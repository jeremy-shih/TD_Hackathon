My name is Candice, and I'll be your conference operator today. I would now like to turn the call over to Sung Lee, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Great. Thank you, Candice, and good afternoon everyone. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the first quarter 2017. The press release and detailed slides are available on the Investor Relations section of the Gilead website. In addition, this year we have combined our annual and corporate social responsibility reports into a single publication titled 2016 Year in Review to share essential information about the company's financial, social, environmental and governance performance. This report can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.","The speakers on today's call will be John Milligan, President and Chief Executive Officer; Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jim Meyers, Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations. Also in the room with us for the Q&A session are Norbert Bischofberger, Executive Vice President of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, and Kevin Young, Chief Operating Officer.","Before we begin formal remarks, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements including plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, financial projections, and the use of capital, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the latest SEC disclosure documents and recent press releases. In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.","Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release as well as on the Gilead website.","I will now turn the call over to Robin.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thank you, Sung, and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased to provide you with an update on our first quarter. I'll review our financial results. Jim will elaborate on our commercial performance, and then John will make a few comments. There were a number of positive trends from our non-HCV business in the first quarter that Jim will describe in a few minutes.","Overall, earnings per share and the total revenues were down year-over-year, due primarily to dynamics in the HCV marketplace that we described during our last earnings call. Total revenues for the first quarter were $6.5 billion with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.23. This compares to revenues of $7.8 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.03 for the same period last year.","Product sales for the first quarter were $6.4 billion, down 17% year-over-year and down 12% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was due to lower HCV sales, partially offset by increased sales in HIV and other therapeutic areas. Sequentially, the decline was due to lower HCV sales and sub-wholesaler inventory decreases in the U.S. associated with our non-HCV franchises, reflective of the seasonal inventory pattern from the fourth quarter to the first quarter.","Turning to the U.S., product sales for the first quarter were $4.5 billion, up 2% year-over-year and down 10% sequentially. Jim will provide more color for the U.S. as well as the other regions. Turning to Europe, product sales for the first quarter were $1.3 billion, down 23% year-over-year and down 11% sequentially, primarily due to competitive dynamics in HCV and unfavorable currency movements.","Now turning to expenses, non-GAAP research and development expenses were $889 million for the first quarter, up 16% compared to the same period last year, due primarily to the purchase of a $125 million U.S. FDA priority review voucher in March. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $807 million for the first quarter compared to $638 million in the same period last year. These expenses increased primarily due to a higher net branded prescription drug fee for the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016, which included a $191 million favorable adjustment as referenced on slide 11.","Without this one-time adjustment, non-GAAP SG&A expenses for the quarter would have been slightly lower compared to the first quarter of 2016. We continue to focus our efforts on operating in a highly efficient manner by proactively managing expenses and investing in areas of strategic importance to retain our industry-leading operating margins, significant cash flows and healthy balance sheets.","During the quarter, we generated cash flows from operations of $2.9 billion and ended the quarter with $34 billion in cash and investments. As part of our plan to return capital to our shareholders, in the first quarter we paid cash dividends of $687 million and repurchased 7.9 million shares of stock for $565 million. The timing and amount of share repurchases was aligned to our stock compensation awards, which are largely granted in the first quarter. As noted in our last earnings call, we are prioritizing the use of capital for investing in the long-term growth of our business including partnerships and acquisitions.","The year is progressing consistent with our expectations. As such, we are reiterating our full-year 2017 guidance provided to you on February 7 and summarized on slide 7 in the earnings results presentation available on our corporate website.","I will now turn the call over to Jim to provide more details on our commercial results for the quarter.","James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Well thank you, Robin, and good afternoon everyone. I'm pleased to provide an update on our commercial performance for the first quarter, and I'll start with a few comments on HCV. Starting with the U.S., approximately 700,000 people have initiated HCV therapy since the launch of Sovaldi in December 2013, with 90% receiving a sofosbuvir-based regimen. Total U.S. revenue from Gilead's HCV therapies for the quarter was $1.7 billion, down 18% year-over-year and 17% sequentially. The decrease in sequential revenue was driven by the declining sales of Epclusa, resulting in lower inventory, as well as some loss of market share as a result of increased competition.","For the remainder of 2017, while increased competition will have some level of impact on patient share and pricing, we expect that the continued decline in HCV patient starts will be the primary driver of the year-over-year decrease in revenue. This decline in starts is driven by the evolving profile of patients that are in care. 62% of patients initiating therapy in the first quarter had fibrosis scores of F0 to F2. That's the highest we've seen for this metric, and indicative of the fact that patients are coming into care with earlier-stage disease, a trend that is illustrated on slide 26.","Over the last six months, we've introduced two new direct-to-consumer campaigns. The first launched in late 2016 with the goal of increasing screening among baby boomers. We were pleased to see that this campaign, along with the efforts of organizations like the CDC, had an immediate effect, with a 24% increase in HCV antibody testing among undiagnosed baby boomers over the first two months of implementation.","The second campaign launched in March, and is directed towards diagnosed patients with a goal of encouraging them to seek treatment with Harvoni. We hope these campaigns will continue to have an impact, and will help more individuals seek testing, linkage to care and treatment. It's important to remember that while the timeline for a patient to go from entering care to initiating therapy has lengthened and is more variable, there are still nearly 3 million people with HCV infection in the U.S., only half of whom are diagnosed.","Turning to Europe, HCV revenues were down 42% year-over-year and 22% sequentially. Quarterly revenues of $487 million were negatively impacted by lower market share as a result of increased competition. During the quarter, we negotiated new agreements with France and Italy to expand access to HCV patients regardless of fibrosis score. This means that there are now 14 European countries, including four of the five major markets, that allow patient access regardless of disease severity.","In addition, Epclusa has now been launched in all five of the major markets in Europe, and will be an important treatment option as some countries have a high percentage of genotype 2 and 3 patients. These patients and their health care providers have been waiting for an effective therapy that does not require co-administration of ribavirin, or extended treatment durations.","In Japan, HCV product sales for the first quarter were $205 million, down 81% year-over-year and down 35% sequentially, due to a decrease in patient starts and increased competition. In the Japanese market, nearly 130,000 patients have been treated with a sofosbuvir-based regimen since the launch of Sovaldi in May 2015. Because there remain many untreated patients, we continued to implement our direct-to-consumer education campaign to broaden the awareness of HCV in Japan.","Worldwide, 1.4 million patients have now initiated HCV therapy with a Gilead regimen in less than four years. With SOF\/VEL\/VOX, our investigational pan-genotypic single-tablet regimen for salvage therapy under regulatory review, we expect to complete our portfolio of HCV therapies later this year.","Now turning to HIV, we are pleased with the rapid adoption and acceptance of our TAF-based regimens by patients and physicians in the U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., HIV and HBV revenues were $2.3 billion in the first quarter, up 20% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. As Robin stated earlier, the quarter-on-quarter decline is consistent with the typical seasonality that we see in sub-wholesaler inventory. Importantly, first quarter revenue from our TAF portfolio exceeded $1 billion for the first time, which translates to a quarter-on-quarter growth of 47%. The launch of our TAF portfolio continued to drive the year-on-year growth of the Gilead HIV franchise.","Genvoya represents nothing less than the most successful launch in U.S. HIV history as measured by cumulative total prescriptions over the first five quarters following launch. By the end of 2016, Genvoya remained the most prescribed regimen for treatment-na\u00efve patients, counting for nearly one in three patients. More broadly, our TAF-based regimens now represent 42% of total Gilead HIV prescription volume just 17 months after the launch of Genvoya, and less than a year after the launches of Odefsey and Descovy.","Truvada for PrEP also continues to be an important growth driver for Gilead. We've seen a significant uptick in PrEP usage in 2017 with an estimated 125,000 patients using Truvada as we exited the quarter. This is encouraging given the important role that PrEP plays in preventing HIV transmission.","Turning to Europe, HIV and HBV revenues were $697 million in the first quarter, down 3% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. Year-over-year volume growth driven by TAF portfolio launches was offset primarily by FX. Notably, the TAF portfolio revenue grew by 24% quarter-on-quarter. I'm pleased to report that Genvoya launched in France and Italy during the quarter. Genvoya is now available in 23 European countries, including all major markets.","In France, the second largest HIV market in the world, Genvoya is off to a particularly strong start. And in early launch markets like Germany, TAF-based regimens already account for up to 60% of Gilead's total HIV prescription volume. This demonstrates the rapid acceptance of TAF by national health systems and the importance of an optimized safety profile for people living longer with HIV.","The TAF portfolio has achieved preferred status and treatment guidelines in four of the five major EU markets, as well as the EACS guidelines, with preferred status anticipated in France in the third quarter of this year.","Shifting away from HIV and HCV, our U.S. cardiovascular team continues to deliver impressive results. Letairis remains the market leader in PAH with a na\u00efve patient share greater than the top two ERA competitors combined, while Ranexa is ranked in the top five cardiovascular branded products in terms of revenue for each of the past two years.","In closing, we were pleased with our first quarter results. For the remainder of the year we will continue to ensure that as many people as possible can benefit from Gilead products around the world.","I would now like to turn the call over to John.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thank you, Jim. As you've heard, product revenues for the first quarter of 2017 were down 12% from the fourth quarter of 2016. While any decrease in revenue is disappointing of course, this decline is a result of the natural challenge of the HCV cure market, where in each country there was a rapid increase in the number of patients who were treated and cured, followed by a decline in the number of patients seeking care and being able to access HCV treatment. The ongoing reduction in patient starts continues to be the major factor impacting our revenues, however 2017 is progressing as we expected and communicated to you on our last earnings call.","On a positive note, we continue to see strong uptake of our TAF-based regimens in HIV, pointing to the valuable role these therapies play in the long-term treatment of patients with this disease. Genvoya is now our number one selling HIV product, surpassing both Truvada and Atripla since the last quarter of 2016.","During the first quarter, I had an opportunity to attend CROI, the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections. This is a good scientific forum with much progress described across the spectrum of HIV research for prevention, to novel targets and treatment to cure. Gilead's work featured prominently in the conference, including Phase 2 data for bictegravir used in combinations with F\/TAF, long-term data supporting use of Genvoya, and preclinical data describing the potential of our novel capsid inhibitor as a long-acting treatment.","During CROI, there was great enthusiasm for the emerging profile of B-F\/TAF, as this is the first time we are able to present the full 48-week dataset from our Phase 2 study. As many of you know, we initiated Phase 3 studies last year based on our interim look at the 24-week data from the study. These four Phase 3 studies include more than 2,400 patients and enrollment was completed in third quarter of last year. We look forward to sharing data from these studies in the coming months and anticipate that we will begin submitting regulatory filings for approval in the third quarter of this year.","The progress we made in providing new options to patients with HIV is remarkable and I'm proud of Gilead's contributions over our 30-year history. Last month, Gilead research was featured in 85 abstracts at the International Liver Conference, or EASL as it is often called. One of the most exciting stories emerging from the conference involved NASH for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. This is a disease that garnered relatively little attention at medical meetings a few years ago but is increasingly understood as a serious health issue for patients, particularly those presenting with the later stages of fibrosis. These are the patients facing the greatest risks of complications, and those with the most urgent need for new treatment options.","We shared proof of concept data for GS-0976, our inhibitor of Acetyl-CoA carboxylase, or ACC, in an oral late-breaker presentation. ACC catalyzes the rate-limiting step in de novo lipogenesis, which means the formation of new fat. Inhibition of ACC with GS-0976 leads to significant reductions in both liver fat content and stiffness with decreases in markers of liver fibrosis seen after 12 weeks of treatment. We have now progressed GS-0976 to a larger Phase II study.","In addition to 0976, another compound in development is our ASK-1 inhibitor selonsertib. We described for your previously the exciting data presented at AASLD last fall, showing that inhibition of ASK-1 with selonsertib led to decreases in fibrosis and secondary markers of NASH in a dose-dependent manner. We now have two Phase III trials underway evaluating selonsertib in NASH patients with bridging fibrosis and cirrhosis.","Also in NASH, GS-9674, a gut-restricted FXR agonist, has progressed into Phase II studies, having shown biological activity through up regulation of FGF19 in a Phase I study. Complete resolution of NASH may require the inhibition of more than one pathway, and animal studies indicate that combinations of selonsertib, GS-0976 or GS-9674 may be more effective than the individual components alone.","We have initiated a Phase II study in 20 patients evaluating the combination of selonsertib and GS-9674 and will initiate additional combination studies this year. If these combinations prove safe and efficacious, we will move one or more into extended Phase II evaluation next year.","In HCV, we had six presentations at EASL further characterizing the efficacy and safety of SOF\/VEL\/VOX, our pangenotypic single-tablet regimen in more than 1,000 DAA-na\u00efve and DAA-experienced patients across all HCV genotypes. Most notable was data showing no impact of resistance-associated substitutions on the high efficacy of SOF\/VEL\/VOX for 12 weeks in DAA-experienced patients. As Jim mentioned, this regime is currently under regulatory review with a U.S. FDA PDUFA date of August 8.","Also on HCV, data from two Phase II studies of Harvoni demonstrated HCV cure rates of 99% in children age six to 11 and 100% in adults co-infected with HCV and HBV. The pediatric data have recently been included in our U.S. label.","And finally, we presented 96-week results from two ongoing Phase III studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of daily Vemlidy in e-antigen positive and negative patients in 24-week data in patients switching from Viread to Vemlidy. The results reinforce Vemlidy as an important treatment option for patients living with chronic hepatitis B infection.","In the area of inflammation, Phase II studies of filgotnib, a JAK1-selective inhibitor are underway and enrolling in rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. With this once-daily dosing in our approximately 1,700 patient-years of experience, we and our partner Galapagos have now started, or announced the intention to start six additional Phase II studies across a range of different inflammatory diseases where JAK1 activity is implicated.","Before we wrap up our prepared remarks, I want to mention another recent and important event at Gilead, at which Gilead's work was highlighted, and that's the Neglected Tropical Diseases Summit that took place last month in Geneva. At this meeting, which brought together industry, the World Health Organization, public health and government officials, and many NGOs working to deliver medicines to the developing world, we reaffirmed our commitment to the London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases. This declaration, signed five years ago, outlines the WHO's ongoing efforts to control, eliminate or eradicate 10 key neglected tropical diseases.","In Gilead's case and related to this declaration, we have partnered with WHO for many years to provide AmBisome for use in several developing countries as a treatment for visceral leishmaniasis, a deadly parasitic infection. This is a very important application for AmBisome, which is better known for its use in cases of systemic fungal infections. We are pleased that the use of AmBisome, along with other mitigation strategies, has resulted in a marked decrease in the number of visceral leishmaniasis cases in India, Nepal and Bangladesh.","In addition to visceral leishmaniasis, we have research ongoing to address other neglected or emerging tropical diseases that pose significant public health threats in resource-limited parts of the world. For example, our work on GS-5734 for the treatment of Ebola and potentially other deadly viruses such as those that cause SARS and MERS.","In 30 years, we've learned that the value of partnerships in developing innovative new therapies, and have demonstrated a willingness to make bold moves. That hasn't changed, and we are committed to building on our success in HIV and HCV by leveraging our own scientific expertise as well as the knowledge of others through collaborations and partnerships to work toward the next generation of life-saving therapies.","I would like to conclude by thanking you for your interest in Gilead and thanking our nearly 9,000 employees for the hard work that is well represented in our results his quarter.","So let's now open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Geoff Porges of Leerink Partners. Your line is now open.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much for taking the question, and appreciate all the color on the dynamics in HCV and HIV. Perhaps we could talk a little bit about the HIV category. And Jim or John, give us a sense of what percentage of your HIV revenue in the U.S. today is Medicaid funded and then what percentage is covered or at least patients are covered by insurance provided by ADAPs. And then lastly, what do you expect to happen to pricing as you get into generic Viread being available both outside the U.S. and then in the U.S. at the end of the year? Should we anticipate Atripla's price coming down to some of their components or staying at the branded price? Sorry, but they're sort of related.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thanks for your one question, Geoff.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hey, Geoff. It's Kevin here. Let me have a go at the first couple of parts, and then Jim can also help out. So I'll just split the business really between the public side and the private side for HIV. We've got about 55% of our business HIV sales go through the public, and about 45% go through the private. It's actually almost a direct reverse of HCV. And of that 55%, 20% or so is ADAP in the U.S. So that's basically the situation that we have.","We're very pleased with the progress with Genvoya. As we said on the last earnings call, we will see the effects of generics in Europe in the second half of this year. That will be a country-by-country event. I think the most direct effect, of course, will be on Viread and Truvada. The most important parts, as far as we're concerned, is to make sure as many of our countries convert from TDF-based regimens to TAF-based regimens. And as you heard from Jim, some of our European markets are doing very, very well on that front. We've got Germany already at a ratio of 60% TAF to TDF. So we're trying to control I think the most important variable, which is good for patients, which is to see them converted to TAF away from TDF in advance of the change in the TDF landscape.","James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yes, and, Kevin, just to add on that, and I agree with everything you said. I think HIV is a bit of a different market over the years. Of all the markets, of all the chronic therapy markets Gilead's ever been in, it's been driven more by increases in patient volume than by changes in price. And there's always some element of both in every therapeutic area that you're in, but disproportionately in HIV. There's always been a healthy steady flow of number of treated patients each year.","As I think you're probably aware, and as Kevin just said, we're already in heavily, deeply-discounted payer segments in the U.S. market. What that means is that's already part of the run rate. So the normal impact of a generic is a big change from where you are. We're already, especially for the older products that are going to be coming off patent, the difference between generic pricing and where those prices are right now is much more incremental than you'd see in most markets, and anyways, that's something that's just very unique with that.","We continue to see obviously a strong support for single-tablet regimens and fixed-dose combinations, and of course, there will be some level of impact whenever there is generic entry, particularly outside of the U.S. But we still very firmly believe that when we want to ultimately have the full launch of our entire TAF portfolio, particularly BIC\/TAF, B-F\/TAF, that this remains very much a sustainable franchise going forward.","Again, I would say we hear sometimes how sustainable is price levels in HIV. That really hasn't been the story of HIV. It's really, I mean particularly in the U.S. market, because of the deeply-discounted segments and the CPI-U penalties you have over time, this has been a market that has overwhelmingly been driven by patient volume. So we're not as reliant on that. We have not been historically as reliant on, if you look at list pricing for sure, it's there. But net pricing has deteriorated over time, and that's already in the run rate. But I'll stop there, and we feel very confident in this being a sustainable franchise.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Geoff, just two last points, Geoff. We obviously thought about these events as part of our guidance. They're included in our guidance, and the other point I'd like to make is I think for the first time, we've really seen a downturn in the number of Atripla patients. Atripla stayed very strong for 10 years since its launch, but with Genvoya now and the TAF-based regimens, we've really seen that turn, and I think that's good for patients and obviously it's very encouraging for Gilead.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Thanks very much. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Afternoon, guys. Thanks for the question. Jim, on HIV, PrEP has been a big volume driver. What's the typical duration of use? And how would you size the opportunity? And then, John, you mentioned revenue trends in the quarter. I'm just curious if there's a metric, be it cash flow or margin that maybe that best informs your biz-dev or deal strategy. Thank you.","James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Sure. So starting with PrEP, what we're seeing very encouragingly, and I think consistent with CDC guidance and data, is that we're starting to see persistency that is very similar to patients taking antiretroviral therapy for treatment, and that's what you want. Frankly, three, four years ago, PrEP prescribing was very episodic, and we're not seeing that now. So that's not just a good thing for Gilead, I think that's a good thing for patients. That's what the data would say is the way that PrEP should be prescribed.","So we're not seeing very much shade of light between those two, and because of that, we do see this as a significant continued driver of growth. I think as we said in the last earnings call, 90% of PrEP prescribing was coming out of five cities coming into this year, and they weren't the cities where a lot of the epidemic is really starting to unfortunately increase, areas like New Orleans, DC, Newark, Oakland, the Bronx. And part of our efforts, both with the field-based team that we deployed of prevention specialists, and also with some of our education that we're doing is geared towards those markets, because honestly I think that's where the needle can be moved the most.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","So, Geoff, I would give you a shorter answer to your question. But you asked about metrics. Certainly as we think about opportunities, we do look for things which have potential to have a high operating margin. That's important to us. That of course informs the potential cash flow from the business in the future. We also of course look for things that have a scientific and medical need such that we can build a sustainable business that would have the top line growth that we desire, along with those margins and cash flows. So those things are all informative in terms of how we think about it.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks very much and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about bictegravir specifically. And maybe you could just talk about, how do you view the potential to being able to achieve superiority with bictegravir over dolutegravir? And maybe as part of your answer if you're willing, can you talk about what's the statistical plan and the powering in the head-to-head na\u00efve study? Thanks.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yes hi, Matt. I'm happy to answer that. So the head-to-head studies in na\u00efve patients, remember one of them is comparing bictegravir to dolutegravir. The other one is comparing our single-tablet regimen to Triomune. Both assume that the comparator arm has a 91% success rate, and the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval is 12%. So the delta is 12%. Now what the chances of achieving superiority, there's always a possibility. I don't think I would like to speculate on that. It really depends. This will clearly show that these are both large studies and will clearly show if there is a difference between these two drugs, we should see it.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yes. Matt, the only other thing I would add from a commercial point of view is that the success of Genvoya, the success of Descovy is the platform for BIC\/TAF. So we see it as a family. TAF is doing extraordinarily well. You saw the results of Descovy in the quarter. So that's just the building block upon which that we'll launch BIC-F\/TAF. So the momentum we really have going now will be taken forward with B-F\/TAF. But we see it all as sort of a collective platform.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Matt, I forgot to add something. Of course we will look for superiority. So the primary test will be non-inferiority, and if we meet that, we will of course look for superiority, which is of course a possibility.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Josh Schimmer, Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thanks for taking the question. Let's discuss why TAF is so strong in Germany versus U.S. And then as you think about launching bictegravir into these markets, is that something going to sustain the current trajectory of TAF adoption or do you expect it to accelerate the penetration? And if it's accelerating, what is the patient population that that one will specifically unlock? Thanks very much.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","You said TAF uptake in Germany versus U.S.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yes. Sorry, Josh. You broke up a little bit. So we're going to try to recreate your question as best we can. We'll turn it over to Jim for that","James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yeah, so my apologies that I didn't hear all that. I think I have it now. But I think what we have seen in Germany is consistent with what we've seen in other early launch markets in Europe, which is number one, rapid adoption or rapid acceptance of the TAF profile and treatment guidelines. Again, we have it in four of the five markets right now in addition to EACS. But also a strong desire to appropriately, depending on the label, move patients to the TAF-based regimens. And because Genvoya launched earlier there, that's a good example of what we're seeing in some of our earlier markets. The example we gave was Germany. It was up to 60%. We also have some earlier launch markets in the Nordics and in some of the northern European countries that tend to launch earlier that are there or thereabouts, closer to 60%.","So the encouraging thing for us, too, is that as we mentioned, we just launched Genvoya in France this quarter and in Italy literally at the end of the quarter. So we've got a lot of room to grow there and try to get up to the levels that we've seen in the other countries. But I think it's primarily a function of just it was an earlier launch. People are seeing good results. They realize that this is a patient population that is aging, and the attributes of TAF in a 50 to 60 year old patient are even more important than they are in a 40 year-old patient, and I think we're seeing that reflected.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yes, Josh. It's Kevin. I was just out in Australia about ten days ago. They've already got a 40% conversion to TAF, so it's happening around the world where we have launched in most markets, a lot of markets just over a year. I would also say that, with HIV, as Jim referred to earlier, this is not a contracting type of market. This is once you have reimbursement, then generally physicians have the freedom to operate and will follow guidelines and put patients on advances in therapy, and clearly, clearly, clearly, clearly TAF is an advancement on TDF.","James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","I think the one final thing I'd say is that in some quarters there's some worry that as you get into some of the generic options, that choice will be taken out of physicians' hands, so you do see a lot of physicians wanting to switch to TAF while they have the ability to do that. And that makes a lot of sense.","Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. And bictegravir insights?","Operator","Thank you.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","I'm sorry, Josh. We couldn't hear that.","Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co.","So I said the impact of the bictegravir on the adoption curve accelerator just remaining.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Do you think bictegravir's going to accelerate the adoption curve of TAF?","James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","I do, yes. I mean, I've said it, and Norbert's probably \u2013 we've all said it in this room. I truly believe that it is the first single-tablet regimen we've had without tradeoffs. And I believe that most of our physicians see it that way too. And I'm looking at my clinical colleagues in the room here, and that's what we hear from our advisors.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yes.","Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Alethia Young of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I'll continue the trend of no hep C questions, but thinking about NASH, in one of your slides you said less than 1% of patients were diagnosed. So I'm just curious kind of what you're doing alongside your Phase II, Phase III work to kind of drive diagnosis? Like particular biomarker work or anything to that respect. Thanks.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yes, so Alethia. I want to answer first then Kevin will, if you have any comments. So we are including in our Phase 3 studies, of course, the primary endpoint as you know is histology. We think that's a potential hurdle to diagnose patients and get patients into care. So we're looking at the use of FibroScan with all patients in that study, and hopefully we can then show the correlation between FibroScan and histology, that that may be a way to include those data and the need. Again, we have not discussed this with regulatory authorities. It's too early for that. We just have to see what the data looks like.","But clearly, one thing from a clinical point of view is to get away from doing biopsy. And we're also looking at the usual markers of fibrosis. We presented at EASL, the ELF data, and others like CK-18. So these are all serum markers that have to do with fibrosis and we showed a fairly good correlation between these serum markers and MREs, so and medical resonance elastography. And if we can do the same thing showing the correlation with histology, then hopefully this will become the accepted diagnostic avenue.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yes, Alethia, not much to add. Yes, we've got to find non-invasive measures. But I would emphasize that we like the focus of going into the F3 and F4 patients. I mean, they're very defined. Somebody's got cirrhosis, it's a very defined patient population and I think with perhaps different from perhaps some other companies in the area, we like that focus and that's where we want to begin our entry into NASH and then build upon that.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Alethia, I want to add, we had another presentation at EASL about, you know the study of simtuzumab in bridging fibrosis and cirrhosis, that overall field. So it didn't show any efficacy, but it taught us a lot about disease progression endpoints, and it is clear that fibrosis is the only predictive biomarker, the only predictive diagnostic that predicts clinical outcomes. And we also got a good sense for what we can experience over a year or two years in terms of clinical events. And based on this data, we are comfortable that with two-year follow-up, we should have enough clinical events, hepatic decompensation ascites, et cetera, that would get us potentially full approval rather than accelerated approval based on histology.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Cory Kasimov of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about business development and curious how much of a barrier all the uncertainty in Washington right now regarding tax reform is when it comes to pulling the trigger on potential BD opportunities? And then, following some of the recent hires you've made over the last six or so months, do you think you have the bandwidth now to more fully explore the myriad of assets in companies that are out there? Thanks.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yeah, thanks for the question, Cory. So first of all, with regard to Washington, I think that uncertainty in Washington seems to be the norm in my 27 years here. So I think we've kind of learned to filter that out and focus on the things that are right for the company. There may be tax reform. There may be repatriation, but you can't count on it and you can't wait for it either.","So we've focused our efforts \u2013 I'll turn to what you asked last, which is we really focused our efforts on broadening our team, adding some depth both scientifically and with business development experience so that we in fact have much, much greater capacity to assess things and are in fact fully engaged with our teams assessing a number of different opportunities, which we think could play out over the coming year as we start to make progress in getting partnerships and potential acquisitions together. So we're going to just focus on what's right for Gilead, try to ignore the noise globally on terms of tax reform, and do the best thing for the company and for the shareholders in the long term. And we really have a great team right now.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mohit Bansal of Citi. Your line is now open.","Mohit Bansal - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So one question on NASH. If you could help us understand the futility analysis you have baked in in your ASK-1 program, and also like what is your strategy for data release there? And when do you think we could see those data? Thank you.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yes, there seems to be this rumor in the public that we have a futility analysis. We do not have an interim analysis planned in our Phase III studies. This will be 48-week endpoint with histology. There will be the usual DS&B meetings that mostly look at safety. But there is not a futility or an interim analysis planned. So we are going to carry this study out to 48 weeks, last patient 48 weeks biopsy. That will constitute the NDA filing.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","But the study will continue blinded after that.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","The study will continue blinded because we believe that the histology will get us accelerated approval, and in order to get full approval, you need to reach clinical endpoints. And we think they should be reached as I explained just before in the two-year timeframe or so.","Mohit Bansal - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. Thanks for clarification. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ying Huang of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have a couple of quick ones related to HCV. First one is you had 44,000 patients starting in U.S. So if you flatline, that trend is actually to the high end of the reg you provided at the beginning of the year of 150,000 to 175,000 patients starting this year. And if you look at your HCV sales, again if you flatline just times 4, it's actually above your range. So I was wondering what do you see in the rest of the year, the next three quarters, what could cause that patient start and also the sales to trend down from 1Q level?","And then another related question comes from the comments of Merck and AbbVie on HCV. I think they had a little bit different opinion. Merck was saying that they continue to see patient trending down, patient start, but then, so AbbVie was saying that, but they have different opinion on where the long-term trend is going. So I was wondering if you can provide any color on that. Thank you.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hey, Ying. It's Kevin. Let me try and take a stab at that. I mean, let me say right from the start, HCV continues to be a large opportunity, albeit that it's declining, and that decline is happening in every market that we look around the world. In terms of looking at revenues and our performance, we took a very realistic view when we set about our guidance three months ago, and really nothing has changed. We still think the number of 150,000 to 175,000 patient starts in the U.S. is still a very solid number.","Yes, you are correct that it was 44,000 treated, but please bear in mind that when you look at revenues, it's a composite that's made up of starts. It's made up of share. It's made up of payer mix, and it's made up of product mix. So there's a number of components that goes into this. It's early in the year. It's just three months. Starts can vary from quarter to quarter, but we don't see anything right now that would change from where we set our guidance back in February.","Yes, and so I think from what I can see, and it's not for me to comment on other companies in the area, I think pretty much everybody is now seeing this market in a similar fashion. It's large, and it'll go on for a long time. I don't think anybody really knows when there will be a turning point. We'll probably only know that turning point when we're nine to 12 months after that turning point. But clearly, with 1.5 million people diagnosed in the U.S., 3 million infected but 1.5 million diagnosed, that's still a lot of patients to cure. And I think ourselves and probably the general noise in the market will encourage people to step forward and be treated, and as Jim described earlier, our DTC campaigns are really focused on that.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, Kevin.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from Phil Nadeau with Cowen. Your line is now open.","Phil Nadeau, Ph.D. - Cowen and Company","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. One for John, kind of a broad big picture question. John, last year there was some talk of Gilead providing a strategic overview early in 2017 and discussing your strategic imperatives in a bit more detail. It seems like that has obviously not happened, but I'm curious, is that still something that we can expect? Is there going to be a time when you will more definitively define your strategy? Or is it just going to be piecemeal, we'll kind of see things develop as they do?","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Well, first of all, Phil, I don't recall ever saying that we were going to have a specific unveiling of a strategy, and strategies for companies are an ongoing process, not an event. And so what you have seen in our different areas, I mean, really think about our strategies over the last few years. We wanted to stabilize and then grow HCV products by the introduction of TAF and additional STRs. We wanted to round out our HCV portfolio with SOF\/VEL\/VOX so we'd have an answer for every patient within our portfolio. We did that very successfully last year, and then we brought Vemlidy to market to help stabilize the HBV market and provide a really good foundation for the company.","We're making forays into NASH, as we've described, more compounds that we've acquired, and are building upon. We may do more there. We're building really nicely in filgotinib. I think we have a really great opportunity with filgotinib to accelerate the clinical development timelines, now that baricitinib seems to have a setback, which could provide greater upside for us as well if that is significantly delayed. So those are two different areas where we're continuing to invest, and you'll see with filgotinib, we're going to embark upon other studies. For example, we have a Syk inhibitor that could be also useful in RA, and that maybe combinable with filgotinib.","With regard to future legs of stool, I think it's pretty clear we're looking for another avenue to increase our opportunity for revenue, and also for helping patients with the considerable heft that we have, and it's clear we've been focusing on oncology, where the question is there in the area, where we can use our resources to accelerate products to market and build a meaningful franchise in oncology. And that was the hiring of Alessandro Riva; that was the foray we made with our business development people to broaden and then to look at other things that can build this.","And so I feel very good that we've got a number of different ways to accelerate growth for the company into the future so that a decade from now we're a very different company, having reinvented ourselves beyond antivirals into a really multi-therapeutic area company. And I feel very good about where we are and we'll continue to try to enhance that as well. So that's our strategy.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Umer Raffat of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. Thank you so much for taking my question. I just wanted to zoom in a little bit on the TAF patent estate. And some of your prior commentary seems to imply that you're guiding to a 2025 patent expiry for TAF-based regimens. And we're seeing some patents listed all the way out to 2032, and just wanted to understand, A, how you think about those patents and B, in your base case do you consider using those patents in any possible patent litigation that comes up down the road? Thank you.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Well, first of all, I'm not going to comment on future patent litigation and what we won't or won't do. I don't have my attorney with me, so I'd be loath to say anything. With regard to TAF itself, the TAF patent is out through 2025. What you're seeing in additional patents is, of course, as we have bictegravir and other products that we're developing, those will have longer product patents of course. And so those products and combination products may go out to a much longer date than that. And as we continue to invent other molecules for HIV, we're not done. We're still looking at, for example, drugs for salvage. Those will have additionally long patent lives, as well. So it will be somewhat of a laddered portfolio of patent expirations going out well into 2030.","Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","2033 for bictegravir.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thank you, 2033. Sung has corrected me for bictegravir.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Katherine Breedis of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Katherine Breedis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you very much for taking my question. As a follow up to the early exciting data for your NASH portfolio that were featured at EASL, I was wondering if you could provide some thoughts about what you think the timeline for potential patient recruitment might be, particularly for selonsertib in Phase III, which again looks very compelling, but we've seen from other recent competitors some enrollment delays. Thank you.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yeah, Katherine, honestly, it's a little bit too early to talk about where we are in patient recruitment, because I always want to get a quarter or one-third into the recruitment phase to be able to make intelligent projections. But clearly what I can tell you is the STELLAR 4 study, which is the one in cirrhotic patients, is enrolling very, very fast and there are two obvious reasons. No competition, number one and unmet need with a population that is very ready to enroll in a study that has the potential to help them and to make their fibrosis better. So the answer was a little bit qualitative. Again, to quantitatively answer it, it's too early. But it is also clear that we might have STELLAR 4 enrolled much sooner than STELLAR 3, in which case we would file with STELLAR 4 only. Of course, this has to be discussed with regulatory.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yes. I'd say we have the potential to file it early depending on the data and the safety and risk benefit.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Sure. I think it's also important to say that we know many of these sites very, very well from our HCV programs","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","These are the same, almost, many times the same investigators, yes","Katherine Breedis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Just a couple more on hep C. I was wondering if you have data yet on the number of new diagnoses in the U.S. in 2016. I know you've provided that in the past for 2015. And then, can you tell us the contribution from the VA this quarter? And then ex-U.S. market share looks like has been declining on a dollar basis since early 2016. Anything you guys can do to stabilize that? Thank you.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hey, Terence, it's Kevin. No. It's just too early. We haven't got the 2016 data yet. So, sorry. It's not that we're holding this back at all. It's just not available. We're hoping maybe going into the second quarter or middle of the year that we'd have that data, but no. We don't have 2016. I'll let Jim take the VA.","James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Sure. So, yeah, the VA as you know in the past has been at times one in four patient starts for us in any given quarter. The VA is experiencing the same dynamics outside the VA where we are seeing a steady gradual decline in the number of treated patients, due largely to the changing profile of the patient under care. We're seeing it actually in a little bit more of an accelerated manner in the VA, simply because they were so efficient and so effective in getting their folks into care and getting them treated. So they actually have been able to treat about 50% of their population. So we would anticipate that the VA would continue to represent a smaller and smaller percentage of our overall treated patient population.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","It's important to say, Jim, that we don't see or we don't hear of any budget restrictions from a VA point of view.","James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yes. It isn't and -","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","The market share year on year.","James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yes. I'm sorry the question was \u2013 so if you think about market share across Europe, you know we had about the same number of patients this quarter as we did last quarter, but what you are seeing, you are correct on a dollar basis it goes down, and that's somewhat a shift from the patients in the north to the patients in the south, which is sort of a natural again evolution because there are more patients in southern Europe where the prices are lower than they are in northern Europe where we have had a good run at curing a high percentage of the patients already. So I think that trend will likely continue.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yeah and, Terence, as Jim pointed out, we do have the opening of access now in France and Italy. So we're going to be obviously trying to use that opportunity to treat more patients. So that's a very positive situation that we've got right now.","James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Particularly in France, yes","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Particularly in France, yes.","Operator","Thank you.

My name is Ann, and I'll be your conference operator today. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Patrick O'Brien","Thank you, Ann. Good afternoon, everyone. We issued a press release this afternoon providing earnings results for the third quarter, which are available on our website. You can also find a detailed earnings slide deck that will support some of the topics we will cover on today's call.","For our prepared remarks and Q&A, I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, John Martin; our President and Chief Operating Officer, John Milligan; our Executive Vice President of Research and Development, Norbert Bischofberger; our Executive Vice President of Commercial Operations, Kevin Young; and our Chief Financial Officer, Robin Washington.","Before we begin with our formal remarks, we want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements including plans and expectations with respect to our product candidates and financial projections, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in our latest SEC disclosure documents and recent press releases.","In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement made during this call. We will also be using non-GAAP financial measures to help you understand our underlying business performance. The GAAP reconciliations are provided in a press release, as well as our website.","I will now turn the call over to Robin Washington.","Robin L. Washington","Thank you, Patrick, and thank you, all, for joining us this afternoon. Gilead continues to deliver solid year-to-date and third quarter financial results. Product sales for the third quarter were $2.36 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year. The U.S. contributed $1.4 billion to product sales, up 20% year-over-year, driven by strong retail demand and the expansion of our HIV franchise. Europe contributed $781 million to product sales, up 5% year-over-year and flat sequentially due to purchasing patterns related to the summer holiday.","From an expense standpoint, non-GAAP R&D expenses increased to $384 million, up 42% year-over-year, primarily due to the continued advancement of our product pipeline and in particular, the progression and expansion of our Phase III studies in both liver disease and oncology.","Additionally, non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased to $287 million, up 8% year-over-year due to the ongoing growth of our business and an increase in the U.S. pharmaceutical excise tax, partially offset by lower bad debt expense.","Sequentially, SG&A expenses decreased 4% due to lower spending as a result of the European summer holidays, partially offset by investments in the launch of Stribild.","Operating cash flows were $745 million. Recall the last quarter's operating cash flows of $1.29 billion included the receipt of approximately $460 million from collection of accounts receivable in Spain.","Turning to financial guidance. Given the strong year-to-date commercial performance, we are increasing product sales guidance for full year 2012 to $9.1 billion to $9.2 billion, which represents a $200 million increase from the top end of our previous guidance range.","The full year 2012 diluted EPS impact of acquisition-related restructuring and stock-based compensation expenses is now expected to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.65 per share, primarily due to changes in anticipated payment associated with the successful progression of our oncology and non-HCV liver pipeline. All other aspects of our non-GAAP guidance for 2012 remain unchanged.","In closing, we are pleased with our financial performance during the quarter and are looking forward to closing out a strong fiscal year 2012. I'll now turn the call over to Kevin Young.","Kevin B. Young","Thank you, Robin. I have been very pleased over the course of 2012 with the execution of the commercial organization. The third quarter was the strongest in Gilead's history, with solid performances across all therapeutic areas.","The anti-viral franchise grew by 13% year-over-year and delivered over $2 billion in product sales, while cardiovascular products delivered quarterly sales of over $200 million for the first time. HIV sales in the U.S. were particularly robust and grew by 19% year-over-year.","As we anticipated, following record non-retail purchases in quarter 1 and quarter 2 of 2012, quarter 3 non-retail sales were down sequentially. At this point, mid-way through the federal fiscal year, it would seem that budgets will allow for continued healthy ordering, assuming little or no rollover is allowed beyond March 2013. The latest update from [indiscernible] shows a total wait list of approximately 100 individuals across all states, down from a high of nearly 9,300 in September 2011.","We were very pleased to be in a position to launch Stribild immediately after receiving U.S. FDA approval on August 27. Upon its launch, Stribild became our first priority detail.","Uptick in the product in the first few weeks of launch have been extremely encouraging. Prescriptions are almost 2x that of Complera at a similar point in launch. New to brand patient starts on Stribild have surpassed Reyataz and are already approaching the level of Atripla and PREZISTA. Access to Stribild far exceeds that of where Complera was 2 months after launch. Most managed care organizations now list Stribild without restrictions. 47 state Medicaid plans and 37 AIDS drug assistance programs now have Stribild on formulary. Importantly, 4 of the big 5 ADAPs have full access to Stribild.","We also continue to be pleased with the U.S. uptick of Complera, which sold $82 million in the third quarter. Complera is the second most prescribed HIV regimen in naive patients and the fifth most prescribed HIV regimen in all patients.","Turning briefly to Europe. Even though the third quarter is traditionally affected every year by summer holidays, especially in Southern Europe, we posted a very solid set of results. Eviplera is now in the market in 14 countries across Europe, with France and Belgium being the latest to launch. We anticipate availability in the 2 major HIV markets of Spain and Italy in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013, respectively.","For the first time, total naive share of Gilead products in the big 5 European markets exceeded 80% during quarter 3. Total utilization of single tablet regimens for naive patients was boosted by Eviplera to a new high of nearly 30%. Eviplera is now the #2 regimen in HIV naive patients in the U.K. and Germany.","To conclude, Gilead delivered another good quarter. As we enter the final months of 2012 and plan for 2013, we can have confidence in an array of growth drivers across our products and across our geographies.","I'll now turn the call over to John Martin.","John C. Martin","Thank you, Kevin. During the third quarter, significant progress was made in our development programs. As Kevin mentioned, Stribild is the first integrase inhibitor containing single tablet regimen to receive U.S. FDA approval. FDA has accepted the MBAs for 2 of the components, cobicistat and elvitegravir, and confirmed PDUFA dates of 28th and 27th of April, 2013, respectively.","For Complera, results from an 841-patient head-to-head study versus Atripla will be presented at the Eleventh International Congress on Drug Therapy in HIV Infection meeting in Glasgow next month. This is the first head-to-head study of Complera versus Atripla, as the previous Phase III studies supporting approval of Complera compared rilpivirine plus Truvada, to efavirenz plus Truvada.","Also at the Glasgow meeting, 48-week data will be reported from a 482-patient study in which patients on a stable ritonavir boosted PI regimen were randomized to either switch to Complera or stay on the boosted PI regimen.","Both these large studies were initiated with the intent to be included in the Complera label. The latter is particularly important because 40% of U.S. patients currently initiating Complera have switched from a PI containing regimen.","GS-7340, a novel pro-drug of tenofovir, dosed at 1\/10 the dose of Viread, was co-formulated with emtricitabine, cobicistat and elvitegravir into a single pill. This 7340 containing single tablet regimen is being directly compared to Stribild in a Phase II study. 24-week data from this study will become available in November. If the results are positive, we anticipate moving this 7340 containing single tablet regimen into Phase III in the first half of 2013.","In HCV, there will be a number of presentations at the AASLD meeting in Boston next month, highlighting the safety, efficacy and resistance profile of GS-7977 in a variety of combinations in HCV infected individuals.","Noteworthy, 7977 will be the subject of 2 oral late breaker presentations. One presentation will also show safety and efficacy data from a collaborative study with BMS of 7977 and daclatasvir with and without ribavirin for 12 weeks in genotype 1 infected patients.","The second presentation is on a collaborative study with NIH and will show data on the safety and efficacy of 7977 with once daily versus twice daily ribavirin for 24 weeks in genotype 1 HCV infected individuals.","In addition, an oral presentation will provide an update on the ELECTRON study and include results of the 7977 plus 5885, plus ribavirin 12-week arm in genotype 1 treatment-naive patients.","Both the late breaker and the oral presentations will include data at the time of the AASLD conference. All four 7977 Phase III studies are fully enrolled. The results of the first study, POSITRON, which evaluates 12 weeks of 7977 plus ribavirin in genotype 2, 3 interferon ineligible\/intolerant patients should be available in early December, with results of the other studies to follow in this first quarter of next year. This will enable regulatory filings for 7977 in the second quarter of 2013.","A single tablet regimen of 7977 and 5885 for genotype 1 infected patients has advanced to Phase III with the first patient dosed last week. This is a 4-arm study evaluating the FTC in 800 patients with or without ribavirin for 12 and 24 weeks. Initially, 200 of the 800 patients will be enrolled. Following an interim analysis of the SVR4 results of the 12-week arms, the remaining 600 patients will be enrolled.","In oncology, a Phase II study evaluating GS-1101 in double refractory iNHL patients closed for screening on October 10, with 120 patients enrolled. Depending on results and FDA concurrence, this iNHL study could form the basis for accelerated approval. More likely, however, approval will be based on data from ongoing Phase III studies.","Five Phase III studies of GS-1101 in CLL and iNHL are progressing. Two studies, which are currently enrolling patients evaluating 1101 with rituximab, or with rituximab and bendamustine and CLL. A third study evaluating 1101 with ofatumumab and CLL and two Phase III studies evaluating 1101 in combination with rituximab and with rituximab and bendamustine and iNHL will initiate later this year.","In summary, the last few months of the year promise to be as busy and productive as the first 3 quarters have been. We are poised to continue making terrific progress for Gilead, for employees and importantly for the patients we serve.","We would now like to turn the call over to Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just got a couple for Kevin and then one for Norbert. For Kevin, I know it's early on Stribild, but are you guys seeing uptick at the expense of PIs? And how much of a driver do you think the switching studies will be with respect to share? And then for Norbert, you guys have talked about the 7977-5885 combo study in the last call and I wanted just to know if anything has changed and how you're thinking about the second pivotal study? What types of patients, what types of design do you think you will employ? Things like that.","Kevin B. Young","Geoff, this is Kevin. Thanks for the question. We are pleased with the progress so far on Stribild. It is early days, almost 2 months of launch. The sales you saw in Q3 were very much the inventory fill for the wholesale as that's very similar amount to the amount we put out a year ago when we launched Complera. I think we're particularly pleased with the access that we've got. It's very much quicker than we have for Complera, the ADAP programs particularly have taken up Stribild and we're almost -- we almost have 5 of 5. We're just waiting for a signature to have the fifth of the big 5 ADAP programs have coverage of Stribild. Twice as many prescriptions for Stribild as Complera, so it's running ahead of Complera, it's running ahead of the uptick of PREZISTA. It's more looking like kind of an uptick of ISENTRESS. So I think overall, we would consider, I think, the launch of Stribild more Atripla-like and less Complera-like. Obviously, you don't have the bolus of conversions that Atripla had, but our sense is there's probably a little bit more being used in the naive setting than in the switch setting. But our other sense, and again it's early, is that the uptick is probably coming at the expense of the protease inhibitors as per your comment earlier. So seems to be more being used in the naive setting than switch. The switch data will help and having in the label will help, but the team, our expanded team is very much positioning this as the preferred regimen for upfront use in new patients as an alternative to Atripla, as an alternative to the boosted protease inhibitors.","Norbert W. Bischofberger","So Geoff, with regards to your question about the Phase III program, the big answer is no, nothing has changed. As John mentioned, the first Phase III study -- the first patient was dosed last week and just to underscore the repetitive enrollment we actually had to close the study for screening last week as well because we had enough patients in screening so that we can enroll the first 200. So we're going to take a look at this, the two 12-week arm sometime in the first quarter next year, probably March, and then we'll make a decision as to what to -- whether we're going to continue to randomize patients in this study. And then with regards to the other study, keep in mind, we have other data coming in. The 2 data sets will be presented at AASLD. One of them is the 12-week arms of the Bristol-Myers daclatasvir 7977 combination, another one is the 7977 5885 ribavirin in genotype 1 naive patients in the ELECTRON study and with them, we have a third arm in ELECTRON ongoing 7977 5885 ribavirin in genotype 1 null responders. And we will take all these data into consideration and based on that, design the second Phase III study, which should start pretty much at the latest around the same time as we're going to reopen this current study for re-randomization and re-enrollment. But just briefly, this could be a very simple, potentially 1-arm study with a 12-week arm, depending on the outcome. It could also include treatment, experienced patients, depending on what data looked like of the combination in the null responders, what it gain. So I hope that answers the question. It will all become clearer over the next 2 to 3 months what the nature and the design of that second Phase III is going to be.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's really helpful. Just a quick follow-up, Norbert, is there anything...","John C. Martin","Geoff, that's 3 questions already. We're going to have to move on to somebody else.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Matt Roden with UBS.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Question for Norbert on GS-7340. Is it reasonable for us to think about the potential to lower the incidence of renal adverse events with 7340 versus the standard of care? How many patients do you think would need to be treated and for how long to really start to tease out whether or not there's a difference here?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Yes. So Matt, that's exactly what we're hoping to be able to show. So essentially, 7340 is the same active ingredient as is in Viread, but it's dosed at 1\/10 the dose. And they always said unless you believe in homeopathy you would -- it's reasonable to assume that this compound has better, say, tolerability and safety. And the 2 things in particular are BMD and creatinine clearance changes. Now I think -- I personally think that BMD changes are easier to show because simply we saw about a 2% net BMD loss with Viread across a whole number of studies and if this compound is better then it should be easier to show statistically. With regards to creatinine clearance, it really depends on the effect size of the variability. But we think, in a Phase III study, you should actually be able to show that. And this would become clearer by the way, as John Martin said in his script, we should actually get the Phase II -- the final 24-week Phase II data from the first study in a month or so and then it should become clearer what the powering will be for the Phase III study.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","My question is for Norbert. Obviously, we've seen a lot of the data come out recently from late breakers 12 and 24 weeks with and without ribavirin from some other oral compounds. Maybe, since that's always been a question as to whether duration and with and without ribavirin matter, maybe you could hypothesize or speculate how you're thinking about that data and whether that changes your thinking since you've gotten some answers from other drugs recently.","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Michael, I don't think I have a good answer for you. So as you may have seen also from our abstracts, one of them on the resistance of 7977 that's going to be at AASLD, we have never seen a breakthrough on 7977. And with one single exception, we have never seen resistance. And the one single exception was when 7977 was used by itself without anything else. So given that, then I would -- you would expect that treatment duration should matter. If you don't  develop resistance, you don't have breakthrough, and you don't achieve 100% response with 12 weeks. If you think about it, going to 24-week should increase that response rate. Now that's theoretical. In the few instances where we have actually tested that, we didn't see that. So that unfortunately is the only thing I can tell you. I can't quite make sense out of the treatment duration yet. I think it should become clearer once we see the Bristol-Myers data and also the -- our Phase III results where we're directly comparing in a large sample size 12 versus 24 weeks.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And of ribavirin?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","You know what, Michael, what overall it looks like is that 7977 is a very potent compound. But by itself, it's not quite enough. You have to add something else. Now if you add ribavirin it will bring the response rates up to a very respectable 80% to 90% to 100%, but not in all populations, particularly you may remember in genotype 1, it's not 100% and then in null responders, it's not 100%. But ribavirin, from a biological point of view, adds, actually, very minimal efficacy. So I think by adding something a little bit more potent to it, like for instance an NS5A, as has been shown by the Bristol-Myers data, you get 100% response rate. So that's how I look at 7977. It's a very potent compound, not quite enough by itself, so you have have to add at least one other -- at least semi-potent antiviral to it, like a PI or a NS5A or a NS5B.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Rachel McMinn with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Rachel L. McMinn - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just wanted to better understand strategy in HCV. When we think about dual therapy versus triple therapy and, Norbert, I just -- I did listen to your comment on ribavirin, but I was curious how you're thinking about 9669. So you've talked about that as being a third agent, but you don't seem to be aggressively developing a safety database around that and then just separate from all that, curious on when you might consider starting an 8-week study with 7977 in either genotype 1 or genotype 2, 3.","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Yes. So Rachel, with regards to 9669, so it's one of the most potent non-nuc NS5B inhibitors that has been described, very well behaved compound, once daily, seems to be safe. The reason why we're not as aggressively pursuing it is simple, because we're not quite sure what the place is in hep C therapy. We have 5885 with a PI. We have in the -- in preclinical in the works a pan-genotypic NS5A inhibitor, so we're just not sure what the role of 9669 is. So we are doing, as I'm sure you know, 2 cohorts in ELECTRON that look at 9669 with 7977 in ribavirin, both in genotype 1 naive and null responders, and I'm sure those data will look very good. But again, we're struggling with this issue where 9669 fit. I want to mention something. One role that I think triple combination therapy could have. If you shorten the treatment -- so let's say you get really good results with 2 agents and you shorten the treatment duration and at one point reach a duration where the response is suboptimal, then it's conceivable by adding a third agent then you will get, again get good responses. So that's a line of experiments that we're pursuing. And with regards to 7977 for shorter treatment duration than 12 weeks, there's actually 1 presentation at AASLD. It's going to be an Ed Gane's [ph] oral where he's looking at 7977 ribavirin for 8 weeks in genotype 2, 3. So that will give you some indication of we're thinking about, depending on the outcome of the other cohorts in ELECTRON, about looking at 5885-7977 ribavirin combination with a shorter than 12-week treatment duration. But there is nothing definitive yet.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Since it's one question, I'll respect that. I just want to clarify, are you guys going to give us the interim data from the Phase III in the 1Q. Because it just seems to me like that is of monumental importance. Obviously, everyone's going to go to AASLD and look at your 5885, 7977 riba 12-week data, but the real -- the really important data set's that 200-patient interim. Are you committed to giving that SVR4 data to Wall Street in the 1Q when you have it?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Mark, this is something we are still debating internally. On the one hand, we've realized the importance of the data for the financial community. On the other hand, we also -- you have to be cognizant of the fact that this is an ongoing randomized study and we can't really -- we would be influencing the conduct of the study potentially if we announced to the world the interim analysis. So something we're thinking about I think there might be other cohorts available at that time that would answer the question. So we would make those available publicly and not make available the actual interim analysis.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So, sorry, what are the other cohorts, Norbert? I just...","Norbert W. Bischofberger","It's still in the planning stage, but we're thinking about initiating 1 or 2 other cohorts that would answer that same question that you have.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Cohorts in the Phase III or in the Phase II?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","This would be Phase II.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with Wells Fargo Securities.","Brian Corey Abrahams - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Continuing on the hep C front, what do you guys see as the bar for SVRs, for both naives and nulls, that would optimize the commercial opportunity just given some of the competitive data we've seen unfold? And how much weight should we place on sort of the predictive value of what we see come out of ELECTRON? And then just lastly, do you have any updates on the disclosure plan for the ELECTRON nulls arm?","Kevin B. Young","Brian, it's Kevin. I wouldn't give you a pinpoint target of a kind of a threshold for SVR. Let's not forget, I think you should be SVR 12 because those are the endpoints of the study. But clearly, you've got to be very high these days. I think there are going to be a number of regimens from a number of companies that are going to have high SVRs and I hope -- that also includes Gilead in that comment. My personal feeling is that as we get towards launch, that other parameters, in addition to SVR, will come to play. The simplicity and the convenience of the regimens and the tolerability. And that's why approaches like 5885 plus 7977, plus ribavirin, or no ribavirin, becomes very attractive, 12 weeks, well-tolerated. It almost becomes sort of a Complera or Stribild approach, but over a 3-month period. So I think we are going to see high SVRs from a number of different approaches, different molecules, but I actually think the addition of the other parameters are going to be important in the real world, particularly beyond the specialist hepatology clinic when you start to go into the general gastro treater in the community, potentially other physicians beyond where the PIs are used today. And our expectation would be that the new regimens can go much further afield than the current prescribing of telaprevir and boceprevir.","Norbert W. Bischofberger","And you asked 2 other sub question. You said what's the predictability of ELECTRON cohorts. I think it's entirely predictable. Just keep in mind you have to take it with a grain of salt because of the sample size. Some of the cohorts are 10, an n of 10, others are an n of 25, neither one is particularly large. So just keep in mind there is always variability. And secondly, you asked about a null responder disclosure. So when I talked to Ed Gane [ph], he let me know that probably what would be available at the time of the AASLD presentation will be a total of 3 patient SVR4. That's 3 out of 10. And we're a little bit debating internally, is that worth showing? Because we don't want to mislead anybody one way or another if the result is a certain way, but it's an n of 3. Now that is a really small sample size.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Bernstein.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And Norbert, 3 patients has been enough to build whole companies in hep C. I just wanted to follow up with some of the questions about disclosure. Will you tell us about the results for 7340 in Q4? Or will we just learn from the decision to start the pivotal trials? It seems important. And just wondering, John, if you could give us an update on the prosecution of the patents for the combination products, where there's any news there?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Yes, we were actually planning on letting the financial community know about the results from the Phase II study because, Geoff, as you correctly pointed out, it has a direct consequence if the results look promising then we would, of course, move into Phase III and that's something that would become public one way or another at one point.","John C. Martin","And Geoff, the second part of your question is we don't have any update on the prosecution of the combination patents, but if that procedure changed, of course, we will update you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citigroup.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So, a question, Norbert, just for you, I just want to follow up and to really understand a little bit. You're going to have data -- it sounds like imminently from the Bristol combo, which is going to give you a sense of whether you need riba or not and whether 12 weeks is enough. And it sounds like from what you're saying, it sounds like you guys are feeling pretty optimistic 12 weeks is enough and if I'm reading correctly, maybe even riba is not adding much. So I'm trying to understand. Then you are going to have data from the triple for 12 weeks from ELECTRON, but that's not a huge sample. Where I'm going with this is, is this enough for you and then have, by March, you're going to have preliminary, it sounds like, SVR4 at least from your current Phase III. Is that enough at that point to make a determination that the Phase III is only going to be 12 weeks? And if so, when do you think you can file for an all-oral for genotype 1?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Yes, Yaron, absolutely, that will be enough. So the argument that we always made and that we firmly believe in that daclatasvir and 5885 are very similar compound at least in genotype 1, they're very potent, similar potent against 1A, 1B, behaves similarly against polymorphs with maybe one exception, but in that polymorph, the Y93H [ph] it's still way above -- the IQ was still a factor of 6. So very potent. The only thing we're missing right now is a clinical proof of that and that will come from ELECTRON. So what ELECTRON would do for us if the data look promising, that would absolutely prove that -- it would establish the link between daclatasvir and 5885. That, together with, I said with the null responder data from ELECTRON and the Bristol-Myers data will give us enough confidence to design the second Phase III study. And then if we get the interim analysis, by the way the sample size is again not huge, it's 100, of the two 12-week arm, so 50 per arm. And again, it would -- I mean this all has to hang together and be confirmative of each other. But each study ideally confirms the other and we would have then enough pieces of evidence that we would feel very comfortable designing the second Phase III study. It's essentially ELECTRON, Bristol-Myers and our own Phase III study. Those are 3 studies, if you add up the number of patients, about 130 total and that's enough to give you confidence to go into Phase III.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And at that point, when do you think you can file for an all-oral, if you start the study, let's say, early Q2?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Well, I think, Yaron, you can do your own calculation. It's just assumed fairly rapid enrollment 12-week of treatment if that's what the treatment duration is, 12 weeks of SVR, 12 follow-up and add to that 3 to 4 months for filing. And then another 8 month for approval if it's priority review or 12 months if it's not.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess, first, you showed that Atripla trends are sort of flat. I wonder if you can comment a little bit about what you're seeing in Atripla and with Atripla use? And second, just a follow-up to Mark's question on the arms that you might be adding in Phase II that might give us a hint about Phase III. Are you talking about maybe adding 24-week arms or maybe non-riba arms to the ELECTRON trial? Is that what you're sort of implying, sort of additional arms in perhaps ELECTRON that would give us a read by March as far as how the Phase III might be shaping up?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Robyn, I'll answer your second question quickly before Kevin answers the first. I don't want to get into that because it would give away -- it would preempt some of the data that you're going to see at AASLD. I think once you see the data at AASLD you will more -- it will be more evident what we're thinking about.","Kevin B. Young","Yes, Robyn. Back to the question. Atripla is coming down. Let me try and give you just a couple of benchmarks. The Q2 Ipsos or Synovate data has Atripla at 34% of the naive market. Truvada is 31% and Complera is at 25%. So that gives you your kind of total of about 90% for Gilead that you've seen before. But clearly the mix is changing. So Atripla has progressively, over the last sort of 5 quarters, come off its high. And another marker in terms of change is that Complera gets 25% of its prescriptions from Atripla switch. So you can see that there is Atripla switching more than likely because of tolerability, the CNS side effects of efavirenz, coming across to Complera. The only other thing I'd add, Robyn, is the shift that you saw in the actual product sales in Q3 versus Q2. That was largely because of the non-retail, that was largely because of ADAP ordering. ADAP ordered quite large quantities in Q1 and Q2 of this year of Atripla, and they were relatively quiet on Atripla in Q3. So the actual product sale changes that you saw there were largely the result of the phasing of ADAP purchase.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Marshall Urist with Morgan Stanley.","Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So just one, Kevin. If you could give us a sense of how you think the dynamics between Complera and Stribild will play out, seeing as I think Complera is obviously, outperformed I think a lot of people's expectations. So what's the impact between those 2? And Norbert, maybe just a slightly different question, which is, has the data that we've seen from Abbott and others sort of changed your perspective or your thinking? Or at least what is your current thinking on the importance of getting rid of riba and dual therapy from the initial -- for the initial Phase III regimen? Or given the competitors, is it -- is there a little bit less pressure, you think, competitively, to drop riba at this point?","Kevin B. Young","Complera, we're very pleased with. I think we've proven that if you put rilpivirine with a good backbone in a single tablet, it can do very well. And we particularly hear anecdotal feedback from physicians on the tolerability. How well patients like Complera. So it has done very nicely in real sort of clinical practice. However, Stribild is our first detail. We are positioning Stribild as first-rank therapy in the vast majority of patients. So you would expect that Stribild would quickly become the lead product in the naive setting, our label is naive. So you would expect it to take over. One just small piece of information that wasn't included in the script, but I think is nice to add for Stribild is that we have had a late breaker accepted at the Glasgow HIV meeting on our 96-week data. So that will be presented there and then hopefully, we'll get that into publication quite quickly for Stribild and then we hope going into 2013 that, that will be helpful eventually for moving Stribild into a preferred setting and guideline. So the profile of Stribild is likely to become stronger. So I think we've got a very good #1 product in Stribild. We're getting the data on switching for Complera and that could well become, I think, a very strong second switch product. The good news in all of this is that I think we've got 2 options in Stribild and Complera that are superior to Atripla. So I think it's a very good position that we're in.","Norbert W. Bischofberger","So Marshall, with regards to the competition, that's an important question that I would like to comment on. So first of all, Abbott has a viable regimen. They obviously came to the conclusion that they needed all 5 agents, differing only in terms of treatment duration, 12 versus 24 weeks. But I will mention that what we do and the urgency that we feel is not really determined by what the competition does, but rather by where we ultimately want to go with the therapy, and our goal has always been to have 1 pill, once daily, without ribavirin, and I think that's entirely possible and that's what we're pursuing. So we, at one point, ribavirin will disappear. People won't use it anymore because of the obvious issues, it's BID, causes anemia and you don't have to use it, you wouldn't use it. And that, I think, we are going to achieve. The question is when and with what regimen.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with Piper Jaffray.","M. Ian Somaiya - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just wanted to follow up with Norbert on sort of your longer-term vision on hep C. I think you mentioned the goal of moving to a once daily, 1 pill regimen. Just can you help us think about -- is the next step addition of a third pill, a third drug that you had co-formulated into a single pill? Or would it be a different combination, different -- let's say switching out your NS5A with something else?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Ian, again, I think the -- it's clear, if you just look at the Bristol-Myers data that were presented at EASL that you can have 2 drugs, in that case daclatasvir and 7977, dosed for 24 weeks gives you 100% response rates in genotype 1. It didn't give you that number in genotype 2, 3 for obvious reasons because daclatasvir and also our own NS5A inhibitor is really not optimized for genotype 2, 3. We have, very early in development, a pan-genotypic NS5A that at least biologically looks just absolutely wonderful. It's a compound that works against all genotypes, against most polymorphs and we think that will be the -- a simple answer to a 1 pill, once daily for all genotypes. The only thing I would like to say, Ian, you said about 3 drugs. It's -- the only role I can see for 3 drugs is if you wanted to further shorten the treatment duration, so it's possible, even though the concept hasn't been shown, that you could, for instance, get away with 10 weeks of treatment with 3 drugs, whereas if you have 2 drugs it needed 12 or 16 weeks. That's where I'm seeing a role of a third drug, but if you have 2 good drugs, you can actually -- that's enough. That will suffice to cure most hep C genotypes.","M. Ian Somaiya - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","And what -- do you have a sense of timelines for the NS5A that you have in preclinical development, when that could move into clinic and when ultimately we could see that in the marketplace?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Ian, it's too early, really, for me to speculate on that. I would -- we're thinking about disclosing that sometime at the future conference. We haven't really decided when yet.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Brian Skorney with Brean Murray.","Brian Skorney - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","I'll jump a little off page and actually ask a question on GS-1101 and just the potential plans for a fileable single-arm study. I just think the response rate, as I recall, in Phase I in indolent NHL was about 57%, but I think that included a number of the higher than 150 mig BID doses. I just wonder, have you guys broken out the responses to 150 migs specifically for these patients and what should we think of as a potentially fileable hurdle for this study? Is it reasonable to think of relapsed refractory indolent NHL as equivalent to other relapsed refractory hematological malignancies? Or given that it's indolent should it -- would we anticipate a closer look at kind of a PFS?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Yes, Brian. We have not, actually -- I don't think we have broken it up by dose, but as you noted, the current 120 patient Phase II study that John talked about in iNHL is fully enrolled. We will look at response rates very soon and the only thing that what we don't know yet is -- and what is equally important is the duration of response and the reason is we just haven't followed enough patients for a long period of time. That will sometime happen next spring, but I also would like to caution you, we think it's unlikely that we will get approval or we will even file under single-arm study. It's more likely that we will get approval based on the Phase III studies that are ongoing. One last comment about response rates and what's required, you may want to look at carfilzomib that got approved on a single-arm study. It was a different disease in myeloma, but the response rate overall was 22% and the duration of response was 8 months. And I think it's probably an exception, but if we have something north of that, then we would definitely approach the FDA and see what they think.","Brian Skorney - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","And I guess, I mean -- so that kind of goes back to my question, I mean, do you -- and I was thinking about carfilzomib specifically, but do you think that the relapsed refractory indolent NHL population sort of meets the same hurdles as the relapsed refractory myeloma population, in terms of not really having exhausting all resources out there, especially with maybe increased use of bendamustine and rituximab now than previous years?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Yes, Brian, they do with one caveat. So they do in the sense that they are relapsed refractory to CD -- anti-CD 20s and cytotoxics, so bendamustine, rituximab. One potential argument that you could use to say they are not unmet need is because these people have not been treated with radioimmunotherapy. And of course the counter argument is nobody uses that. That was something that was brought up by the Advisory Committee meeting by Anderson. Again, this is something we don't know what the FDA would think. I mean, would they say these people have not exhausted all their options yet because radioimmunotherapy hasn't been used, or would they accept the previous relapsed response to cytotoxics and anti-CD 20s. That's kind of the question.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Thomas Wei with Jefferies.","Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask -- have 3 questions. Just an update on how you're thinking about the genotype 1 cirrhotic population? How competitive do you think you're going to be there relative to some of the other companies that seem to be expediting development in that population? And how much more work do you need to define the right duration and regimen for cirrhotics?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Thanks, Thomas, for your question. Thomas, we're actually pursuing that in all our Phase III studies. So all our studies mandate at least 20% cirrhotics and actually in 1 study, the POSITRON study that you will hear about in this year, the results, that study enrolled 30% cirrhotics. So we are actively addressing that question. And we always add as a goal to have a representative sample of patients in our Phase III study that represents the patients that are actually going to be treated and a lot of those are cirrhotics. So those are included in all our studies in our Phase IV, Phase III studies that are currently ending or coming to an end. And they will also be included in the 7977-5885 fixed dose combination.","Operator","And our next question comes from line of Tony Butler with Barclays Capital.","Charles Anthony Butler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I'll be brief, Norbert. Just again on cirrhotics. You did make reference to the notion that the only way you would think or you would hypothesize that a 3-drug regimen would be necessary, would be due to duration. Does that imply that you think that a fixed-dose 2-drug combination would be sufficient for cirrhotics, are you still leaving that door open? And then very quickly to Kevin. I'm respectful of the Stribild label for another naive setting, but why would it not erode or dampen the Complera demand, especially when Stribild is in first line on the -- at least, on those Atripla switches?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Tony, you are right. In terms of special populations, we may well realize that certain populations you can't -- 2 drugs are not sufficient, you may need 3 drugs. But again, I want to point back to our observation that we have, to this date, never seen a biological breakthrough on 7977, not one. All our patients that were nonresponders are rebounders. Again, that makes me -- convinces me that it's a function of duration of therapy rather than the number of drugs that are needed.","Kevin B. Young","Yes, it's a very good point you make around sort of dampening the uptick of Complera, Eviplera. I think that's certainly the case in naive setting. It might have an effect in the switch setting. Of course, if people are on Atripla, then they've already been taking an NNRTI. And if it's a tolerability issue, it's a simple switch from 1 NNRTI to another simply based on the CNS. One area that we haven't talked about and we'll be waiting for data and of course again it's a label situation is that we have done the switching study from Truvada plus ISENTRESS, so raltegravir and there are over 50,000 patients on that regimen today. So I think that's more likely a potential switch in the situation that the doctor takes that decision individually to do that. So I think for Stribild, it's more likely a PI switch or a Truvada ISENTRESS switch.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Alan Carr with Needham & Company.","Alan Carr - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Just a quick one. Could you comment on the share buyback activity and strategy as well as managing the debt as well?","Robin L. Washington","Sure, Alan. We did repurchase shares, it's actually outlined in the deck that we provided. Our focus, in terms of our share repurchase program, is secondary to paying down the debt. So we actually slightly underachieved offsetting dilution this quarter. I think it was slightly under $200 million or so that we repurchased. In terms of the Pharmasset debt paydown, we are focused on paying down the short-term debt and we paid about $350 million down this quarter to bring our debt to EBITDA down to about 2.2. Our goal is by mid-2013 to get it to 1.5. That's our target.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Joel Sendek with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Joel D. Sendek - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So HIV question. I'm wondering on the Stribild launch whether you encountered any pushback on reimbursement given the price? And then also regarding Europe, I'm wondering why the franchise is growing a little bit slower? I understand this particular quarter's issue, but if you look at each of the last couple of quarters, it's not been growing that much. I'm wondering if there are any other reasons why.","Kevin B. Young","Joel, it's Kevin. I couldn't be happier with actually the access to Stribild. To have 37 ADAP programs, and 4 of the big 5 already in a little under 2 months is where we were really with Atripla. It's very much quicker than what we had with Complera. So we're really having very, very good acceptance. Now just as a reminder, the pricing of Stribild is lower than the boosted protease inhibitor. So that's quite appealing to managed care. Not by a large amount, but it is lower. So managed care likes that. So we priced it very competitively from a regimen cost point of view. When it comes to Europe, Joel, it isn't easy out there. I think we do well because we've got specialist products, HIV requires treatment. We have a great deal of support from physicians. We have good payor support and we've got good advocacy,  but some of the markets are tough. Any pharmaceutical company will tell you that, particularly Southern Europe. But our business in the likes of Spain and Portugal, Italy are holding up, I think, pretty well. So it might look a little bit quieter in terms of growth in the U.S., but on a relative basis, I actually think we're doing remarkably well. So Europe, there are still some stresses and there are still some challenges there.","Operator","Mr. O'Brien, at this point, we have run out of time for additional questions.","Patrick O'Brien","Thank you, Ann, and thank you, all, for joining us today. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead and the team here looks forward to providing you with updates on future progress. Thanks, again.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation and you may now disconnect.

My name is Candice and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode, and as a reminder this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Sung Lee, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thank you, Candice, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market close today, we issued two press releases regarding our CEO John Milligan and earnings results for the second quarter of 2018. The press releases and detailed slides on earnings are available on the Investor Relations section of the Gilead website.","You will notice the change to how we present product sales in the press release. Previously, we grouped HIV and HBV together under antiviral product sales. We now show HIV products alone so that you can better understand the performance of this category.","The speakers on today's call will be John Milligan, President and Chief Executive Officer; Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Andrew Cheng, Chief Medical Officer and Executive Vice President; and John McHutchison, Chief Scientific Officer and Head of Research and Development.","Before we begin with our prepared comments, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, financial projections and the use of capital, all of which involves certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements.","A description of these risks can be found in our latest SEC disclosure documents and recent press releases. In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release as well as on the Gilead website.","I will now turn the call over to John.","John F. Milligan, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thank you, Sung, and good afternoon, everyone. As you saw from our press release, I'll be stepping down as CEO and departing Gilead at the end of this year. It's been an honor to work here for my entire professional career and now that the company is on solid footing for the future, the board and I have agreed it is a good time to turn the reigns over to a new leader.","You've seen the strong results from the second quarter. Beyond these numbers, I believe Gilead is in a position of tremendous strength. When I stepped into the role of CEO there were a number of things I wanted to accomplish on behalf of the company and I'm very pleased with the progress we have made. We have a growing HIV franchise and industry-leading cell therapy program and late-stage pipeline in inflammation and NASH.","We've been working at a fast and unrelenting pace for many years, for me nearly three decades, and while I'm extremely proud of what this company has accomplished, I'm also looking forward to a well-deserved break and will move on to new and different opportunities.","I want to emphasize that this does not change our mission or the strategic direction of our company and with the full faith and support of the Board of Directors we will continue to pursue and execute internal programs as well as external partnerships and transactions that further strengthen our pipeline and our business.","As our press release described, I will be staying in my role until the end of the year while the board has a chance to conduct its search for a new CEO to lead Gilead into its next wave of growth.","So let's get to the business at hand, the great results from this past quarter and I would like to now turn the call over to Robin.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I provide an update on the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to thank John for his leadership, commitment and many contributions to Gilead over the years. Personally, I've appreciated your friendship, support, and I wish you well in your future endeavors.","Turning to the business and the results for the quarter, I'll review the financial results and commercial performance. Andrew will provide updates on HIV portfolio, and then John McHutchison will make a few comments about our pipeline.","We delivered a very strong quarter led by the performance of our HIV franchise with further stabilization in HCV and continued progress of the Yescarta launch. Total revenues for the second quarter were $5.6 billion with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.91. This compares to revenue of $7.1 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.56 for the same period last year.","Non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter benefited from a settlement of a tax examination which contributed $0.15 per share and an effective tax rate for the quarter of 13.4%.","Starting with HIV, product sales for the second quarter were $3.7 billion, up 13% year-over-year and 16% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to the uptake of our Descovy-based regimen with a very strong contribution from Biktarvy in the U.S.","Sequentially the increase was primarily due to the following factors. First, the seasonal U.S. inventory draw-down observed in the first quarter, which accounted for more than $200 million and did not recur in the second quarter. Second, U.S. payer mix which is typically about 45% private pay and 55% government, but in the second quarter was approximately equally split between private pay and government segments. We estimate that this benefited the second quarter by approximately $150 million. And, third, the continued rapid uptake of Biktarvy in the second quarter.","Our U.S. HIV business continues to be a major growth driver, delivering 18% year-over-year revenue growth and 11% year-over-year prescription growth, which reflects the strong underlying demand for Descovy-based regimens. 70% of Gilead's total HIV treatment prescription volume was comprised of Descovy-based regimens. We anticipate this percentage to continue to increase over the coming years.","In the first full quarter since its approval in February, Biktarvy delivered $183 million in sales in the U.S. Biktarvy also became the number one regimen for switch patients during the quarter. Based on its current trajectory, we anticipate that Biktarvy will become the number one single tablet regimen for treatment-na\u00efve patients and will overtake Genvoya as the most successful launch in HIV history.","More than 85% of Biktarvy's prescriptions came from switches. Of these switches, approximately a quarter came from Genvoya and another quarter came from regimens containing dolutegravir. The balance came from older Gilead single and multi-tablet regimens.","In March, Biktarvy was added to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services guidelines for the use of anti-retroviral agents in adults and adolescents living with HIV as one of the recommended initial regimens, and earlier this week The Journal of American Medical Association published updated treatment guidelines from the International AIDS Society-USA Panel, which now includes Biktarvy as a recommended regimen.","Truvada for PrEP continued to grow with an estimated 180,000 individuals in the U.S. taking Truvada for PrEP as we exited the quarter. Also in May the U.S. Food and Drug Administration extended the indication for Truvada for PrEP to include at-risk adolescents. In the U.S., youth aged 13 to 24 comprised 21% of the approximately 40,000 new infections in 2016, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.","These statistics demonstrate the need for increased efforts to educate at-risk individuals, particularly young men who have sex with men, about risk-reduction strategies including Truvada for PrEP.","To this end with strong encouragement from the HIV community, we launched two new television campaigns, a non-branded disease awareness program to reach those unaware of their HIV risk, and a branded Truvada commercial. We hope that these two campaigns, together with the ongoing educational initiatives across our organization, will further support the advocacy community's efforts to destigmatize HIV and normalize conversations about HIV prevention among those at the highest risk for infections and the healthcare providers who serve them.","Turning to Europe, HIV sales were down slightly year-over-year due to the availability of generics in several markets. Partially offset by uptake of Descovy-based regimens. These regimens now comprise nearly 60% of our Europe HIV product revenues reflecting the strong physician and patient preference for Descovy-containing regimens over generics.","Genvoya remained the number one regimen for na\u00efve and switch patients across the EU5 collectively for the fifth consecutive quarter. Biktarvy was approved in the EU toward the end of June and immediately launched in Germany and a few other countries. We believe Biktarvy will make significant contributions to our European revenues once pricing and reimbursement are achieved broadly, which can take up to 12 months.","The performance of our worldwide HIV business was very strong in the first half of the year and we expect similar results for the second half of the year.","The U.S. HIV market will continue to deliver robust year-over-year prescription and revenue growth in the second half of 2018 driven by the continued strong uptake of Biktarvy.","Given the payer mix dynamic we experienced in Q2, our Q3 U.S. HIV revenues could look similar to Q2. Additionally it is important to note that in Europe there is typically a third quarter seasonal impact on revenues due to holiday schedules in various countries that also could impact our Q3 revenues compared to Q2. We also expect to see some additional impact from generics in certain European countries. All of these assumptions have been factored into our guidance.","Turning to HCV, product sales for the second quarter were $1 billion, down 65% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. As anticipated, we are seeing further stabilization of the market, which is reflected in our sequential performance for the quarter.","Patient starts continues to be more predictable, and we still expect a slow and steady decline moving forward. Our belief is that the HCV market is durable and will contribute to our revenues in a meaningful way going forward, albeit at declining rates.","We will continue to compete for market share across the market segments and geographies with increased promotional efforts and focus behind Epclusa, our pan-genotypic, pan-fibrotic, once daily single-tablet regimen.","Turning to cardiovascular products, Ranexa and Letairis delivered their best quarterly performance ever with sales of $208 million and $244 million, respectively. As a reminder, the U.S. patent for ambrisentan, the active agent in Letairis will expire near the end of this month and we expect this to impact our Letairis sales in the second half of the year.","Moving on to cell therapy, sales of Yescarta were $68 million. We continue to be encouraged by the response from the healthcare provider and patient communities for the life-saving potential of Yescarta.","We have completed the authorization of more than 60 cancer centers which cover approximately 80% of the Yescarta-eligible patients in the United States. While we continue to work on authorizing additional centers, our focus now turns to working with centers to enhance patient flows. Furthermore, we are educating community oncologists about cell therapy and how they can connect their patients to cancer centers for appropriate treatment.","In terms of access in the United States, the payer mix has been consistent with expectations. The majority of patients treated with Yescarta were covered by commercial insurance or treated at PPS-exempt centers.","We continue to work to provide better access for patients on Medicare. We provided comments to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services as part of the fiscal year 2019 rule-making process to create a DRG code that is reflective of the value that cell therapy provides to patients. CMS is expected to announce the final in-patient prospective payment system rule in August of this year that will establish in-patient payment rates for the upcoming fiscal year beginning October 1.","Last month we announced that the CHMP adopted a positive opinion on the Marketing Authorization Application for Yescarta in the EU, as a treatment for adults with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B lymphoma and primary large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy.","We expect the European Commission to grant Marketing Authorization in the third quarter of this year and our preparations for launch are underway. We plan to complete the authorization of more than 20 centers in the EU by the end of 2018 with our initial launch efforts primarily focused on Germany and France.","Now, turning to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $921 million for the second quarter, up 13% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to our purchase of a Priority Review Voucher in the second quarter and investments in our cell therapy program.","Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $840 million for the second quarter, up 2% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to higher costs to support the growth of our business following the acquisition of Kite.","Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the second quarter was 13.4% compared to 22.8% in the first quarter of this year. The lower rate in the second quarter was due to a favorable settlement of a tax examination. As a result of this favorable impact, we are lowering our full year non-GAAP effective tax guidance to be in the range of 19% to 21%.","Moving to our balance sheet. As of June 30, we had $31.7 billion of cash and investments. During the second quarter, we generated $1.6 billion in operating cash flow including tax payments of $1.5 billion. And we also paid cash dividends of $740 million and repurchased 6.6 million shares of stock for $450 million.","The year is progressing consistent with our expectations, and we are reiterating our full year guidance with the exception of the non-GAAP effective tax rate, which has been lowered. Also, the diluted EPS impact of GAAP to non-GAAP adjustment has been increased from a range of $1.41 to $1.51 per share to $1.50 to $1.60 per share. Details of our guidance can be found on slide 35 in the earnings results presentation.","One area I'd like to address before closing, is U.S. pricing. We did not implement midyear prices increases on any of our products and have no plans to do so for at least six months. As you know, in HCV we have responded to the evolving, increasingly competitive market by providing payers with substantial discounts. We are confident that our net pricing is competitive and is delivering value for patients and the broader healthcare system.","In closing, we continue to believe that 2018 is a trough year for Gilead on which we can grow in the future. Our confidence in our future is supported by strong and growing HIV business led by the launch of Biktarvy in the U.S., increasing momentum in our cell therapy business, progress in the emerging R&D areas of NASH and inflammation and a healthy balance sheet, which equips us to invest in future opportunities to create long-term shareholder value.","I will now turn the call over to Andrew.","Andrew Cheng, MD, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thank you, Robin. It's timely that the 22 International AIDS Conference is taking place this week in Amsterdam. The World AIDS Conference represents the largest conference on any global health issue in the world and has become known as a venue where researchers, policymakers, advocates collaborative help drive an evidence-based response to the HIV epidemic.","I'd like to provide some highlights of Gilead's vision for HIV treatment, prevention and cure, and how we intend to sustain and build on our leadership position. I will summarize some of the exciting data presented in Amsterdam this week that provide context to what we see as remaining unmet needs in this field.","I'd also like to congratulate our partner Janssen on the approval last week of SYMTUZA by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. SYMTUZA is the fourth Descovy-based, single-tablet regimen and the first commercially available single-tablet regimen containing a protease inhibitor, an important option for patients who previously had to consume two or more tablets each day. Among the results we presented at the International AIDS Conference, where data from a pooled analysis that further demonstrate the lack of resistance seen across the Biktarvy clinical trial program. This analysis generated \u2013 evaluated the efficacy of Biktarvy among patients with high baseline HIV RNA greater than 100,000 copies per milliliter and with a baseline CD4 cell count below 200 per microliter. Biktarvy sustained virologic suppression with no treatment emergent resistance to 48 weeks and 99% of patients in both sub groups achieved HIV RNA less than 50 copies per mill. For some people living with HIV, drug resistance is already a fact of life and we are also advancing molecules to meet their needs.","GS-9131 a novel nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor is currently being studded in a Phase 2 trial in people living with HIV who are resistant to nucleosides and we look forward to sharing updates on this study in the future. Although once daily single-tablet regimens have set the current standard for convenience, we recognize that even once-daily dosing can be challenging or impractical for some people living with or at risk for HIV infection. I'm also pleased to share an update on a long-acting formulation of GS-6207, our novel HIV capsid inhibitor. This inhibitor is the most potent anti-HIV molecule ever recorded and results in therapeutically active blood levels lasting greater than 90 days after a single subcutaneous injection in pre-clinical species. Since that time, we have moved a clinical formulation into the clinic and similar to our animal data we have established in healthy volunteers that a single subcutaneous dose of the capsid inhibitor results in therapeutically relevant concentrations for greater than 60 days. Our goal is an effective subcutaneous product that can be self-administered every three months, which could provide an important option for the significant number of people who are unable to adhere to daily oral regimens.","Prevention efforts also took center stage at the conference this week. We now have compelling evidence correlating the use of Truvada for PrEP with declines in new HIV infections in the United States. In an analysis of state-level data conducted through a collaboration by Gilead, Emory University, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and presented this week at the conference states that \u2013 states with the highest utilization of Truvada for PrEP from 2012 to 2016 showed significant declines in the number of new HIV infections, while states with the lowest use reported increases in new infection. These data underscore the importance for Truvada for PrEP as an effective public health intervention in the ongoing efforts to decrease new HIV infections.","Turning to our HIV cure efforts. One investigational agent is GS-9620, our toll-like receptor 7 agonist which activates certain immune cells that are important for eliminating infected cells. A second investigational agent is GS-9722 an anti-HIV envelope broadly neutralizing antibody that can kill infected cells. Combination studies are planned following the completion of dose-ranging studies for each compound. In summary, Gilead remains deeply committed to leading and innovating in HIV across the spectrum of care from prevention, to treatment, to HIV cure. We are continuing to make significant progress with Truvada in combination with safer sex practices as a means of preventing new HIV infections.","We have multiple medicines available to address the needs of people living with HIV, including six single-tablet regimens. We are working to address remaining needs in both prevention and treatment. And we remain focused on pursuing discovery of new research that could one day lead to a cure for HIV. We have been the leader in HIV for many years and intend to remain at the forefront of these efforts for as long as HIV is a threat to the health of people worldwide.","I would now like to turn the call over to John McHutchison.","John G. McHutchison, AO, MD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thank you, Andrew, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As you heard from Andrew, we are advancing pipeline candidates across the continuum of care for patients with HIV infection. We are also making progress in other therapeutic areas, and I'd like to spend a few minutes highlighting key accomplishments from the first half of this year, as well as additional milestones to look forward to in the second half, starting with cell therapy.","As we anticipate regulatory approval of Yescarta in Europe, we're taking steps to establish worldwide manufacturing capabilities for cell therapy by leasing a new facility in the Netherlands. We anticipate this new European manufacturing facility to be fully operational in 2020 with the capacity to manufacture personalized cell therapies in closer geographic proximity to the patients who will receive them, therefore potentially shortening the turn-around time for people who urgently need such care.","All of us at Gilead and Kite share excitement about both the work being done to launch Yescarta and to advance potential new cell therapies that could help a wider range of patients in the future. I'm particularly enthusiastic about ZUMA-7, our ongoing Phase 3 study comparing Yescarta to the standard of care in second-line treatment of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The current standard of care for these patients is salvage chemotherapy often followed by an autologous stem cell transplant. If successful, this study would support the use of Yescarta in earlier lines of therapy and could one day spare people from having to receive stem cell transplantation with all of its concomitant or attendant difficulties and complications.","As significant of an advance as Yescarta represents, it is also just the beginning. It's critical, but an even greater percentage of patients respond to therapy. And that treatment becomes even safer and better tolerated, so that we can treat people sooner. I believe that with the pipeline programs we have and the technology gained through recent partnerships we can make this a reality.","In the 10 months since we acquired Kite, we have initiated seven acquisitions, investments or partnerships that augment our efforts to more rapidly bring forth cellular therapy, treat a broader range of hematological malignancies and also solid tumors. Lastly, we announced a strategic collaboration with Gadeta a privately-held company that focuses on the discovery and development of novel cancer immunotherapies based on gamma delta T cell receptors.","During the quarter, we also announced the new Cooperative Research and Development Agreement, or CRADA, with the National Cancer Institute to develop adoptive cell therapies targeting patient-specific tumor neoantigens. Neoantigens are mutations found on the surface of cancer cells that are unique to each person and their tumor, offering the potential for more targeted antitumor activity particularly in the realm of solid tumors.","Together, these research collaborations add to our capabilities in research and cell manufacturing, and they broaden our approach to developing potentially effective therapies for additional types of cancers including solid tumors.","Moving to liver disease now. Our two ongoing Phase 3 trials, STELLAR 3 and STELLAR 4, evaluating selonsertib, our ASK1 inhibitor in patients with F3 or bridging fibrosis and F4 or cirrhosis, were fully enrolled earlier this year, and data from these studies should be available in the first half of 2019. If positive, we expect to be in a position to file for approval in mid-2019.","Under this timeline, we believe selonsertib could be the first NDA and the first product approved for the treatment of patients with NASH. From a commercial perspective, our teams are also currently building all the necessary capabilities to develop this new market.","Separately, we discontinued the development of selonsertib for severe alcoholic hepatitis after a Phase 2 study of selonsertib in combination with prednisolone showed a lack of benefit on mortality, which is the primary efficacy endpoint of the trial.","Now, it's important to note that alcoholic hepatitis and NASH are two very distinct diseases. Patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis have advanced decompensated disease with severe hepatic dysfunction and a high 30-day mortality, independent of any therapy. This is completely different from patients in NASH clinical studies and for most patients with NASH in general who have preserved liver functions and they have compensated disease. Additional data from the study will be shared at an upcoming scientific conference later this year.","Turning to inflammation. We continue to be enthusiastic about filgotinib. In May, Gilead and Galapagos announced that EQUATOR our Phase 2 study of filgotinib in adults with moderate to severe psoriatic arthritis achieved its primary endpoint of improvement in the signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis at week 16 as assessed by the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement score.","The filgotinib arm achieved an ACR20 response of 80% compared to 33% for the placebo arm. These results indicated filgotinib has the potential to have a significant effect on the signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis, a condition for which there is also high unmet medical need.","We also announced that an independent Data Monitoring Committee conducted a planned interim futility analysis of the filgotinib Phase 2b\/3 ulcerative colitis study named SELECTION. The DMC recommended that the study proceed into the Phase 3 portion as planned in both biologic experience and biologic naive patients.","In rheumatoid arthritis three studies, FINCH 1, 2 and 3 are fully enrolled. FINCH 2 compared filgotinib to placebo each added to conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs or DMARD in 423 patients who have had an inadequate response to biologics. We expect results from the study later this year.","As you know also our ability to file the NDA for filgotinib is dependent on establishing an adequate safety database at each dose of the drug being studied, as well as data from the MANTA study which is currently enrolling. We expect results from FINCH 1, a 52-week randomized study comparing filgotinib plus methotrexate to adalimumab plus methotrexate, and to methotrexate alone in patients who have had an inadequate response to methotrexate. And from FINCH 3 a 52-week randomized study comparing filgotinib alone to methotrexate alone and to the combination of filgotinib plus methotrexate in methotrexate-na\u00efve patients in the first half of next year.","In summary, we are very excited about our business performance led by robust HIV revenues, a growing cell therapy franchise, stabilizing dynamics in HCV and a pipeline that will generate multiple Phase 3 data readouts across our therapeutic areas within the next 12 months.","I want to take this opportunity to thank John and also Gilead's nearly 11,000 employees for their incredible focus, hard work and execution over the first half of the year.","Let's now open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks so much. Hi, John, I just want to say it's been a real pleasure to work with you. You're really going to be missed in the industry.","John F. Milligan, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Well, thank you, Geoff. I appreciate that.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I'm a little worried about payback from our activist letter.","John F. Milligan, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","I promise not to write any letters to Barclays.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And I bet you'll miss all the M&A questions, I'm sure.","John F. Milligan, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","You know, I will miss this. It's always been a pleasure to work with you guys, and I really enjoyed it over the years. And this is not my last call, so you'll have one more chance to pester me.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. So when you look at the backdrop, hep C is stable, obviously, HIV is growing, Kite could be a nice platform. Do you think \u2013 is Gilead happy to get back to positive growth trends when you look at late this year and definitely in 2019? Or is it time to get even more aggressive? I'm just thinking either on deals or maybe more rapid deployment of investments, say, in cell therapy or NASH?","John F. Milligan, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","It's a good question, Geoff. I mean, the message that we're trying to send out here today is that we're very confident in our overall strategy. We are going to continue to be very, very active looking at transactions which can further our business, and I think it's fair to say we're never really satisfied with where we are. We're always seeking to do more, faster, and we'll continue to try to do that.","And so we have a very active business development team. You'll see many things coming to fruition in the second half of this year. The announcement today is not going to slow us down, and the board has given us the go-ahead to move with these transactions if they meet our criteria. So I'm confident in the baseline. I'm never satisfied, and I know my team is not satisfied and we will continue to move forward. And so that's our message.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Yee of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC","Oh, hey, thanks. Good afternoon and I think we're all going to echo our appreciation and all the stuff you've done with us, John. And so to that extent, I guess I would ask, given perhaps some period of uncertainty I think into what that next Gilead is, what do you think investors should anticipate in terms of a either new leadership or a strategy or what do you think could be certainly different? Is that more deal making? Is that going into other areas? What do you think would change? Thanks so much.","John F. Milligan, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","You know, it's a good question, Michael. If you think about my background and my history, I've been here for a long time, from the time the company was a private start-up to the $100 billion market cap company we are today, and so I've seen a lot of growth. But I've been pretty limited in my exposure, and I think the next leader should be somebody who brings expertise, scientific, commercial or other, into new opportunities for us to grow, for example, people who've launched products into new markets such as we're doing NASH or people who really know how to compete in the oncology area, where I have less experience.","And so I think we are looking for a new leader who will bring new ideas, previous history and experiences we don't have, and one who will take the baton from me and move it forward for the company and for the patients we serve. And so I would look for somebody like that.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Abrahams of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Brian Abrahams - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the quarter. And John, my congrats to you as well on almost three decades there and all your accomplishments.","On the HIV front, coming out of IAS, just wondering your expectations as to what, if any, impact dual regimens could potentially have on pricing, particularly in Europe and\/or overall market share?","And then on the housekeeping front, just wondering if you saw any favorable impact from any inventory restocking in HIV revenues this quarter? Thanks.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","So maybe I'll start with the last question, and then turn it over to Andrew to talk about IAS, Brian. No, the performance in Q2 was demand-driven and inventory was stable, right? Wholesaler days on hand remained consistent between Q1, Q2, and I'd say, again, inventory was commensurate with demand.","Andrew Cheng, MD, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yeah, Brian, it's Andrew. And I think when we look at the GEMINI data coming out of the Amsterdam meeting from yesterday's presentation, I think we've all seen the results and we still remain interested in better understanding the resistance profile of a two-drug regimen, given some of the methodological differences that we're seeing in patients who may have had virologic failure before week 24 that were excluded from the analysis.","I think when we think about the looking at the big picture for two-drug regimens, in particular of dolutegravir and lamivudine, we are interested in understanding what the long-term resistance profile is as highlighted by some of the recent JULUCA data that highlighted resistance development past week 48. So we'll be very interested to understand how GEMINI regimens work in the real world and are continuing to focus on its \u2013 the potency in a two-drug regimen, especially one which has viral load limitations in clinical studies.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges of Leerink. Your line is now open.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much. And I echo the congratulations, John. I'd like to be the first to volunteer over the next six months to help teach you how to prepare a resume since it's a path that you've never prepared one before.","John F. Milligan, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Don't worry. My daughter told me she's going to teach me how to set up a LinkedIn profile.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","I look forward to that. I guess the business is really stunning. It really started out in HIV and now it's come through full circle. It's really very much focused on HIV now but with just a much broader and remarkable product portfolio. So I'd like to hear you comment about what the sustainable growth rate is for the HIV business, at least through 2022 or so. You're in the transition from the legacy combinations over to the TAF-based combinations. Biktarvy is just doing fabulously well, and it's difficult for us to sort of model it exactly how that shift occurs. But what should we be thinking about the sustainable growth rate for this business and the contribution from volume, price and mix, both currently and then going forward?","John F. Milligan, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Geoff, why don't I start out with this? I mean you mentioned 2022, but we see this as a growing franchise well beyond 2022. We think that the TAF-based regimens will be the backbone of choice for patients. We think Biktarvy will be a very, very large successful product, and we see great opportunities for a number of areas to treat more patients. There still aren't all patients in the United States who are under treatment, and with the simplification, we continue to think that we can expand the number of patients who will be treated across the United States.","As Andrew mentioned, we're making great progress in our long-acting products. I think there's a significant segment of patients who aren't treated today who would choose an every-three-month option. We're very, very encouraged by the pharmaco-kinetic data we're seeing for this molecule. It is a very interesting opportunity for us to grow the field beyond the 750,000 patients treated in the United States to a much higher number. And so I see great opportunities for us to extend and expand the range of that. And I'll turn it over to Robin for her thoughts.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","I think you've covered it, John. And, Geoff, as you've seen, relative to the conversion of Descovy-based products it's been very, very good surge with over 70% in the U.S., 60% in the EU and, as John said, and Andrew and team are continuing to go forth with new innovation and new development, so we're very confident in our ability to continue to grow this franchise even through long-term LOEs. I think innovation of HIV is Gilead, and that'll stay true to what we will always, I think, excel at.","Andrew Cheng, MD, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Geoff, its Andrew. And I would just only add that when one thinks about the growth rate, one really has to factor the 250,000 to 300,000 Americans who know that they're living with HIV, yet are not receiving any form of anti-retroviral therapy. And so there are many reasons for that. But one of them is that, as I highlighted, the oral therapies may not work for where they are in their life at this point. But as we know, HIV progresses without the anti-retroviral control, and so the capsid is something we're very, very excited about given its profile.","In addition, when we think about Biktarvy, I think we \u2013 just adding some color to what we've seen to date is that we've seen Biktarvy open doors for us that really we haven't seen. Multiple examples of doctors or practices that have been closed to us for more than five years that, with the profile that we've seen with Biktarvy, no resistance as well as once daily small tablets plus well-tolerated unboosted integrase inhibitors with few drug interactions, that has really made a difference in how physicians and patients look at this compound. And we've also seen institutions create therapeutic exceptions for Biktarvy to enter their institutions because of its profile.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, great. Good afternoon. So John, congratulations to you and good luck as you take a well-deserved break. I'd like to ask a sort of product-specific question, if I could, so. And maybe this is for Andrew, but can you just comment on how you did resistance testing in your studies versus the method that they've employed in their studies? And if there are any key differences in that that may have led to sort of lack of seeing some resistant mutants if they were occurring?","Andrew Cheng, MD, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","So, Matthew, thank you for the very good question. It's a very technical one, but I think on \u2013 when it came to resistant samples, we began looking at resistant samples at week 8. And with an integrase inhibitor they've come down quite rapidly. We did not require patients to discontinue for them to be what we call a resistance analysis population, so anyone with a viral load after they suppressed of greater than 50 we put into our resistance analysis population. So we looked at them, and we used the second sample to quantify whether or not \u2013 because the first patient would come in, they had a greater than 50 viral load, then we'd proceed to get the second confirmatory sample and send that off for analysis.","John F. Milligan, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Andrew, I think it's fair to say that it's a very, very rigorous analysis to really make sure that there is no resistance.","Andrew Cheng, MD, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","No. Right, John. I think that's right, and I think we're very comfortable with the strong resistance profile of Biktarvy. And as you know, we're very close to presenting 96-week data in upcoming scientific conference.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Citi. Your line is now open.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you for taking my question, and John, I just want to echo what everyone else has said. It's been a pleasure working with you and learning from you. I guess the question I have is really around NASH. It's gone from \u2013 this is a massive market to it's not a market to, oh, now it's a market again. Maybe since you're going into the phase of hiring people and thinking about a launch, can you give us some sense on how you're thinking about what you're learning about the market as its developing? And what you're hearing from what doctors want to see in the space? And how you think it'll evolve with your data and the coming data over the next year? And then part of that would be on M&A. Do you think you have enough drugs in development? Or would you think about adding to the pipeline because there's a lot of other NASH drugs out there as well? Thanks.","John F. Milligan, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","First of all, thank you, Robyn, for those kind words and I'm not sure that I ever thought NASH wasn't a market. I think we've done a lot of digging. We've been doing a lot of early market development work-around NASH, understanding the doctors, the populations, the kinds of diagnostic tests that will be necessary across the different fibrosis scores, trying to really understand what is the best right medical way to get into this area because we're going to have to establish the market, as I think we are likely to be the first drug launched into NASH.","So I think we've got a pretty good understanding of the patients. We have a pretty good understanding of the differing opportunities for the F2 through F4 populations, so I think it has a considerable potential to be a big market for the field and for us, and so I think we're pretty confident in that area.","You asked about M&A, do we have enough molecules? I would say we never feel like we have enough molecules in any area, which is why we continue to innovate in HIV for more than two decades and why we'll continue to look for things that make sense in combination with or adjacent to our portfolio in NASH. So we're kind of relentless in that area.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Umer Raffat of Evercore. Your line is now open.","Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI","Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking my question. I wanted to focus on two things. One, for the ongoing Phase 3 NASH studies, is there an interim of sorts that we should be aware of before the final readouts, first? And then secondly, is there anything we have learned on a blinded basis from the ongoing filgotinib testicular tox studies? Thank you very much.","John G. McHutchison, AO, MD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Okay. So it's John speaking, and I'll address in terms of the Phase 3 STELLAR trials in NASH, there is no interim analysis. The interim analysis is the endpoint \u2013 one of the interim analyses is the endpoint for approval and the subpart H, which is the week 48 biopsy. The study actually continues for five years.","We do have a D&C, of course, that looks at all the safety data regularly. So if there was any obvious safety signal in the risk\/benefit change, we would know about that, and so far we've not had any recommendations to change either of those Phase 3 studies in terms of their conduct. In terms of filgotinib and the male safety study, we're enrolling the study it's something that we have to address. We believe our margin is adequate above and beyond the minor histological abnormalities that we're seeing in the pre-clinical models and we'll evaluate the data as it comes in.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from Jim Birchenough with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Nick Abbott - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good afternoon. It's Nick in for Jim and, John, I'm sure Jim will echo my comments thanking you for your candor and transparency over the years. I have a very specific question as to, relating to the Gadeta deal you did last week. Is your concept here that you're going to be adding in the gamma delta T cell receptors to CAR T or TCRs to give you that sort of bi-specific, or do you see this as a standalone or an additional product? Thank you.","John F. Milligan, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yeah, that's a great question. Nick, I think it was if we caught your name. So we believe that it is standalone. We believe that the gamma data TCR constructed or engineered into the alphabeta T cell will have all of the advantages of both, properties of both of those cells which will allow us to explore them individually in terms of both hamartiological and also solid malignancy so that's a very short answer to a very complex question but that will be our initial approach and that is the initial program that we'll collaborate on.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Phil Nadeau of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Philip Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. John, let me add my congratulations on a fantastic career that's played a big part in the success of Gilead and strides in the treatment of HIV and HCB. Definitely a job well done. Two questions, first on your pipeline there's an entry in the slides that says the KITE-585 program, we're going to have Phase 1 data in the back half of the year and also a go decision on \u2013 go\/no-go decision on a pivotal study. Can you give us some idea of what data we're likely to see and what the hurdle would be to moving it to pivotals? And if I could just sneak in a question on the commercial, briefly, Robin, I think you mentioned that the HIV payer mix was different in Q2 than in the past. What drove that and is that likely to revert to the normal payer mix in the second half of the year? Thanks.","John F. Milligan, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Okay. So Phil, its John, and I will talk about the KITE-585 program first which is in Phase 1, dose installation, as you know in people with relapse refractory myeloma. So we will see data as we've said on the slides in the second half of this year and then we will make a decision depending on how the data looks compared to the other data that's come out from other similar BCMA products and determine whether we will take it forward into Phase 2 and that's where we are right now. But we see the value in exploring it, in patients with relapsed refractory myeloma, of course. We have cohorts with people with renal impairment as well, which is also important. Many of these people have renal impairment, so we will also be looking at that as well we have a lot of support from the community we have a single-chain variable fragment that's fully humanized as you know and we have activity in low BCMA expressing targets as well so we'll have to wait and see where the Phase 1 data is and we'll make a decision later this year about moving on to the more registrational trial.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from -","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Let me just finish, operator, I think Phil asked one question regarding payer mix in HIV for Q2 that I want to be sure I address. And Phil, to be specific you're right, you recall that \u2013 if you think about our HIV franchise is typically slanted more to the government payer mix driven by the ADAPs, and that's been fairly consistent, there's always a little variability in there, but overall when you think about it, it's typically a mix of 45% commercial and 55% government. In Q2 we saw that mix more equal, i.e., 50-50, so what I was messaging is if you think about the second half of that normalizes, we quantified it to be approximately about $150 million. It's always tough to be exact because it's really based on some reimbursements and remakes that come in, you know, typically after the quarter-ends so we're always estimating, but we just wanted to be cautious and transparent that if that shifts back to what we normally see it could be a slight headwind relative to sequential growth for U.S. HIV.","Overall, robust growth year-on-year, it's simply an adjustment between quarters, but very much factored into our guidance and again, it's just a slightly larger tilt relative to that mix than we've typically seen in the past.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from Tyler Van Buren of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Tyler M. Van Buren - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hi, good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question. It sounds like, I want to ask a question on the cellular therapy business and some of the progress that has been made as of late. It sounds like you guys are pretty adequately penetrated in the center, so could you just provide an update on some of the logistics and some of the improvements that have been made as of late? And I know there's some debate over whether freezing the product is beneficial or not and paying on-demand as opposed to having to pay upfront prior to receiving the product and things like that so curious to get your thoughts, thanks.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","That was Jim?","John F. Milligan, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Tyler.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hi Tyler, maybe I'll start, but I think we can all chime in. Yeah, I mean, we overall are very excited relative to our progress of the Yescarta launch. Our centers, as I mentioned, are on track relative to our coverage. We're focused on bringing additional centers online. And similar to what you said we're really focused on improving the patient flows and just being sure that our centers are focused on our manufacturing process continuing to be excellent and we have good turnaround times.","I'd say overall that our commercial performance has been generally consistent with what we've seen in the ZUMA-1 studies, so we're very confident making good progress; remember we've talked about this being a nice, slow and steady launch. I talked in my prepared remarks about us focused on reimbursement. So overall a very good launch and tracking very good relative to expectations. Maybe I'll turn it over to John to talk about some of the other issues you mentioned.","John F. Milligan, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Tyler, I don't think \u2013 we have an exceptional group of scientists who spend a lot of time thinking about the manufacturing process and how it can be improved so the product has more active greater efficacy, safer and so forth. So as Robin said I'll just reiterate, I mean what we've seen in ZUMA-1 is what we're seeing in clinical practice as well and we are not having a lot of out of specification issues, et cetera. So in terms of freezing products or not freezing products that's not really an issue for this. Products can be frozen if the cells need to be collected and shipped and sent a long distance to somebody that's very remote. Our product could be frozen. That would take an additional day to do.","Andrew Cheng, MD, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Perfect. That's a good point, John, for example, for our European patients we will freeze the cells and send them in, so it's not our practice in the United States but it is certainly possible and we have quite a bit of experience doing that.","I think you said something about payment on-demand, I just want to reiterate that we take on the cells, we manufacture them and we only charge the patient if that patient gets those cells. So if something happens in the interim, for example, the patient expires then there is no charge to the family.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Cory Kasimov of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question, let me also add my congratulations to John on a great run. You'll definitely be missed.","Want to follow up on the CAR T front, although it's obviously very early in the launch. Curious about any comments or color you can provide in terms of safety, CRS or neurotox rates that you're seeing in kind of the real-world experience relative to what you saw in the clinical trials. And I'm curious more specifically on whether in the commercial setting these rates have changed at all or been appreciably different for patients based on the receipt of bridging chemotherapy.","John G. McHutchison, AO, MD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Cory, it's John McHutchison and we actually have scientific advisory board here, all of our Kite development docs were here and we were talking about this and I actually asked them this specific question as to whether they're seeing anything different with the commercial products and so forth and there isn't a difference.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Katherine Xu of William Blair & Company. Your line is now open.","Yu Katherine Xu - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi, good afternoon. And John, my congratulations to you as well for great achievements at Gilead and also all the best to you on the next phase of career\/life.","I have a very quick question on the HCV side. So the international sales have been growing. I just want to understand where that growth has come from and how the launch in China is going. And also on the HBV front, B as in boy, what is Gilead's grand strategy there? Thank you.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","So maybe, Katherine, I'll take the HCV question. Yeah. You know, we're excited. Epclusa was recently approved in China. I think it's still very early days there, but we're excited about the possibilities outside of Europe and the U.S. We've got also international sales in Japan, Canada, Australia, as well as several countries in Asia and while there are quarterly fluctuations from country to country, I think overall we continue to establish ourselves in those markets, similar to what we have done in the U.S. and Europe.","So as you can see, overall we're on track with our guidance, more stability and predictability, and I think with Epclusa, right, which is the only pan-genotypic pan type (01:00:05) product single-tablet regimen out there, I think we're well poised with our portfolio of products to be successful globally with our HCV franchise.","John G. McHutchison, AO, MD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yeah. Katherine, it's John again, and just to follow up from Robin, before I answer the hepatitis B strategy question, Epclusa is the simplest regimen to use. It's one duration, as Robin said. You don't need a liver biopsy, you don't need a genotype. So in terms of all the products out there, it's far simpler. And the efficacy is the same as some of the others, as you know. So there's no compromise there.","In terms of the grand strategy for hepatitis B, I think it's similar to your notes. We want to be able to attack multiple different mechanisms of viral replication, and we want to be able to augment HBV specific immunity. We have two new programs in the clinic. One is the TLR8 molecule. And the other one is our capsid, also that's in early stages in the clinic.","We have now SB92 \u2013 Spring Bank 9200 collaboration in two Phase 2 trials, one with tenofovir and one with TAF. We have many free clinical programs looking at other mechanisms of action also in both of those axises. And of course we have Vemlidy, which is approved and doesn't have any issues with bone or kidneys, as you know, in more than 50 countries.","So it's one of our largest internal research programs and we're passionate about trying to create a finite cure for many people, the many millions of people with hepatitis B around the world.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Ying Huang of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. One for maybe Robin. You actually saw a very decent increase in Q2 revenue compared to 1Q, but you did not increase the guidance for the total product sales for the whole year. I want to drill down more on why that is.","And then secondly, and maybe for John McHutchison, you mentioned that the filing of FDA application for filgotinib had to wait until you finish the safety study in the UC trial which won't complete enrollment until first half 2019. Does that mean we have to wait until at least second half of next year before you can file for NDA for filgotinib? Thank you.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Sure, Ying. So I'll start. Again, as I mentioned on the call, I think our HIV franchise is firing on all cylinders. It's positioned extremely well to deliver on long-term growth. And when I think about guidance, again, we reiterated our guidance and feel very comfortable with it. But as I mentioned on the call, we do anticipate second half dynamics to be slightly different. So there's nothing new about those dynamics, but we did want to ensure that, you know, that you understood for modeling purposes kind of some of those components.","And then, as I said for HIV in the U.S., we may have payer mix shift more to what normally occurs. But other than that, things are very good there. We do have the patent for Letairis in the U.S. which expires at the end of July, so we do anticipate some impact from generics for that product in the U.S.","Turning to Europe, generics are available, and we do expect them to become available in a few additional countries. And we have the normal third quarter seasonality in Europe related to summer holidays, and that impacts both our HIV as well as our HCV franchise. And we also have the slow, steady decline of HCV patient starts. So I do want to emphasize that we expect our U.S. HIV prescription growth and revenue growth on a year-on-year basis that continue to be very, very healthy and robust, but we're reiterating our guidance because all those factors that we talked about at the beginning of the year still remain.","John G. McHutchison, AO, MD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Ying, for the second part of the question in terms of the filgotinib filing time, obviously we'll file as expeditiously as we can. But just let me make three points. First of all, we need safety and efficacy data from three randomized Phase 3 trials and that has to be supportive.","Secondly, we need, and as I said today on the prepared comments, we need an adequate safety database in terms of exposure at each stage both for a predetermined range of time. And thirdly, we need to submit data from the male safety study, which is enrolling. And, you know, these are tough studies to do. You've got to have men with ulcerative colitis and they have to be on the drug for six months and have multiple sperm collections. So we're doing everything we can to enhance enrollment and we will announce the details when it's appropriate in terms of the filing time.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Sung Lee for any closing remarks.","Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thank you, Candice, and thank you all for joining us today.

My name is Jonathan. I will be your conference operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Sung Lee, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Sung Lee","Thank you, Jonathan, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market closed today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the fourth quarter 2018. The press release and detailed slides are available on the Investor Relations section of the Gilead website.","The speakers on today\u2019s call will be: Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Hamill, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Commercial Operations; and John McHutchison, Chief Scientific Officer and Head of Research and Development; also in the room is Gregg Alton, Interim CEO and Chief Patient Officer.","Before we begin with our prepared comments, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, financial projections and the use of capital, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in our latest SEC disclosure documents and recent press releases.","In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the Company\u2019s underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release as well as on the Gilead website.","I will now turn the call over to Robin.","Robin Washington","Thank you, Sung, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to share our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 and provide 2019 guidance. I will first review financials followed by comments from Laura and John. 2018 was a year filled with accomplishments where we met our financial and operational goals. Beginning with our HIV franchise, we extended our leadership position and grew the business to an all-time high in product revenue.","We continue to execute and maximize our opportunity in HCV and initiated a plan to launch authorized generics this year, which should keep us very competitive in a durable long-term market. In cell therapy, we made tremendous progress in the number of centers authorized, and saw the steady and measured adoption of Yescarta in the U.S. and the approval of Yescarta in Europe. We advanced our pipeline and finished the year with a strong balance sheet that will enable us to continue to execute on M&A and partnerships to drive future growth.","Turning to the financials. Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $5.8 billion, with non-GAAP earnings of $1.44. This compares to revenue of $5.9 billion with non-GAAP earnings of $1.78 per share for the same period last year. For the full year 2018, total revenues were $22.1 billion, down 15% year-over-year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings were $6.67 per share for the year, down from $8.84 per share for the full year 2017.","The full year 2018 GAAP diluted earnings of $4.17 per share included an unfavorable impact of $0.98 per share due to an impairment charge for in-processed research and development for the KITE-585 anti-BCMA program for the treatment of multiple myeloma and a non-cash tax charge related to intangible assets acquired from Kite.","Now turning to our product sales. Product sales for the fourth quarter were $5.7 billion, up 4% sequentially and down 3% year-over-year. For the full year, product sales were $21.7 billion, down 16% year-over-year driven by lower HCV sales. In the U.S., product sales for the quarter were $4.5 billion, up 8% sequentially and 8% year-over-year. This marks the first quarter in several years where U.S. product sales grew year-over-year as the revenue growth of our HIV franchise more than offset the market dynamics of our HCV franchise.","While demand, particularly for Biktarvy and Truvada for prep, was a driver of sequential growth, the quarter also benefited from seasonal inventory purchases and a favorable payer mix. These two factors contributed an estimated incremental $250 million to the sequential performance. In Europe, product sales for the quarter were $813 million, down 7% sequentially and 29% year-over-year. The sequential and year-over-year declines were anticipated and included the full quarter impact and launch of generic HIV products in certain markets, as well as an accounting adjustment related to statutory revenue call back reserves.","Now turning to the expenses for the full year 2018. Non-GAAP cost of goods sold were $300.6 billion, up 5% compared to $3.4 billion in 2017. The increase was caused by a $410 million reserve on unfavorable $0.31 EPS impact, primarily for excess Harvoni inventory due to a shift in demand to Epclusa.","Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $3.5 billion and non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $3.6 billion, both expense categories increased by 7% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to a full year of investments to support the growth of our business following the acquisition of Kite. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the full year 2018 decreased to 19.8% compared to 24.5% in the same period last year, primarily due to reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate as a result of tax reform, and the favorable impact of a tax settlement.","Turning to the balance sheet. We generated $8.4 billion in cash from operations for the full year 2018, and $2.3 billion for the quarter. We ended the year with $31.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents. During 2018, we repaid $6.3 billion of debt, the majority of which was related to our acquisition of Kite, and paid cash dividends of $3 billion. In 2018, we repurchased 40 million shares for $2.9 billion. In Q4, we made opportunistically purchases of approximately 14 million shares for $962 million, resulting in a reduction of diluted shares outstanding at year-end.","Earlier today, we announced an 11% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.57 to $0.63 per share, which will become effective in the first quarter of 2019. This represents the fourth consecutive year of double-digit increases to the dividend and underscores our confidence in the strength of the business and future cash flows. In 2019, our capital allocation priorities will remain the same with a focus on M&A and partnerships to augment our pipeline, followed by dividends and share repurchases.","Before I provide details for our full year 2019 guidance, I would like to highlight aspects of 2018 performance as illustrated on Slide 20, which will impact the anticipated level of product revenue growth in 2019 relative to 2018. In October, during our Q3 earnings announcement, we increased our 2018 full year product revenue guidance due to two unanticipated events. Our second half 2018 revenues did not reflect the entry of a generic version of Letairis in the U.S., as expected when we issued our original guidance at the beginning of 2018.","Secondly, we saw the entry of generic versions of our HIV products occurred later in certain ex-U.S. countries than we had originally expected. It is important to keep these events in mind as our 2019 revenue performance unfold as they will have an impact on the level of product revenue growth in the year.","Turning to guidance. Our 2019 non-GAAP financial guidance is summarized on Slides 19 through 23 in the earnings presentation available on our corporate website. Product sales are expected to be in the range of $21.3 billion to $21.8 billion. This guidance is subject to a number of uncertainties, including slower than anticipated growth in our HIV franchise in larger than anticipated shifting payer mix to more highly discounted payer segment such as PHS, SSS, Medicaid and the VA.","Lower than expected market share and greater price erosion resulting from the sale of generic versions of TDF, the fixed dose combination of FTC, TDF and the fixed dose combination of FTC, TDF, efavirenz. The accuracy of our assumptions about HCV market share, the accuracy of our estimates for HCV patients starts in 2019, unanticipated pricing pressures from payers and competitors, as well as volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, which could be plus or minus $300 million for each 10% change relative to our assumptions.","Non-GAAP product gross margins are expected to be in the range of 85% to 87%. We expect our non-GAAP R&D expenses to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses are expected to be in the range of $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion, and include investments to prepare for commercial launches in NASH and inflammation. For the full year, our non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 20% to 21%.","We anticipate the full year diluted EPS impact of acquisition-related stock-based compensation and other expenses to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.50 per share. As we look towards Q1 2019, we anticipate total Gilead product sales will decline sequentially by a percentage similar to what we\u2019ve seen over the past two years, which was in the range of 12% to 14%, primarily driven by the U.S. seasonal inventory patterns and buying patterns of public payers that negatively impact payer mix.","Also a factor into the Q1 sequential decline as a step-down in price for our HCV drugs sold into U.S. Medicare. Despite this anticipated sequential decline in total product sales in Q1, I want to underscore our confidence in the health of our worldwide HIV business, from which we expect double-digit year-on-year growth again in 2019.","I would now turn the call over to Laura.","Laura Hamill","Thank you, Robin. Good afternoon, everyone. I will provide an update on our commercial performance during the fourth quarter, and here are some highlights from markets around the world. Beginning with HIV, we achieved an all-time high in quarterly revenues. This speaks to the appeal of our Descovy-based regimen led by Biktarvy, the growing use of Truvada for PrEP and our ability to execute commercially.","In the U.S., total HIV revenue was $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up 30% year-over-year and 13% quarter-over-quarter. Year-over-year growth was driven by a 13% increase to prescription and also benefited from an inventory purchases and favorable payer mix mentioned earlier by Robin. We continue to see strong adoption of Descovy-based regimens, which accounted for 77% of Gilead\u2019s total U.S. HIV prescription volume as we ended the fourth quarter.","This is a remarkable achievement considering the first Descovy-based regimen was introduced just three years ago. Through its first 11 months, Biktarvy remains the best HIV launch of all time in the U.S. as measured by total prescriptions on a launch-aligned basis. During the fourth quarter, Biktarvy generated $551 million in revenue in the U.S. and is the number one prescribed regimen for both treatment-na\u00efve and switch patients. Approximately 80% of Biktarvy\u2019s U.S. prescriptions came from switches, 25% of these switches from dolutegravir and another 25% coming from Genvoya. This is a testament to the profile of Biktarvy, its strong efficacy and no identified cases of treatment emergent resistance at week 96 in our Phase 3 studies.","Biktarvy provides the renal and bone safety advantages offered by Descovy backbone with minimal drug to drug interactions. These are important considerations for an aging HIV population and for younger patients on lifelong treatment.","Moving to prevention. Truvada for PrEP continues to grow as we invest in the U.S. to raise awareness among at-risk individuals and treating physicians. We estimate that approximately 202,000 people were taking Truvada for PrEP at the end of the fourth quarter in 2008. We initiated two direct consumer campaigns in mid-2008, and have dedicated team of therapeutic specialist focused on Truvada for PrEP. Additionally, we have a number of commercial programs aimed at helping populations, disproportionately impacted by HIV, where utilization of Truvada for PrEP is low. While these investments has helped increase awareness, there is still so much more we can do. The CDC estimates that 1.1 million people in the U.S. could benefit from PrEP.","Now turning to Europe. Total HIV revenue was $511 million in the fourth quarter, down 21% year-over-year and down 13% quarter-over-quarter. This decline was driven by the expected availability of generics across all major EU countries. During 2018, we experienced slower erosion of the HIV franchise due to later generic entry in a few countries, while at the same time, we saw rapid uptake of our Descovy-based products, which accounted for more than 80% of our total HIV revenue in Europe for the fourth quarter.","We are encouraged by the strong uptake of Biktarvy in Germany and in France. In Germany, Biktarvy was number one prescribed regimen for both treatment-na\u00efve and switch patients during the fourth quarter. And in France, just six weeks after launch, Biktarvy was among the top five regiments for switch patients. We anticipate by mid-year, Biktarvy will also launch in Spain, Italy and the UK. Once Biktarvy is broadly reimbursed and entrenched in the market, we believe our European HIV business will stabilize and return to growth.","Now, turning to HCV. Product sales for the fourth quarter were $738 million, down 51% year-over-year and 18% quarter-over-quarter, in line with the guidance we provided in 2018. As previously announced, authorized generic version of Epclusa and Harvoni have become available in the U.S. this quarter through Asegua Therapeutics LLC, a separate subsidiary. We expect to see a positive impact on sharing Medicaid markets during the second half of 2019. Over the long-term, we anticipate the adoption of these authorized generics will allow us to be more competitive in a rapidly growing Medicaid segment.","In 2018, we launched a new direct-to-consumer campaign highlighting Epclusa as a pan-genotypic, pan-fibrotic single-tablet regimen. Epclusa has the right profile to address the broadest population in HCV. As a leading liver company, we remain fully committed to serving patients with HCV, contributing to the elimination of the disease and competing with a great deal of confidence based on the profiles of our HCV products.","Turning to Yescarta. We are building on the momentum generated by the two year real world data presented at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting. This year, we expect to steadily and measurably progress in the U.S. and in Europe and potentially see a doubling of our revenue for Yescarta Carta, as centers gain experience and community oncologist become increasingly aware of this life saving therapy. We now have 68 centers in the U.S. certified to provide treatment with Yescarta.","In Europe, we are encouraged by the early stages of our launch. We have treated commercial patients in the UK and in Germany and we have activated sites in France. In total, we have authorized 12 centers and look forward to additional centers coming online this quarter. We are pleased with the engagement of countries across EU markets, wanting to rapidly offer Yescarta.","Finally, our U.S. cardiopulmonary team continues to deliver impressive results. Letairis and Ranexa revenue totaled $431 million for the quarter. We did not see any generic competition for Letairis in the fourth quarter. We currently anticipate the entry of generics in the second quarter of 2019. We began the year from a position of strength. I would like to thank the teams around the world for their incredible efforts. With a continued focus on our outstanding portfolio of products and operational excellence, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our 2019 goals.","Now, I will turn the call over to John.","John McHutchison","Thank you, Laura, and thank you everyone for joining us today. As you know, this is a very exciting time for Gilead\u2019s R&D organization. We anticipate readouts from five Phase 3 clinical trials in the first half of this year. I will talk briefly about those studies, provide an update on our cell therapy and oncology programs and then close with some thoughts on 2019.","We expect upcoming readouts of STELLAR 3 and STELLAR 4, our ongoing Phase 3 trials, evaluating selonsertib, an ASK1 inhibitor in patients with advanced fibrosis, future NASH. It\u2019s supported by the data, we expect to file for regulatory approvals in the second half of this year. In addition, we continue to advance multiple other investigational compounds in NASH as both single agents and as combination therapies.","We anticipate ATLAS, our Phase 2b study of various two-drug combinations or regimens in patients with NASH and advanced fibrosis to readout in the fourth quarter. As we continue to do to build our pipeline in NASH, I would like to highlight tow other recent preclinical agreement. Last month, we announced the collaboration and license agreement with Wuhan to co-develop novel treatments for patients with advanced fibrosis, future NASH that will complement our other internal programs. In December, we also entered into another collaboration with Scholar Rock to discover and develop highly specific inhibitors of TGF\u03b2 activation. We will work with Scholar Rock to investigate this novel approach directed towards one of the core pathways driving fibrotic diseases including NASH and diabetic kidney disease.","Now turning to inflammation. This quarter, we expect results from FINCH 1 and FINCH 3, two Phase 3 studies of our selective JAK1 inhibitor full governed in rheumatoid arthritis. As you may recall, last year we announced from FINCH 2, the first of our Phase 3 study to readout. Those results demonstrated that they\u2019ll get in a bit all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints and it difficult to treat group of patients. Now as supported by data, we expect to be able to then progress the filgotinib rheumatoid arthritis indication filings for regulatory approvals globally.","In the U.S., our ability to file the NDA is the dependent on data from the MANTA study, a safety study in men with ulcerative colitis. This was requested by the FDA and is designed to address non-clinical findings observed in preclinical animal studies. The FDA recently allowed us to expand the inclusion criteria, which is enabled us to enhance enrollment. We will continue to evaluate our progress and options to advance timelines. Once we have the Phase 3 data from 3 FINCH studies in hand, we will initiate and request further interactions with the FDA and other regulatory groups worldwide. We will then be able to provide greater clarity as to filing timelines in the U.S.","Moving to HIV. In the coming months, we anticipate the results from the DISCOVER trial, a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind study of more than 5,000 people, evaluating whether Descovy is as safe and as effective as Truvada at reducing the risk of HIV infection, when used as PrEP or pre-exposure prophylaxis. The trial speaks to our ongoing commitment to people at risk of HIV infection and those living with HIV, where our goal is to continue to lead and drive innovation across the spectrum of care from prevention to treatment to hopefully one-day a cure.","And finally, I\u2019d like to make a few comments on cell therapy. Our investment in cell therapy is and always has been an investment in the future. Similar to what we\u2019ve done in other areas, historically, we are committed to leading with cutting edge science that one-day creates a path to a cure.","Last December, the American Society of Hematology annual meeting, we presented a number of significant updates. The two-year safety and efficacy ZUMA-1 data presented at the meeting and simultaneously published in Lancet oncology, showed an unprecedented plateau in duration of response and overall survival in patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma. After a single infusion of Yescarta with a minimum follow-up of two years, more than half of the patients were still alive and nearly 40% of patients had an ongoing response.","The two-year point is a major milestone for Yescarta. This is the longest duration of follow-up of any registrational clinical cell therapy study, and the results set the bar, reinforcing our leadership in cell therapy. Also at the ASH meeting, there were numerous presentations highlighting real world Yescarta data from centers outside of the clinical trial setting. It was encouraging to see similar 30-day efficacy and safety data in this setting, despite sicker patients compared with ZUMA-1 as well as the consistent manufacturing performance and product turnaround time.","Finally for Yescarta, we are moving forward in earlier lines of therapy in large B-cell lymphoma and several new indications for other B-cell malignancies, as part of our broader registrational plan. This year, we will also continue several studies aimed and investigating strategies to further improve the safety and the efficacy of Yescarta.","More broadly now in cell therapy, we\u2019re advancing an allogeneic platform to IND this year. Progressing different cell therapy approaches in multiple solid tumors with next generation technologies and leveraging our best-in-class cell therapy manufacturing. We will also continue to pursue scientific collaborations that will help us achieve these goals when they make sense.","With regard to our other oncology programs, during the fourth quarter, we announced a global collaboration with Tango Therapeutics to discover, develop, and commercialize a pipeline of innovative, targeted immuno-oncology treatments for patients with cancer. Our collaboration will combine Tango\u2019s CRISPR based discovery technology alongside Gilead\u2019s drug discovery and development capabilities.","We also recently entered into a partnership with Agenus, focused on the development and commercialization of up to five novel immuno-oncology therapies, three of which are expected to be in the clinic in 2019. We believe these novel approaches can augment the impressive benefits that have been seen with checkpoint inhibition in a variety of cancers.","Last quarter, we disclose an initial patent outlining some of our exciting preclinical work related to our small molecule PD-L1 program. To that end, we have now initiated a Phase 1 study of GS-4224 in healthy volunteers. I\u2019m confident we will continue to make significant progress in 2019. I want to close by highlighting several key areas for Gilead this year. We are focused on returning to growth in terms of product sales and confident this can be achieved with our operational excellence, a strong in growing HIV franchise, and stabilizing hepatitis C market.","As I\u2019ve just shared on the R&D side, we continue to make excellent progress with our pipeline and we\u2019re looking forward to the readouts of the five Phase 3 studies as I described today. With regard to cell therapy, we will maintain our position of leadership as we continue to reach more patients with Yescarta and advance the next generations of cell therapy. And finally, we are in a position of financial strength, which gives us the flexibility to execute on M&A and partnerships to augment our pipeline.","On behalf of the entire organization, we look forward to welcoming Dan O\u2019Day to Gilead next month, as our new Chairman and CEO.","In closing, I would like to thank our 11,000 employees around the world. It\u2019s your commitment and dedication that have made us successful and will continue to make us successful in 2019 and into the future.","So let\u2019s now open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Your question, please.","Geoff Meacham","Good afternoon guys, thanks so much for the question. John, I want to continue to the thought on BG and looking at the step-up in 2018 that you guys had. It\u2019s mostly on early to mid-stage assets. So the question is, one, does this change Gilead\u2019s appetite for later stage deals? And two, what\u2019s the appetite for an expansion beyond your core therapeutic areas? And I realize the answers like to change after Dan gives a more detailed review of the business. Thanks.","Robin Washington","Hi Geoff. It\u2019s Robin, why don\u2019t I start. I\u2019d say again, the high bar and criteria for us when it comes to M&A or scientific differentiation, I think you\u2019re right to state that we\u2019re primarily focused on our existing therapeutic areas. While these have been small deals, I think we\u2019ve continued to look for deals with commercial assets as well as later stage pipeline deals as well. But they happen when they happen. So as you can see, we\u2019ve been very active. We\u2019ve been even more active at the second half of the year and we\u2019ll continue to focus in this area as Dan joins us.","John McHutchison","And Geoff, it\u2019s John and I\u2019ll just add onto what Robin has said. Also, we have looked at many other things as well over the last year and we\u2019ll continue to do so. And it is driven by the science and it is driven by the opportunity and the importance and the impact that we\u2019ll have on certain diseases. So we will look at life and earlier stage opportunities as they come forward, but as Robin said, the late-stage opportunities are few and far between.","Geoff Meacham","Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from Jefferies. Your question, please.","Michael Yee","Thanks for the question. I guess my question is, although Dan hasn\u2019t come onboard yet, I mean, what do you think and investors should anticipate or should expect through the course of the year, is that him just trying to get onboard familiar with everything and that could take a year? Do you think that he void or management and the board anticipate urgency to put the balance sheet to work? When yes, what should investors expect through 2019 as it relates to Dan coming onboard? Thanks.","Gregg Alton","Sure, this is Gregg Alton, I\u2019ll take this question. I think it\u2019s neither of the scenarios that you laid out there. I think that Dan will come onboard March 1, as you know. I think he will be patient. He\u2019s going to take his time to get to know the company, spend more time with the management team, fits in our strategy. Certainly, he will \u2013 then I think he\u2019ll put his own mark on what \u2013 where he wants to take the company. I wouldn\u2019t expect it to take up a year, but I think he will be patient and I think he\u2019s going to be thoughtful and make sure that he\u2019s really understanding what we\u2019re doing.","Michael Yee","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams from RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please.","Brian Abrahams","Hi. Thanks very much for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. How should we be thinking about your 2019 guidance for HIV with respect to contribution from volume versus price? And then along those lines for the longer term, there\u2019s been some discussion around CMS practices shifting for protected classes. Can you talk a little bit about the impact that you foresee elements like formulary management or prior authorizations potentially having on clinical practice in HIV and on potential future revenues for the franchise? Thanks.","Robin Washington","Hi, Brian. It\u2019s Robin. Maybe I\u2019ll take the first part of your question. And then turn it over to Gregg. So thank you for calling out both those parameters. I mean, keep in mind that volume is a major driver of growth for our business and that will be the case in 2019. For our HIV business, we have taken price increases in the U.S. in the past, but keep in mind that the net effect of them has been limited because the majority of our volume goes through public channels. For instance, ADAP has not had a price increase in since 2008. And that\u2019s part of our U.S. business.","In Europe, as you know, we actually take price decreases. So the net result on a worldwide basis is really a low single-digit price benefit when we think about any price increases. For this year, as you can \u2013 appreciate due to competitive reasons, we\u2019re not going to mention, if we aren\u2019t taking price increases at this point in time. Recall back mid-year, we announce no price increases for six months, but any thinking that we do have around price increases as currently reflected in our guidance. And I\u2019d say that, we\u2019ve aware and continue to be aware of the climate out there and we\u2019ve always had a very sensible approach to how we think about pricing.","Gregg Alton","And so if I can just jump in on the second part of the question relating to the proposal by CMS on the protected classes, as you\u2019re all aware of Gilead has been on the forefront of innovation in HIV for 30 years now. Bringing our products for treatment and prevention that improved potency, safety, tolerability, simplicity and the protected classes has been a very important component to ensure that patients have access to that and then physicians are free to prescribe what\u2019s best for their patients. And the reason for the protected classes, as many of you know is, these are disease or six disease areas where the products really are not interchangeable and they really need to be the right patient \u2013 right for the patients. This is allowed patients, individuals to do very well with HIV, but also allows us to have a very good public health response to HIV on reducing new infections.","We believe that any challenges to the protected class, particularly the prior authorization or step therapy would be a significant step backwards in these efforts. We also share this with a lot of the other therapeutic areas that are impacted by the protected classes. So we are in constant discusses with them. This is the number one public policy initiative by Gilead is ensuring that people understand the importance of protected classes. We\u2019re very engaged with the administration at CMS, HHS, as well as the Senate and Congress. So we are ensuring that we\u2019re very vocal. There were also very closely tied with the patient groups and the physician groups, who care very much about this issue.","So this is the first time, this has come up, but we take this very seriously, and we are making sure that the message is very strong, that this would be a step backwards. And we also don\u2019t see significant cost savings to our health system from doing this, and potentially a long-term step back in terms of what we\u2019ve accomplished.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges from Leerink. Your question, please.","Geoffrey Porges","Thank you very much for taking the question and for the information provided in the call. Robin, could you talk us through the increase in SG&A specifically? It\u2019s about a 10% increase compared to where you are this year. It\u2019s about $500 million above what the rate was expecting. Could you talk us through where the incremental $500 million is going and what\u2019s the total possible with \u2013 presume you went through everything else you were spending on previously and couldn\u2019t find any way to reduce in other areas. Thanks.","Robin Washington","Yes. Thanks for the question, Geoff. Let me first talk about the sequential increase that was driven by a one-time grant. So I wouldn\u2019t take Q4 and assume that\u2019s the run rate, right? I mean, during the second half of the year to your specific question, we have included incremental expenses focused on our new emerging therapeutic area launches, in particular, NASH and inflammation.","We\u2019ve also included some incremental expense to our cell therapy ramp. As you know, we\u2019re continuing to build outside of the U.S. in that area as well. So those are some of the primary drivers. The kind of the smaller drivers include just some geographic expansion. If you saw from our guidance, we\u2019re expected to have HIV revenue in Japan next year, so there\u2019s some investment that we\u2019re waiting there. We also continued to get products approved in China, so that\u2019s an area of focus.","So yes, there is a second half ramp in our expenses to support those very new launchers. I would say, Geoff, to your point, have we thought about trade-offs? Yes, we have. I would say, particularly, for NASH, we haven\u2019t maybe work and can comment on this as well, we do believe continuing to stay focused on our hep C franchise in a much more competitive environment is the way to go. So there are some incremental expenses that we hadn\u2019t initially thought about associated with NASH, but we\u2019ve appropriately included in our guidance.","Laura Hamill","Yes, thanks, Robin just first half covering it. For HCV, we believe not only from a field force perspective that we wanted be fully focused around the world, but also in terms of reaching consumers in the United States as a very strong focus. And external and outside of the United States, there is a number of initiatives to really help with elimination in conjunction with the government, and we\u2019re committed to that. So I think that\u2019s really what we were contemplating with positive where we have an opportunity to join forces, we believe that we should keep those separate and continue to focus on them as individual very important products uniquely.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.","Matthew Harrison","Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. John, I have one for you, specifically on the NASH study. Can you talk a little bit about how you tower those studies? I know you\u2019ve talked in the past that 20% delta is clinically meaningful, I wonder if you could comment if you achieved the delta below that? If the studies could still be statistically successful and how you might look at the result like that? Thanks.","John McHutchison","Thank you, Matthew. We\u2019re excited about the NASH readouts from STELLAR 3 and STELLAR 4. We have 1,600 patients with bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis. So those results due to imminently readout this quarter, so we are looking for the \u2013 to answer your question, we are looking for a significant increase over placebo response rate, which we believe we can calculate accurately from our previous trials, and we believe that we would like to show a 10% to 15% increase or a doubling of response rates over placebo, to have a meaningful effect in a group of people that have a high likelihood of disease progressing to transplant, et cetera.","So without getting into all the details about the numbers, this would be our first step forward for patients with advanced fibrosis towards NASH, and a meaningful improvement if we could allow one in five of them to prevent progression of the disease to transplant the compensation, et cetera, we believe that will be meaningful clinically, statistically and otherwise.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Citi. Your question please.","Robyn Karnauskas","Hi guys, thanks for the question and congratulations on all the progress. My question is on PrEP. Can you talk about 200,000 on PrEP and by our math that could be around $2 billion worth of sales coming from PrEP I don\u2019t know the trade, but my question is more about their data other thing this could be a 1 million to 2 million, 3 million people that ideally could benefit from PrEP. How are you thinking about getting that \u2013 getting Descovy enhance of those people? What is the argument you would make to make sure those patients go on PrEP?","And do you think \u2013 my question is more about a lot of people are young, so how are you going to make that argument and where do you think PrEP could go and what\u2019s going to benefit from DTG, very long question, sorry.","Laura Hamill","Yes. So how about if I take the conversion question and on the clinical study, I\u2019m going to leave that up to John. So this is Laura. Thank you, Robyn for the question. So as it relates to PrEP, as I mentioned earlier, I mean, the United States has 1.1 million people that the CDC estimates that could benefit from PrEP. And we really believe there\u2019s a lot more to do. There\u2019s a lot of populations that are affected that just don\u2019t have the awareness that they really need to protect themselves.","So not only do we have a dedicated field force, but we have a lot of community individuals that have come from non-profits that are very much committed to helping these communities, and we are leading into these communities to try to raise awareness. In addition, we\u2019ve actually put a significant amount of additional funding behind both Biktarvy and Truvada for PrEP in 2019, because we believe that\u2019s very important thing to do.","Now to answer your question about the conversion from TDF based regimen to TAF based regimen or Descovy-based regimen. Obviously, the clinical trial results I\u2019ll let John talk to. But what I would say is when we look at the treatment market, as I mentioned in the U.S., we\u2019re at 77% of prescription, total prescription, now in Descovy-based backbone and in Europe, we\u2019re at 80%. And we believe that the benefits that accrue to a patient for HIV are the same benefits that we need to have for a patient at risk that its being treated for PrEP.","Some of the duration of therapy is longer than we would \u2013 you may anticipate, so these otherwise, healthy individuals want to have a normal, healthy life and the Descovy-based regimen really lens splints for that to be a great treatment option. Then turn over to John on the study.","John McHutchison","So Robyn, the safety advantages of taking a test-phase backbone has this been the case and seen in the conversion rates for the HIV-infected individual will apply equally to the at-risk individual who\u2019s taking medication for PrEP. So we\u2019ll be able to show in the study with over 5,000 patients that they are differences, I presume, in terms of safety, kidney and bone. And because of the young age and the longevity in terms of taking medicines to prevent HIV infection, the same principles apply suggested somebody who is infected already.","So another way of saying what Laura has already said, and hopefully, the study will lead this down. The answers to that question, we are creating that in the coming month.","Operator","Thank you. Our next comes from the line of Alethia Young from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question please.","Alethia Young","Hey guys, thank for taking my question. I was just asking about the MANTA study, I just want to clarify maybe one thing. Is that may for like a label or is it really need actually for at the filing package. And then just can you update with a little bit more precision on how does initiative that played out at the enrollment timeline? Thanks.","John McHutchison","Thanks, Alethia, and thank you for your question on MANTA. Before I go into at an answer that, so let me further I really do appreciate everybody\u2019s interest in the program. It\u2019s a somewhat different situation than we found ourselves in before and the day that we generating in the Phase 3 trials will provide me with a lot more, and our team, with a lot more details that will allow us to be able to answer your questions with greater clarity regarding the timelines.","So we have had a pickup in enrollment, Alethia, since we\u2019ve made the modifications to the programs. And as I said today really, I think we don\u2019t need it for labeling necessary, but it would give clarity as to whether there\u2019s any risk associated with male infertility and so forth because it\u2019s a male safety study. So it\u2019s not required, but it\u2019s, obviously, advantageous for us to have it in all of those respects.","As I said to you, this is an issue that we \u2013 we\u2019re really addressing an FDA issue of a non-clinical filing that we observed in the preclinical animal studies. We\u2019ve seen a pickup in enrollment, I don\u2019t want to get into specifics about the numbers, but there has been a significant pickup in enrollment. And I\u2019ll keep watching, and we will keep watching that process very carefully to advance our timeline.","So once we have the data from the three Phase 3 FINCH trials, we will be able to initiate further interactions, discuss the MANTA study and its progress more and then be able to provide you with the greater clarity.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Your question, please.","Umer Raffat","Hi, thank you so much for taking my question. I have one for Robin and one quick clarification on something John said. So Robin, there was an expectation among investors based on a lot of the comments you shared and the rest of the management shared at the January conference that 2018 was a trough and 2019 should be a growth year in product sales. But judging by guidance, at least, it doesn\u2019t quite look like that. Can you please go over that? And also particularly curious about Hep C because it looks like versus 4Q run rate, there isn\u2019t a whole lot erosion modeled into it? And John, just to clarify, something you mentioned about NASH earlier, is there a hierarchal analysis for the low-dose versus high-dose in the readout or is the p-value being split? Thank you very much.","Robin Washington","So, Umer, let me start with your question on guidance. And so I just want to reiterate, as I\u2019ve said, your conference, we are very focused on returning the growth in 2019, and really believe that\u2019s achievable if you look at the strength of our HIV franchise. As I said we expect double-digit year-on-year growth, stabilizing trends in our HCV business, as well as the momentum of our cell therapy franchise where as you saw, we expected to practically double this year. I think the other thing we\u2019ve tried to do is to be very transparent in our 2019 guidance of outlining those unplanned factors in 2018 that definitely will impact growth or the level of growth that we expect in 2019.","The other thing I want to point is just our philosophy around setting guidance at the beginning of the year. It remains pretty consistent with how we\u2019ve done in prior years, and it includes all the uncertainties that you could expect that could impact our franchises. I mentioned several on the call and just take FX, that alone, volatility could have a, plus or minus, $300 million impact. So yes, the guidance, particularly, our first guidance of the year, that includes downside risk, and we\u2019re going to monitor those and manage them throughout the year. But our conviction as well as our confidence around returning to net product revenue growth is very, very strong, and we\u2019re going to look forward to updating you throughout the year as activities progress across our franchises.","John McHutchison","In regard to your second question, it\u2019s John. We took two doses into the Phase 3 trials, a, because we had target engagement of both doses in terms of immunohistochemistry. We also allowed ourselves to have another chance in terms of the safety profile that might be potentially differentiated that lower or higher doses, those were the two reasons for taking two doses forward into Phase 3. And without getting into all the details of the statistical analysis plan, we will be able to compare both doses to placebo in terms of the primary endpoint.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Your question, please.","Cory Kasimov","Hey, good afternoon guys. Thank you for taking my question. Wanted to ask on the cell therapy side of things. Can you talk about the source of your confidence in the projected growth for Yescarta in 2019? I believe you said it\u2019s up $200 million, given there\u2019s only $6 million of sequential growth in 3Q and 4Q. And along these lines, I think you previously guided to having more centers online for the product. In Europe, by the end of 2018 and where you ended up. So how should we be thinking about kind of the cadence of opening centers into 2019 and how that plays into your guidance. Thanks.","Laura Hamill","Hi, this is Laura. Thanks for the question. I will say, that our launches of Yescarta really made excellence progress, both in the U.S. and in EU. As part of our guidance, we do expect the Yescarta revenue to nearly double, as you\u2019d mention. So we feel we have very, very strong on momentum. We are seeing greater depth and breadth of treatment with Yescarta across the 68 certified sites in the U.S. So where we started off, there is a process of the institutional really figuring out how to operationalize treatment, and we had a very high amount in the \u2013 for top 20 academic institutions, we\u2019re starting to see that spread further across the 68 institutions and also like I said, depth of patients going through.","In addition, as we mentioned, the data that was presented for the follow-up to the real-world evidence, I think really is providing that extra energy in the community about the importance of treating. Not only, obviously, the 68 sites, but what\u2019s more important is that the community oncologists are referring these patients into the sites for treatments, and we do have full force focused on helping with that referral process. And you did ask us specifically about Europe. So we do have 12 sites in Europe that are actively engaged, and we will tell you that in terms of what we\u2019re seeing in Germany. We\u2019re very, very impressed with the results and we continue to have additional in the UK and we also have provided products and open up sites in France, and we will continue to expand throughout 2019 in the European markets.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau from Cowen and Company.","Phil Nadeau","Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. Question on the HIV franchise. I think in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that the use of TDF generic regimens is a risk to HIV pricing this year. And in fact, we have seen some payer programs to incentivize the use of those generic regimen. So just curious if you could maybe talk to a little bit more detail what you are seeing from payers? Any impact on pricing of the generic regimen\u2019s, how it\u2019s being used by physicians and should payers get more aggressive about recommending their use, how it gave encounter that. Thank you.","Laura Hamill","So this is Laura. Thank you for taking question. That was a pretty consistent question that we had at JPMorgan conference, too. And when we look at specifically, one particular payer that was emphasized, we really have not seen any major impact at all. As a matter of fact, when we look at the program, which was specifically, supporting Cimduo, we saw no more than 100 prescriptions generated during the 10 month period of time. And in addition to that, in December, United, basically said, there were two physicians saying, they were longer going to run the My Scripts program. So that\u2019s \u2013 I think that was an effort that was tried to be, if patients would choose to switch back but we really did not see any impact.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Salim Syed from Mizuho Securities. Your question, please.","Salim Syed","Hi, guys . Thanks for taking the question. I just actually have two quick ones, if you don\u2019t mind. The first is on HIV Japan. So if I recall at the end of last year, toward the end of last year, you guys bought back to HIV rights from Japan tobacco. I was wondering if you could just give us some color, how should we be modeling that opportunity coming out of Japan now that you are marketing that solo? And what should we be taking out of the royalty line, where I believe you previously booked the economics. And then the second question, just on your auto CD19 wondering if you guys view CD19 car and K cells therapy as complementary or competition to your allo T-cell therapy. Thank you.","Robin Washington","So maybe I\u2019ll start with the HIV question. Thanks for a asking that. We\u2019re really excited about the opportunity in Japan. It is included in our guidance. And to your point, in the past, we got between about $50 million and $60 million a year in Japan Tobacco royalties and that was in total revenue, not product revenue.","So net-net, this is a positive for us and that we\u2019ll now see those revenues flow through net product revenue, but we\u2019ll lose that royalty contract and other going forward. So again, I think very excited about gaining the commercial rights to the HIV products. And Laura, I don\u2019t know if you want to expand a bit on the commercialization of that relationship at all.","Laura Hamill","Yes. So the teams have been actively working for a smooth transition for the HIV franchise. I think it\u2019s not only the HIV franchise that exists most currently, but it\u2019s really the opportunity this year 2019 to launch Biktarvy. So we\u2019re really, really excited about that opportunity. And the teams, like I said, are working hard and we appreciate the great partnership with Japan Tobacco on kind of helping us with the conversion and building this franchise for us and helping us with a successful launch.","John McHutchison","In terms of the question Salim, related to the allogeneic program. As I said on the call, we are very pleased to announce that we hope to have our IND for our allogeneic CD19 program this year. And we will engineer certain factors into that program. One of which we\u2019ve already announced that we\u2019ll be HLA high related that will have an effect on NK cells that will \u2013 we hope, an advantage in terms of persistence of those cell \u2013 persistence or the manipulated or engineered CAR T cell. So it\u2019s an early field, more to be seen, lots of different approaches. We are pleased with our progress so far.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.","Terence Flynn","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just on selonsertib. I was just wondering if you can confirm if you\u2019d be able to file on only one positive Phase 3 trial or if you need both of those trials to file. And then we\u2019d love your thoughts on how you see this market playing out over the near and longer-term under a positive outcome for the STELLAR studies. Importantly, what are the key inputs on pricing? Do you need the event-free survival data to really drive the value proposition or do you think just the histology data\u2019s enough? Thanks.","John McHutchison","Thanks, Terence. Look, we would like both studies to be positive. They imminently going to be available in the next quarter or few months as well. If one was positive and one was negative as you outlined, we\u2019d have to have a discussion with the regulators. And that would be something that we would discuss analyzing data in that situation. Look, in terms of pricing and moving forward, I\u2019ll hand those aspects onto Laura.","Laura Hamill","Yes. Thanks, John. Thank you. So obviously it\u2019s too early to really comment on our pricing strategy, but of course we modeled scenarios. I will say that the medical affairs team has done a lot of work from a health economics perspective. We\u2019re quite familiar with the overall cost of an F3, F4 patients. These patients are extremely expensive to the system, so having that real world data, which shows us how expensive and unfortunately how many patients when they get to that level really are in pretty dire need. We can take that information coupled with what John produces from a clinical perspective and be able to utilize that for our discussion.","John McHutchison","Terence, just to add. It is Subpart H approval. So once we have the histological endpoint of week 48, that would then allow approval of the drug that would be linked to the five year follow-up to show the improvement in clinical benefit as well over time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.","Ying Huang","Hi. Thanks for the questions. So maybe first for Robin. In your assumptions for the incremental SG&A for 2019 in PrEP for the launch for filgotinib and NASH, I assume that will probably mostly occur in the second half. And if NASH unfortunately fails, does that mean SG&A would actually be lower than expected. And then secondly on the assumption for the HIV launch in your guidance, does that assume incremental more switches from dolutegravir-containing regimens or not in 2019. Thank you.","Robin Washington","Sure, Ying. So first to talk about SG&A, as I mentioned earlier, yes it is the ramp in SG&A is more second half 2019. Don\u2019t use Q4, 2018 as your baseline. Yes, it\u2019s an unfortunate, yes. And for some reason we would not launch our SG&A expenses would go down and that is hopefully not what happens. This is one place where as a CFO, I hope we\u2019ll spend every single dollar that we have allocated. I\u2019ll also add that, again, because of the health of our HIV franchise, I didn\u2019t mention earlier, but there is a component of incremental investment we\u2019re making there as well. But to your question, if NASH did not launch, you would have lower expenses. If you think about $100 million for us in terms of SG&A spend or expenses in general, it\u2019s about $0.06 a share.","Gregg Alton","And then there is a question on the HIV launch assumptions and in terms of a competitor. I think Ying, it\u2019s safe to say we\u2019re not going to get into our detailed assumptions of our guidance. But we fully anticipate Biktarvy will go on to be the best selling single tablet regimen.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carter Gould from UBS. Your question please.","Carter Gould","Thanks guys. Just wanted to dig in a little bit deeper to the EU dynamics in HIV. You obviously highlighted a couple country\u2019s total launch with Biktarvy, but you were a little bit more, I guess a pick on around if that business will sort of stabilize this year and\/or return to growth, or is that really something we should be looking to 2024? Any color there would be appreciated. Thank you.","Robin Washington","Okay. Hi, Carter. This is Robin, maybe I\u2019ll start and if Laura has any color. Yes, I would say in 2019 we actually don\u2019t expect U.S. HIV revenues to grow. But we\u2019ll have the full year impact of genericization and as Laura talked about, we\u2019ll continue to see that ramp of our Descovy-based products. So keep in mind over the next two years we\u2019ll be launching Biktarvy throughout Europe.","So the one component of that quarter sequential decline that we saw was a one-time adjustment we had to make relative to prior periods where certain Southern European countries reach a cap in terms of spending on pharmaceutical products. And then they do what\u2019s called clawback, we get kind of an additional tax. There has been a lot of changes in governments -- and we did make an additional adjustment. And if you take that out, I\u2019d say the sequential declines are more consistent of what we\u2019ve seen in the past. But beyond 2019, again, Laura talked about the great uptake of Descovy and with Biktarvy, we do expect overtime in 2020 or 2021 return to grow for EU HIV.","Laura Hamill","Yes. So I\u2019ll just add a little bit. I think Robin covered it very well. In terms of launches, we\u2019ve definitely been able to with Biktarvy launch, like I said, just some \u2013 the very end of the year, some of the big countries, but we have a launch is going on all through 2019 for Biktarvy. There will still be erosion of generics occurring through 2019. So we had in 2018, we\u2019ll see it happen through 2019. But we believe, we\u2019re going to have some erosion. But the conversion of the Descovy-based regimen being at 80%, those three variables, we believe that we will be able to move through 2019 and then continue to grow from that base.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s program. I\u2019d like to hand the program back to management for any further remarks.","Sung Lee","Thank you, Jonathan, and thank you all for joining us today.

Martin","Thank you, Patrick and thank you all for joining us today. Last year Mark was marked by great productivity and an unprecedented pace of progress. Revenues increased to record levels in numerous R&D programs or advance. This is true for all therapeutic areas, HIV, liver disease, cardiovascular, respiratory and oncology. Although today I will limit my brief comments to liver disease, HIV and oncology.","As you are aware the clinical development program of sofosbuvir for the treatment of hepatitis C infection is supported by four Phase 3 studies. Results from the first study POSITRON evaluating sofosbuvir and ribavirin and interferon-intolerant or hematological genotype II and III infected patients were previously disclosed in a press release in November. This morning we issued another press release with top line data from the second and third Phase III studies, FISSION and NEUTRINO; both of these studies met their primary end points. ","FISSION compared to 12 week courses of sofosbuvir and ribavirin in genotype 2 and 3 infected treatment-na\u00efve patients to a 20 weeks standard of care regiment of pegylated interferon ribavirin. The SVR 12 rates for the sofosbuvir ribavirin arm was 67% compared to 67% in the controlled arm. ","The other study, NEUTRINO evaluated a 12 week treatment course of sofosbuvir, ribavirin, and peginterferon in treatment na\u00efve genotype 1, 4, 5, and 6 infected patients. In this study, 90% of patients achieved an SVR 12. ","In both FISSION and NEUTRINO, sofosbuvir was safe and well tolerated and adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of ribavirin and peginterferon. ","The results from the fourth Phase III study, FUSION evaluating sofosbuvir and treatment experienced genotype 2 and 3 infected patients will become available later this quarter. These four Phase III studies along with a number of additional studies in special populations will support the marketing authorization applications of sofosbuvir, which are planned for submission in the second quarter of this year. Results from all Phase III studies will be presented at future scientific meetings. ","We are also developing the fixed dose combination of sofosbuvir and the NS5A inhibitor ledipasvir, previously known as GS-5885. This one pill once daily FDC is being developed as all oral interferon-free regimen for genotype 1 infected patients. The first Phase 3 study evaluating the FDC with and without ribavirin was initiated last November. Earlier this year, we announced initiation of the second Phase 3 study in genotype 1 treatment experienced patients. This successful B studies would support regulatory filings in the first half of 2014. ","Now turning to HIV, our vision to simplify HIV treatment with single tablet regimens is proving to be a robust strategy. With Atripla, Complera and Stribild, there are now three STRs available. Continued innovations with STRs create opportunities to improve upon current regimens. A recent example of this is TAF commonly GS-7340, which was evaluated last year in a Phase II study. This Phase 2 study show that TAF is efficacious at one-tenth the dose of VIREAD, and provides potential safety advantages. Based on these findings, a TAF containing STR was advanced into Phase 3 development last month. There are two identical Phase 3 studies, which compare elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and TAF co-formulated into an STR to a control Stribild. ","Importantly these studies will allow for inclusion of renally impaired patients with GFR as slow as 50 mL per minute. ","Turning to oncology, over the last five years we have built the beginnings of a solid franchise. Idelalisib, a PI3K double inhibitor was advanced into five Phase 3 studies in refractory CLL and IMHL. Simtuzumab, the anti-LOXL2 antibody is being evaluated in various Phase 2 studies of pancreatic and colorectal cancer and in myelofibrosis, liver fibrosis and pulmonary fibrosis.","Earlier this year, we announced the acquisition of YM BioSciences, which is expected to close this week. This acquisition brings to us CYT 378, a JAK 1\/2 inhibitor, which has been studied in Phase II for the treatment of bio fibrosis. The data indicate that CYT 378 has potential advantages over existing agents and we plan on advancing the compound into Phase III studies later this year.","Overall, 2012 was a very successful year. We\u2019ve demonstrated productivity across all parts of our organizations. 2013 will also be an exciting year with numerous upcoming milestones. We look forward to sharing our progress with you.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Kevin Young.","Kevin Young","Thank you, John. In the fourth quarter of 2012, we achieved record worldwide product sales up $2.5 billion, a growth of 18% over the fourth quarter of 2011. Thanks to this very strong performance. Product sales for the whole of 2012 totaled $9.4 billion, a growth of 16% over 2011.","Sales in the U.S. were especially strong in the fourth quarter, exceeding $1.5 billion for the first time, a growth of 22% over the fourth quarter of 2011. U.S. antiviral sales posted a robust 20% increase over the same quarter a year ago, but particularly notable increases of 31% was seen in our cardiopulmonary business.","Underlying U.S. demand drivers were healthy throughout the fourth quarter. However, it is important to highlight a number of purchasing events, which positively influence sales in the run-up to the year-end.","First, Antiviral product orders from the VA were above historical norms. This was particularly apparent at the regional mail-order pharmacy level. Second, inventory levels for Letairis rose by approximately four days over and above the third quarter 2012.","As a reminder, we do not administer inventory management agreements with specialty pharmacy. Third, ADHOC purchases during the fourth quarter were strong, similar to the levels seen in the second quarter of 2012. Finally, by our estimates the biggest impact on the quarter, we saw strong so-called sale of retail purchases. We believe this was in anticipation of price increases we took at the beginning of 2013.","In total for the U.S., we estimate that $80 million to $100 million of fourth quarter sales were as a result of strategic purchases beyond our control. We kind of predict whether these purchase activities will be repeated in 2013, or whether there might be others of a similar nature.","The fourth quarter of 2012 was our first full quarter of Stribild sales. I'd like to provide some color on initial uptake dynamics, which I believe are very encouraging for our HIV franchise overall, but more importantly, the continued adoption of STRs, single tablet regimens.","First and foremost, payor acceptance of Stribild has been excellent, beyond that Complera at a similar timepoint. All state Medicaid plans and all AIDS drug assistance programs now have Stribild on formulary. Moreover, most Managed Care Organizations now cover Stribild of the same level as our other HIV drugs, with little or no restrictions. Cumulative prescriptions of Stribild are running approximately 90% higher than Complera at a similar point in launch; particularly active prescribers are infectious disease physicians with large clinical workloads many of whom were involved in the Phase 3 registrational studies of Stribild.","While it\u2019s very early, we are seeing a different patient profile for Stribild than Complera. More naive patients are receiving Stribild, few patients are switching from an NNRTI third agent to Stribild and encouragingly more patients are switching from protease inhibitor third agent to Stribild.","Please note that Gilead only details according to the na\u00efve label in our package insert. Nevertheless, having a single tablet integrase regimen available for the first time is proving attractive to physicians who have historically preferred the protease inhibitor class.","Finally, on Stribild, as we did with Complera, we have secured an advanced look of the na\u00efve patient breakdown for the fourth quarter, highlighted in slide 32 of our earnings presentation. Recall, that at this time in the Complera launch, STR share of na\u00efve patients rose from 50% to 60%. We now see a similar spec change driven by Stribild, essentially several of ten naive patients now start on a single tablet regimen. This increase is associated with a decline in third agents for which Gilead does not receive economics.","Turning to Europe, whilst economic conditions remain difficult and healthcare expenditures are the continued target of government costs. We are delighted with the growth in our business. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, European sales grew by 7% in the fourth quarter versus one year ago.","Eviplera is now in the market in 17 countries across Europe and encouragingly we have completed price negotiations in Spain and Italy, and we\u2019ll be supplying patients in these countries during the quarter.","Eviplera uptake has been very strong in France, Germany, and the UK. We are particularly pleased with France, the largest HIV market outside the U.S. and one that is dominated by the protease inhibitor Prezista class.","Also, the fiscal quarter of launch, 42% of all Eviplera patients are switching from a protease inhibitor. So in summary, we exited 2012 with great momentum across all our therapeutic areas and across all our expanding territories.","In addition to have quick patience and meeting our company goals with today\u2019s best-in-class drugs for HIV, HPV, pulmonary hypertension and joiner and cystic fibrosis, we have the very exciting prospect of launching a major medical innovation in 2014, Sofosbuvir for Hepatitis C. Commensurate with launch timelines of quarter one 2014 in the U.S. and quarter two 2014 in Europe, we have started a progressive ramp up of commercial activities from the start of 2013.","Subject to regulatory approval, we believe Sofosbuvir has the potential in combination with other drugs to cure significant numbers of HCV infected people. Our goal is to educate physicians in the hepatology, gastroenterology and infectious disease settings with highly trained, dedicated sales, marketing and medical affairs staff. ","As has been the case in HIV, step changes in therapy change the phase of the disease. We believe the same will hold through in hepatitis C. Gilead will direct considerable resources to position itself as the commercial leader in the space. ","With this in mind, we recently established our own company identity in Japan with the goal of developing, registering and supplying the many patients with advanced liver disease caused by hepatitis C. ","To conclude, 2012 was a year full of new commercial milestones. In 2013, we believe that whilst there maybe some market challenges, the need for Gilead\u2019s portfolio of specialty medicines gives us the opportunity to have another successful year. ","I will now turn the call over to Robin Washington.","Robin L. Washington ","Thank you Kevin, good afternoon everyone. We completed 2012 with strong financial performance. Our continued commercial execution enabled us to generate total revenues of $9.7 billion in 2012 representing a 16% increase from 2011. Net product revenues exceeded the upper end of our guidance, driven in part by $80 million to $100 million of purchasing that exceeded prescription growth as Kevin highlighted. ","Our operating expenses were within our guidance range as provided for 2012. Non-GAAP R&D expenses increased to $1.5 billion, up 34%, reflecting the progression and expansion of our Phase III studies, particularly in liver disease and oncology. ","Non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased to $1.2 billion, up 12% year-over-year driven by higher pharmaceutical excise tax and ongoing cost to support the growth of our expanding business.","During 2012, we generated operating cash flows of $3.2 billion, which includes $533 million in cash collections from Southern Europe for the payment of past due accounts receivables. We repaid a total of $1.6 billion in debt resulting in a non-GAAP debt-to-EBITDA ratio of $1.8 billion as of December 31, and remained on track to reach our targeted non-GAAP debt-to-EBITDA ratio of $1.5 billion by mid-2013. ","With recent business development activity and the upcoming maturity of the May 2013 convertible notes, we will be suspending our repurchase activity until this targeted math.","The last financial highlight that I would like to share is our full year 2013 financial guidance, which is detailed on a slide 41 in the earnings presentation available on our corporate website. Please note that this guidance is inclusive of the YM BioSciences acquisition. ","For the full year 2013, we are projecting product sales of $10 billion to $10.2 billion reflecting a 6% to 9% increase over 2012 product sales. This range is since the continued growth of Complera and Stribild in the U.S. and Europe, as well as the continued growth of our cardiovascular franchise. We also assume the continuation of a challenging economic environment in Europe and the potential for continued volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. ","Our non-GAAP product gross margin for 2013 is expected to be in the range of 74% to 76%. We expect our full-year non-GAAP R&D expenses to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion if we continue to invest in our product pipeline. We expect non-GAAP ","SG&A expenses to be in the range of $1.55 billion to $1.65 billion which includes increased sales and marketing expenses in preparation for the launch of sofosbuvir in 2014. ","Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the full-year 2013 is expected to be in the range of 26% to 28%. This includes the benefit of the Federal R&D tax credit extension which was passed by Congress in January and is retroactive to 2012. As a result, our income tax provision for 2013 will include a discrete tax benefit which will reduce our effective tax rate for the first quarter and to a lesser extent full-year.","As detailed on Slide 42, we are anticipating a full-year 2013 diluted EPS impact of acquisition related restructuring and stock-based compensation expenses to be in the range of $0.21to $0.24 per share. ","In closing, we're pleased with our performance across the organization during 2012 and as John indicated, we believe we have laid the groundwork for future success. We want to thank our employees for their continued dedication and hard work.","I will now turn the call over for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Today's question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. (Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Geoffrey Meacham with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Geoffrey C. Meacham \u2013 JPMorgan Securities ","Hey guys, good afternoon. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking the question. A couple related clinical question, can you help us with how you\u2019re thinking about the genetype remarket based on the data so far, there\u2019s 5816, 7977 the combo you\u2019re looking for, and what are the gating factors there to start the Phase 2? And then finally on study 104 in HIV, is 48 weeks enough, do you think to see an impact on bone and other points of differentiation with respect to our straddles? Thanks.","Norbert W. Bischofberger ","Hi, Geoff, it\u2019s Norbert. So regarding genotype 3, I would say immediately, we\u2019re doing two things, we could think of longer treatment durations to get a response rate up, and that\u2019s ongoing in fusion, and we can also think about or we are initiating a study to look at the NEUTRINO regimens or pegylated interferon, ribavirin and sofosbuvir for genotype 3, that will be a very attractive opportune, I think and I\u2019m assuming the response rate with that regimen would mimic what we have seen in NEUTRINO genotype 1, 4, 5, 6, more intermediate term we were actually looking in ELECTRON in two cohorts with our fixed dose combination of sofosbuvir and 5885, for genotype 2 and 3, I have to tell you my expectation is that that regimen should not be excellent, because simply the antiretroviral activity of 5885 against certain polymerase in genotype 3a is suboptimal. ","And then lastly, as you pointed out we\u2019re certainly looking at 5816, I think that compound in combination with sofosbuvir has that opportunity to make this whole issue disappear, and we are looking at that hopefully we can initiate the Phase 2 study sometime in the middle of this year; studies in genotype 2 and 3 are currently ongoing and as soon as those are finished, and as we have some inkling about the dose will initiate Phase 2.","And then you asked about study 104, you correctly \u2013 so the 48 week is the primary regulatory end point, at which we would analyze the study and submit it for marketing authorization application. But as you know, we always carry these studies out to longer duration in a blinded fashion, and this study currently is planned to go for 96 weeks. But we are confident that we are going to see difference in BMD at week 48, I want to remind you, we have seen those same difference with a much smaller same emphasize into Phase 2 study at week 24. So I\u2019m convinced we\u2019re going to see the same thing in the Phase 3 study.","John C. Martin","Yeah, and Jeff I\u2019d just like to chip in and say that the GT-3 market size in the U.S. is 7% of the population. It\u2019s different in Europe. It\u2019s different in the rest of world, but it\u2019s only 7%. So market here is very much GT-1 and GT-2. And I\u2019d also like to point out that there was 11% of patients from FISSION, who had to discontinue and that\u2019s in a clinical trial setting so clearly current standard of peg ribavirin is difficult to take even of a 24 week period. So we can do better. We want to do better for the GT-3 patient both the current standard is certainly less not optimal.","Geoffrey C. Meacham \u2013 JPMorgan Securities","Okay, thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Rachel McMinn with Bank of America. Please proceed.","Rachel McMinn \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, it\u2019s kind of a high class problem, but Norbert, I\u2019m just curious what you do with your short duration studies with loans done ELECTRON showed at six or eight weeks the treatment duration is positive with really strong STRs. Are these going to have an impact on potential pricing decision, so can you expand into multi-center Phase 3 to really try and get more data, or is it just something that kind of sits on the sideline and you just kind of price it as a shorter treatment regimen? Thanks.","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Yeah, hi, Rachael, so it is a high class problem, you are right, but it\u2019s certainly not going to sit on the sidelines. So what we are currently thinking and this of course needs to be discussed with regulatory authorities to do a non-inferiority study, so we will do another Phase 3 type study, non-inferiority of 12 versus eight potentially versus six weeks, depending on the outcome of the Phase 2 studies, and we would like to get that into the label. We feel it\u2019s very important to have that information available for promotional purposes and maybe Kevin could comment on that thing.","So that\u2019s our thinking Rachael. Again, this has not been discussed with regulatory authorities yet, we still yet that to do that.","Kevin Young","Yeah, Rachael, our preference always at Gilead is to have these things in the label, not only who enable our field forces, sales representatives, our medical scientists, but it\u2019s obviously a key for the payor. And we would definitely want it for that subject to \u2013 that been an appropriate profile for 7977 plus 5885.","Rachel McMinn \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just squeezing it on from a timeline perspective with that delay your, combination, there is regimen filing or you think you can get all those stuff done in time?","John Martin","Yeah, Rachel, we think, we can get all of those done in time, the rate limiting step right now seems to be IM1, so the study that started first, as you know we stoped enrollment that the first 200 patients and the other 600 would be enrolled following an interim analysis on the second quarter. So that would be the rate limiting study. And another thing I\u2019d like to add Rachel is that the sample size for non-inferiority studies is fairly reasonable, you don't need the larger number of patients, the further, away you are from 50% the easier just to show non-inferiority.","Rachel McMinn \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you so much.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Matt Roden with UBS. Please proceed.","Matthew Roden \u2013 UBS","Great, thank for taking my question. First, Norbert, can you give us the actual SVR-12 for the NEUTRINO genotype 1 non-cirrhotic patients? And then secondly, by the time you file for FDA approval, can you talk about whether or not to what extent you have data on decompensated cirrhotics and transplant patients, and if so whether or not you could get claims for those populations based on the data? And lastly, how many patients you think that description as of today? Thanks a lot.","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Yeah, hi, Matt, I don't have the \u2013 so what we put in the press release, the response rate in NEUTRINO was 90% and 80% in cirrhotics. So non-cirrhotics you can kind of calculate what that would be if the overall population of cirrhotics is 17%, I don't have the number right here, but it\u2019s obviously something north of 90%. U.S., the second question you had about how many transplant and decompensated would be in the label, so needless to say, we are going to put in the filing whatever we have at that time, we've had at the moment if I\u2019ve not mistaken about 25 to 30 patients enrolled in our pre-transplant study with a post-transplant study that has about a similar amount. And then Rich has started a decompensated study dose that have a portal hypertension, and I don\u2019t have the number here.","And whether this is enough to actually get in the label, of course has to be determined by FDA, I don\u2019t know \u2013 it also what they think about, 25 patients. It\u2019s also, of course depends on what the results are if we see something spectacular then FDA would be more mineable, I think to put the lower number of patients in the label. But I think we have a very good broad package that includes decompensated pre-transplant, post-transplant and HIV coinfection that we will be in the initial label.","Kevin Young","","Yeah, Matt, I don\u2019t have the transplant numbers at my finger tip. So I can get back to you in terms of the proportion of patients who are being transplanted specifically for HCV. So we can get up to you.","Matthew Roden \u2013 UBS","","Kevin, strategically how important is it to get the sort of special populations in the label to start of with, from the most affected?","Kevin Young","","It\u2019s always nice to have high need population, and clearly a transplant patients, because they all reinfect with HCV is a very, very high need population. But I think, what we\u2019re seeing from our day to today and having labels for GT-I, GT-II or GT-III, it\u2019s clearly the core parts of our approval. So I think it\u2019s nice to have, but I don\u2019t see it is very, very big and sort of a big swing factor in our launch at all.","Matthew Roden \u2013 UBS","Thank you very much and congrats on all the progress.","Kevin Young","Thank you.","Norbert W. Bischofberger","I just like to remind everybody, please keep with you one question, please.","","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Please proceed.","","Mark J. Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group","Hey, thanks it's Mark Schoenebaum. Hey Pat, I have got eight questions, if I may. No, I was actually wondering hey Kevin, I know you are talking at JPMorgan at some point, you might be willing to give out a number, I think we all plan pretty helpful, and modeling, I just want to ask if you\u2019ve got the number ready, and that is the number of the diagnosed hepatitis C patients treated by specialists in the U.S. and Europe, and if you want to answer that, maybe I can ask Rob then \u2013 Robin, where is the IP for 7977 domicile, is there any opportunity to take your tax rate down once you start selling that drug, that is could be cash flows, be taxed at a lower rate for that drug than the corporate average rate now. Thank you.","","Kevin Young ","Hey Mark, it's Kevin. Yeah, if you don't mind Mark we probably do mind, I'm going to hold those numbers for a little while longer, we are obviously in a highly competitive market here, but I think once we get through regulatory filing, and getting to the middle of the year, and we really start to take up the commercial activities then I think we will be able to share some quite interesting information we're starting together on the whole dynamics of HCV, not just in U.S. we\u2019re doing some really good work in Europe as well. So we will start to share that with you as we get into the middle of the year.","Mark J. Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group","Okay I understand thank you. Maybe the tax question. . . ","Robin L. Washington ","Yes, so Mark IP for 7977 is domiciled in Ireland; so as we commercialize that, there an opportunity for our tax rate to decline over time.","Mark J. Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group","Thank you.","","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Matt Andrew with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Matthew J Andrews \u2013 Wells Fargo Advisors ","Hey, good afternoon this is Matthew Andrews calling in for Brian Abrahams. Thanks for taking the question. Just on your 2013 guidance, Robin can you talk about your expectations for peak year expenses as it relates to R&D considering the large number of Phase 3s you are currently having ongoing? Thanks.","Robin L. Washington","Sure Matt right, I can\u2019t necessarily talk about peak year, I can talk about 2013, and I mean, I do think if you look at on an absolute basis, and as a percentage of net product revenue do, and we\u2019ve guided to towards being higher (inaudible) that's given by the progression of our Phase 3 studies in HCV oncology. I don't necessarily \u2013 I see that trend probably continuing somewhat beyond that, but we'll try to add at the appropriate time.","Matthew J Andrews \u2013 Wells Fargo Advisors","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Michael J. Yee \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Hey thanks for the question on Lone Star, can you clarify when you think you might actually get data on that steady? Have you completed screening et cetera, and just to clarify, if you were to run a non-inferiority study of \u201812 versus 08 and what not? When do you not be able to do that until, you had the data. So can you may be just walk through the timeline for Lone Star and when you get that data running a potential on a period how that all gets done by mid '14. Thanks.","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Yeah Michael, so the data from Lone Star and by the way also from ELECTRON, the six week arm is an ELECTRON, we should be able to get those early second quarter, and only then can we make a decision to do a larger study to look at to compared to '12 to '08 to may be six weeks. But keep in mind the ION-I has a 24-week treatment arm in it, that\u2019s going to be the late-limiting step. So we compare 12 to 8 to 6, we\u2019ll get that done before the 24-week treatment arm in ION-I will finish, so it all works out for NDA filing.","Michael J. Yee \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, thank you.","John C. Martin","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Marshall Urist with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Marshall Urist \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. So just two for Robin on spending, just I know you\u2019re not going to talk about peak here. But should we thinking, as I think about how about the business and new products that this is a good level of R&D, have you guys are kind of sort of comfortable spending at over the next three years, as we think about the model, and then maybe just also on gross margin, it looks like to think about that sort of flattish year-on-year. So Robin, just talk through how we can think about the mixed benefits of some of the new products rolling through, and when we might see some more of that benefit? Thanks.","Robin L. Washington","Sure, Marshall. So I mean as it relates to R&D spending, I cannot mention for 2013 on an absolute percentage of revenue, it would be higher. 2014, still I think similar level particularly given our focus on oncology as we continue to build up that franchise with the successful launch as a percentage of revenue obviously that would go down, right more towards traditional levels, right but those absolute spend, I\u2019d see probably remain at the 2013 levels for a while. ","John C. Martin","And Marshall, let me add some different look, clinical perspective clearly in the second quarter of this year will hit the peak of clinical studies, we have the pen of how you count eight Phase 3 studies Stribild in hepatitis C and all of those should finish this year, they are fairly short duration treatment, so next year we should see fewer clinical studies lot more. ","Robin L. Washington","And Marshall, it relates to gross margin as we have a larger component of our net product revenue coming from Stribild and Complera, we would expect to see a more favorable impact of gross margin and we think clearly in 2014, with the launch of 7977 and expects that even greater going forward.","Marshall Urist \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great, thanks a lot. ","Robin L. Washington ","Okay. ","Operator"," ","And your next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citigroup. Please proceed. ","Yaron B. Werber \u2013 Citigroup","Great, thanks. So Norbert, I just have a couple of questions sort of it\u2019s one question in two parts, if you don\u2019t mind. ION-I, just give us a little bit of sense, it sounds like come April or so, you can do the interim analysis in 200 patients, how fast can you get the other 600 in, if they have been prescreened? And then you really didn\u2019t say much about 9669, where is that product going?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","So Yaron, how fast could we re-open the enrollment, one challenge we had with these studies that involve all oral regimens is that, we have to slowdown to side, because enrollment is too fast. In this case its even somewhat better or more accelerate, because all the (inaudible) divide, all the patients are ready, they are prescreened, so which was that to say go and then we would enroll that study very, very quickly. So I am sorry, what was the second question?","Yaron B. Werber \u2013 Citigroup","Second one was about 9669.","Norbert W. Bischofberger","9669, where is that going? So our plan right now is to follow. So we are going have to first answer the question, what is the limit of 7977, 5885. Is 12 weeks without ribavirin limit, is it eight weeks, is it six weeks with ribavirin. Once we have found the point where the response kind of wares off, then we would do the mixed experiment, and see whether if we had a third drug or we will place ribavirin will 9669 whether we get a better response rate.","So in other words, if you can think about six weeks may not be enough with 7977 by the (inaudible). So add to that 9669 again, we would have once-daily potentially single tablet regimen for six weeks. That\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re looking at right now. Of course then we have to ask the question, is three drugs for six weeks versus two drugs for eight weeks or 12-weeks. That still a debate we\u2019re having internally, but meanwhile in Phase 2 we\u2019re answering these questions.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Robyn Karnauskas \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Just one question on HIV, so cobicistat, maybe you can talk a little bit about, is it included in your guidance and how do we think about that product given it could launch this year?","Kevin Young","Hi, Robyn, it\u2019s Kevin. Yes, it\u2019s included in our guidance. It\u2019s probably going to be a very small product. We\u2019ll be hopefully launching simultaneous to elvitegravir. I think as John Milligan has said in the past, in the main driver of cobicistat as a boosting agent will come from the combination products that will be launched in due time by our partners with Reyataz and with Prezista.","So I think our expectations are for fairly modestly sized products and our concentration for the sales representatives will be first and foremost way to Stribild followed by Complera.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Porges with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.","Geoffrey Porges \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Thank you, that was remarkably good. So, Rob, I just would like to focus in on what you've been saying about margin, so we understand first on the gross margin front, is the mix shift towards the first [Eviplera] should we assume that that product will contribute gross margins that are at least this good or better than the profitability of the core HIV business ex is the stable component.","And then also on the operating margins, you\u2019ve had a very negative trend over the last two years and you\u2019ve seem to be guiding that operating margins will be negative again in 2013. Should we expect that they could get back to the level of 2010 in the future at some point if things go well with the HIV franchise, or is that something that we should forget about? Thanks.","Robin L. Washington","Thanks, Geoff, for your question, I mean the quick answer is yes, and yes to both. I mean clearly, we would expect gross margins with (inaudible) equal to or better, I mean it would be dependent on final pricing by directionally if we think about our plans, yes, we would expect them to be at the higher end relative to our current margin for HIV.","And as it relates to operating margin, as we discussed the last two years of the acquisition and the investment period for us without the following revenues. So with the launch of 7977 in 2014, we would definitely expect to return to operating margin conditional for Gilead and hopefully improved.","Geoffrey Porges \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Terrific. Thank you very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.","Ian Somaiya \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Thanks, just a question on the pipeline. First on TAF\u2019s, how should we think about your decision to start Phase 3 studies with TAF, part of the release of a second Phase 2 data? And just on Simtuzumab, there seems to be more discussion today on it\u2019s evaluation in multiple Phase 2 studies. You mentioned pancreatic cancer, colorectal, I was hoping to get your thoughts on IPF, what if anything you have seen from the early clinical works since you\u2019re running a 500 patient Phase 2 study in that setting?","John C. Martin","","Yeah, so Ian with regards to TAF, I assume you\u2019re thinking about the second Phase 3 study that was also \u2013 which will come out I think in the second quarter if I am not mistaken. We\u2019re still debating that internally whether we should do the second fixed dose combination actually with the protease inhibitor or whether it should be something else and that should lead to \u2013 we will announce the decisions on that Monday, as soon as we are there. ","And then you asked about IPF, that study was a very small study. I think it was some like 25 patients that weren\u2019t dosed for long enough. So I think even if Simtuzumab has had a fairly dramatic effect in IPF. I don\u2019t think we would have seen it. So what we\u2019re doing right now in the Phase 2 study, it cannot be a Phase 2 that leads to a Phase 3, which is an event driven study that is doing a number of interim analysis for utility. So in other words if we see a trend early on we would of course continue, we don\u2019t see much at a certain point, we will discontinue the study. So it\u2019s a risk based \u2013 risk managed approach to a large Phase 3 study which starts out a Phase 2. ","Ian Somaiya \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Can you give some sense of the timelines of when the interim analysis will be conducted?","John C. Martin","I feel reluctant to do that, because the enrollment rate is an unknown, I mean if this was Hepatitis C, I would feel no fear to give you a date, but in IPS, it\u2019s a little bit slower, and I don't know how the community is going to react to an injectable, it's something that we should have to see on enrollment goes, I don't know.","Ian Somaiya \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Okay. Thanks, Norbert.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen & Co. Please proceed.","Phil M. Nadeau \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. My question is actually on the side effect profile of sofosbuvir. The press releases that you\u2019ve issued so far have been pretty parsed in the details around the side effect profile. So I wondering if you could give us a bit more information on how Phase 3 side effect profile is different from Phase 2, and in particular you have a lot more experience now in cirrhotics than you had in Phase 2. So how does that side effect profile with cirrhotics differ from patients who have fully functioning livers? Thank you.","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Yeah, Phil, so I would say it was parsed what we put in the press release, but we did like a statement that that \u2013 if you look at just adverse events and laboratory abnormalities differ always greater in the control arm even in POSITRON, which utilized in placebo control, there were more laboratory abnormalities in the placebo arm compared to the 7977 arm.","So to this date, I have to say, we have not seen anything that we could point to, that\u2019s a signal in either adverse event for laboratory abnormalities that is due to sofosbuvir. I don\u2019t know the exact size of the database, but it\u2019s something like a thousand patients treated beyond 12 weeks, maybe about 2,000 total, so that\u2019s the state of our safety. They are based and lastly, the safety profile in cirrhotic doesn\u2019t seem to be sufficiently different from non-cirrhotics. so to this point, this is very well tolerated and well behaved drug, we are very happy with it.","Phil M. Nadeau \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC","Great, thank you. ","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Brian Skorney with R.W. Baird. Please proceed.","Brian Skorney \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for fitting me, and I\u2019ve got a lot of questions, but I guess given the one, maybe I will ask Robin a question about just what are your thoughts on or regarding cost of capital and what you are internally thinking of the cost of equity versus the cost of debt? And why in particular the goal is to get 1.5 times non-GAAP EBITDA on the debt as opposed to interest rates being where they are, maybe staying even a little higher than that?","Robin L. Washington","Okay. So Brian, part and parcel, if you recall probably about eight or 10 months before we did the acquisition, we had just recently been rated. So when we took out the amount of the debt that we did with the transaction, we actually proactively reviewed it with the rating agency and just given our maturity about capital structure where it was in terms of being rated and it\u2019s something that is important to us.","We chose to be, which I don\u2019t discrete as a fairly conservative relative to debt-to-EBITDA ratio. I mean, going forward I think there is different ways to look at that, but I think relative to the commitment that we made when we did the transaction there, our goal is to ensure that we meet that as we guided to when we initially close the deal.","Brian Skorney \u2013 Robert W. Baird","I guess if I could just kind of ask a follow up to that. I mean what would be implication beyond cost of that to take it downward?","Robin L. Washington","I don\u2019t think it would be significant Brian. It would really depend on what we do by taking that downgrade, right. So I think relative to other companies of our size with our balance sheet, we could take on more debt, but you are right, the cost of capital is doing a given current interest rates would probably not be that significant.","Brian Skorney \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Gotcha. Thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Thomas Wei with Jefferies & Company. Please proceed.","Thomas Wei \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask a question about the hep C data. So when we're all doing these calculations of the STR rates in cirrhotics versus non-cirrhotics, those numbers in the delta has varied quite a bit from study-to-study, so if I'm doing all these math right, it looks like there is the 12% delta in NEUTRINO, 20% in POSITRON, 25% in FISSION. And I guess I'm wondering why should we take away from our guard, is the 12% delta in NEUTRINO smaller \u2013 this potentially misleading, because there is PEG+RBV in the backbone, or is there something about genotypes when you look at the more detailed data that makes cirrhotics for certain genotypes particularly harder to treat?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Hi, Thomas, this is Norbert. You are kind of reading my mind, because both John (inaudible) and I looked at this over the weekend then we went back and forth over the numbers. So I can tell you, I don't have an answer for you other than to tell you that the numbers are small, so you have to be careful what percentage is. I'm not sure whether some of these percentages will still be the same when the numbers are much larger.","The next study by the way FUSION will shed some light on this. It has more cirrhotics actually 35%, and so I hope we\u2019re going to learn something more there. But you know what these known from a larger number of interferon ribavirin studies that was recently if April and December 2012 in hepatology first author Marcelo, and he actually showed that over a large number of patients 7,000 patients in all genotype cirrhotics are about 15% to 10% lower in their response rates than non-cirrhotics and somehow I feel like what we are seeing here looks like the same thing.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ravi Malhotra. Please proceed with Credit Suisse.","","Ravi Malhotra \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","Question for Kevin on patient population size for HC. I'm going to ask Mark's question in a slight different way in a much broader context. For your initial stage I approval of 7977 in early 2014; what population proportion do you think you can address with that label versus when you get to stage 2 as it where, when you get a fixed dose ION-I, II sort of added to it, and link to that what society of sales folks initially versus stage 2. Thank you.","Kevin Young","Hey Ravi, it\u2019s Kevin. I\u2019ll reverse the order of your questions, can\u2019t right now peg you the specific number for our HCV field force again as I said with Mark's question; we are in a very, very competitive world. I did say today that we would have a dedicated HCV field force, I think it\u2019s important for us not only to do well in hepatitis C, but continue our success in HIV, so we will separate the field forces so we'll continue to have a dedicated HIV set sales force, and we will have a dedicated HCV field force. Actually we will also have a dedicated HBV field force. So I hope that's somewhat helpful. ","In terms of our genotypes and the way we are viewing our launch, it\u2019s certainly not going to be some sort of low key entry into the market because we\u2019ve got 7977 plus 5885, a year down the road. If you look at today\u2019s results, I think in all genotypes we are a step improvement certainly significant improvement in the GT-1 and GT-2 patients and that\u2019s the majority of patients in the U.S. So we will be high-gear and we will have a significant high-energy launch behind all three genotypes subject to getting everything that we would like into a label from the FDA. So we are going to somehow low key genotype 1 launch and if you like to heighten GT-2 launch, we\u2019ll be putting a common emphasis on all three genotypes.

Flynn \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, thanks for taking the question. I noticed you had very low discontinuation rate in FISSION and NEUTRINO, but was wondering if there are any patients that receive less than 12 weeks of therapy and if you could give us any details on the outcome in those patients regarding QR rates. Thanks. ","John C. Martin","Yeah, hi Terence. We actually don\u2019t have any data, I don\u2019t have any of the discontinuation rates. They\u2019re very small and I don\u2019t have any information on what the response rates in those people were that received less than 12 weeks of the regime and I have to go back to our data set and look. Sorry. ","Operator, next question\u2026","Operator","Yes. Your next question is coming from Howard Liang with Leerink. Please proceed.","Howard Liang \u2013 Leerink Swann ","For sofosbuvir, ribavirin combination what do you think and what were your proposed regulators on how long the duration should be for genotype 3 patients in the label? It seems like 12 weeks will be too short as you mentioned earlier and the patients keep going after 12 weeks. So if longer dosing is of consideration, how big is your safety database for 24 weeks and 16 weeks for sofosbuvir?","John F. Milligan","Yeah, hi Howard. So it all really depends on what we see in the mix study FUSION, as you know that was a blind study that compared 12 weeks to 16 weeks of therapy in genotype 2, 3. Actually we have genotype 3 population 63%, so we should get a very good field from that, whether extending the duration of treatment will have any benefit. And based on those results we then have to make up our own mind and also talk to FDA about what they would think the ultimate recommendation will be. ","But Howard I would not say just something because you know it comes up to this genotype 3. The response rates that we're seeing actually are very, very good. They\u2019re comparable to what you get with interferon ribavirin. In the FISSION study it was 56%, versus 63%, 63% of interferon, 56% was the ribavirin. It\u2019s a little bit lower numerically, but that confidence whenever crosses zero so it\u2019s not significantly worse.","And secondly, in order as we have shown in the POSITRON study, these are patients that actually don't have any other options. And we cure 61% of them in genotype 3, so it\u2019s a good, well tolerated regimen, which just need \u2013 we know we can do better and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do next as I said was extending the treatment duration, we\u2019re having an interferon-containing regimen or adding, replacing ribavirin or adding another drug line 5885 or 5816.","Howard Liang \u2013 Leerink Swann LLC","Is the size of the Phase III database an issue for longer dose?","John F. Milligan","Phase III database, Howard, I have to look it up. Honestly I don\u2019t want to give you a number that I don\u2019t know. I do know we have about a 1,000 patients exposed for 12 weeks or longer. How many more we have longer, I am not sure. FUSION has about 100 patients for 16 weeks?","Howard Liang \u2013 Leerink Swann LLC","Thank you very much.","John F.

Please proceed.","Joel D. Sendek \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, thanks a lot. I have a question about the Stribild source of business. I was confused by something you said. But first of all, if I look at that slide, it\u2019s slide 32, 32% of Stribild comes from Na\u00efve patients relative to 30% for Complera. I would have expected a greater percentage coming from Na\u00efve. I think you mentioned something about 70% number, could you repeat that again? Thanks.","Kevin Young","Hey, Joel, it\u2019s Kevin. Basically to seem and if you look at the slide 33, which is kind of Eviplera is a contrast that do seem that as we go into the market with these single tablets, some thing about a third of the patient seem to be coming from Na\u00efve, which is our label and that\u2019s what we promote on. But physicians do make switches within HIV and looking to kind of a upgrade or when they have the resistance or they want to improve the side effect profile for patients, we\u2019ll make a switch. That\u2019s not what we\u2019re promoting, but that seems to happen.","We\u2019ll just have to see how we progress with Stribild. I think what is the most encouraging part of slide 32 is saying that physicians have seen the struggles in alternative to that protease inhibitor. And if you just look at the Na\u00efve market shares, you can see how there is a drop off in Prezista, drop off in Reyataz, with the entry of Complera and with Stribild.","But I think Stribild is seen for those doctors who have not been great fans of efavirenz as seen as a \u2013 both starting as an alternative drug where they have not been particular advocates of Atripla, R&D, Complera as NNITI food agents try to getting Stribild.","Joel D.

Milligan","Alan, in terms of pipeline for hepatitis C, as you know we started off this whole effort with the belief that we needed multiple drugs and we actually will see through as of three years ago if you had asked me, I would have said me, three, four, five drugs, probably and that\u2019s the reason why we pursue broadly a large class. We have two PIs now in Phase II; 9256, 9451 with another PI in pre-clinical we have two NS5As, we also have a cycle of filling inhibitor in pre-clinical and we are working on another nuc and we have another NS5B non-nucleoside.","So either if there are any broad agent, staple of agents and the way it looks right now, we may not meet that menu, it may actually turn out at two or enough, but if we need three, we will have three.

My name is Cherie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, and as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Sung Lee, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thank you, Cherie, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the third quarter 2018. The press release and detailed slides are available on the Investor Relations section of the Gilead website.","The speakers on today's call will be Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Hamill, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Commercial Operations; John McHutchison, Chief Scientific Officer and Head of Research and Development; and John Milligan, President and Chief Executive Officer.","Before we begin with our prepared comments, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, financial projections and the use of capital, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements.

We are pleased to share our financial results for the third quarter of 2018.","Before I get into the financial results and commercial highlights for the quarter, I'd like to welcome Laura Hamill, who recently joined Gilead as Executive Vice President, Worldwide Commercial Operations. We are glad to have this key position filled, and are excited to have Laura on our team. Laura is quickly becoming familiar with our business and has already provided significant commercial expertise on several strategic fronts. You'll hear from Laura in a few minutes followed by John McHutchison with an update on our R&D efforts and then John Milligan with a few closing comments.","We had very strong execution in the third quarter, during which our HIV franchise achieved record quarterly sales. HCV revenues continued to be more predictable and in line with our expectations, and further progress was made in cell therapy, including the approval of Yescarta in Europe. Total revenues for the third quarter were $5.6 billion with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.84. This compares to total revenues of $6.5 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.27 for the same period last year.","Starting with HIV, product sales for the third quarter were $3.7 billion, up 12% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to the continued strong uptake of Genvoya and Odefsey, and the rapid adoption of Biktarvy. With 19% year-over-year revenue growth and 11% year-over-year prescription growth, our U.S. HIV business continues to reflect strong underlying demand for Descovy-based regimens, which now account for 74% of Gilead's total U.S. HIV prescription volume.","Sequentially, U.S. HIV sales were up 5%, reflecting strong demand for Biktarvy. Payer mix in the third quarter was similar to the second quarter, where it was approximately equally split between private pay and government segments. In the second full quarter since its FDA approval in February, Biktarvy generated $375 million in sales in the U.S., becoming the number one prescribed regimen for both treatment-na\u00efve and switch patients. Biktarvy is on track to overtake Genvoya as the most successful launch in HIV history, as measured by the first 12 months of product sales. Approximately 85% of Biktarvy's U.S. prescriptions came from switches. Of these switches, approximately one quarter came from regimens containing dolutegravir.","Truvada for PrEP continued to grow. We estimate that more than 193,000 individuals were taking Truvada for PrEP as we exited the quarter. Early performance indicators for the HIV prevention and Truvada for PrEP television campaigns launched in the second quarter are encouraging. Since the launch of these campaigns, we've seen active engagement with campaign-related websites and a nearly 50% increase in the number of weekly new subscribers compared to the pre-campaign averages earlier in the year.","Turning to Europe, HIV sales were down 11% year-over-year, primarily due to the availability of generics in several markets. The decline was partially offset by the continued uptake of our Descovy-based regimens which now comprise approximately 70% of our HIV product revenues in Europe. As anticipated, we saw a sequential decline in sales in the third quarter, primarily due to the additional impact of generics in certain countries and the seasonal impact of holiday schedules in various countries. To date, in some countries, the impact from generics has not been as significant as expected.","Since receiving marketing authorization from European Commission in June, Biktarvy has launched in Germany and some of the smaller countries in the EU. In Germany, we are seeing great early uptake where Biktarvy is tracking at least as well as Genvoya for the same period after approval. Also, Biktarvy is already among the top five most prescribed regimens for both treatment-na\u00efve and switch patients, with about a third of the switches coming from dolutegravir-containing regimens. Genvoya remained the number one prescribed regimen for treatment-na\u00efve and switch patients in the EU5 collectively for the sixth consecutive quarter.","Turning to HIV (sic) [HCV] (07:29), product sales for the third quarter were $902 million, down 59% year-over-year and down 10% sequentially. To date, our performance in the HCV market continued to align with our expectations of gradual sequential declines with fewer patients seeking treatment. In September, we announced plans to launch authorized generic versions of Epclusa and Harvoni in the United States in January 2019 through a newly created subsidiary, Asegua Therapeutics LLC.","The list prices of the authorized generics will be comparable to the current net prices of the branded versions. We believe these authorized generics could reduce out-of-pocket expenses for patients, increase pricing transparency, and open up access to our HCV medicines for patients covered by Medicaid. This solution allows us to quickly introduce a lower-priced alternative to our HCV medications without significant disruption to the healthcare system or our business.","Turning to our cell therapy franchise, sales of Yescarta were $75 million for the third quarter, up 10% sequentially. We are pleased with the progress we made with Yescarta since its approval by the U.S. FDA one year ago. We now have 64 centers certified to provide treatment for Yescarta. As we continue to see patient inflows at certified centers, we have also observed variability in volume as some centers enthusiastically embraced this novel therapy and others adopt treatment more slowly.","We've turned our focus to working with centers to enhance patient flows. We are also educating community oncologists about cell therapy and how they can connect their patients to cancer centers for appropriate treatment. We expect to see continued demand as our certified centers gain broader experience with Yescarta and community oncologists become increasingly aware of this life-saving therapy.","Recently, CMS approved an NTAP, new technology add-on payment, to assist the reimbursement of CAR T therapy within the hospital setting while we await the creation of a CAR T-specific DRG through CMS. We're very encouraged with the speed in which CMS has recognized the value of Yescarta for cancer patients who have run out of treatment options in relapsed\/refractory DLBCL. We look forward to working with CMS to create a dedicated DRG code reflective of the value Yescarta brings to patients.","As I previously mentioned, Yescarta was approved in the EU towards the end of August. We are working diligently across Europe to certify approximately 20 centers by the end of 2018. We are pleased with the progress and commercial performance seen to date with Yescarta, which is consistent with our expectations. Going forward, we anticipate a steady and measured launch as reimbursement, referrals and center logistics improve to accommodate more patients.","Turning to our cardiovascular products, Letairis and Ranexa generated sales of $241 million and $178 million, respectively, in the third quarter. While the U.S. patent for ambrisentan, the active agent in Letairis, expired in July of this year, we have not seen any impact to our sales as a result of the loss of exclusivity because the single-shared REMS program necessary to allow generic ambrisentan to launch has not yet been FDA approved. There is no specific PDUFA date associated with this approval and the timeline for FDA action is unknown. As we look ahead, we anticipate Letairis sales to continue for the remainder of this year. However, sales beyond this timeframe are uncertain.","Now turning to expenses, non-GAAP R&D expenses were $844 million for the third quarter, up 13% compared to the same period last year. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $852 million for the third quarter, up 6% compared to the same period last year. The increases in both non-GAAP R&D expenses and SG&A expenses were primarily due to higher costs to support the growth of our business following the acquisition of Kite.","Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the third quarter was 19.9% compared to 25.7% in the same period last year, primarily due to reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate as a result of Tax Reform. On a sequential basis, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was higher compared to the second quarter rate of 13.4% due to a favorable settlement of a tax examination in the second quarter.","Moving to our balance sheet, as of September 30, 2018, we had $30.8 billion of cash and investments. During the third quarter, we generated $2.2 billion in operating cash flow, repaid $1.8 billion senior notes upon maturity, paid cash dividends of $742 million, and repurchased approximately 6 million shares of stock for $449 million. The year is progressing consistent with our expectations, with the exception of the durability of Letairis revenues and the lower impact of HIV generics. The combined benefit from these two exceptions is approximately $400 million.","Therefore, we are raising our full-year net product sales guidance. Net product sales are expected to be in the range of $20.8 billion to $21.3 billion. Our guidance is subject to a number of uncertainties which are outlined in slide 35 of our earnings call presentation. For the full-year, our non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 18% to 20%. All other components of our guidance remain unchanged.","I will now turn the call over to Laura.","Laura Hamill - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thank you, Robin, and good afternoon. I'm thrilled to be part of the Gilead team and appreciate how welcoming everyone has been during my first six weeks as I'm getting to know the critical success factors for our current and future therapies. I've had the opportunity to learn more about Gilead's portfolio by participating in several therapeutic advisory board meetings, scientific conferences, visiting some of our cancer institutions that are providing treatments with Yescarta, and engaging with many passionate Gilead employees. The commercial and field teams have a deep commitment to support healthcare providers as they meet the needs of patients around the world. It's a privilege to be joining Gilead at this time with the introduction of Yescarta as well as Biktarvy, which is on track for an outstanding launch. We are continuing to shift treatment paradigms.","I also want to acknowledge the innovative approach the team has taken in the United States to increase access to our hepatitis C treatments. Next year, our subsidiary, Asegua, will launch authorized generic versions of Harvoni and Epclusa, a medication we believe has a unique clinical profile as a pan-genotypic and pan-fibrotic single-tablet regimen. As we prepare for our next set of launches, we will bring our deep expertise in building new markets, as well as capabilities to compete in existing markets with many therapeutic options.","The teams around the world are motivated by Gilead's mission to bring innovative medicine to more than 13 million patients with life-threatening illnesses.","I look forward to sharing our commercial progress with you during our next quarterly update, and will now turn the call over to John McHutchison.","John G. McHutchison, AO, MD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thank you, Laura. Welcome, and thank you, everybody, for joining us today. I'd like to start by talking about the progress we are making across our later-stage pipeline. As we enter the final quarter of the year and look ahead to 2019, we anticipate readouts from five Phase 3 studies over the next nine months.","The American College of Rheumatology Meeting finished yesterday in Chicago. So I'll begin with some commentary about our work in the area of inflammation, starting with filgotinib, which, as you know, is the selective JAK1 inhibitor.","Last month we announced positive results from FINCH 2, the first of three Phase 3 studies to readout in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. FINCH 2 compares filgotinib to placebo, each added to conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, or DMARDs in 423 patients who have previously not had an adequate response to biologic therapy. Filgotinib was generally well tolerated and met the study's primary endpoint in terms of the proportion of patients achieving an ACR20 at week 12. In addition, key secondary endpoints, including ACR50 and ACR70 responses and the rates of low disease activity and clinical remission were all higher with filgotinib compared to placebo. Importantly for these endpoints, we also noted a dose dependency as efficacy rates were numerically higher with the 200 milligram once daily dose of filgotinib compared to the 100 milligram daily dose. The initial readout of the first Phase 3 data adds to our excitement about the potential of filgotinib, obviously.","We expect results from two other Phase 3 studies of filgotinib, FINCH 1 and FINCH 3, to be available in the first quarter of next year, and if supported by the data, to form the basis of our filings for regulatory approvals globally. As a reminder, FINCH 1 is a 52-week randomized study comparing both doses of filgotInib, plus methotrexate to adalimumab plus methotrexate and to methotrexate alone in patients who have previously had an inadequate response to methotrexate. FINCH 3 is a 52-week randomized study comparing filgotinib alone to methotrexate alone and to the combination of filgotinib plus methotrexate in methotrexate-na\u00efve patients.","Now our ability to file the NDA for filgotinib is dependent on data from the MANTA study. As you may recall, MANTA is a safety study in men with ulcerative colitis that was requested by the FDA and is designed to address non-clinical findings observed in preclinical animal studies. Because our Phase 3 FINCH trials have enrolled more rapidly than anticipated, enrollment in MANTA will likely be the rate limiting factor to filing an NDA in the United States. While we have been making every effort to expedite enrollment, the full impact of the efforts and their impact on the overall timeline are uncertain at this time.","Results from the EQUATOR study, a Phase 2 trial of filgotinib in 131 adults with active psoriatic arthritis were presented this week at ACR in a plenary session and concurrently published in The Lancet. The study also achieved its primary endpoint of improvement in the signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis at week 16. The study demonstrated an impressive ACR20 response of 80% to filgotinib 200 milligrams daily versus 33% for placebo. The ACR50 and ACR70 responses were also significantly higher for filgotinib compared to placebo. Based upon the strength of these data, we are excited to be initiating plans for our Phase 3 program and are enthusiastic about what this may mean for people living with psoriatic arthritis and whose disease is not responded to prior treatments.","Last month we announced that filgotinib met its primary efficacy endpoint in the Phase 2 TORTUGA study in adults with moderately to severely active ankylosing spondylitis. Patients treated with filgotinib achieved significantly greater improvement in the ankylosing spondylitis disease activity score at week 12 compared to placebo. These results which were also published in The Lancet this week compare favorably to those seen with other known DMARDs commonly known to treat ankylosing spondylitis patients. We'll determine the next steps for the program in the coming months.","Finally in the inflammation therapeutic area, I'm pleased to share that a Phase 2 study evaluating three investigational therapies, filgotinib; GS-9876, a Syk inhibitor; and tirabrutinib, a BTK inhibitor in patients with active Sjogren's syndrome has fully enrolled 140 patients.","Now turning to HIV, we presented 96-week data at IDWeek in San Francisco earlier this month from an ongoing Phase 3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of Biktarvy for the treatment of HIV infection in treatment-na\u00efve adults. The data at two years confirmed the efficacy and safety profile of Biktarvy and showed that Biktarvy continued to be well tolerated with no cases of treatment-emergent resistance.","Moving on to liver diseases, The Liver Meeting will be held in San Francisco early next month where we will present data from more than 50 abstracts across our programs in NASH, primary sclerosing cholangitis, hepatitis B and hepatitis C. In NASH, we are advancing multiple investigational compounds for the treatment of advanced fibrosis, that is patients with Stage 3 and Stage 4 fibrosis. Individuals with these advanced stages of fibrosis are at a significantly higher risk of liver-related mortality.","The data being presented further characterize the potential role of three compounds we have in development: our FXR agonist, GS-9674; our ASK1 inhibitor, selonsertib; and our ACC inhibitor, GS-0976. We will also present baseline data from the STELLAR 3 and STELLAR 4, our two ongoing Phase 3 trials evaluating selonsertib as monotherapy that describe the potential role and sequence of non-invasive tests and their ability to diagnose advanced fibrosis. Currently, liver biopsy, which is the standard method to diagnose advanced fibrosis, poses challenges to timely and efficient diagnosis and treatment of patients with this disease.","Before we move on from NASH, I'd like to remind you that we anticipate data readouts from STELLAR 3 and STELLAR 4 in the first half of 2019. We are also pleased to share that the Phase 2b ATLAS study of various combination two-drug regimen in patients with NASH and advanced fibrosis has now closed screening.","We are presenting data from a Phase 2 trial evaluating our FXR agonist in primary sclerosing cholangitis. This is a rare serious disease that causes progressive inflammation and scarring of the bile ducts which can lead to cirrhosis and its complications, including liver failure. There are currently no effective treatment options available for these patients.","And finally at The Liver Meeting, we will also share data from Gilead's ongoing programs directed at achieving functional cure of chronic hepatitis B infected patients. GS-9688, an investigational oral selective toll-like receptor 8 agonist is the subject of several studies to be presented, including the first in human, and Phase 1b results evaluating the drug in patients with chronic hepatitis B.","Turning to cell therapy, we continue to make great scientific progress also during the quarter. In August, we announced that European Commission granted Marketing Authorization for Yescarta as a treatment for adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, after two or more lines of systemic therapy. We are making progress in reaching patients with other forms of B-cell malignancies also, with Yescarta and KTE-X19. Registrational Phase 2 trials are ongoing with Yescarta in relapsed and refractory indolent NHL or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and with KTE-X19 in relapsed and refractory mantle cell lymphoma and adult ALL. We expect to announce additional data and trial updates from our cell therapy program at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting, ASH, which begins December 1 in San Diego. We will share more information with you next month when those meeting abstracts are published.","Separately in oncology, we discontinued the development of andecaliximab, an investigational anti-MMP9 antibody, in gastric cancer, after a Phase 3 study showed a lack of overall survival benefit to primary endpoint. These data are consistent with the results we're seeing with andecaliximab in other therapeutic programs.","We continue to pursue additional technologies and approaches that will allow us to remain the leader in cell therapy. Earlier this month, we announced another research collaboration and license agreement with HiFiBiO Therapeutics to develop technologies supporting the discovery of neoantigen-reactive T cell receptors for the potential treatment of various cancers, particularly solid tumors.","Through this collaboration, we intend to adapt HiFiBiO's proprietary single-cell technology platform to create a high throughput approach that will potentially allow for in-depth screening of TCR repertoires from patient samples to identify both shared antigen and neoantigen TCRs for use in adoptive T cell therapy. Neoantigens arise from tumor-specific mutations that are unique to each patient's cancer, offering the potential for more targeted anti-tumor activity. This area of research has the potential to transform the way we might be able to treat many solid tumors.","I would like to also note that these kinds of scientific collaborations are not limited to cell therapy. In September, we entered into a strategic collaboration with Precision BioSciences to develop therapies targeting the in vivo elimination of HBV or hepatitis B virus with Precision's proprietary genome editing platform, ARCUS. We are committed to developing therapies that achieve a functional cure for patients with chronic hepatitis B virus. We are excited about the potential of genome editing and Precision's ARCUS technology, which has already demonstrated promising in vitro activity.","We have achieved a great deal across our R&D organization this quarter, and I am confident we will continue to make significant progress throughout the rest of the year. I'm excited about the strength and diversity of our pipeline, as described today, the breakthrough work we are doing in cell therapy and the cutting-edge research we are doing to advance curative therapies, both for hepatitis B and HIV-infected patients. I want to take the opportunity to thank our R&D organization and all of our employees for their incredible focus, hard work and execution.","So, thank you all, and now I'd like to turn the call over to John Milligan.","John F. Milligan, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thank you, John. Good afternoon, everyone. As we approach the end of the year and head into 2019, we have many reasons to feel confident about the strength of our business and the future of our company. Our long-term leadership in HIV continues. We're having a terrific launch with Biktarvy, which is exceeding our high expectations and is on track to become the most successful ever in HIV through the first year of sales. We also have compelling evidence correlating the use of Truvada for PrEP with declines in new infections in the United States, further demonstrating its importance as an effective, public health intervention in the ongoing efforts to meaningfully decrease new infections.","While great progress has been made in both treatment and prevention over the last two decades, we believe there is still plenty of room for innovation in HIV. We are pursuing research that could help patients who have run out of options as a result of viral resistance or who may need less frequent dosing than afforded by a daily pill. And finally, we hope that our research may one day help lead to a cure, completely removing the virus from patients once and for all, as we did for patients in HCV.","In HCV, we continue to innovate to expand access and support efforts toward elimination of the virus from the human population. In January, just over five years after the launch of Sovaldi, our newly-formed subsidiary, Asegua, will launch authorized generic versions of Epclusa and Harvoni in the United States. We believe this will help reduce out-of-pocket expenses for many patients, increase price transparency and open up access to our HCV medicines for patients covered by Medicaid, without disruption to the broader healthcare environment.","One year after the acquisition of Kite, Gilead is the leader in cell therapy and Yescarta access for people with relapsed\/refractory DLBCL is now established in over 60 centers in the United States. Yescarta has shown an unprecedented duration of response in clinical studies, and we have now treated nearly 700 patients across clinical trials and commercial use. The high percentage of patients showing a durable response following the single cellular fusion gives us a glimpse into the potential of cellular therapy to radically change the cancer treatment paradigm in the future, perhaps across many different tumor types. Over the last year, we have established six technology product-based partnerships that will allow us to build on our leadership position in cell therapy and transform the treatment of cancer.","We have a maturing pipeline and are now beginning to see the first of many Phase 3 readouts of filgotinib in inflammation. We are pleased that the efficacy and safety of filgotinib looks to be consistent with the datasets from the long-term Phase 2 studies and believe filgotinib shows great promise to help patients in a number of different indications.","Finally, Gilead has dedicated enormous resources to understanding the biology and pathology of NASH. These efforts are paying off with three compounds in the clinic, including an extensive array of Phase 2 combination studies. Next year, we'll see the first Phase 3 readouts of selonsertib as the STELLAR 3 and STELLAR 4 clinical studies are completed and unblinded. We look forward to seeing the data, and our teams are hard at work preparing for the launch of selonsertib into this brand new disease area.","The work of Gilead goes on, even as I prepare to depart at the end of the year. To everyone who has supported us in our mission over the years, thank you. I have every confidence in my team's ability to continue the work of bringing forward therapeutics that dramatically improve lives. To Gilead's more than 11,000 employees, I also want to thank you. It's been a privilege to be your leader for the last three years and to work with you for the last 29. It's been deeply gratifying to be part of a company that has brought life-saving treatments to 10 million people around the globe. I look forward to watching the continued evolution of Gilead and the extraordinary things I know you will accomplish.","So, let's open it up for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, today's question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. Our first question comes from Geoff Meacham with Barclays.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for the question. John, really will miss your leadership and I want to add congrats also to Laura on the new role.","Laura Hamill - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thank you.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just had a few on HIV. If you guys could give any more perspective on switches to Biktarvy, beyond dolutegravir, are you seeing switches from generic regimens as well? And then on PrEP, I know you don't have data yet, but what's the initial thought on positioning for Descovy over Truvada and how do you think that plays out following the Truvada LOE? Thank you.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","So, in terms of the switches, Geoff, as I mentioned, we are seeing that the majority of the Biktarvy prescriptions are coming from switches, about 85% to be exact. And approximately a quarter of those are coming from dolutegravir-containing regimens. There is also about 25% coming from Genvoya as well. So (35:57) balance. Then the latter half of your question, Geoff, if you can repeat it?","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Descovy for PrEP.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Oh, Descovy for PrEP. (36:05), John.","John G. McHutchison, AO, MD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yes. John here. Look, the question of Descovy versus Truvada for PrEP, people who are healthy, which the people who are taking PrEP are, deserve and want the easiest and safest and best tolerated medication. So, that is Descovy. So I think that's a pretty straightforward answer to that question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets.","Brian Abrahams - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks very much for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. On filgotinib with the Phase 3 starting to rollout, I was wondering if you could provide your latest views on what you see is the key differentiating features or indications, and maybe walk us through your latest plans in how you're thinking about building out a commercial infrastructure in inflammation, particularly with some of the new leadership now in place. Thanks.","John G. McHutchison, AO, MD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","So I'll start first. So, after attending ACR this week and being at the meeting, it's clear that the efficacy that we are generating in multiple inflammatory diseases with filgotinib is as good or if not better than any other drug in the class, and equivalent to the biologics. And that holds true for FINCH 2 where we just saw the most difficult patients to treat, the biologic non-responders, inadequate responder patients where our ACR20 rates in people who had received three or more biologics previously was over 70%, just over 70%. So, I think efficacy wise, we are as good if not better than anything else out there in the class.","Safety wise, we continue to see the differentiation based upon the lab parameters, the lack of anemia, the lack of effect on platelets and when we look at other clinical events such as thromboembolic events and other events, we are not seeing anything difference. We have to see that safety benefit and advantage hold up in the subsequent Phase 3 clinical programs.","The same as the other diseases. We are seeing those benefits as well. So, I'll hand it over to the other folks about the commercial build out, et cetera.","Laura Hamill - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","So, hi. This is Laura. I would say on the commercial structure, we will build a commercial field team that is competitive across all indications and as you know, we are aware of the investment that's necessary to compete in this market and we will be reaching consumers in innovative ways to make sure that they are aware of the profile that we'll be able to bring to the market to help them.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Yee with Jefferies.","Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Appreciate the question. And, John, I'm sure we all heard the emotion in the voice, so we appreciate all the work you've done and for all the years. I guess my question is, it feels like the Street has two uncertainties; one is a bit on hep C and one is, I guess, to an extent, an update on the new leadership that would give people confidence going forward. Perhaps you can give a comment as to your confidence around the U.S. hep C market stabilizing and whether there's any changes and how did authorized generic helps that, if at all. And then if you can make a comment on where we stand on the leadership change, I think that would help people as well. Thanks.","John F. Milligan, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yeah, hi, Michael. So let's just \u2013 talking about the U.S. hep C market, what we have seen through the course of the year is a fairly stable pricing environment but, of course, declining patient numbers, particularly in the commercial markets and to some extent the Medicare markets. So we think the authorized generic will actually boost us for the future because number one, it provides more transparency, which is good for everybody. It will take away some of the pain of the co-pays that are provided, especially into the Medicare population. But most importantly, it'll open up access for us into the Medicaid population, which is the largest growing segment of patients for the future. So we think that all this will enhance our ability to compete for the future and really help stabilize this market going into 2019 and beyond. So all-in-all, a very positive thing for us.","With regard to the CEO search, I really can't say anything specific, other than to say there are many candidates who are very interested. The process is moving along quickly, and we certainly hope to have somebody announced before the end of the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I had one related to some of the Kite programs. I noticed in the slides you indicated that you'd be making a decision on your BCMA CAR, whether to move into a registrational study in the fourth quarter. I'm just wondering what data you're waiting for to make that decision and how you're going to communicate that decision. Thanks.","John G. McHutchison, AO, MD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Sure. Hi, Michael.","John F. Milligan, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Matt, this is Matt.","John G. McHutchison, AO, MD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Matt, sorry. Look, yes, it's unchanged. We are waiting for data from the Phase 1b trial, which is looking at escalating dose cohorts of the safety and efficacy in myeloma patients of KITE-585. And then we'll announce the start of a Phase 2 trial if the data supports that. So no change to what we've said previously and we're in the process of that right now.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges with Leerink.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you very much. And, John, I just want to congratulate you on all the accomplishments over those 29 years. I'm sure if you have any free time, John McHutchison might lend you his AO (42:13) for a bit of travel. I just wanted to ask John McHutchison a little bit about a couple of pipeline contingencies. First, you mentioned the MANTA study. And obviously, you'll have the three FINCH studies by the \u2013 in the first half of the year. Is it possible that, that filing could be delayed until 2020? Or is there any way you could start filing with the clinical data and then append the MANTA data to the filing? And then secondly, will you have a chance to look at the interim data from the combination NASH study and then potentially contemplate pivotal trials to some combination earlier than the 48-week data? Thanks.","John F. Milligan, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yeah.","John G. McHutchison, AO, MD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thank you, Geoff. Starting with MANTA, great question. We have spent an inordinate amount of effort trying to enhance the enrollment in the MANTA study. It's too early to gauge the effectiveness of those modifications to inclusion criteria, et cetera. I think we'll provide an update in the future when we can have more clarity about the timeline. I will say we are having discussions internally and with regulators about different options, as one of which you outlined as well. And as you know in various parts of the world, you can file and you can file updates at various different times of the review process. So each region and each area is different. So we're having all of these discussions and spending a lot of my effort and a lot of the team's effort on that as well.","In terms of the ATLAS, your second question, in terms of the ATLAS Phase 2b 350 patient NASH combination study, yes, we will take a look at week 24. And week 24 look we're allowed to do in the statistical analysis plan. It's not biopsy-driven and it's driven by MRA FibroScan, lab tests, MRI-PDFF. So we will be able to have a look. And if there's clear separation without biopsy, we can decide to move early into Phase 3 if we're convinced that's the right thing to do.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Citi.","Greg Harrison - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. This is Greg Harrison on for Robyn. Thank you for taking the question. So in hep B, given the Arrowhead data we've seen recently, do you think that you need an S antigen component in your combos? Or are you satisfied with what you have internally?","John G. McHutchison, AO, MD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","I don't think we're ever satisfied with what we have internally. And we have a number of internal programs that are looking at interfering in S in various different ways, either by direct mechanisms or through induction of HBV-specific immunity. And we are also always looking for what we think is additionally valuable to what we are doing internally, externally as well. We are watching the siRNA field closely also and aware of what Arrowhead's done. We look forward to seeing the data presented in full at AASLD.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Umer Raffat with Evercore.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And John, wanted to extend our congratulations on all of your's and Gilead's success over the years. My question was perhaps two-fold. One, going forward for the new CEO, is there specific expectations that the board has set? May that be on specific M&A targets, dollar size, number of transactions? Just wanted to get a flavor for the direction for the company and board's expectations. And then secondly on CAR T, we heard your commentary on the variability in adoption. And my question is, Street has a 50% growth over the next four quarters for Yescarta franchise. And given how important a launch it is, my question is, do you remain confident in that type of growth trajectory?","John F. Milligan, PhD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","So first let me start with the specific criteria for a new CEO. No, that's not typically how things are done. There are conversations and looking at different strategies that a new CEO could bring to Gilead. But, no, there are no specific targets or directions that were given by the board.","So secondly, and question about CAR T is a good one. So if you think about CAR T and you think about the shift in paradigm that has to occur in a treatment center to adopt it, it requires lots of collaboration across multiple departments. It requires novel ways of thinking about billing and treating patients. And it takes time for these centers to come up to speed. The centers that were early adopters of CAR T and are still the biggest users of Yescarta, have a lot of experience and have kind of worked out the treatment, and frankly, business paradigm of cellular therapy. And that's where we're seeing the majority of our success today.","The middle adopters and now the late adopters are the groups that are really trying to figure out how to make this work within their institution and how to make this business model work for their hospital in particular and that can take some time. So what we would expect is that as these centers start to treat, as they work out how to build the commercial plans, as they figure out how to get reimbursement for Medicare patients, this will grow over time. And, of course, we'll see some centers that have greater adoption and some that have less.","So, I do think that with the data that are emerging on CAR T with the growing body of evidence that a high percentage of patients can have very durable responses, this is something that will grow to become of importance in all 60 centers that we're in. But it is going to take some time to get the growth rate that we need. I won't comment to any specifics. But I am very confident that as we get better at this, as the medical practice gets better, as we get better at managing some of the side effects around this, and then importantly in the future, as we get a DRG code, this will grow into a very important business for Gilead. And it will be very, very important for patients who have run out of options.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alethia Young with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Alethia Young - Cantor Fitzgerald","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on Biktarvy. And John, you certainly will be missed and we truly enjoyed seeing your leadership over such a long tenure. I guess I have a question on HIV and generics in Europe. You said obviously you've seen some impact and there actually have been some countries where you haven't thought \u2013 you thought you would see impact and didn't. So, can you talk a little bit more about those certain dynamics there? Thanks.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Sure, Alethia. Congrats on your new role as well. Yeah, we continue to see adoption of generics across Europe. I think what we're seeing is differentiation across the different countries relative to timing and the uptake of generics. We talked about the uptake of Descovy. That continues to go really well and we think that's thwarting some of that uptake. Particularly in Italy and UK, we're just not seeing the uptake of generics as quickly as we thought they would take hold. And that's something that we've factored into our guidance to the tune of $100 million. I think even in 2019, we'll continue to see uptakes of generics but with the launch of Biktarvy, et cetera, we think we'll be well competitively positioned and think all the benefits of Descovy will help us to continue to grow share in our ex-U.S. markets.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Nadeau with Cowen.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. John, let me add my congratulations on all that you've accomplished and best of luck on your next act. My question is on the guidance. It looks like that even at the top end of the guidance, you're projecting a sequentially down quarter in Q4. I'm curious to get a little bit more information on what elements do you think are going to have a quarter-over-quarter decline? Is that HCV? Is that EU HIV? Any information you could give us would be appreciated. Thanks.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Sure, Phil. I won't go \u2013 again, we kind of gave a base of our guidance. First, let me just say we're really very satisfied with how the year has gone and the ability to raise guidance at this point. Everything that we've talked about from HIV being a growth franchise to HCV stabilizing, Yescarta continuing to have a nice slow and steady build, I mean I think overall, all of our franchises are performing very well. There's a couple of dynamics. You mentioned a few. One HCV, as we said, while stabilizing, we do continue to see declines in patient starts because that's the primary driver.","Recall we talked last quarter about a price freeze for the next six months, which if you think about a typical Q4, we sometimes see inventory build in Q4 in advance of that price increase. And I'm not saying we won't have any inventory build, some of that is just part of supply chain, but we do anticipate that there may be a little less. And as I mentioned, the other driver of our raise in guidance was Letairis and the LOE, which is here. We haven't seen any impacts. That could happen, right. So we are providing a range of guidance but we're very confident with our ability to meet the guidance and hope to overachieve it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess first to John, congrats again on a really great run. So I guess my question is on Biktarvy on the heels of another really impressive quarter for the product. I'm just curious if there was any meaningful contribution from inventory build or any other type of one-time item? Or is this really all just demand-driven? Thanks.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hi, Cory. Great question. No, our sequential growth was all demand driven. We didn't see really any change in inventory and as you're probably recalling last quarter, I talked about the fact that we were at a 50\/50 payer mix between commercial and government and there was the chance that that would have shifted back to what we've traditionally seen, 45% commercial, 55% government. But we didn't see that. And these payer mix percentages do fluctuate quarter-to-quarter really depending on the buying patterns from government payers, such as ADAP. So, overall, a strong demand-driven quarter for Biktarvy and HIV overall, no impact from inventory or payer mix.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just a couple of follow-ups on Biktarvy and the TAF portfolio. First, can you just comment on European pricing dynamics for Biktarvy now that you're a little bit further in and maybe help us think about that heading into 2019? And then can you guys disclose total TAF volume in Europe right now? I know you give us that for the U.S., but just wondering where it stands in Europe? Thank you.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yeah, Terence, it's hard to talk about volume because of generics. We do talk about TAF or Descovy based as a percentage of revenue, and it's about 70% of revenues in U.S. Pricing really hasn't been a barrier, keep in mind we price \u2013 our Descovy regimens are pretty much priced similar to Stribild, et cetera, in the way of (54:39) Biktarvy. So it's really been good overall uptake. I think we'll always see competitiveness in European pricing, but that's something that we're used to. So, it really fundamentally has been just the desire from more and more patients who want to move to Descovy-based regimens that has been driving our performance offset by the adoption of generics.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions, and congrats to John as well. So, first one on Yescarta, I think, Robin, you mentioned that now you do have this new technology add-on payment. I was wondering how much that helps the adoption for Yescarta under that? And how much is this financial loss is actually stopping the centers from adopting Yescarta?","And then secondly, we noticed that you have exclusive status with Express Scripts for 2019 and Mavyret from AbbVie was excluded. Does that mean there is additional pricing concessional rebate provided by Gilead? Thank you.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","So, let me start with the prior question, Ying. I think as always is our case, we are always working and negotiating with payers. I can't talk specifically to the details of the contract, but we are happy that we have reached the formulary ranking with Express Scripts, and it's something that we've talked all about that we continue to be out there competing in this marketplace. There's us and Mavyret, and we continue to do well.","I think to your other question relative to Yescarta, yeah, the NTAP as I said, it's a start. As we understand it, it's about 50% of reimbursement. To sit and tell you what every hospital makes or doesn't make, that's very hard for me to comment on. That's very dependent on their relationship with the payers, et cetera. So, I can't give you more details on that. I do think the NTAP is a start, and we are working very, very diligently and hard to continue to show the value of this treatment, and hopefully eventually see DRG specifics for CAR T therapy.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from Steven Seedhouse with Raymond James.","Steven Seedhouse - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi. Thank you for taking the question. Just on NASH, understanding the hope is obviously that both STELLAR 3 and STELLAR 4 succeed. I'm curious if there is a viable filing strategy or path forward for either monotherapy or combination therapies for selonsertib in basically refined fibrosis subset of NASH patients if one of those two Phase 3 trial hits the primary endpoint or have you designed the clinical program such that both Phase 3 trials need to work to move selonsertib forward? Thank you.","John G. McHutchison, AO, MD - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","So, it's a good question regarding the STELLAR programs, and I think the answer to your question lies in the STELLAR programs where our discussions with regulators were around both trials independently, but I think everybody understands that a third of patients with F3 really have F4, and a third of patients with F4 have F3. So, if for example there was a situation where one trial was positive and one trial was negative, we would be able to look at different subgroups of patients, but that would be a completely unscripted discussion that would just depend on what the data looked like at that time.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's question-and-answer session.

(Operator instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Patrick O'Brien","Thank you, Stephanie. Good afternoon, everyone. We issued a press release this afternoon providing earnings results for the first quarter, which is available on our website where you can also find detailed slides that support today's call.","For our prepared remarks and Q&A, I am joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, John Martin; our President and Chief Operating Officer, John Milligan; our Executive Vice President of Research and Development, Norbert Bischofberger; our new Executive Vice President of Commercial Operations, Paul Carter; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Robin Washington.","Before we begin our formal remarks, we want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including plans and expectations, with respect to our product candidates, financial projections, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in our latest SEC disclosure documents and recent press releases.","In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. We will be using non-GAAP financial measures to help you understand our underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in our press release as well as on our website.","I will now turn the call over to John Martin.","John Martin","Thank you, Patrick, and thank you all for joining us today. The first quarter of 2014 was an important step towards realizing a number of milestones for the business, particularly in hepatitis C. Earlier today we reported product sales of $4.9 billion, an increase of 104% year-over-year. This increase was driven by the launch of Sovaldi.","Sovaldi's profile has the potential to transform the treatment of hepatitis C and the rapid uptake speaks to a significant unmet medical need. I couldn't be more proud of the teams at Gilead, who rapidly brought this product to market supported by a robust data package of data from many clinical studies. Paul Carter will discuss the launch in more detail.","Moving to other advances in hepatitis C, FDA granted a PDUFA date of October 10, for the single tablet regimen of once-daily combination of ledipasvir\/sofosbuvir for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infection in adults, and also advised us that an advisory committee would probably not be necessary.","In addition, the European Marketing Authorisation Application for ledipasvir\/sofosbuvir has been validated and has been granted accelerated assessment by the European Medicines Agency, a designation for new therapies and medicines of major public interest. If approved, this STR could be available for marketing in EU by the end of 2014.","On April 2, in a press release, topline data were disclosed from a Phase 3 study of sofosbuvir\/ribavirin dosed for 12 weeks in genotype 2 hepatitis C infected patients in Japan. In this study, 98% of treatment na\u00efve and 95% of treatment experienced patients achieved SVR12. This study will support regulatory submission in Japan by mid-year.","Earlier this month, at the 49th Annual European Association for the Study of the Liver, EASL, was held in London. At this meeting, new data on Gilead's products and liver diseases programs were presented in 15 oral talks and over 40 posters, including results from three Phase 3 studies, ION 1, 2 and 3 on the ledipasvir\/sofosbuvir fixed-dose combination. Concurrently, the results of these three studies were also published online in the New England Journal of Medicine.","Other presentations at EASL show that both, sofosbuvir\/peg\/riba and sofosbuvir\/ledipasvir with or without ribavirin are viable regimens for the retreatment of patients who had failed previous regimens, including sofosbuvir and containing regimens. In these studies, retreatment resulted in SVRs of 74% to 100%.","In addition, results from our Phase 2 study evaluating GS-5816, the next generation pan-genotypic NS5A inhibitor were presented. Treatment of patients with genotype 1 through 6 with GS-5816 with sofosbuvir for 72 weeks resulted in SVR12 rates of 86% to 100%. Initiation of Phase 3 studies of a fixed-dose combination of GS-5816 and sofosbuvir are expected later this year.","Earlier this month, WHO published guidelines on screening, care and treatment of persons with HCV infection. This quick action by the World Health Organization signals recognition of the recent advancements in the treatment of hepatitis C.","Now, turning to HIV. The two Phase 3 studies comparing the single tablet regimen of ECF TAF in Stribild in treatment na\u00efve patients are fully enrolled and we expect data to become available in the fourth quarter of 2014. In addition, this STR is being evaluated in a number of other studies, including treatment experience patients, patients on stable therapy, who are switched to ECF TAF, patients with mild-to-moderate renal impairment and also in adolescent patients. We currently anticipate filing for U.S. and European approval of ECF TAF in the first quarter of 2015 for na\u00efve, experienced and switch indications.","In oncology, we continue to prepare for the potential approval and launch of idelalisib. The relapsed CLL application was assigned a priority review with a PDUFA date of August 6, and the relapsed refractory iNHL application was assigned a standard review with the PDUFA date of September 11.","As I mentioned earlier, I am proud of what the team has accomplished with the launch of Sovaldi, and I also want to acknowledge the contributions on other important activities by more than 6,000 employees at Gilead.","I will now turn the call over to Paul Carter.","Paul Carter","Thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. In the first quarter of 2014, our worldwide total net product revenue increased to $4.9 billion, representing growth of 104% over the prior quarter of last year.","U.S. sales exceeded $3.6 billion and for the very first time European sales exceeded $1 billion in a single quarter. This performance has been driven mainly by healthy demand in our core HIV business and the launch of Sovaldi, which itself had sales totaling $2.3 billion in the quarter.","Off that number, $2.1 billion represent the U.S. sales and most of the remaining revenue came from Germany and France. We had Sovaldi sales in 13 countries worldwide and that number will continue to increase as regulatory approvals and reimbursements are achieved.","Beginning with the United States and HIV, underlying demand was healthy for all products. Nine out of 10 patients new to treatment were prescribed the Gilead medicine, with Gilead's single-tablet regimen being used by seven out of 10 patients new to treatment.","Stribild continued to be the leading HIV regimen for patients that were beginning therapy, capturing three out of 10 prescription growth that Gilead's single-tablet regimens, including Stribild, Complera and Atripla is just under 20% year-over-year.","ADAP purchasing in the first quarter was strong, consistent with expectations for the last quarter and ADAP fiscal year. During our fourth quarter call, we highlighted that approximately $130 million to $150 million of our fourth quarter revenue were related to inventory build across the supply chain to yearend.","In the first quarter, as expected, we saw a drawdown at this inventory, as the big 3 wholesalers' inventory levels declined to near the bottom of established ranges. In addition, we also saw a drawdown by sub-wholesalers.","This is in fact a similar dynamic to that which we've seen in first quarter over the past several years. This collected inventory drawdown resulted in a sequential decline in HIV net product revenue. The underlying demand for Gilead HIV product is however strong and growing, especially for our newest single-tablet regimen Stribild and Complera.","Moving to U.S. hepatitis C performance. Sovaldi sales of $2.1 billion show strong patient demand and the increased inventory levels necessary to support this demand across the supply chain. Since launch, approximately 30,000 patients have begun treatment for hepatitis C with Sovaldi and these have come from all the main pair groups.","The first patient who began 12 weeks of treatment around the time of approval last December have yet to reach the timeframe, when they can achieve an SVR12, which occur the further 12 weeks after completing treatment. Nevertheless, we continue to hit positive reports from physicians about their experience with Sovaldi.","The prescribing of Sovaldi in the U.S. has been driven mainly by hepatologists and gastroenterologists, but internal medicine specialists and primary care physicians, many of them also treat HIV patients have also prescribed. Despite the broad spectrum, we estimate that only half of the physicians visited by our therapeutic specialist have prescribed Sovaldi to date.","This leaves us optimistic about the opportunity that lies ahead. In fact, with an estimated 1.7 million diagnosed patients in the U.S. and around 400,000 under treated care, we have to take just a small fraction of those who can benefit from treatments in the future.","The genotype distribution of patients that have received treatment is representative of the U.S. HCV population. With around 70% usage in genotype 1 and the majority of this usage is being with the so called NEUTRINO regimen or a 12 week regimen in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin.","On the payer front, access to Sovaldi has been as we expected, with its formulary status consistent with our experience in HIV reimbursement. Most commercial, Part D and state Medicaid plans take full six months to review new drugs.","Turning to Europe. We are very pleased with our strong HIV performance, which like the U.S. is underpinned by our belief in the benefit the patients of single-tablet regimen. Eviplera is the most prescribed regimen for treatment na\u00efve HIV patient and also continue to expand its lead over Atripla as the regimen most commonly switch to in the big 5 European market.","By the end of the first quarter, we have launched Stribild in 19 countries across Europe. This includes recently in France, which represents the biggest single HIV market in the EU. It is also just this month been launched in Italy, so is now available to patients in all of the European Union big five market.","I would like to highlight that in early launched countries like Germany, the performance of Stribild has been approximately double out of Eviplera at the same time point. Regional reimbursement in Spain and Italy is expected to continue to roll out during the rest of the year.","Moving to Hepatitis C. The European sales for Sovaldi totaled a $164 million in the quarter. While Sovaldi has regulatory approval in the European Union, full pricing and reimbursement, is a country-by-country process with some countries completing that process more quickly than others. Today we have reimbursement in Germany, Austria, Sweden, Finland and to some extent France.","As mentioned in the prior earnings call, we have filed health economic dossiers with all the major reimbursement agencies and we are following the normal process that leads to price and reimbursement approvals.","In France, after completing or completion of the temporary authorization for use or ATU program, but prior to completion of full reimbursement stages, we continue to provide Sovaldi to patients who have pre and post-liver transplant and also patients with advanced liver disease who have failed other HCV treatments or are interferon intolerant. This is in line with the ATU scope and will widen when full reimbursement is agreed.","In the U.K., the National Health Service in England has recently issued a statement confirming that they have approved the filing to Sovaldi for approximately 500 patients. Notably, this is funding pre-NICE approval and recognizes the urgent need for Sovaldi for sicker patients.","The European Association for the Study of the Liver or EASL, just last week published their clinical practice guidelines on the management of HCV infections. Sovaldi is recommended in combination with other agents across all genotypes as well as in several difficult-to-treat groups. These EASL guidelines come soon after newly issued guidelines in Germany and France, which also both recommend Sovaldi.","Outside of North America and Europe, we continue to expand our geographic footprint. I would like to highlight that we are making good progress building out our Gilead organization in Japan in the anticipation of sofosbuvir approvals during 2015.","In closing, I'd like to provide an update on our commercial readiness for oncology. As John mentioned, we have filed for regulatory approval in both the U.S. and EU for idelalisib for using iNHL and CLL. We have completed hiring the U.S. therapeutics specialist team and have fully trained in end-markets. So we are ready and excited to launch idelalisib. A similar process is being followed in Europe consistent with anticipated regulatory and reimbursement timelines.","I'd now like to hand the call over to Robin.","Robin Washington","Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon everyone. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for our first quarter 2014 were $1.48. Total revenues for the first quarter were $5 billion, up 97% year-over-year. As Paul mentioned, similar to prior year's strong wholesaler and sub-wholesaler purchases in anticipation of January 1 price increases for HIV and cardiopulmonary products results in an inventory drawdown in the first quarter of 2014.","Non-GAAP product gross margins were 87.4%, up from 74.5% largely driven by Sovaldi sales and an favorable HIV product mix. Sovaldi's impact to gross margin is a combination of Sovaldi revenues as a percent of total net product revenue and the geographic mix of these revenues, which were 92% U.S. sales in the first quarter. Product gross margin for our HIV franchise was favorably impacted, primarily by lower Atripla revenues.","Turning to expenses year-over-year. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were up $98 million reflecting the progression of clinical study activity, primarily in oncology and HIV. Non-GAAP SG&A spending was up $167 million to support the ongoing lunches of Sovaldi in the U.S. and in cautionary as well as the anticipated launch of idelalisib.","Cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion. During the quarter, we raised $4 billion in debt financing for general corporate purposes, including repayment of debt, working capital and share repurchases. We also repaid $840 million in debt from previous finances and purchased $450 million in shares.","Finally, we are reiterating full year 2014 guidance, which excludes Sovaldi product sales and is outlined on Slide 45. The metrics we provided in February for the impact of Sovaldi product sales still applies to our full year results and includes the following estimates.","Non-GAAP product gross margin will increase by approximately 0.75% to 1% for every $1 billion of Sovaldi sales and non-GAAP effective tax rate will decrease approximately 0.75% to 1% for every $1 billion of Sovaldi sales. In closing, we look forward to updating you on our continued progress in the coming months.","We would now like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Geoffrey Meacham with JPMorgan.","Geoffrey Meacham - JPMorgan","So there's been a lot of payer noise, obviously a lot lately. So I just wanted to get you guys perspective on how you think you could change kind of the conversation from cost benefit to sort of the value of a payer, and this would be for public and private payers. Are there any sort of pharmacoeconomic studies that you guys are doing coming out or just help us a little bit with how to deal with a lot of the headlines that we've been seeing almost everyday from commercial payers and government payers?","John Milligan","Geoff, its John Milligan. So, yes, there is a number of things, I think it's important that we talk about. First and foremost, the value of a cure I tend to think it's under estimated in terms of the overall advantage to the healthcare system receives from it. And I do know, as we have talked to doctors and certainly the tone coming out of EASL has been one of greater understanding of the value that it provides to patients and healthcare systems.","And then, in fact, HCV patients cost a lot of money. The all cost mortality, the overall healthcare cost for an HCV patient is very high. And we are seeing more and more papers now being written on this, as there is a possibility of curing a larger number of patients. And so we do think that's an important part of the dynamic of talking about this, and also talking about the priorities that healthcare systems will likely make as they do choose to treat certain patients now and for certain patients to later.","And these will be difficult conversations, but important ones for doctors and the payer community and public health officials to undertake, as they understand the benefit that they get and try to outline the timeframe from which they wish to tackle this very difficult problem of trying to eradicate HCV from as much of the population as we can.","And so we will be talking quite heavily about these things. There are publications out there not by Gilead, but by respected people in the field, who understand this very well and whoever can start these conversations and more of an academic collegiate way.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.","Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group","I was just wondering if you guys could talk a little bit about -- I mean there has been this conversation out there, but perhaps restricting over time the access for the drug, the patients that are perhaps the most at need, people talk about certain levels of fibrosis. I'd love to get your perspective on that, if you think that that is medically and what your view on that is if you think if that's medically appropriate? And then on the commercial side, just the same question by the way. Do you have any statistics on the market that might help us understand what percentage of patients are F3 and F4, so that we can sort of run those scenarios through our models?","Norbert Bischofberger","I am going to try to answer the first question. So with regards to the price and volume and the overall cost, there are four points to make. The first one is that regimen cost of Sovaldi\/peg\/riba for 12 weeks is not dissimilar from standard of care, either simeprevir or [ph] faldaprevir or peg\/riba for the respective period of time.","Number two, Sovaldi provide shorter treatment durations, higher cure rates and is better tolerated. So there is the value. But the value goes beyond just treating hepatitis C, there is value, as John Milligan mentioned, there is more disease in HCV that is non-hepatic. So if you look at the extra Hepatic mortality, non-HCV related is much higher in the HCV infected population than the control group.","Thirdly, curing somebody for hepatitis C has benefits that go beyond the liver. It's recognized now that hepatitis C is a chronic inflammatory condition that over time leads to more diabetes, more heart disease, more CNS disease and you could certainly reasonably argue curing somebody of their hepatitis C infection has collateral benefits that go beyond the liver.","And we've actually shown that in our own Phase 3 studies. It's a result that's somewhat underappreciated. We have looked at PRO, patient reported outcomes, and we have shown in a blind fashion that the people in the studies that achieve an SVR, they had much better outcomes than those that didn't. And the better outcomes were they felt better, they had less bodily pain and they had even better mental health status.","And we're working as John Milligan said, in putting all of this together into a bigger pharmacoeconomic argument, but to summarize a short answer to your question, I do not believe its medically to prioritize and restrict the cure of hepatitis C. It maybe necessary economically and that's what is going to address.","Paul Carter","Mark, it's actually, this launch is absolutely unprecedented as we've already sort of agreed I think. The data coming in and the kind of patients sort of being treated is not absolutely clear yet. I mean, we got a sense of the genotype, but we don't have a good sense about the severity of fibrosis scores. We have, call it, a sort of qualitative anecdotal comments coming in, but I don't think I'm in a position really to say that proportion of F3 and F4s. I would get it's about maybe 30% or 40%, but that's just a personal guess.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Porges with Sanford Bernstein.","Geoff Porges - Sanford Bernstein","So I suppose I better change the direction just a little bit Robin. Given the cash flow that you reported in the quarter and the new debt you've taken on in a position to be pretty aggressive about either share buybacks or anything else that you would like to do, and yes, the share buyback in the quarter was relatively modest. Could you give us some sense of your thinking about how that might play out? What you'd like to be doing with your cash? How you view the stock here for the balance of the year, because I think that's something that people are starting to ask?","Robin Washington","Absolutely, Geoff. Thanks for the question. I mean our plan has always been to accelerate our repurchases, post the launch of Sovaldi. So you could definitely expect to see larger share repurchases, cash flows and recent debt raise. We have the liquidity to be able to do that. And as you mentioned just given our current stock prices something that we would be able to take further advantage of and reduce the number of shares outstanding.","Geoff Porges - Sanford Bernstein","Robin, do you have sort of goal in terms of percentage of cash flow or amount of cash that you'd like to deploy?","Robin Washington","Not at this point, Geoff. We haven't kind of recalibrated to that. We haven't provided guidance. Again, I'd say, definitely it will be north or higher. But we haven't necessarily rethought our capital strategy, where I can give you a percentage of free cash flow at this point in time.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew Roden with UBS Securities.","Matthew Roden - UBS Securities","So I also want to change directions, Norbert, maybe a pipeline question for you. When I look across your pipeline programs here in your slides, it really striking how many indications maybe addressable with Simtuzumab? So I was just wondering if you can review why you think that that's a drug, what the cadence of readouts will be across the indications? And then lastly, is there any of these Phase 2 readouts could possibly from the basis of an early filing in any of the indications?","Norbert Bischofberger","Simtuzumab was always the preclinical data strongly supported both fibrosis and solid tumors, and lots of [indiscernible] involved than necessary in both and expressed to high levels and both. So we decided to enter solid tumors. We chose pancreatic and colorectal cancer. And we chose to go into fibrosis and we chose IPF in Liver.","And I have to say, all of these studies were done so that when if we see a spectacular effect, that we could potentially file with the Phase 2 data. For instance, the liver study, as I stressed many times, it's powered on HPVT, hepatic venous pressure gradient, that's an approval endpoint according to FDA and NASH, under accelerated approval guidelines.","And the IPF study is similarly powered that we could file with the Phase 2 data, if the data is good. So you know, we feel very comfortable with the program. I know it looks like a lot when you look at the slide, but it's certainly a risk worth taking, this Simtuzumab if it works, it could be a really big drug, a successful drug for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from Phil Nadeau with Cowen.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen","I did want to circle back on to the payers, just for a bit. Could you give us more of a sense of how the negotiations are going, so how many of your target accounts are currently under contract and how does the progress compare to kind of where you thought you would be at this point in time in the launch?","Paul Carter","Well, we can't tell you too much is the honest truth, because we're in negotiation, but everything is pretty much in line with our expectation and our experience with HIV and other drug. So we're in negotiations. We're making good progress. And that's really all I can say at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets","My question is as it relates to sustainability. First part of question is in Europe, I think some of the feedback was that based on the way the budgets are obviously run that one way to control it under a line item annualized budget is to limit it to more of the sicker patients. I guess the first question, do you expect that to happen and should that be your expectation for our revenue models?","But the second part of that is that's also creates a longer tale. Do you expect that that could at some point happen in the United States, does that create a longer tale? How should we think sustainability and as it relates to what you're going to see in Europe?","Paul Carter","Michael, this is Paul here. I think you've got it in one there. Its how to going to be big in short-term or it's going to be longer-term and less each year and I think the European markets, market-by-market have their own economic circumstances. A lot of the Southern European countries that you're fully aware have really tight squeezes on their healthcare budgets.","And they will have to probably prioritize patients at this point or significantly increase the amount of money going into Hepatitis C. So I think we're very confident in our clinical position and the science and our pipeline. So to us, we're very, very comfortable about it. But I think you're right, it's going to be spread out in Europe, typically some of the Southern European countries over a longer time period.","Norbert Bischofberger","Michael, I would like to add something also in this pharma-economic debate and that is that there was a paper published in 2012 in hepatology that looked at the cost of caring for a Hepatitis C infected person and what is apparent from that paper that the cost of not treating is fairly substantial, and actually that paper claims it ranged from $7,000 for a cirrhotic early disease patient to $42,000 per year for somebody with end-stage lever disease. Those are the annual cost of just doctor visits, tests and other care. So that clearly has to be entered into this debate also, although I'm not sure how much of that is applicable to Europe, the cost might be different there. This was a really large U.S. study.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with Wells Fargo.","Brian Abrahams - Wells Fargo","Coming out of the full data presentations and publications for IM1, IM2 and IM3, what your sense as to how physicians might be thinking about optimizing duration of therapy for the overall across different patient groups. For instance, how much eight week usage might expect among treatment na\u00efve genotype 1? How much longer than 12 week usage amongst the treatment experienced cirrhotic? And I'm curious how this as well as some of the current reimbursement buzz we're hearing about factors into your pricing decision for the fixed=-dose combo?","John Martin","Brian, let me answer the first questions, then Paul will talk about the price issue. So we have proposed in our regulatory filing that eight week treatment duration should be for everybody who is treatment na\u00efve and non-cirrhotic. People who are treatment experienced and\/or cirrhotic will 12 weeks of treatment and this is really based that thought process. This follows a thought process where we asked ourselves if we take everybody 12 weeks, how many of the patients would be over treated, would get more than they need. And there were way too many, was north of 90% depending on which population you looked at.","And if you were in London, you may remember, [indiscernible] who did one of our IM presentations. He actually mentioned this at the podium. And given the fact that you can't justify not medically, but certainly not economically over treating patients that for one-third of the duration, they need only 8 weeks, but they get a 12. That I think is a reasonable proposal. And our of course it has too to be agreed upon with regulatory authorizes, but that was our proposal in the filings that we have made.","John Milligan","And I guess, I'll take the second part, this is John Milligan, again. So just thinking about, your question was what do we take into account where putting the price of Sovaldi and Sovaldi was I think price appropriately based on the benefit that it provides today, but we were aware that a significant percentage of patients, particularly those with low risk factors, a new to therapy could benefit from eight weeks in the future with the combination of ledipasvir\/sofosbuvir.","So we did think about this very heavily as we weighed into our debate on what the final price of Sovaldi would be and of course it will weigh into our picking on the next generation of pricing as well as we mature to no ribavirin, no interferon simple regimens for shorter duration still and so we will provide additional benefit to those medications that we have taken always into account as we think through pricing strategies.","Operator","Our next question comes from Yaron Werber with Citigroup.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup","Two questions. One give us a little bit of sense, if you look at the IMS data, which we know on the reports, I mean you've sort of beat at the top end of that handedly, so was there any stalking? And then two, give us a little bit of a sense, what's going on in the VA and in the prison systems. So how much usage are you seeing in those verticals? And if you don't mind, what's your strategy, how to deal with pricing in those verticals, especially if it gets more competitive?","Paul Carter","I think there is three questions. So Robin, do you want to start.","Robin Washington","Yaron, we're only 17 weeks in, in our market at this point and our IMA agreement are not totally inter-passed as we've previously communicated in case of Sovaldi nine months or so to fully get through that process. So while we know that inventory was build this quarter, it is difficult for us to fully quantify it at this point in time in the launch. But I would say, as we continue to get more clarity around demand et cetera going forward, we'll be better able to provide that in the future, but I would say there is inventory, but unfortunately we're not able to quantify it at this point.","John Martin","Maybe I'll just add a couple of comments on VA. So Sovaldi was added to the VA National Formulary during the first week of April. And ultimately be a potentially the largest federal purchaser of healthcare for Hepatitis C in the U.S. We haven't seen a huge amount of orders come in yet, but this is really because it's very, very early days for them. In the prison system, Federal Bureau of Prisons is updating basically the treatment guidelines and we understand those are going to be released imminently and we do anticipate that Sovaldi will be included in those guidelines.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Barclays Capital.","Ying Huang - Barclays Capital","Firstly, can you give us a little bit idea in terms of the payer mix you saw in first quarter? How many patients taking Sovaldi are insured by commercial insurers and then how many coming from Medicare, how many coming from Medicaid? And then also would you mind giving us also the so called growth net adjustment for the first quarter sales of Sovaldi?","Paul Carter","So again, its very early days and our data to some extent is reflecting that. We think about 90% of our business so far in the first quarter has come from both the private and the Medicare sector. And I think that that's probably split roughly half and half. Medicaid is about 70% and the rest is the small balance left over.","Robin Washington","Relative to growth to net, again similar to Paul's response, it's still very early in the launch and as he previously described we're still in the midst of contracting process. So I would say our growth to net percentage now is not necessarily predicted of what it would be going forward, but it is lower, lower than HIV and kind of lower than we project the whole year to be?","Paul Carter","Yes, the mix will change at a time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank","So on this whole concept of prioritizing patients by fibrosis, how would that be implemented? Would it be implemented by the doctor potentially or could it be forced by the payer, and in conjunction with that how do payers and doctors view eight weeks versus 12 weeks. And is eight week an advantage, if you're in that situation where you have prioritization by fibrosis score.","Paul Carter","So there is a healthy, I'm not sure it's healthy, I see tension between payers and clinicians I think at this point. And it's clear that some payers are trying to restrict or prioritize patients with say higher fibrosis scores or sicker patients. And I think clinicians are some times taking a different view of that and it's very hard for us to see how that's worked out from here, but we do hope that the clinician and the science prevails, but over time we're pretty confident that would be the case as payers starts to get used to and to predict better the volumes of patients that require treatment.","Norbert Bischofberger","The other equation is an interesting one that maybe I could summarize it by something that a well-respected thought leader told me. He said, he would prefer 12 weeks of treatment over eight, simply because it is something that's really safe, well-tolerated, why not go for the safe path and give them 12 weeks, it's not that much more. But then he went on to say that he is ultimately not the one that will make that decision, but that decision will probably be made for him by the payers. And how that's exactly worked operationally, I'm unsure, but that's probably what we're thinking.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ravi Mehrotra with Credit Suisse.","Ravi Mehrotra - Credit Suisse","Obviously you are now in very different league from a sales perspective, the market cap perspective, and actually a future-pipeline needs perspective in the long-term. Cognizant to that, you got a lowest R&D budgets, yet the highest operating margin. So philosophically how do you think about R&D and B&D in the long-term to fill out your long-term pipeline?","John Milligan","Our R&D as a percentage of sales has been down fairly dramatically this quarter as you know, which means you can't grow that up to a level that might be more appropriate for a company with the sales levers we're seeing in a very short period of time. It takes a long time to hire the people and to put thoughtful programs into place.","So with regard to R&D, our philosophy is simple, would be to continue to grow, but to grow a reasonable sustainable pace as we add more pogroms and as things mature from research into development. We're seeing quite a number of those happening this year and that I think is quite exciting for us.","In terms of BD, it's somewhat of a similar issue, we're looking for to licensing programs, but we can only grow so fast based on a number of people we have, the complexity of the business and also just the capability of bringing in and bringing programs in and then doing a very good job on them.","So I think we've got a very full pipeline right now. I think it's going to be a thoughtful way forward as we grow the company, and I think we have most of what we need to continue to grow this company for years to come. So that would be very, what I call very targeted kinds of transactions that can help further us along.","John Martin","And if may add something, John, we're going to continue to be disciplined about all of this just because we have more money available, it doesn't mean we're going to spend it. The science has to be right and the medical need has to be right, that's when we're going to do it and not in any other -- under any other scenario.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ian Somaiya with Nomura Securities.","Ian Somaiya - Nomura Securities","On the fast launch, had a question regarding, again, on the pricing front, and actually just wanted to revisit maybe some prior comments that you have made in terms of how we should think about pricing for the combination, specifically that most of the value that was being derived from Sovaldi and that's the way we should think about from a pricing perspective that most of the contribution from price would be from Sovaldi and there would some incremental value or cost associated with the second drug. So I wanted to gets your thoughts on that whether that still holds?","And related question is the conversations that we have with payers are not really focused on Sovaldi on its own, they're focused on the combination and the price point they all seem to have in the mind, whether we think about the U.S. payers or European is the off-label usage of Alicio and Sovaldi and the $150,000 of our price point, but if you could just sort of comment on those things that would be really appreciated?","John Milligan","Ian its John Milligan. It's always difficult to talk about pricing. And let's not forget, we don't have approvals for those products. But as you know as you think about it there were natural limits on what I think is appropriate for a next generation products. And for example, with 5885, we're essentially replacing pegylated interferon and ribavirin, which over a 12-week duration is much less expensive for example than Sovaldi.","So first of all it is the driver, the value in that combination. And then I tend to think about it in that sort of way. And so I think you're right. People are concerned about the combinations of things like Alicio and Sovaldi. And that's really not how we're thinking about next generation products.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Sendek with Stifel.","Joel Sendek - Stifel","I had a question about just the duration of therapy that you're seeing so far. You mentioned about the use with interferon in Roche's report that the sale of the peg didn't really got that much. So I'm wondering if can you just help us with the average duration for example, how many patients or what percentage are on the 24 week Sovaldi ribavirin regimen as opposed to the 12 week combination then what we would expect for the trend in that duration over the next couple of months?","Paul Carter","The data we have is only for the U.S. We think about 70% of patient's are genotype 1 and also 70% -- we think about 65% to 70% are on so called NEUTRINO regimen at 12 weeks of sofosbuvir plus peg\/riba. So I think that that's 12 week piece, the 24 week piece we're not at all sure on.","John Martin","The combination of patients who are on genotype 2 taking 12 weeks and genotype 3 who are taking 24 weeks, but anyway you doing the math with the shorter duration and a high percentage of patients now taking non-interferon-based regimens is not surprising that the interferon sales are declining.","Paul Carter","We think there is about, the U.S. so far around about 7% to 30,000 have been genotype 3.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jim Birchenough with BMO Capital.","Jim Birchenough - BMO Capital","Just a question, as you think about potential competitors coming in later in the year and into next year. Is there anything you can do with payers right now to try and preempt what could be price competition and aggressive discounting just to preserve some level of pricing in this market?","John Milligan","Well, Jim, it's not generally prudent to talk about strategies in public, so that others know what you're doing. So I'm going to decline making any comments on that. Although I do note that it looks to us based on today's filing of the AbbVie regimen with the five drug regimen that they're putting out there, that we should have a considerable leads to market from where they are, since they are over two months behind us in terms of their filing, so that could be an advantage for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Howard Liang with Leerink.","Howard Liang - Leerink","Can you talk about what next in HCV? There's some chatter out of EASL that your dataset in cirrhotic patients now is as big as AbbVie, do you have a plan to do a cirrhotic study? And then also what's the next the regimen you take to Phase 3 in HCV?","John Martin","I'm not sure I understood all your question. You were asking about the comparability of AbbVie's cirrhotic population results with ours?","Howard Liang - Leerink","You've got a big enough -- do you need another study dedicated to cirrhotic patients?","John Martin","Well, I think we have answered the question. AbbVie chose to do a separate cirrhotic study. We have included our cirrhotic patients, and by the results were in that population, AbbVie had 88% and then our subpopulation of treatment experienced cirrhotic patient was 86%, so a similar number. The only thing to remember is AbbVie didn't have experienced patient, really as experienced patients in their study, we did. So comparing the two studies is a difficult thing to do, you'll have to do a head-to-head study.","And I think you asked about what's next about, the thing would be 5816. So what we have now filed ledipasvir\/sofosbuvir for genotype 1 and we're repeating this now with a pan-genotypic NS5A inhibitor in as GS-5816, which would be the one pill, once daily for everybody for all genotypes.","We're finishing up some studies, one the result was disclosed at EASL by Emerson, that show it works against all genotype sofosbuvir GS-5816 combination. We still have with data are coming in right now on the same regimen cirrhotic and we're also looking at shorter treatment durations. When all of that is in we'll make a decision to go in Phase III some time in the second half of this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Harrison - Morgan Stanley","I wanted to ask a little bit back on the payer side and we've heard some commentary out of some of the payers that have already reported about sort of patient volumes and UNH was one of them and they had suggested that based on patient volumes, we're actually peeking for them in the first quarter. So I guess I was wondering, a, if you agree with that? And then, b, sort of as it related to that, what kind of information do you need where you feel like you'll be in a position to give us Sovaldi guidance.","John Milligan","So Matthew, its John Milligan. In terms of the patient numbers, I mean you see the prescription rates as much as we do. We don't necessarily know where those patients come from, so I can't speak to the United Health population whether that is an accurate portray all or not, I assume they know more than we do about those patients and their system.","But as Paul had talked about we have less than 50% of physicians who can prescribe Sovaldi, who have prescribed Sovaldi. And so we also look at the fraction of patients who've been treated relative to the total patients and it's relatively small.","In a typical year about 60,000 patients are treated, near about 30,000 last quarter, and so that put us certainly in a faster pace than the last few years, but certainly far below some of the peak years and well over 140,000 patients were treated. So for one believes there are many, many patients out there who will continue to seek some Sovaldi therapy or who might be looking forward to the combination therapy, as we get later into the year. So I think there is plenty of opportunity out there for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from Thomas Wei with Jefferies & Company.","Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Company","I wanted to ask a little bit about some of the discussion at EASL on the EU countries banding together potentially buying antivirals beyond pandemic vaccines and your take on. How likely is something like that to happen and how the mechanics of that might work? Any insights that you have to share would be very helpful?","Paul Carter","I think this is a wonderful idea and if it could work, it will be great, because we could have one price and access at the same time across Europe. But as we've often said, you can't change a thousand years of history, and if Europe ever managed to get back together on this, I would be absolutely amazed. So that's really my point of view on it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Skorney with Robert Baird.","Brian Skorney - Robert Baird","Let me congratulate you and maybe then one up by saying I think this was actually the biggest single quarter for a pharmaceutical product in U.S. history. It's probably tied I think a couple of quarters in '06 with Lipitor. But anyway, I just wanted to know kind of got going off of John's comments about the number of patients that are out there. Do you have any sense that there is a warehousing going on ahead of all approval? I mean it just seems with six months to go before interferon is totally out of the equation that it'd be a little bit of -- there won't be much rationale for starting non-symptomatic na\u00efve patients. So do you anticipate a depth in new prescriptions in the coming months and anticipation of that? And do you have any kind of guidance on what sort of acceleration we might anticipate post the launch of ledipasvir\/sofosbuvir?","John Martin","It's very hard to determine, if there is warehousing, except by talking to physicians, and we've talked to some of the top KOLs, and it's clear that they are thinking they would like to hold back some of their less sick patients to put them on all oral therapies later on the year. But as I mentioned there is a whole host of the middle-tier physicians, people who don't attend, so who are just now becoming Sovaldi prescribers, who seem to be having a very good experience.","And we don't get any sense that they are all that aware of the next generation coming out or that they wish to slowdown their own practices in order to wait for business later on the year. So I kind of doubt that those physicians would have significant amounts of warehousing, and in fact could likely accelerate their use of Sovaldi as they get into the second part of this year.","Operator","Mr. O'Brien, we have time for one more question. Your final question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs","Just two quick ones from me. John, I was just wondering on the prescriber mix, you mentioned you reached out about 50% or 50% of the targeted audience prescribed. Can you tell us what historically they represent in terms of volumes for those 50%? And then the second question was just, any early feedback on the DTC campaign and what metrics are you guys using there to evaluate the effectiveness of that program?","John Martin","These are getting into the middle-decile of the doctors represent that mix, where they'll exclude the lower tiers, because we tend not to hit those decile one and two doctors frequently. But it's a real middle mix of these doctors who are geographically difficult to get to in some cases and some times could be difficult to see. So that is a really good piece of business for us as well. And the second question was the DTC -- ","Paul Carter","DTC campaign. We really don't have any idea if the unbranded campaign of awareness have had an impact other than a few anecdotes of patients calling their physicians. I think give the stronger than expected early demands, those campaigns, of course, are being rolled back very substantially and you'll see less and less of that in the coming weeks and months.","Patrick O'Brien","Thank you, Stephanie, and thank you all for joining us today.

My name is Chanel, and I'll be your conference operator today. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick O'Brien, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Patrick O'Brien","Thank you, Chanel. Good afternoon, everyone. We issued a press release this afternoon providing earnings results for the quarter. The press release and earnings slides are available on our website. For our prepared remarks and Q&A, I am joined by the Chairman and CEO, John Martin; our President and COO, John Milligan; our EVP of Operations and CSO, Norbert Bischofberger; our EVP of Commercial Operations, Kevin Young; and our CFO, Robin Washington.","Before we begin our formal remarks, we want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements that contains certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control.","These risks include the possibility that our actual financial results may differ materially from the revised guidance we are presenting today.","The possibility of unfavorable results from our clinical studies, including those evaluating the GS 7977, and GS 5885 in various patient populations and the possibility that we may be unable to compete our clinical studies and regulatory filings or obtain regulatory approvals in currently anticipated timelines.","A description of these risks can be found at our latest SEC disclosure documents in our recent press releases. Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update these forward-looking statements made during this call.","We will also be using non-GAAP financial measures to help you understand our underlying business performance.","The GAAP reconciliations are provided in our press release, as well as on our corporate website.","I would now like to turn the call over to Robin Washington.","Robin L. Washington","Thank you, Patrick, and thank you all for joining us today.","We are very pleased with our strong operating results for the second quarter. Product sales were $2.3 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year and 5% sequentially.","The U.S. contributed $1.4 billion of product sales, up 21% year-over-year, driven by strong increased demand across all therapeutic areas.","In the U.S., our early release of Ryan White Federal funds and the desire by states to reduce patient wait lists have contributed to strong year-to-date non-retail performance.","This may impact ADAP purchasing patterns in the second half of 2012.","The state's efforts to reduce ADAP wait lists are encouraging, resulting in a 60% reduction since the beginning of 2012. The current wait lists are at our level not seen since mid-2010.","Our U.S. performance also includes a new milestone for Letairis, which exceeded sales of $100 million in the second quarter.","Europe contributed $786 million of product sales, up 3% year-over-year, driven by increased demand.","From an expense standpoint, operating expenses increased to $729 million, up 24% year-over-year due primarily to the continued advancement of our product development pipeline.","Turning to other financial highlights. Operating cash flows continue to be strong. During the quarter, operating cash flows were $1.3 billion, which includes the collection of $460 million of past-due accounts receivables in Spain, contributing to a 15-day improvement in our DSO, highlighted on Slide 14.","$350 million of bank debt was repaid this quarter and since January 2012, a total of $700 million has been repaid, which further deleveraged the balance sheet and will help achieve a targeted debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.5x by mid-2013.","During the quarter, $241 million or 4.8 million shares of common stock were repurchased and retired.","Finally, we are updating certain aspects of the full year 2012 guidance as outlined on Slide 17.","Net product sales are now expected to be $8.8 billion to $9.0 billion, an increase of $200 million from the prior range.","Non-GAAP R&D expenses are expected to be in the range of $1.45 billion to $1.525 billion due to accelerated clinical studies in liver disease and oncology.","All other aspects of our guidance remain unchanged.","I'll now turn the call over to John Martin.","John C. Martin","Thank you, Robin.","We are very pleased with the continued strong demand for our products and the maturation of the pipeline. During the quarter, 2 successful FDA Advisory Committee meetings were held. One on the use of Truvada for PrEP and one on Quad for the treatment of HIV infection.","Just last week, FDA approved Truvada for prevention of sexual transmission of HIV in high risk individuals.","This is the first approval of an anti-retro viral for pre-exposure prophylaxis, providing another option in the fight against the HIV pandemic.","The U.S. government's commitment to HIV prevention, diagnosis and treatment was also demonstrated by the approval of the first over-the-counter HIV test.","The next U.S. regulatory milestone is the upcoming August 27 PDUFA date for Quad and our scientific and commercial teams are well prepared for the launch.","European Union approval of Quad is anticipated in the first half of 2013.","This past quarter, NDAs and MAAs works for Cobicistat and Elvitegravir were submitted. And this week, the International AIDS Conference is taking place in Washington, D.C.","Gilead presented 3 noteworthy abstracts at this conference. One was on 96-week data from Study 145 indicating that Elvitegravir was non-inferior to Raltegravir when added to optimized background therapy in treatment experienced patient.","In addition, 48-week data from the Phase III study comparing Cobicistat to Ritonavir each in combination with Atazanavir and Truvada showed that Cobicistat was not inferior to Ritonavir and lastly, the SPIRIT study showed that switching completely suppressed patients from a PI containing regimen to the once daily Complera single tablet regimen was not inferior to patients maintaining their PI regimens.","Finally, rapid progress has been made with the HCV Research Program and we now have a comprehensive Phase III development program.","Norbert will cover that in his comments.","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Thank you, John. Before I get to HCV, I would like to state that multiple programs have advanced across all therapeutic areas. In HIV, 2 Phase II studies were progressed which evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2 single tablet regimens, containing a novel product of Tenofovir GS-7340.","One trial, which is now fully enrolled compares a single tablet regimen of Elvitegravir, Cobicistat, Emtricitabine, GS-7340 to Quad and the other study, which should complete enrollment by the end of August compares a single tablet regimen of Darunavir, Cobicistat, Emtricitabine, GS-7340 to the single components of the Darunavir, Cobicistat and Truvada.","In oncology, 2 Phase III clinical trials of GS-1101 for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia has been initiated. These studies in a placebo-controlled fashion compare GS-1101 added to either Rituximab or to Rituximab with Bendamustine in relapsed refractory CLL patient.","My remaining comments will focus on hepatitis C, where progress has been rapid.","At the EASL conference earlier this year, data were disclosed from 2 Phase II studies of a 12-week, 12-week course of GS-7977 and Ribavirin in genotype 1 infected treatment-na\u00efve patients. In the ELECTRON study, the SVR4 rate in genotype 1 na\u00efve patients was 88% or 22 out of 25 patients and in the QUANTUM study, the SVR4 rate in genotype 1 treatment-na\u00efve patients was 53% or 10 out of 19 patients.","I would now like to provide an update on new data from 2 Phase II studies evaluating 24 weeks of treatment with GS-7977 and Ribavirin, in treatment-na\u00efve genotype 1 infected patients.","In the QUANTUM study, 19 genotype 1 patients were randomized to receive 24 weeks of GS-977 and Ribavirin. Of those 19 patients, 10 were 53% achieved in SVR4.","The second trial is conducted by the NIAID, in a cohort of genotype 1 infected predominantly African-American patients, a population which has historically been more difficult to treat.","In that study, of the first 9 patients who completed 24 weeks of treatment with GS-7977 and Ribavirin all 9 or 100% achieved SVR4.","These results from the QUANTUM and the NIAID studies are included in Slides 31 and 32 of earnings slide deck.","In summary, in the various Phase II cohorts, treatment with GS-7977 and ribavirin for 12 or 24 weeks was in genotype 1 infected patients, resulted in SVR4 rates between 53% and 100%.","In May and June of this year, discussions were held with the U.S. FDA and 3 European regulatory agencies, and agreement has been achieved on a comprehensive Phase III development plan for GS-7977 and on a Phase III plan for GS-7977 in combination with the NS5A inhibitor, GS-5885.","The initial NDA and MAA filings will be for GS-7977 and will include data from 4 Phase III studies, 3 conducted in genotype 2\/3 infected patients and 1 in genotype 1 infected patients.","The 3 genotype 2\/3 studies are FISSION, POSITRON and FUSION. FISSION is the first study in 500 genotype 2\/3 na\u00efve patients, comparing 12 weeks of treatment with GS-7977 and Ribavirin to the current standard of care of 24 weeks of treatment with peg-interferon Ribavirin.","The second study, POSITRON, is comparing 12 weeks of treatment with GS-7977 and Ribavirin in 240 genotype 2\/3 interferon intolerant or ineligible patients to placebo.","And thirdly, FUSION is a study in 200 genotype 2\/3 treatment experienced patients exploring 12 or 16 weeks duration of treatment with GS-7977 and Ribavirin.","And all 3 trials, FISSION, POSITRON and FUSION are now fully enrolled. And the last patient in these studies has started dosing just today.","A fourth Phase III study called NEUTRINO is a single arm study evaluating a 12-week course of GS-7977, peg-interferon and Ribavirin in 300 genotype 1, 4, 5 and 6 infected patients.","Screening in the NEUTRINO study is completed and the last patient should start dosing by mid-August.","This same regimen, 12 weeks of GS-7977, peg-interferon, ribavirin, was evaluated previously in genotype 1 patients in a Phase II study, called ATOMIC and resulted in SVR4 rate of 92%.","These Phase IV, Phase III studies are outlined on Slides 33 and 34 in our earnings slide deck.","With these 4 Phase III studies underway, we anticipate being able to file for regulatory approvals for GS-7977 by the middle of next year.","If successful, the initial indication will for 12 to 16 weeks of treatment with GS-7977 and Ribavirin in genotype 2\/3 infected patients, and for 12 weeks of treatment with GS-7977, peg-interferon and Ribavirin in genotype 1, 4, 5 and 6 infected patients.","In PEMARON [ph], we're also advancing GS-7977 in combination with GS-5885 for the treatment of genotype 1 infected patients.","GS-7977 and GS-5885 were successfully co-formulated into a single pill, fixed dose combination.

Chanel?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges, Bernstein.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Norbert, I have to ask the obvious question, which is are the differences between the patients in the 2 Phase II trial arms that you reported, the 7977 Ribavirin, genotype 1 that would explain the gap between 53% and 100%. Anything that you see in either how studies were conducted, the compliance or anything else that would explain that or should we just split the difference?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","No, Geoff, unfortunately I don't have a clear cut answer for you. Of course, we looked at all the obvious base line imbalances. There wasn't really anything there. It seems like at this point, really the QUANTUM study seems to be the outlier. We're seeing better results in ELECTRON and also better results in the NIAID study and I said in my script, that's a population where you actually would have expected lower response rates and yet we get 100%. So I do not understand it, the thing of small numbers and where the ultimate truth lies. I don't know, but either way, I think these numbers are actually a huge improvement with a very simplified, shortened all-oral regimen over where we are today. And that's also reflected by the way when we talk to regulatory authorities that they allowed us to do single arm studies with no control arm, that's a reflection that even regulatory authorities think that the standard of care control arms are not really worth including any more in Phase III clinical studies. So sorry, Geoff, I don't have a really good answer to your question. It's have something we have looked into, but we don't know.","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham, JPMorgan.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Another one on the hep C franchise. So Norbert when I look at Slide 36 with the 7977, 7585 Phase III design, with the second confirmatory study that says TBD. So can we assume that you won't be able to use any 7977 Riba studies alone or do you plan to do that over any duration, 12 or 24-week as part of the regulatory strategy or is that sort of off the table at this point?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","So, Geoff, our current working assumption is that the data that Bristol-Myers generated their study will be replicated in our studies. We have made this argument before that from a virological point of view, the Daclatasvir and GS-5885 are very similar and there's no reason to expect a different result. So if that's the case, then obviously the second study might be a single arm study that looks at the fixed dose combination either with or without Ribavirin for either 12 or 24 weeks depending on how those data come out. So that's what our current thinking is. We do not currently think that GS-7977 Ribavirin will be included because GS-7977 with 5885 has -- its virologically more potent and moreover has the advantage of being much safer in 1 pill once daily, so it's the ultimate frontier In HCV therapy. That's what we want to pursue.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And just as a follow-up to that. When you run the interim analysis or you get that data, could you start the second confirmatory study to save some time. What sort of shortcuts do you feel like you can make or what sort of amendments can you make to accelerate an all oral filing, do you think can still, maybe to the end of '13, not mid-'14?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","So, Jeff, the interim analysis, as I said is on the first -- on the 12-week treatment arms, so if the 12-week treatment arms show high response rates, then, of course, we would immediately be in a position to initiate the second confirmatory study as a very simple, perhaps single arm 12-week duration, fixed dose combination plus or minus Ribavirin and keep in mind, as I said in my script, we also have data from 2 cohorts in the ELECTRON study and be able [ph] to at that time that look at 12-week of treatment with GS-7977 and 5885 and Ribavirin in both null responders and na\u00efve patients. I think with the totality of those data, it should be fairly straightforward to design the second Phase III study.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rachel McMinn, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Rachel L. McMinn - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I think you've answered a lot of the hep C questions, but I just want to be really clear. So regulatory agencies just don't want to see any control versus an interferon arm, so we should expect to your competitors as well to have similar designs? And then also to clarify the population here, this is just treatment-na\u00efve, there is no category around interferon intolerance. And then just a totally separate question on 7340 can you just give us a sense of what antiviral efficacy or excuse me -- what kind of differential you need to see -- are you looking for primarily around perimetral [ph] density. What would be a good outcome there?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","So the first question you asked was about NEUTRINO, of course, I can't speak for our competitors, but I would assume that the same comp set that regulators communicated to us is also applicable to them. So whatever in the future Phase III studies are going to be done might be much simpler studies that do not include a current standard of care control arm, that's the clear message we got and that's why they allowed us to do that single arm Phase III study that by the way, is powered against historical controls. The second question you asked was about 7340. So Rachel, as you may know, the monotherapy data were presented at the last CROI meeting and we showed that 25 milligrams of 7340 actually has higher potency in terms of HIV RNA reductions compared to Tenofovir DF 300 milligrams. Now in a triple combination regimen, higher potency in my mind is almost impossible to show, because all these triple combination therapy are very, very potent. They suppress the virus. So what we're hoping for is to show some benefit in terms of safety and you pointed it out already, one thing that we should be able to show is less of a BMD effect and the other thing we're exploring in terms [ph] of 7340 in advanced -- in renal impairment and maybe we can show some benefit there, but it's not quite clear. But you know, the big thing I think about 7340 will be that physicians will just feel much more comfortable. They do not have to worry about whatever potential, theoretical or hypothetical or real side-effects there are. Don't worry about bone, don't worry about renal, this is the same or higher potency at 1\/10 the dose. So I think it would be a great addition to what we have today.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Brian Abraham, Wells Fargo Security.","Brian Corey Abrahams - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Related to the 7977, 5885 study, just wondering if you have any sense from the FDA or EMA in terms of what they're looking for, for what would be an approvable SVR12 bar just given the lack of standard of care. And also any sense of the bar for your futility there? And then related on NEUTRINO, do you have any sense from payers about what kind of flexibility docs may have to prescribe 7977 if it's approved in genotype 1, but the flexibility they would have to use it in interferon-free regimens before you get the approval for the 5885 combo?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","So Brian, I'm happy to talk about the powering. By the way, the powering for all our Phase III studies is approximately a similar line of thinking and so first of all, keep in mind that we will enroll in our study at least 20% cirrhotic patients. There has been some criticism by the medical community of previous development programs that have studied relatively healthy patients and then the ultimate experience that physicians made was worse than what was observed in Phase III studies because the more advanced cirrhotic patients were not studied. We're not going to do that. So we have 20% target. And by the way, in our FUSION study, we have actually have 30% cirrhotic patients. So that's number one. Number two, we calculated historically what would be an expected response rates in genotype 1 in a population that is 20% cirrhotics and the answer to that is if you look across a lot Tenofovir Resapravir [ph] studies, the answer is 65% is the expected response rate. Now regulators gave us a bonus. They say you don't have to even meet 65%, if you meet 60% that will be perfectly fine because you get the bonus for shorter treatment duration and better safety. So what we have to beat in other words is 60% and let me point out, that's a very low hurdle. If you look at the ATOMIC study, we have 93% -- 92% response rates and so that's how the interim analysis is going to be conducted. If we see in the futility analysis, less than 60% response rate, that will be considered futile. But if we 60% or higher, that will be acceptable. And as I said, my expectation, based on previous Phase II studies and also Bristol-Myers' experienced that we will see much higher numbers than 60%. I hope that answers your question.","Unknown Executive","I guess, the second question was about the flexibility about using combinations. And so as you know, once 7977 is approved. Doctors have the flexibility to prescribe it in the way that they see fit. And I guess, we could imagine that there may be other antivirals approved that could be useful in combination with 7977 during an interim period before we have a fixed dose combination out. My own feeling is that certainly, treatment-na\u00efve patients, and there's a bunch of things we don't understand here including what the cost of the other therapy would be. That in the treatment-na\u00efve patient there would probably be more control over going to a peg-interferon 12-week regimen, but in patients who can't take interferon for various reasons or have failed interferon, I can imagine a scenario where payers will allow those patients to be dosed by combination therapies, but we really have to see how the data play out in those areas too. If there's anything to support those combinations or not.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Matt Roden from UBS.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So your phase III with the combination 7977 and 5885 is contingent on this Phase I bioequivalent study. Norbert, can you give us a sense for whether or not there's any risk or if this is the slam dunk sort of study where you would expect to get adequate exposures a priori. And then secondly, on duration of therapy, it looks like at least in QUANTUM you didn't see any change in the efficacy, whether it's dosed at 12 or 24 weeks. Do you think that there's any read-through to other regimens such as nucleokinesis [ph] [NS5A] combination and whether or not you expect to see any meaningful difference between 12 and 24 weeks with the nucleokinesis [ph] [NS5A].","Norbert W. Bischofberger","So the first question had to do -- by the way I want to state it's not a bioequivalent study, but a bioavailability study. Bioequivalent is very strictly defined by being equivalent to a test regimen. We don't have that. We just want to make sure that roughly the levels of 7977 and 5885 are in the ballpark of what we have seen in the previous studies and while it's always difficult to say what the risk is, I think both compounds 7977 and 5885 are pharmaceutically well-behaved compounds. So we have the first formulation, but needless to say if this first formulation doesn't work out, of course, we have backup formulations that we will then put into development, that would delay the program by 2 months or so. The other question you asked was -- duration of therapy. So again I don't have an answer. I honestly -- I do believe that there should be a difference in duration of therapy. Why we are not seeing that in QUANTUM I do not know. And needless to say, we have looked at everything possible that we could look at. The compliance was not quite what it should have been in QUANTUM, although that's a difficult thing to measure. And the reason why I'm saying there should be a difference with regards to duration of therapy is simply because we have never observed breakthroughs. All our patients that are nonresponders are rebounders. So after you eliminate, after you take 7977 away -- your 7977 and Ribavirin, then the virus comes back. During treatment, we have actually never seen breakthroughs. That's why I think 7977, by itself or with Ribavirin is a very potent, very effective agent. And if you can't cure somebody with 12 weeks by going longer, you should actually get the better outcomes, but unfortunately, I only have the data that we have today and I can't really speculate anymore.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Marshall Urist, Morgan Stanley.","Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So another, predictably, another hep C question. So just to be clear on the interim analysis for the 5885 combination study for 7977, is the -- Norbert, is the hurdle rate there 60%, number one. Number two, how will the -- will this passing of the interim analysis be something that will be explicitly communicated to everyone when it happens. And then maybe finally on just if you could talk a little bit more about your FDA discussions and was it principally the Bristol combination data that got the FDA comfortable going forward with this design or are there other data that they saw as part of your discussions that kind of tied it all together?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Yes, Marshall, the interim analysis, let me say it again, so the -- we want to beat a response rate of 60%. So if 65% is the expected, the response rate with the current standard of care, Tenofovir Resapravir [ph], we get a 5% bonus, so we want to beat 60%. That means the lower bound of our 95% confidence in total [ph] has to be 60% or higher. And if we see a point estimate that's less than 60%, so let's say we see 59%, that would mean we only have a 5% chance of achieving our goal. I hope I was clear in what I said. So 59% or lower would be futile to show superiority, 60% or higher would allow us to go forward. Then you had another question about the FDA. No, so the FDA they were comfortable with the fact that we initiated the Phase III study, but to an interim analysis after 200 patients. And so really the totality of the data both the Bristol-Myers data, our own virology data and the previous -- current experience with 7977 even by itself or in combination with Ribavirin that has made the FDA and 3 European regulatory agencies comfortable with this approach.","Patrick O'Brien","And just to remind everybody please keep your questions to one question only, without 3 parts or we'll just answer the first part of your question and then move on so everybody has an opportunity to speak.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Yee, RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","On the QUANTUM 24-week data that you reported, which are the 53, do you know the IL 20B breakdown? I recall in the 12-week, there was a lot of differences, they were harder to treat patients. Maybe that was the reason?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","So generally, in the QUANTUM study, the CC genotype was not as high as in the ELECTRON study. If I remember it correctly, it was 25% or 30% and there was no difference between the 12-week and the 24-week. That is still true. But it was a little bit higher in the ELECTRON, but that doesn't account for the whole explanation, I would think. In my mind, if you ask me to speculate, it has to do with study conduct and remember, the QUANTUM study was a study where patients actually were blinded on treatment assignment, they were taking 938 or placebo. They were informed that there was a liver toxicity issue with 938 that maybe that could have influenced somewhat the study conduct at compliance. So that if you asked me to speculate, that's probably the best I can come up with although we can't substantiate that currently from our data.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum of ISI Group.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","You may have answered this. I'm sorry, I was sort of on and off. I really apologize. So I may end up wasting my question, but I'm just confused, when do you think you will be able to file for the fixed dose combination file for approval? Is the single trial enough or are you going to need both trials? And I guess, what kind of time line are you expecting for that first fixed dose combination trial, I'm obviously talking about the NS5A plus 7977?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Mark, since this is a new chemical entity. It contains a new product, we need 2 Phase III studies, 2 confirmatory -- 1 confirmatory Phase III study and one other Phase III. So the current time lines if everything works out and everything goes without a glitch, roughly the filing for the fixed dose combination would follow one year behind the 7977 filing, which would then be middle of 2014. That's our best guess currently.","Operator","Our next question comes from Yaron Werber, Citi.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a quick, maybe Robin, in case you're still in the room, because no one cares about financials anymore. The quick question on, so you beat by roughly about $100 million, but you're raising by 200, what's the -- and I'm going to try to make it one sentence, so it's one question. What's the difference? How much of inventory stocking did you see and were the strengths unusually strong in Europe relative to your expectation?","Robin L. Washington","Overall, we saw a strong non-retail demand in the whole second half. Remember, if you recall, Kevin talked last quarter about the fact that we expected some reduction in Q2. While we saw some of that, it wasn't as much as what we had anticipated. So we do potentially see some inventory run off that's [ph] happening in the second half. I mean, all that being said, we're balancing that with the fact that we clearly know that the states are trying to reduce overall wait list.","Kevin B. Young","Yes, I'll just add to that, Yaron. Q2 was pretty strong. It was not as high as Q1, but it was as good as Q4 of last year. So that was pretty strong and certainly far stronger than Q2 of 2011. So it was -- it quite surprised us. Puerto Rico, Illinois were particularly big in their purchases. I think at the moment, Yaron, there is quite a lot confidence in HIV right now. The budgets went out early. You saw just about week ago that the remaining $75 million was allocated. So pretty much all of the budget bar $6 million has gone out now. So the states know what they're working with, vis-\u00e0-vis the Federal funds, it's quite remarkable to see the wait list now down 1,800, that's over 80% from its peak at 9,200. So I think there's a sense of greater confidence, desire to get the wait list down, the mantra of test, treat, retain is very strong right now. You saw the comments coming out of the World AIDS meeting. So I think people recognize that treatment is the right way to go for the individual and it's right way to go for prevention and -- there is a sense of momentum there that I don't think was there this time last year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robin Karnauskas, Deutsche Bank.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a quick question for you, I guess, on HIV since most of the hep C has been covered. Since all the macro good news coming out the guidelines, do you think the new stock market will be growing. I think before you'd said around 50,000 a year. Would you expect that to go up?","Kevin B. Young","I think it's going to continue to be on its run rate, Robyn. I think the remarkable thing about HIV is it's been so consistent and that's through guideline changes and it's through more data, single tablet regimens and it just got this remarkable robustness and consistency about it. So there might be some small tick up, but I think the reassuring thing is it's just been remarkably consistent and I think that's the way we see it going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Russo, Baird.","Thomas J. Russo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","The 12-week arms in the BRISTOL 7977 study started enrolling really earlier this year and I think its status recently updated to no longer recruiting and that would suggest a decent chunk of patients might be out, some number of weeks post-treatment in 12-week arms, so I was just wondering if you're comfortable saying are you making any inferences from that on relapse or lack thereof that make it worthwhile to include 12-week arms in the Phase III study that you're announcing that. In other words, is it informed on that at all yet?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","No, Tom, we're not using any of those ongoing studies. That's a study, as you know, conducted Bristol-Myers and if I am not mistaken, they said that they could announce some data by AASLD. So the -- but that's entirely up to BMS. It's not our study.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ian Somaiya, Piper Jaffray.","M. Ian Somaiya - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I had a question on the HIV front, specifically 7340. Given how close you were in the 102 trials to achieving superiority, I'm just curious why you're not pursuing a trial of potentially adequate ties as part of the Phase III program to get a superiority claim. I guess, if we learned anything, you guys are close in 102 and maybe another 100 patients and I guess, applying the Glaxo strategy could get you over that threshold?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Ian, we would of course try and be superior, but as you know, most of these noninferiority, superiority trials, so the nonresponders in HIV studies, a large part of those are either discontinuation due to adverse events or lost [ph] to follow-up and there aren't that many virological failures, the few that there are, you always wonder they're probably due to noncompliance more than due to inherent limitations of the potency of the regimen. So I just think they've lost [ph] to follow-up and it's conditional due to adverse event and noncompliance. Those are kind of generic things that haunt you in any study and I think by having 7340 in the regimen, I'm not sure whether you would -- whether that would address -- would not address those issue and I'm not sure if you would see superiority. But needless to say, of course, a good idea that's what we're, of course, attempting to do.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ravi Mehrotra, Credit Suisse.","Ravi Mehrotra - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Question for Norbert. When do you expect to get the results for your SVR12 from ARM 13 from the ELECTRON study 7977, 5885 and will you announce those as you get them?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Which study? What is it now Ravi?","John C. Martin","ELECTRON, the 5885, 7977 ELECTRON arm.","Norbert W. Bischofberger","We may have something -- Ravi I'm actually not sure. I have to look it up, honestly.

I don't know.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Kolbert, Maxim Securities.","Jason Kolbert - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Just wanted to ask a quick question. With approval of the Quad hopefully coming up, how does that patient population differ versus the dynamics associated with Complera?","Unknown Executive","So I think we've always said that the opportunity that we have with Quad is to go after the majority of new starts, so we'll have data both -- well, we do have data from 102 and 103 versus Atripla and versus the protease inhibitors. So essentially we're able to position our Quad against the current, almost 9 out of 10 patients who are starting on those 2 third agents, either with Truvada or as part of Complera, part of Atripla. So that's the biggest slice of the na\u00efve pie currently, Complera operates in. I think we've seen some very, very high response rates at 88% and 90% with the Quad, 2 very well controlled studies. We'll have to see, but I think we are hopeful that Quad would go into guidelines into the U.S. guidelines fairly quickly so I think that would give more opportunity for the Quad than we have today with Complera. Having said that, Complera is starting to do very well. So I think our expectation is that the first single tablet regimen becomes the Quad and then the second single tablet regimen becomes Complera.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Skorney, Brean Murray.","Brian Skorney - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","I just want to kind of get some color on eventual pan-genotypic strategy. I know you've said in the past that 5885 won't be developed in GT3 due to the potency shift. When I look at Slide 36 and the Phase III fixed dose combo study, especially in the arms including Ribavirin. It just seems to me like you already have a pan-genotypic regimen with those 3 drugs right now and why wouldn't you think about just expanding the study to include all comers and potentially moving Ribavirin to a once daily dose. It would seem like the activity Riba has in GT3 would make up for any miss in 5885, and 5885 would make up for any weakness in Riba in the genotype 1 population.","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Brian, it's a hypothetical possibility. You may remember the Bristol-Myers data that were presented at EASL where they saw 100% response rates in genotype 1, they saw lower response rates, in other genotypes. So clearly, 7977 Daclatasvir is not as good in non-genotype 1 patients. That's also, by the way, completely consistent with the virology data and our own virology data on 5885 would actually indicate that 5885 would really not be suitable for genotype 2. We see a lot of polymers there where GS-5885 activity [ph]. So -- I know what you're saying. You're saying, well you have 7977 and Ribavirin for genotype 2, but then you have a drug in there 5885, which doesn't really do much in genotype 2. So to make a long story short, we have other strategies that would come as kind of the third wave. And we're working on other nucleoside and we have some very interesting pan-genotypic compound in 2 other classes in preclinical development that would soon go into the clinic. That's what we're thinking about then the ultimate regimen will be 2 drug. It could be NS5A or PI -- or a nuc [ph] combined with 7977 that would truly be a good pan-genotypic regimen. That's our goal and plan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Thomas Wei, Jefferies.","Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just a question on the QUANTUM data. You had mentioned I think in response to a question that you had done some assessments of compliance in QUANTUM and that there are lower rates there may be relative to the other studies that have been done with 7977 and Ribavirin. Can you give us a sense of how poorly compliant those patients were in QUANTUM and what it looks like in the other studies as well?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Yes, so, Tom, the other thing you have to remember in ELECTRON and in the NIAID study, these were single-side studies where -- like Ed Gain [ph] and the ELECTRON study, he knows every patient by name, he is in very close contact with them. The same at NIAID, they are very close contact with the patients, where as in QUANTUM is more of a large center study. So we have looked at the measure of compliance in QUANTUM was simply a self-recorded, did you take your drug? And as you know, that's somewhat less than reliable and we have seen low report rate, it's just -- the question is how much of that do you believe? It would be nice to have a somewhat more -- like plasma levels are the ultimate things that don't lie, that you can't hide behind and we just don't have those data. But, Tom, we would move forward with the Phase III study and then the Phase III studies we would see what the 2 response rates are, so I'm not too worried about what is it with QUANTUM that we see lower rates than in the other studies. And I'm convinced in the Phase III study we would see higher than what we saw in QUANTUM. That's my own feeling.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Birchenough, BM Capital (sic) [BMO].","Jim Birchenough - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I wanted to just push a bit on the concept of confidence intervals because we don't get much data bounded by confidence intervals. So on QUANTUM and the NIAID study, do you have confidence intervals on those response rates. And I'm trying to understand in the interim when you've got 50 patients per arm, what's the difference between a 59% point estimate that's futile and a 61% when you think about the confidence intervals there?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Jim, we actually have done conference interval in QUANTUM and ELECTRON and one thing I can tell you is they are fairly large because the number is so small. So typically, if you have like 10 or 20 patients and you see a 50% response rate, the 95% confidence interval will go from 20 to 80, so plus 30, minus 30, that's how large the confidence interval is there [ph], so it's not very informative. So with regards to the interim analysis, I want to say it again. So our goal is to be superior to 60%. So in other words, that lower bound of the 95% confidence interval at the end of the study has to be 60% or higher. So if we see 59% in the interim analysis as the point estimate, that means we will have only a 5% chance of ever making that and that will then be a futile attempt, so 59% or lower we would say this is futile, to reach this point at 60% or higher we would think it's possible.","Jim Birchenough - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Can I push on that a bit? I guess, what I'm trying to understand is that if you're trying to hit a lower bound that's above 60%, shouldn't your point estimate be way higher than that. And I guess, where I'm coming from is 59% suggest that less than 5% chance to hit your end point. What's your chance of hitting your end point if the point estimate is 61%, because presumably, there's still a pretty wide confidence interval that's going to well below 60%, that's what I'm trying to understand.","Norbert W. Bischofberger","So Jim, in order to reach the lower bound of 60% or higher, the point estimate calculation is 66%. So if we have -- if at the end of the study in 800 patients, the point estimate is 66% then the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval is 60%, so we got from 60% to 72%, the 95% confidence interval. With regards to your second point, I completely agree, but keep in mind, this is such a low bar that I do not believe this will ever be an issue. I mean this shows you how long the bar is. Like in ATOMIC, we had the same power calculation, we want to be at least 67% point estimate, but we were at 92% and I am convinced in this 5885, 7977 study we will see a similar result.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Nadeau of Cowen and Company.","Philip Nadeau - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","You've done a good job identifying a Phase III program for genotype 1 treatment-na\u00efve patients. I think the last thing we're waiting for is a Phase II program for genotype 1 treatment experience patients. Can you give us some sense of where your primary thinking is there and when we could get a more definitive Phase III program structure for that population?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Phil, so I didn't get into this, but we decided with the first filing for GS-7977 by middle of next year, we would not include genotype 1 treatment experienced patients. And the reason is as you may remember, we presented ELECTRON data, I think they were somewhere before EASL, where we saw about a 10% response rate in the null responders, that's just too low. We will, however, a clue -- of course include treatment experienced patients in our GS-5885, 7977 program. I didn't talk about that today, but that would of course be another Phase III study that we would do because this compound -- the combination of the 2 should actually be a great compound to look at -- experienced patients. And as I said in the ELECTRON, there is 1 cohort of genotype 1 null responders. So that will give us the proof or the confidence that this is worth doing and then we would include that in the Phase III program. There is, finally, a lot of other studies that I have not talked about that will be included -- that includes special population transplant, HIV co-infection, it goes without seeing that this will be a comprehensive program. I've just touched on the main Phase III studies today to give you some sense as to what the main body of information is.","Jim Birchenough - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Would you be filing for treatment experienced patients in mid-2014?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Yes, it could be under same filing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Howard Liang from Leerink Swann.","Howard Liang - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","When do we see the data of 7977 in combination with protease inhibitor -- the Tibotec [ph] compound?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","The study is now enrolling and honestly, I am not at liberty to talk about the time lines, that's a J&J Tibotec [ph] managed study. We have regular meetings with them and I know their study is enrolling, but I do not currently know what the time lines are for that study.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tommy Butler, Barclays Capital.","Charles Anthony Butler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Can you think about what you would like to present or what you're anticipating presenting at AASLD in November?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","I, Ken and Paul [ph], we have talked internally about that -- large number of potential presentation and I'm really not prepared to mention them right now. We haven't finalized them yet, but you will get updates on many of these studies, QUANTUM, ELECTRON, we'll present whatever is available to -- for them to be presented.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alan Carr, Needham & Company.","Alan Carr - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Can you speak to what will be going on like behind 5885 with some of your other antivirals like 9669 in combination with 7977?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","So we are currently doing a number of again small cohort within ELECTRON, looking at 9669 with 7977. We're looking at our protease inhibitor with [ph] 7977, but as I said, the real goal is something we haven't really disclosed or talked about is pan-genotypic classes and one of them, we have -- other nucleosides that we're working on that could be combined with 7977. We have NS5A inhibitors that could -- are potentially pan-genotypic and we have protease inhibitors. And that's just something now that we have -- we're clear on what the first NDA, MDA [ph] filing looks like. We have now decided on the second filing. Now we can seriously start thinking about or formalizing a plan to move ahead with our third phase and the third phase will clearly be a one pill, once daily, maybe 12-week course for all genotypes. That's our goal still, and we're very close.","Operator","Our last question comes from Joel Sendek, Stifel Nicolaus.","Joel D. Sendek - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Another HIV question actually. Just to follow up on the earlier comment that you made about Dolutegravir. I'm wondering, given what you said about noncompliance and those sorts of things, do you view that drug as a threat, obviously, it showed superiority but is that meaningful at all when you look at the market down the road once QUAD's on that market?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Just a quick comment on the superiority. No, actually, if you compare the data -- response rates on the Dolutegravir arm, they were very similar to the QUAD. We actually had 90%, they had 88% and interestingly enough, the superiority was entirely driven by fairly high discontinuation rates due to averse events on the Atripla arm. Those discontinuation rates are twice as high as we have seen in our own study and they're also twice as high as other competitors like Merck has seen in their study. So that is just a common -- it's a peculiar result, why in their study, the discontinuation rates on rates on Atripla were so high. They were 10%, in our studies they are 5%. I'll let answer Kevin answer the other part of the question.","Kevin B. Young","Joel, I think we take all forms of competition very seriously. One thing to point to out is that, with an expectation that the agent would be co-formulated with EPZICOM. EPZICOM only gets right now 4% of na\u00efve patients. So it really is hardly used in the na\u00efve treatment setting. And even though it was elevated in the recent IX guidelines, it's not associated with all the third agents as is Truvada. So we do think that the preferred regimen for an integrate inhibitor is the QUAD. The results are very good. The results are published. I'll go back to the point I made about -- hopefully early entry into treatment guidelines and we don't exactly know the timelines of the competition, but we probably have about a year head start on the market, and with an expanded field [ph]force, which is trained and ready for the PDUFA date. We're going to try to make most of that. So we do think we have an excellent opportunity coming out first with the single tablet regimen of an integrate inhibitor.","Operator","Mr. O'Brien, at this point, we have run out of time for additional questions.","Patrick O'Brien","Thank you, Chanel, and thanks for you all joining us today. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead and the team and I are here to follow up with any follow-on questions that we can help with.

My name is Liz and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Sung Lee, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Sung Lee","Thank you, Liz, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the third quarter 2019. The press release and detailed slides are available on the Investor Relations section of the Gilead website. The speakers on today's call will be Daniel O'Day, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Johanna Mercier, Chief Commercial Officer. Also in the room are Diana Brainard, Senior Vice President and Head of our HIV and Emerging Viruses Therapeutic area; and John Sundy, Senior Vice President and Head of our Inflammation Therapeutic area.","Before we begin with our prepared comments, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements including plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, financial projections and the use of capital, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in our latest SEC disclosure documents and recent press releases.","In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release as well as on the Gilead website.","I'll now turn the call over to Dan.","Daniel O'Day","Thank you, Sung, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining today. I'll share a few opening comments and then turn the call over to Robin. And after that Johanna will take you through the commercial highlights of the quarter as well.","So let me start by saying, I'm very pleased with the progress that we're making on all fronts here at Gilead and a strong third quarter results. Once again, we saw a significant growth in our HIV business, reaching an all-time high in quarterly HIV revenue. As you know in my time at Gilead, I focused on three key areas since coming in the pipeline, commercial delivery and people. And today in my brief remarks, I'll focus on the significant progress we've made in two of those areas: The pipeline and the people, and then Johanna will take you and talk to you about the excellent commercial performance later in the call.","So let me begin by saying a few words about our pipeline, starting with HIV. As you're aware, we received FDA approval for DESCOVY for PrEP earlier this month. This is a really important indication for us as it allows us to extend the benefits of DESCOVY to people who are at risk of HIV. To remind you, the approval was based on the DISCOVER trial, which demonstrates that DESCOVY is just as effective as Truvada and offers advantages in bone and renal safety parameters.","We are excited to build on DESCOVY status as the most-prescribed dual NRTI backbone in the world by advancing its use in PrEP. Happy to say, we've also received endorsement to begin the study of DESCOVY for PrEP in cisgender women, which will allow us to eventually bring the medicine to a broader group of people.","Rest assured, we continue to remain focused on our HIV pipeline beyond our DESCOVY-based regimens as well on our long-acting antivirals programs compounds that will treat -- highly treatment-experienced patients and, of course, on our CARE research as well.","So turning to filgotinib, we've now filed for approval of filgotinib in rheumatoid arthritis in the EU and Japan and are on track to complete our filing in the United States by the end of the year. Our teams around the world are preparing for launch and I'm encouraged about the potential of filgotinib to be best-in-class among the JAK inhibitors. In addition to rheumatoid arthritis, we're continuing to advance filgotinib together with our partner Galapagos. We have a comprehensive program across a number of other inflammatory diseases, including ulcerative colitis, which we expect to have data on next year.","And in addition, we were successful in closing our partnership with Galapagos this past quarter. I'm looking forward to the American College of Rheumatology coming up in Atlanta, so that we can share further updates on filgotinib. Researchers there will present further analysis in the FINCH two study, which evaluated filgotinib in patients with RA who previously -- who were previously treated with a biologic and then results of the pooled safety analysis of filgotinib across the FINCH program will also be presented and updated there.","Turning to cell therapy. I would like to say a few words about Kite and our working cell therapy. The teams down at Kite are busy preparing for the American Society of Hematology meeting, which will happen in early December, where in addition to exciting data from our ongoing clinical trials, we will share survival data for Yescarta at three years in large B-cell lymphoma as well as results from the registrational study of KTE-X19 in mantle cell lymphoma.","Recently we also completed enrollment in the pivotal ZUMA-7 study of the Yescarta in second line large B-cell lymphoma and we're excited about the potential this medicine could help for this group of patients. As we discussed also last quarter, we continue to see quarterly variations in Yescarta, but we're very confident in its future and the long-term trajectory of our cell therapy platform.","Finally, a few comments about our leadership team, which is now complete with two new appointments. Merdad Parsey will join us on November 1st as our Chief Medical Officer. Merdad who previously led the early clinical development program at Genentech will have responsibility for all of our global developments and medical affairs functions.","Bill Lee will continue to lead our research organization and he will report directly to me working closely with Merdad. Merdad is an outstanding scientist and leader with a remarkable track record of success. And I believe that Merdad will be a tremendous asset to Gilead maintaining a very high bar for innovation, so that we can continue to build on our legacy of transformational medicines.","I'm also very excited about the appointment of Andy Dickinson to the role of CFO. Andy has been at Gilead since 2016 and currently serves as our Executive Vice President of Corporate Development and Strategy. He transformed the way that the company approaches corporate development before I came in, and expanding the kinds of transactions executed and implemented a broader more strategic approach to dealmaking here at Gilead.","As of November 1st, Andy will succeed Robin Washington whose retirement we announced earlier this year. Happy that Robin will remain at Gilead in an advisory capacity through early next year, while we complete the reporting of our 2019 results. I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank Robin for her outstanding contributions, dedication and tremendous commitment to Gilead. We wish her all the best in retirement. And I'm sure she'll continue to stay busy.","I look forward to working with this outstanding group of leaders here at Gilead, who bring a strong blend of skills and diverse perspectives to the path forward for our future. And in closing, I'm increasingly optimistic about the future and believe we are well positioned as we enter the last part of the year and look ahead to 2020 and beyond. We will continue to build on our success, as we replenish the pipeline and bring the next wave of transformational advances to patients.","On behalf of the leadership team, I want to thank all of our employees and partners around the world for the dedication and hard work that led to the successful quarter and the results that you see here today, and whose commitment will continue to make it successful in the future.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Robin.","Robin Washington","Thank you Dan for your kind words. It has been a privilege to serve as Gilead's CFO for the past 11 years and to work alongside such extraordinary colleagues to bring medicines to people around the world. I know the focus on this mission will continue and I look forward to cheering Gilead on in 2020 and beyond.","I'm pleased to report the financial results for the third quarter, which were marked by strong execution across our therapeutic areas led by the continued growth of our HIV franchise and continued predictability of HCV.","Total revenue for the third quarter were $5.6 billion with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.75. This compares to revenues of $5.6 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.84 for the same period last year.","As noted in the earnings press release, on a GAAP basis, we recorded a loss of $0.92 per share primarily due to $3.92 billion or $2.40 per diluted share of upfront collaboration and licensing expense associated with our global research and development collaboration agreement with Galapagos.","Turning to product sales. Product sales for the third quarter were $5.5 billion, down 2% sequentially and up 1% year-over-year. In the U.S., product sales for the third quarter were $4.2 billion, up 4% sequentially and up 2% year-over-year. In Europe, product sales for the third quarter were $804 million, down 23% sequentially and down 8% year-over-year.","The sequential performance was primarily impacted by two items. First, recall that the second quarter benefited from a $160 million adjustment for a statutory revenue clawback reserve. And second, the third quarter was negatively impacted by a statutory clawback reserve adjustment. These two factors, which primarily impacted our HCV and HIV revenues, caused an approximately $200 million decline between quarters.","Turning to cell therapy. Worldwide Yescarta sales for the third quarter were $118 million, up 57% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. U.S. sales were $86 million for the third quarter, up 15% year-over-year and down 13% sequentially. In Europe, Yescarta sales were $32 million, up 52% sequentially, as we continue to ramp in the region.","It is clear that cell therapy is a validated platform; with hundreds of patients being treated on a quarterly basis in the U.S. Yescarta has established itself as a differentiated leader in an increasingly competitive environment. We will continue to focus our efforts on CAR T education in the community oncology setting to stimulate referrals of appropriate patients to cell therapy treatment centers.","We also observed CAR T eligible patients being enrolled in clinical trials at a much higher rate relative to commercial patients. As such and as Dan outlined, we anticipate further quarterly sales variations, but remain very confident in the future trajectory of Yescarta.","Now turning to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $954 million for the third quarter, up 13% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to increased investment in our oncology programs, HIV programs and research projects.","Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $967 million for the third quarter, up 14% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to higher promotional expenses in the U.S. and expenses associated with the expansion of Gilead's business in Japan and China.","Moving to the balance sheet. During the third quarter we generated $2.6 billion in cash from operations and ended the quarter with $25.1 billion in cash and investments. We paid $5.5 billion in connection with our global research collaboration and equity investment in Galapagos, which was classified in our cash flow statement as cash from investing activities and includes a $1.1 billion equity investment. We also paid $1.5 billion of debt used to finance our acquisition of Kite. We paid cash dividends of $804 million and repurchased 3.4 million shares of stock for $223 million.","Turning to our guidance. As we move closer to the end of 2019, we are narrowing our guidance ranges as follows. Net product sales are expected to be in the range of $21.8 billion to $22.1 billion. Non-GAAP R&D expenses are expected to be in the range of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion. We expect non-GAAP SG&A expenses to be in the range of $4 billion to $4.1 billion. All other components of our guidance remain unchanged. Our guidance is subject to a number of uncertainties which are outlined in slides 22 and 23 in our earnings call presentation.","I will now turn the call over to Johanna.","Johanna Mercier","Thanks, Robin, and good afternoon, everyone. So as I've had the chance to settle into my role, I've been really impressed with the talent here at Gilead and the potential we have to reach even more patients with our medicines. I want to talk today about a few areas, the continued strength of our HIV business, including our recent launch of Descovy for PrEP durability of HCV, and finally touch briefly on our cardiopulmonary business and close by discussing our filgotinib launch preparations.","So, let's start with HIV. Global HIV sales for Q3 were $4.2 billion, up 4% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. As Dan noted, this is an all-time high for quarterly HIV product sales. U.S. HIV product sales were $3.4 billion in Q3, up 6% sequentially and 14% year-over-year.","The year-over-year increase was driven by underlying prescription demand growth of 13% mainly Biktarvy. Biktarvy was a number one prescribed regimen in the U.S. in the quarter. In prevention, they're now approximately 224,000 people taking Truvada for PrEP, an increase of approximately 25% year-over-year of active patients.","Our teams are now in the field with Descovy with its recent approval in PrEP. We initiated efforts to educate health care providers and people at risk for HIV about Descovy immediately following the approval and are really quite pleased with anecdotal feedback from providers.","Turning to Europe, Q3 HIV product sales were $558 million, down 10% sequentially and 4% year-over-year. The year-over-year decline was expected due to the broad availability of generic versions of Truvada. The impact in generics is starting to wane as the launched of our Descovy-based products namely Biktarvy progress.","As Robin just mentioned, the sequential performance was impacted by an adjustment for statutory clawback reserve in Europe, which benefited the second quarter. Biktarvy is now available across the EU5 and continues to grow. It's on track to be the best HIV launch in Europe and is number one in naive and switch across Germany, France and Spain. It recently launched in Italy and the U.K. and is off to a strong start in both those countries.","Moving on to HCV. Global Q3 HCV sales were $674 million, down 20% sequentially and 25% year-over-year. U.S. product sales for Q3 were $380 million, up 7% sequentially and down 22% year-over-year. The sequential performance was driven by the continued uptake of authorized generics which has improved our overall competitive position in the U.S.","In Europe, HCV product sales for the second quarter were $111 million, down 60% sequentially and 45% year-over-year. As anticipated the sequential performance was negatively impacted by the adjustment for statutory clawback reserve in Europe, which benefited Q2. Overall, the HCV market continues to see a more predictable decline in patient starts and perform in line with our expectations.","Before closing, I wanted to just make a few comments on our cardiopulmonary business, where we have seen generic competition enter the market. As anticipated significant volume erosion has occurred and as of September, we have seen an 85% erosion of Ranexa and 60% erosion of Letairis a trend that we expect to continue.","Finally, I spent time recently in both Europe and Japan, where our teams have completed the regulatory filings for filgotinib in rheumatoid arthritis. Launch preparations are well underway in both regions as well as in the United States, which Dan noted we plan to file before the end of the year.","I believe that, we truly have an opportunity to make a difference in the lives of people with RA, and in the future other inflammatory diseases. We're actively preparing for competitive and innovative launch of a differentiated JAK inhibitor across our key markets. I really look forward to working with this great team of people to deliver on the promise of these medicines.","So, thank you very much for joining today's call and now let's turn it over to questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Yee with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Michael Yee","Hey guys. Thanks for the questions. I had a question for Dan. Obviously Dan, you've spent a lot of time this year putting in the right people, getting everything all set up. You did Galapagos deal to build up the pipeline a bit. I guess in thinking about the pipeline and building that out where are you focusing your priorities on? How should we think about your next area whether that's in NASH or oncology? How should we think about that? And maybe just give us a little state of the union there?","Daniel O'Day","Yes. Thanks Michael very much for the question and delighted that we now have the team coming together for the future. I think it's really good diverse team with some strong Gilead legacy colleagues, as well as combined with some talent from the outside the organization with different perspectives.","And I think it's going to lead to a really strong good team that will help us drive kind of the future chapters of Gilead moving forward. Also pleased Michael that we had the Galapagos transaction finalized in the quarter, we're obviously getting going now on a deeper collaboration beyond filgotinib.","And as I said to you in the past and I'll say it again, I mean, I think the team here and I have the pipeline as our number one priority of course. And that -- we approach that from a variety of different ways; one is, the strength of our internal pipeline looking for ways to accelerate differentiated medicines that we can internally and with Galapagos now significantly expanding our research base in addition to other collaborations we have externally that allow us to essentially double our research base of medicines coming into the portfolio -- the development portfolio.","In terms of therapeutic area, I would say our approach to external partnerships and M&A will be very much the same of what you saw in the past. So first and foremost, it will be driven by science, driven by where we think the most unique opportunities are.","Secondarily, will be informed by our own expertise, as you know we play across four therapeutic areas today and strong scientific understanding in the base in antivirals and immuno modulation. And there is no one size fits all of course. I mean, at times it make sense to just do a partnership, but other times it makes sense to do a full acquisition and other times it makes sense to do something like a Galapagos arrangement where we have a deep partnership associated with that.","So we'll continue on in that area. I think more to come as the team comes together as we continue to evaluate. Certainly the areas that you mentioned are areas that we're looking at carefully to complement our internal expertise, but we're not driven by any one therapeutic area.","We're driven much more by where is the next innovation going to come from in science and how do we complement that portfolio. With an acknowledgment by the way that we understand that we have to accelerate the development of our later-stage pipeline as well. And that can happen by both accelerating our internal pipeline or having partnerships arrangements with the companies outside of the Gilead orbit today.","So Michael more to come and obviously some of the conferences coming up and into next year, I can be even more specific and articulate about how some of our strategies are forming.","Michael Yee","Perfect. Looks forward to that. Thank you.","Daniel O'Day","Thanks Mike.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Brian Abrahams","Hi, there. Thanks very much for taking my question. So you narrowed the R&D and SG&A guidance to the upper end of the previous ranges. And so I guess -- I'm wondering maybe bigger picture perhaps longer term especially as we're getting closer now to the filgotinib launch how do you guys balance the importance of margin preservation and earnings growth against the potential to invest as you build out in inflammation? And how might the changes in leadership potentially influence this? Thanks.","Daniel O'Day","Yes. Let's -- let Robin give her commentary Brian and then maybe I'll add as well so please.","Robin Washington","Hi, Brian. Thanks for the questions. I'd say we manage them very carefully. As you know we've always been a very highly efficient organization, really focused on operational excellence and ensuring that even as we've grown, we've grown profitably as we think about margins.","And at the same time, as you've heard me say before we're always balancing the need to invest for the long term, and as you know that can have implications in the short term. You've seen us with previous launches and with acquisitions make the necessary investments upfront that may yield shorter operating margins in a short term, but ultimately get us to higher revenues in overall margins long term. So I think that's how we think about our model. There's -- it's not by quarter or by year, it's really ensuring that when we make investments that we make the necessary actions in the short time to ensure the overall ROI on those investments. And I'll turn it over to Dan to talk about the future but I think we're pretty much aligned going forward.","Daniel O'Day","It's well said Robin. And Brian you may want to hear it from my vantage point as well just particularly with the CFO transition to make sure you understand the stability from my side as well. So I have really admired Gilead's efficiency as Robin mentioned and the careful management of expenses. And I think that's something that we will continue to make sure that we have the size here as well. I've also been a student of the history here at Gilead and I've looked back in the past and seen in times of important launches that investment has increased correspondingly in the interest of patients, in the interest of shareholders. And I think that type of philosophy I think will continue.","And certainly we will also be -- as we have generic erosion, of course, coming now this year and next year, we also have the ability to redeploy those resources as we already have done with cardiopulmonary to other areas of focus and interest including the upcoming -- or the current launch for DESCOVY in PrEP. And then we will also make sure that we have a competitive launch of filgotinib because we know that it will be essential to have the right share of voice to get that off to a good start.","We have one chance to launch a product in this industry and therefore we have to make that accordingly. So as we get into providing you with more guidance in 2020, we can elaborate a little bit further about how we see that expense management for next year. But I hope you get a sense that much of the discipline that Gilead has in the past you can expect to have in the future as well Brian.","Brian Abrahams","Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Geoff Meacham","Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Congrats, Andy and Robin. It's been great to work together. Wish you the best. Just wanted to ask about HIV market expansion outside of PrEP, and with Biktarvy, the share gains are impressive and with its profile, are you seeing an uptick though in treated patients on ART overall? I just wanted to ask because HIV market expansion used to be a secondary driver of the market but I'm not sure about that today. And how do you think this differs in Europe? Thanks so much.","Johanna Mercier","Maybe I'll take that one. Geoff, it's Johanna. I think as you're mentioning the HIV business overall and treatment is a huge part of that 80% of our total HIV business has never been stronger. And what we're seeing, it's a bit of a mix what you're saying, but in those U.S. and Europe, you have about 80% of the patients that are switch patients and 20% are na\u00efve patients. So the na\u00efve patients is a smaller play and less of a market expansion per se to your earlier point, but much more in the switch. And so where the switch come from are really important to us for Biktarvy. And what we're seeing with Biktarvy and that's been our strategy all along in our expectations is, we are seeing about 20% to 25% are coming from dolutegravir-based regimens and about a 1\/3 coming from Truvada-based regimen and then the rest -- another 1\/3 probably from Genvoya and so that's the piece where from a switch standpoint that's the biggest most important piece of the business. Both in U.S. and Europe it's quite similar actually.","The challenge in Europe is obviously there is more Truvada pieces of the puzzle just because of the genericization in Europe. But, overall, what we're seeing is very consistent both in na\u00efve and switch and Biktarvy is number one not just in the U.S. but also in Germany, France and Spain and we only just got reimbursement in the last quarter for U.K. and Italy, but those launches are off to the similar, very consistent way of launching than we've seen in the other markets.","Daniel O'Day","Thank you, Geoff. So we'll go on to the next questioner.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Porges with SVB Leerink. Your line is now open.","Geoff Porges","Thank you very much. I'm just wondering if you could help me understand a little bit on the research side. You've sort of lost over that a bit. Firsthand, could you break out the $4 billion or so in annual spend that you have now between immunology, oncology, hepatology and then research? Just give us a sense of those allocations?","And then, related to that, Dan, could you talk about, if you were to contemplate significant M&A or for that matter, additional licensing, do you envisage that that $4 billion run rate will have to go up to accommodate those new programs? Or do you have some savings from big trials coming to an end and\/or other efficiencies that might take the $4 billion down and accommodate incremental programs from outside the company?","Daniel O'Day","Terrific. Yes. Thanks, Geoff. And actually, I'm glad you asked the question because on the previous question I spoke more about how we look at allocation resources on the commercial side more so than the research side. So, yes, let me first of all state that -- the first part of your question relative to how we allocate that across therapeutic areas, it's not something that we disclose accordingly.","So I can't help you with that but I think I can help you with the forward question, which is, as we think forward to either partnerships or M&A, how is that going to help -- or what impact will that have, if you like, on the overall R&D spend.","Now, I think, there's one aspect of that that's very important which is -- and you mentioned it a bit. But, A, we're constantly prioritizing our portfolio internally. And that is based upon making sure that we have the most-attractive programs that we're funding.","Every organization has to draw a line and I think we also have to do that as well. And of course, things change, because of the nature of data that's read out, competitive environments, variety of things that happen. So the portfolio is constantly kind of evolving and moving internally based on that portfolio.","And therefore, to your point, there are times when we stop studies, studies come to a natural conclusion and they've been successful and we have those to then reinvest again accordingly. Many of the structures that we've looked at in our partnerships have also been designed to be, first of all, innovation forward but also allow for some balanced risk across the portfolio and spend.","For instance, with Galapagos. Our relationship with them is that they are covering trials up until Phase 2 and they take the decisions and they take the risk associated with that and all the diversity and benefit that comes from having another organization look at that differently.","And then, post our opt-in of course then we would start to incur expenses on our R&D line as well. So many of our partnerships and collaborations have been designed with that in mind as well and we'll continue to do it that way to be efficient with risk versus investment. And I think that's the way we'll continue to look at moving forward. So more to come on that.","I would just say -- I mean, the one thing we do disclose Geoff on the R&D line is that around 15% to 20% of the $4 billion goes into research and the remaining is into development human trials accordingly. So that I can give you. But we don't really break it down further by therapeutic area. Does that help?","Geoff Porges","Somewhat. Thanks, Dan.","Daniel O'Day","As much as I can, I think. But thanks, Geoff.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Matthew Harrison","Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, I was hoping you could just talk briefly, I know it's very early in the switch from Truvada to Descovy. But maybe you could talk about your expectations for some of the markers we should be looking for there and then maybe anecdotal feedback, as you maybe been in the market a couple weeks already with that. Thanks.","Robin Washington","Thanks, Matthew, for the question. So, yes, only a few weeks in, right? We got the approval early October. But even within a few weeks we're off to a strong start. I think, the team is very excited about it, but more importantly the early feedback from physicians is very positive and we're hearing a lot of enthusiasm from our prescribers.","I do want to explain that the PrEP market is a little bit different than the treatment market and that is that it's much larger in the number of prescribers. So there's over 50,000 prescribers that have actually written at least one script of PrEP with Truvada.","So having said that, more than half of the volume that we're seeing in PrEP is actually very concentrated in a couple of thousand specialists who also prescribe in treatment. So that has been our number one focus and target physicians that we have been calling on over the last couple of weeks, because these are folks that obviously largest volume pool, but also folks that have experienced converting from TDF to TAF and also understand the value of DESCOVY and its clinical profile, specifically around the safety with bone and renal.","So we assume a very similar conversion than what we've seen in the past. We have a lot of experience here of TDF to TAF conversions and we assume that same conversion rate will happen with these top prescribers. For the balance of the volume, obviously we are assuming a little bit of a slower uptake with those prescribers just because it's so much more diffuse. But having said that, we've augmented the field team.","I think Dan mentioned this earlier, how we've taken a lot of our field forces from the cardiopulmonary in light of the generics hitting there. We basically train them and move them over there to supplement the team and also augmented our consumer approach to get really rapid awareness of DESCOVY both to physicians as well as targeted consumers. So so far so good, very excited about the launch and probably in the next quarter we'll have more to talk about with data.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alethia Young with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.","Alethia Young","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And I just wanted to talk a little bit about NASH strategy from here. I understand you have the ATLAS study in the fourth quarter, but I also saw you started semaglutide GLP-1 study combination with doubles and triples. So can you maybe frame for us how you think about like what might be your backbone asset in NASH and possibly your plans going forward there?","Daniel O'Day","Yes. Thank you very much, Alethia. So I think you rightly pointed kind of an important data point coming up here that will allow us to think about how we pivot our NASH strategy moving forward and that's the ATLAS study that we will be reading out before the end of the year. So those of you that don't know, I mean that's a combination trial that will allow us to look at the results of a variety of different combinations on the progression of NASH.","But as you also know I mean, we've had a number of other collaborations, we've looked at with Novo Nordisk on GLP-1 and some of the other ones that you've already mentioned there Alethia that are approaching this from different angles as well. So I do think though that most progressed clinical trial is currently the ATLAS trial. And once we can see the results for that and dig into that then I think it will help us really understand how to progress ahead with NASH in what format and what way.","I would just mentioned that as we've always mentioned, we think that NASH is a very high unmet medical need, but also a challenging disease to develop in given the nature of the disease, given the heterogeneity of the disease, given the end points. And yet, we think a company like Gilead with expertise in this area need to be informed by the science and solve the science to see what our path forward will be. So more on the NASH strategy after the ATLAS trial at the end of this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Umer Raffat","Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. I wanted to focus on a couple of R&D topics if I may. One on filgotinib. I noticed FDA called entospletinib review documents. FDA effectively implied class labeling on thrombosis risk for the class. And my question is what's your expectation? Do you think you'll get a black box for thrombosis? And do you think that impacts commercial uptake?","And then secondly, there was a program in your pipeline which I was starting to get really excited about perhaps mostly because it was sort of in the exactly type of thing Gilead has been very good at novel nukes GS-9131 and it could have formed a base of life cycle management. I noticed it's not in the slide deck this time around and I was wondering if you could catch us up on any learnings from that program. Thank you.","Daniel O'Day","Terrific, Umer. So we're going to start with John and - then we'll go to Diana for HIV question.","John Sundy","Sure. Umer, I mean as you know and we've spoken of before, we know that patients with inflammatory diseases are at risk for thrombosis. And so it's always a comparison against expected background rates of this event in patients. And we think it's possible that selected JAK1 inhibition as we have with filgotinib may have some advantages. But certainly at this point it would be premature to speculate on what the label outcomes maybe. We're going to go through the process. We believe we have a strong story with regard to thrombosis risk and at the same time reassured by the overall efficacy and safety profile. So we've seen this across all of our programs and we are looking forward to having that discussion with the regulators.","Diana Brainard","This is Diana Brainard. I'll speak to your question around GS-9131, which is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor with an improved resistance profile over the currently improved drugs in that class. And this is a compound that we've been excited about and moving through the clinic in early phase studies because we do have a commitment to highly treatment-experienced patients who have failed higher regimens and have multidrug resistance.","In parallel with the GS-9131 program, as you know, our capsid inhibitor program with GS-6207 has also progressed very rapidly. And GS-6207 is the first-in-class compound. It's got a novel mechanism of action. It's got an orthogonal resistance profile. We haven't seen any pre-existing resistance among all of the samples we've tested from treatment-na\u00efve patients and heavily treatment-experienced patients.","These data have been published at recent conferences. And so because of this novel mechanism of action, because of the potency, because of the lack of pre-existing resistance, we really feel that the capsid inhibitor is the really best and lead compound to bring forward in highly treatment-experienced patients.","And in fact its promised was recognized by FDA when they granted us breakthrough designation for this population. And so we're moving ahead with capsid in this population into a registrational trial. And therefore won't be bringing GS-9131 forward for this population because we prioritize our capsid inhibitor.","Q \u2013 Umer Raffat","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mohit Bansal with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Mohit Bansal","Great. Thanks for taking my question. So looking at your slides, you have some plans to develop capsid inhibitor in the Phase 2 -- started trial in Phase 2 trial with capsid inhibitor. Have you discussed internally about what kind of combination agent you will be using for this long-acting treatment at this point? And when can we learn more about your PrEP strategy for capsid inhibitor? Thank you.","Johanna Mercier","Sure. So we're really envisioning the capsid inhibitor to have multiple different applications for people living with HIV. I just mentioned, its use for heavily treatment-experienced patients where it could be added on to optimize background therapy as is commonly done for this population.","But it also has a huge potential for people living with HIV who might want to switch to a long-acting regimen because of its ability to be given at least every three months, every six months and potentially in the future longer. And there we are still actively looking for what's the right partner for our capsid inhibitor will be and we have multiple internal programs which are preclinical or in the very earliest stage of assessments in the clinic.","And we're looking forward to sharing more details as we have more certainty about what the right combination will be to partner with capsid. What we're prioritizing is ease of administration. So we're looking at subcutaneously administered drugs. We're looking at drugs that can go the distance in terms of longer, at least monthly, if not longer and match capsid's potential. And so as we prioritize those features and bring forward different compounds we'll -- we're really excited actually to share that data.","Mohit Bansal","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Cory Kasimov","Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to see if you could talk a little bit more about the quarter-over-quarter trends for Yescarta? I know you mentioned there are or there were a higher number of potential patients going into clinical trials in 3Q, but how much do you think this sequential drop can also be attributed to the launch of Polivy? Are you seeing center slot that in the head of CAR T products or potentially any other dynamics taking place? Thanks.","Daniel O'Day","Yes. Absolutely, Cory. No, thanks for the question. Happy to talk about it. I mean, I think it is important that I start out with letting you know that the team here is really confident with the longer-term opportunity of the Yescarta and also cell therapy. But as we know, I mean this is a pioneering platform and just to point out some of the dynamics that we're seeing in the market, cell therapy really literally changes everything to the touches, from patient identification to clinical practice to reimbursement to safety management.","So I would say, some of the growing challenges with getting the pioneering technology in or what we would expect. But what's kind of unquestionable is in the patient set, where it has been studied so relapsed\/refractory DLBCL so far in the market, I mean the efficacy and durability are unprecedented.","I mean the majority of extremely six patients who are alive at two years, and as we know and many of my colleagues and the team hematology\/oncology is a data-driven space.","So I would say that -- and we also have a very strong and good manufacturing capacity which is critical for this technology. Now you mentioned some of the challenges. Let me talk about some of the drivers and some of the challenges that we're seeing in general in the market.","I mean on the positive side the NTAP improvement that just went into effect in October 2019 from reimbursement by CMS of 50% to 65% is a step in the right direction. We -- it does take there is a lag time before that gets fully absorbed and introduced into the community.","I would point out the ASH data coming up. We'll have three key events there; the survival data at three years in relapse\/refractory DLBCL, early steroid use and also data on the KTE-X19 in MCL. Would just also point out the ZUMA-7 is now fully enrolled. So that's the second line DLBCL. I look forward to that trial playing through.","And hopefully as we go into next year we can look towards a DRG for CAR-T as well. So those are some of the real positive things we're seeing in the market. And then to your point, I mean there are still challenges with Medicare reimbursement update. There is a high rate of clinical trial usage in DLBCL which is good news for patients. It's just -- there's quite a few clinical trials there still getting the patient referral flow downs.","We do have some new market entrants early days on those. You mentioned one on the call here today and this whole concept between inpatient and outpatient reimbursement.","So I think the team is kind of systematically working through these and that's why we see some quarter-on-quarter fluctuation in the United States. I would point out that we're now getting going in Europe which is also terrific and very good growth there and different -- some of these dynamics are different in Europe as well.","So I think as we learn quarter-to-quarter on some of the dynamics and as the data matures and develops out there, I think that's going to be a real telltale sign for how we continue to see the uptake here. But taking a big step back, the type of data we're seeing and the duration of response in the patients that we've studied is second to none.","So hopefully, as some of this becomes more the trends become more clear in future quarters we'll be able to be more precise about some of these as well. But thanks for the question Cory.","Cory Kasimov","Thanks Dan. Appreciate the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from Salim Syed with Mizuho. Your line is now open.","Salim Syed","Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. And congrats to Robin and welcome to Andy. Just one for me on hepatitis B; as in boy, if I can, I mean if you guys can give us an update on the core inhibitor what's the status there? I know there's been some safety issues for the core inhibitor class predominantly coming from HAV and SBA derivatives. So I was wondering if you can just give us a little bit of color, if your core inhibitor whether is in development or not in development and whether it is one of those derivatives? Thanks so much.","Diana Brainard","Salim, this is Diana Brainard. Are you talking about the capsid inhibitor?","Salim Syed","For hepatitis B as in boy?","Diana Brainard","Yes. You're talking about the capsid inhibitor? Yes.","Salim Syed","Yes correct, yes.","Diana Brainard","Yes. So I think that we have seen the competitor data regarding capsid and we're looking very closely at our compounds preclinically as well as clinically. Because obviously with hepatitis B we've got a lot of experience in this space and we know very well the value of suppressive treatment and the safety of those regimens and the benefit that viral suppression brings in terms of reducing cirrhosis, reducing rates of hepatocellular carcinoma.","So, while we're committed to cure and recognize that we're going to need combination therapies, we're also really cognizant of the safety barrier that really has to be exceeded to bring combinations forward. And I think that's really all we can say about that right now.","Salim Syed","Are you still developing? Is it still ongoing -- there's been some speculation that it's been terminated in the marketplace?","Diana Brainard","I think that we're in the process of continually evaluating what our best next steps are. And I think in terms of how we prioritize what we bring forward we've got the TLR8 in Phase 2 and we really want to see the results of those studies before making any final decisions on next steps and future combinations.","Salim Syed","Okay, got it. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Phil Nadeau","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just one question on filgotinib. Maybe to ask Umer's question a different way. You've talked a lot about differentiating filgotinib. How important is the differentiated label to that process commercially? How else -- what other key points will you have in differentiating filgotinib?","And then second filgotinib question. We have been expecting data from filgotinib as well as GS-9876 in Sjogren's and CLE in the second half this year. I noticed in your slides neither of those programs are mentioned. Is there any update on those two Phase 2 programs? Thanks.","Daniel O'Day","Yes. I'll let -- Johanna can start on the commercial side Phil, and then we'll go to John on the development.","Johanna Mercier","Okay. So, Phil more on the competitive concept. So, as you know this environment is super competitive and many of us know it well including myself. And so we've really pulled together a team that has considerable experience in this field.","The piece that you would say that the differentiated label, I think it's twofold. I think from a label standpoint what we've seen thus far from the FDA is a little bit of a more of a class labeling. And so our expectations and we'll go through the process, but we're also being conservative in our expectations.","One of the things that I would say is the importance of our data. And I think that if you look at the results of the three FINCH 3 studies in three different patient groups those are really exciting for us, both from an efficacy standpoint as well as safety standpoint.","So, a lot of the work that's being done right now is sub-analysis to ensure that we can better educate physicians about our data. So, that's kind of the plan there. And I do think that the opportunity here is to potentially have a best-in-class drug inhibitor and that could be also related to the sale activity of the JAK1.","So, having said that, that's what we're doing. All hands are on JAK to prepare for a competitive launch, but a differentiated one and an innovative one at the same time. So, we're excited about that and obviously we'll know more about the label in the coming months through 2020.","So, John maybe on the other.","John Sundy","Sure. Let me update you on the status of cutaneous lupus and Sjogren's studies that we conducted. So, these are proof-of-concept studies as you probably know we looked at a couple or even three different drugs in the same trials for these. These studies were exploratory in nature. We set a high bar for ourselves to proceed.","And while we did not see or meet the primary endpoint in these studies, I think I would like to point out is that we did see evidence of activity with filgotinib, particularly in patients who had markers or evidence of more active disease.","So, we just got the first look at these data, we're looking at the full set of data from all of these studies and we'll determine the next steps that we take an Lupus and Sjogren's disease and we'll share those results at an upcoming meeting soon.","Phil Nadeau","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Evan Seigerman","Hi there and thank you for taking my questions and I also want to extend my best wishes to Robin on her retirement. Just one on the Kite franchise. So, I'm just wondering if you can help me better understand the rationale for the increased investment, namely with the manufacturing facility. But more broadly how is expansion into cell therapy beyond Yescarta fit within your kind of new strategy for Gilead then?","And aside from Yescarta, are there any programs that you should think we should focusing on that drive near-term value for the franchise?","Daniel O'Day","Thanks very much for the question. And \u2013 yeah, again I would probably start with the investments that you mentioned. I mean I think, it's really important that we acknowledge the fact that the ability to manufacture and the turnaround time associated with cell therapy is absolutely fundamental to patient benefits and also to the efficacy results that we see. And I think it's a real competitive advantage to be able to have a network of manufacturing facilities that are state-of-the-art and are able to reduce that turnaround time including as you mentioned we have made a decision to establish a viral vector facility in one of our current manufacturing sites in Oceanside California that will allow us to not only supports the current products but also future products in the pipeline.","So look I mentioned some of the near-term things on CAR T in addition to what we currently have out there with the Yescarta profile today. The state on the Yescarta at ASH I think will be important looking at the three-year data and the early steroid use. The Kite X19 is now a second product for MCL and we look forward to presenting that data as well.","ZUMA-7 goes back to a Yescarta in an earlier line sitting. So when you think about the long duration of effect, the efficacy and durability that we've seen in the relapse\/refractory third line setting, I mean the real question is and more natural obviously oncology developments avenue is to say, can you bring that affect up into earlier lines of therapy and potentially have this effect with more patients and potentially for longer duration, because you're treating them earlier.","So the strategy is very much to continue to expand out the hematology indications first and foremost. I think that's where the greatest product exists or CAR T is right now, but we do also have mid to longer term programs on solid tumors on allergenic and those although risker and earlier are also programs we\u2019re fully committed to as we looked around out our leadership in cell therapy accordingly.","So more to come on this. I personally to the broader oncology strategy, I mean as I said before and I'll say it again, I think the concept of Gilead getting deeper into oncology by starting with a pioneering technology, I think is a smart thing to do in oncology. I mean really to think about where you can get long durations of responses with a new technology.","Having said that, we also have a great deal of expertise in our home-based technologies such as small molecules and an evolving biologic modality expertise at Gilead. And although I'm not prepared to talk more about that today and look forward to Merdad and others coming into the organization, so that we can continue to evolve our oncology strategy.","I think there are opportunities certainly that we can look at outside of cell therapy and complementary to cell therapy, so more on that. We\u2019re literally in the process of really doing deep dives on this. As you know we also have some partnerships with other companies where we are fully committed to different aspects of oncology.","And it's been a common question and I totally accept it and it's one that as we go into next year will be laying out deeper and deeper our holistic strategy around oncology that will include cell therapy but not the only cell therapy as we move ahead. So more to come on that.","Evan Seigerman","Great. Thanks for the question. Appreciate it.","Daniel O\u2019Day","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Tyler Van Buren with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Tyler Van Buren","Thanks guys. Good afternoon. Earlier in the session you guys spoke towards your strategic areas of focus for business development and the Galapagos deal makes a lot of sense from a long-term, broadening out the pipeline perspective and acquiring additional scientific talent in Europe. But could you guys speak a little bit further to your urgency to acquire late-stage or on-market assets particularly maybe within the next year to add to the top-line, which as it stands is relatively flat?","Daniel O\u2019Day","No. Thanks Tyler. I mean, obviously, we're a company that's firmly focused on differentiated medicines and will be driven again by the science both internally and externally. And, obviously, it won't be too long before we start to talk about the guidance for 2020 and beyond and I'm not going to talk about that today.","But the bottom-line is we're -- if I take a big step back and think about my confidence in the long-term growth potential of Gilead, it is captured within the strength of the HIV business. I mean that same business that you see offsetting some of the patent expiry this year continues to be we think a very durable business for the foreseeable future. You have a more predictable HIV-HCV business at this time. And then we have upside potential in filgotinib launching next year and I won't repeat, but the Yescarta programs and success accordingly.","Having said that, we understand that we want to find ways to continue to look to increase and accelerate our growth in the coming years. And that will happen both through internal strategies associated with the launch products and programs I mentioned and then also outside partnerships and M&A. So rest assured, that we are looking at everything that could help complement our later-stage portfolio out there.","And yes, and as you've seen, I think, our behaviors we will be disciplined about that. We will make sure that it's something that we feel scientifically is very strong something that we can add something to and provide strength to. And when and if those opportunities come up we certainly have the financial capacity and ability to act. So that's paramount on our mind. We are in it for short, medium, long-term and we're looking to improve all three of those time periods. But clearly the portfolio is absolutely key for me and a key for the leadership team. So thank you Tyler for your question.","Tyler Van Buren","Yes, thanks very much.","Operator","That will conclude today's question-and-answer session.

The press release and detailed slides are available on the Investor Relations section of the Gilead website.","Joining today's call will be John Milligan, President and Chief Executive Officer; Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Kevin Young, Chief Operating Officer; and Norbert Bischofberger, Executive Vice President of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer.","Before we begin formal remarks, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, financial projections and the use of capital, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the latest SEC disclosures documents and recent press releases. In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.","Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release as well as on the Gilead website.","I will now turn the call over to Robin.","Robin L. Washington - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Sung, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to share results for the second quarter of 2016. I'll first review our financials and Kevin and John will then make a few comments.","Total revenues for the second quarter was $7.8 billion with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.08. This compares to revenues of $8.2 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.15 for the same period last year.","Product sales for the second quarter were $7.7 billion, down 6% year over year and flat sequentially. The year-over-year decline was driven by lower HCV sales, partially offset by increased sales in HIV and other therapeutic areas. Sequentially, we saw an increase in HIV, U.S. HCV and other products that were offset by a decline in HCV sales in Japan and Europe.","Turning to the U.S., product sales for the second quarter were $4.9 billion, down 12% year over year. HCV product sales were $2.3 billion, down 33% year over year, driven by lower revenues per patient as a result of increased rebates and discounts due primarily to payer mix and lower patient starts for Harvoni as the initial group of warehouse patients was treated in 2015. Sequentially, our HCV product sales were up 13%, driven by a $270 million adjustment to our HCV sales returns reserves rate and the initial inventory build for Epclusa.","Strong uptake of our TAF-based regimens drove 23% year-over-year and a 11% sequential growth of our HIV product sales. The quarterly revenues of $2.2 billion were also positively impacted by the upward trajectory of Truvada use for PrEP.","Turning to Europe, product sales for the second quarter were $1.6 billion, down 18% year over year, primarily driven by lower HCV patient starts and a higher proportion of patient starts from countries that have a lower net average price. Sequentially, sales in Europe were flat, excluding the impact of currency movements with HIV sales growth offset by lower HCV sales.","In Japan, product sales for the second quarter were $619 million, down 43% sequentially as a result of lower patient starts on Harvoni and the full quarter effect of the mandatory price reductions for both Sovaldi and Harvoni, which were discussed during our last call.","Moving to gross margin, our non-GAAP product gross margin for the second quarter of 2016 was 92% and benefited from the reversal of a $200 million litigation charge recorded in the first quarter of 2016 following a favorable decision in the Merck case.","Now turning to expenses, non-GAAP R&D expenses were $1 billion for the second quarter, up 48% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the purchase of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration priority review voucher and the progression of clinical studies. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses for the second quarter were up 10%, compared to the same period last year, primarily due to higher costs to support new product launches and our geographic expansion.","From a balance sheet perspective, during the second quarter, we generated cash flow from operations of $4.9 billion and ended the quarter with $24.6 billion in cash and investments. While our cash flows will remain strong in the second half of the year, we anticipate a sequential decrease in Q3 2016 due to required cash payments related to accrued government rebates in the U.S. and abroad as well as milestone payments associated with our R&D pipeline progression.","We continue to return capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During the second quarter, we repurchased 10.5 million shares for $1 billion under the $12 billion 2016 share repurchase program. And we received an additional 8.1 million shares in April 2016 from the final settlement of the accelerated share repurchase program announced in February 2016. The total share repurchases in the first half of the year were 98.2 million at a cost of $9 billion. As previously communicated, we anticipated share repurchases in the second half of 2016 to be lower than the first half of 2016 as we focus our capital allocation on advancing our R&D opportunities.","Finally, we are updating full-year 2016 guidance, which is outlined on slide 21. The changes are as follows. We are lowering net product sales guidance to a range of $29.5 billion to $30.5 billion. While we are seeing continued strength in non-HCV product sales, given the current trends in payer and patient flow dynamics for HCV, our updated models suggest net product sales will range from being slightly above to slightly below $30 billion for the year. As such, we believe it is prudent to update our full-year 2016 guidance.","The factors contributing to this conclusion include lower HCV revenue per patient as a result of a mix shift towards more heavily discounted payer segment in the U.S. and continues with a lower net average price in Europe, a trend toward slowing patient starts in the U.S. commercial segment and some earlier launch markets of Europe, a continued gradual trend towards shorter duration and loss of some market share to competition.","This guidance is subject to a number of uncertainties, including potential changes in the global macroeconomic environment, adoption of additional pricing measures to reduce HCV spending, volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, inaccuracy in our HCV patient start estimates, additional competitive launches in HCV, an increase in discounts, chargebacks and rebates due to ongoing commercial payer contract negotiations and a larger-than-anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments such as PHS, FFS, Medicaid and the VA.","We are increasing our R&D expense guidance to a range of $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion driven by acquisition-related expenses for Nimbus Apollo, Inc. and the purchase of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration priority review voucher, slightly offset by lower-than-anticipated clinical trial expenses.","We are lowering SG&A expense guidance to a range of $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion, primarily driven by the favorable one-time adjustment to the expected invoice from the IRS for the branded prescription drug fee, which lowered Q1 2016 SG&A expense. Diluted EPS impact of acquisition-related upfront collaboration, stock-based compensation, and other expenses increases to a new range of $1.47 to $1.53 as a result of our recent M&A activity. All other components of our 2016 guidance remain unchanged.","I would like to now turn the call over to Kevin.","Kevin B. Young - Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, Robin, and good afternoon, everyone.","Let me say immediately how terrific it is to be back at Gilead in a full-time capacity. Working with exceptional executive colleagues around the table here in Foster City, interacting with my senior operating management team and seeing the dedication of the thousands of Gilead employees around the world leaves me in no doubt as to the long-term prospects for this outstanding company.","While it's early days, over the last two months in my new role, I've had the opportunity to reflect on Gilead's recent product introductions, the evolving healthcare landscape and the operating challenges on our near-term horizon. I'd like to share three general observations with you today. First, I am struck by the commitment that is shared by physicians, payers and governments around the world to reduce the prevalence of hepatitis C.","Even countries with challenging economic circumstances are finding ways to prioritize the treatment of HCV patients. In the two-and-a-half years since the launch of Sovaldi, more than one million patients have been treated on a sofosbuvir-based regimen.","Beneath this aggregated number are several landmark statistics. The United States has already treated nearly half a million patients to-date with Sovaldi and Harvoni. Equally, over 200,000 patients in Europe have been treated with Gilead regimens. Japan has treated approximately 100,000 patients in a little over a year, and just this year, Australia has treated an estimated 17,000 patients in a matter of months.","Healthcare systems have demonstrably mobilized to reach those patients most in need. These are remarkable facts that clearly underscore the profile of the products we have introduced. Equally, they have implications to longer-term treatment dynamics and portfolio lifecycles.","Secondly, in the area of HIV, I'm impressed by how the clinical data for TAF-based regimens are resonating with many constituents who tirelessly drive for better patient care. The understanding that these regimens can help address the growing need for highly effective and safer treatment options for lifelong HIV therapy is evidenced by the early success of Genvoya. I will highlight some impressive data points later.","Thirdly, I'm reminded just how complex the delivery of healthcare continues to be. Gilead's focus on flawless execution on controlling the variables that we can control with the highest levels of conduct and compliance is critical and is my top priority.","Now let me take the details of the commercial performance for the second quarter. Starting with HCV, in the U.S., total HCV revenue was $2.3 billion, up 13% sequentially and down 33% year over year. Since the beginning of the year, access has improved, and almost all major commercial payers have been moved by grocery store criteria, joining Medicare and the VA in this regard.","Medicaid remains the only payer segment where use is still generally restricted to the sicker patients. There are other significant barriers to access, but we are encouraged that some states have recently moved away from fibrosis restrictions towards more open access.","In terms of patient starts, approximately 59,000 people began HCV therapy in the second quarter, and an estimated 90% of these patients started on a sofosbuvir-based regimen. Importantly, third-party databases suggest that new patients are being identified through increased screening efforts. As evidence, approximately, 14 million people were screened for HCV for the period of 2014 through 2015. And approximately 280,000 people were confirmed RNA positive in that two-year period. These figures represent a significant increase from the years prior to the launch of Sovaldi. We estimate that 3 million individuals remain infected with HCV in the U.S., approximately half of whom are diagnosed.","Although patient starts increased for the second consecutive quarter and patient inflows into care remained reasonably steady at around 30,000 patients a month, the dynamics vary by patient segment. Within the commercial and Medicare segments, some larger payers have recently opened up access. We now estimate that up to 90% of all commercial covered lives have access without regard to fibrosis score. While the payers that recently opened up access are bringing in more patients, we are seeing a modest downward trend in patient starts among payers that have had full access in place for longer periods of time.","The sickest patients have largely been treated, and the movement we are seeing is towards treating genotype 1 patients with lower fibrosis scores and thus greater use of the eight-week treatment regimen for Harvoni.","In terms of all new HCV treatment starts in the second quarter, approximately 45% came from within the public payer systems. We anticipate this percentage will remain largely the same through the remainder of the year. The VA is one example of a payer within this segment, and their commitment to treating and curing veterans who have HCV using budget allocated by Congress to do so is truly groundbreaking.","We are aware that in some cities, extra clinics have been scheduled to help shoulder the workload. However, we also expect that in the longer term, socially disadvantaged patients within the VA system will be harder to reach and bringing to care and that the rate of treatment will decline.","Turning to Europe, total HCV revenue in the second quarter was $775 million, down 32% year over year and down 7% sequentially. Overall, Gilead patient starts decreased to around 28,000 for the quarter. We observed steady treatment rates in Italy and Spain, but lower numbers in early launch markets like Germany and France. Patient starts in the UK continue to be limited by NHS England budget restrictions. Additionally, we saw a slight decline in average treatment duration as countries like Germany are treating more patients with low fibrosis scores who qualify for an eight-week treatment duration.","In several European markets, locally documented cure rates are equal to, if not better than, what was demonstrated in Sovaldi and Harvoni clinical studies. This has resonated with governments and payer bodies. And some countries such as France are considering removing all fibrosis score criteria. We will watch this pretty closely and share evolving news with you in the future.","Moving to Japan, as Robin mentioned, revenue was $619 million, down 43% sequentially. We believe this is related to two factors: first, the decline in genotype 1 new patient starts following the Q1 2016 peak when a very large number of individuals with advanced disease initiated therapy; and second, the full three-month effect of a mandatory price reduction previously described on last quarter's call.","Finally, for HCV, Epclusa was recently approved in the U.S., the EU, and Canada. These approvals are true milestones in patient care since Epclusa is the first pan-genotypic once-daily single-tablet option. Epclusa will be an important treatment option in the U.S. as an estimated 20% to 25% of HCV patients have genotype 2 and genotype 3. And equally across Europe, there are some countries that have up to 30% of patients with genotype 3 alone.","In concluding my remarks on hepatitis C, I will return to my earlier comments. Gilead is proud to be part of a fundamental disease paradigm shift, delivering disease cures to virtually all patients treated. That's why we developed Sovaldi, Harvoni, and Epclusa and have a third single-tablet regimen in clinical testing. Whilst the pace of new patient treatments may slow in coming years and quantifying that pace is incredibly hard, there is still an opportunity to identify and cure many HCV-infected people around the globe.","Moving to HIV, we are pleased with the launch of our TAF-based products in the U.S. and in the European markets, where we have already achieved reimbursement. In the U.S., total HIV and other antiviral revenue was $2.2 billion, up 11% sequentially, and Genvoya revenue nearly doubled in Q2 versus Q1. The product represents the most successful HIV launch since the introduction of Atipla, the first single-tablet regimen, a decade ago.","After its first six months of availability, Genvoya is already the most prescribed regimen for both treatment na\u00efve and switch patients. Seventy-eight percent of all Genvoya prescriptions have come from switches. Half of the switches have come from Stribild. And importantly, 10% of switches have come from non-Gilead therapies. Among all patients who switch, we have seen an increase in our ability to retain patients on a Gilead product.","While still in the early stages of the Odefsey and Descovy launches, we are seeing similar patient dynamics to Genvoya. Over 90% of all Odefsey and Descovy prescriptions have come from switches, and 6% and 11% of switches respectively have come from non-Gilead therapies.","Finally, in the U.S., I would like to highlight the growing use of Truvada for PrEP. We estimate somewhere in the order of 60,000 patients to 70,000 patients were using Truvada for PrEP in the second quarter. This number accounts for approximately one-third of Truvada demand. This is encouraging, as we know Truvada has an important role to play as part of comprehensive HIV prevention for many at-risk individuals.","Turning to Europe, total HIV and other antiviral revenue was $755 million, up 5% sequentially, driven by the launches of Genvoya and Descovy. Genvoya has gained pricing approval in 11 countries and is now the market leader in Germany for both treatment-na\u00efve and switch patients after only six months of availability. We anticipate additional launches in France, Italy and the UK in the second half of the year.","Genvoya is a preferred regimen in several HIV treatment guidelines, including Italy where it was added before pricing and reimbursement. Preferred listings are anticipated in other EU guidelines later this year and into 2017. EACS guidelines are expected to be updated following the HIV Glasgow 2016 Conference in October.","Finally, I would like to briefly update you on the outstanding performance of the Gilead U.S. cardiovascular team. Letairis and Ranexa together generated $356 million in revenue during the quarter, representing a 12% year-over-year increase. Today, over 0.25 million people in the United States regularly receive Ranexa and Letairis remains the overall ERA market leader in PAH.","In closing, Gilead achieved a great deal across our operations during the quarter and I am confident that we will continue to make significant progress in the second half of 2016.","I would now like to turn the call over to John.","John F. Milligan - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Kevin.","Before I get started, I just wanted to say it's great to have you back on the Gilead team full time as our new Chief Operating Officer. Today, in addition to the remarks of Robin and Kevin regarding the quarter, I'd like to make a few comments of my own.","Over the last 2.5 years, we made great progress in helping provide access to Sovaldi and Harvoni for HCV patients. Throughout the world more than one million HCV sufferers have now been treated with nearly half of those coming from the U.S.","The launch of these drugs were unprecedented in our industry and patients are treated at a much faster initial rate than we, or anyone else, thought possible. Looking back, we can now say that in every country the peak number of patients treated was achieved within two quarters or three quarters of the launch of Harvoni. And that peak number is far higher than what had ever been achieved before about three times that seen with the launch of the HCV protease inhibitors in 2011.","As we've reached the midpoint of the year, we now see the market maturing to a slower rate of treatment for HCV-infected individuals. And as we think about this more normal pace of patient starts, there are a few things to keep in mind. As Kevin mentioned, there are three million people who are infected in the U.S. and slightly more than half of those have been diagnosed. Many of these diagnosed patients have less advanced liver disease upon reentering care.","For example, in the United States, in the second quarter this year, we estimated that only 13% of patients starting treatment had F4 fibrosis scores compared with more than 21% the year prior to that. With less severely ill patients, there's less urgency to immediately treat patients and this may explain the slower rate of treatment versus last year. However, we do believe these patients will eventually benefit from treatment and this means the flow of patients will continue for many years to come.","There's also an opportunity to diagnose patients and bring them into care. As Kevin mentioned, we estimated that about 280,000 HCV patients were diagnosed in the U.S. within the last two years, considering the value and importance of the U.S. CDC and CMS recommendations for HCV testing. So while there has been a slowing of treatment compared with the rush of patients when Sovaldi and Harvoni were first approved, the HCV market is attractive over the longer term, providing good revenues, strong cash flow and earnings per share on top of our base business of chronic therapies.","Because of this, our focus on improving care for HCV-infected individuals has not wavered. Beyond the recent approvals of Epclusa, we are actively working on a third single-tablet regimen that combines the two active ingredients in Epclusa with a third investigational compound, voxilaprevir. This combination known as SOF\/VEL\/VOX is being evaluated in four Phase 3 clinical trials among patients who have previously failed direct-acting antiviral treatments. It's also being studied for its potential to offer an eight-week treatment duration for treatment-na\u00efve patients of all genotypes. We expect to have top line data available for SOF\/VEL\/VOX by the end of the year.","We're making tremendous headway in HIV as well both with our portfolio of newer products and our pipeline. We've had several key approvals with Descovy approved in the U.S. and Europe last quarter and Odefsey approved in Europe earlier this month. It's clear these medications offer a significant advance for patients, and that advance has been recognized now by multiple professional and public health groups, including the International Antiviral Society of the U.S.A and the Department of Health and Human Services, both of which released updated guidelines supporting the use of TAF-based regimens for initial HIV therapy.","We continue to generate clinical data that support the favorable scientific and medical profile of our TAF-based products. Last week we announced the results of two Phase 3b switch studies evaluating Odefsey in virologically-suppressed adults, switching from Complera or ATRIPLA. Odefsey achieved similar rates of virological suppression as the TDF-based regimen. These studies reinforce the efficacy of Odefsey as of the renal and bone safety advantages that we plan to present full data sets later this year.","Last month we presented the first human data of bictegravir, our investigational un-boosted integration inhibitor at the American Society for Microbiology. Data from four preclinical and Phase 1 studies examined the antiviral potency, resistance profile, pharmacokinetics and safety of bictegravir, providing the rationale to further evaluate the compound.","Bictegravir, as part of a single-tablet regimen in combination with TAF and emtricitabine is currently in Phase 3 trials. Enrollment of more than 2,300 patients across four registrational studies was completed earlier this month. The 48-week endpoints for these studies will be reached in the second quarter of next year; and if the data play out as we hope, NDA and MAA filings could occur in the third quarter of 2017.","With the approval and rapid adoption of our TAF-based regimens and exciting new STR in Phase 3 development and an active HIV research pipeline, I'm confident that we will be able to extend our leadership position in the HIV market and broaden our ability to help even more patients around the world.","Outside of our work in antivirals, Gilead has focused on solving some of the biggest health challenges today. Several important data sets that are anticipated in the second half of this year may help us to find a strategy and pathway forward for tackling these challenges.","In our NASH program, where we have four active clinical programs, we'll have data from the Phase 2 studies of GS-4997, our ASK-1 inhibitor, and simtuzumab, our monochromal antibody and sLOXL2. The Phase 2 study of simtuzumab for primary sclerosing cholangitis will also conclude, and we'll also have data from the Phase 2 studies of GS-4997 in diabetic nephropathy and pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH.","And finally, we expect data from two Phase 3 studies for myelofibrosis before the end of the year. If these data are positive, these studies will form the basis for an NDA filing in the first quarter of 2017. These are important milestones and represent a great deal of work across the organization to enroll and advance these studies and analyze complex data sets as they become available.","Gilead continues to innovate at every level in every part of the organization. Next month, we will publish our first corporate social responsibility report that looks at access, sustainability, grant-making and other positive contributions to the communities we serve and I urge you to read it.","I'm proud of the work that's being led by our employees and extend my many thanks to them for all the ways they're making a difference around the world.","Thank you, and let's now open up the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. And, Kevin, good to have you back on the call and in the seat, of course. So I want to dig into your comments and also John's comments on the hep C new starts. And, I guess, I'm curious here, because you have better F0-F1 access, you have positive impact theoretically from the CDC guidelines and very low penetration in markets such as the prison population. I'm just curious why \u2013 could you put your finger on maybe one or two things that you feel like could ultimately become a growth driver to give us back to better sequential growth? I'm just trying to figure out what the tipping point is on some of these different volume drivers. Thanks.","Kevin B. Young - Chief Operating Officer","Hey, Geoff, nice to hear your voice as well. Thank you for the comments. I'm not at all pessimistic about the long-term prospects for hepatitis C. In fact, I'm rather optimistic. I think what we have seen 2014\/2015 is an enormous group of the less well patients treated particularly by specialist hepatitis C treaters. It's really quite amazing.","I think this quarter, and we've highlighted perhaps going forward, is really a sort of a payer mix situation that we've got. The VA has definitely increased in terms of its contribution to the 59,000 total HCV starts, which, of course, was an increase on quarter one. So a lot of VA patients are coming through, and the VA is very, very motivated to try to essentially eradicate the virus from that population. I think, yes, we did see pickup in two of the large payers that came onstream with open fibrosis scores from the beginning of the year, but we did see some downtick in other commercial payers. So net-net, it was slightly a decrease in overall commercial patients.","What I feel about the long term and as we go into years further forward and we hit an equilibrium of patients is all around what I mentioned and John mentioned around diagnoses, there's been a considerable pickup in the number of HCV tests 2014 and 2015, about a 65% increase in the number of HCV tests, 280,000 in that two-year period were HCV RNA positive. So, as John said, they will eventually work their way through to treatment.","There's still over a quarter of the population being diagnosed is at a fall, so there's still a lot of sickness out there in patients. So whilst the healthcare system here and in some of the European markets have done heroic things in treating patients in the last two years, I still think with 1.5 million diagnosed patients in the United States, that we are going to see a continued healthy flow of patients that can benefit from our products.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, thanks, Kevin.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges of Leerink. Your line is now open.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much. So, Kevin, welcome back, and very good to hear you. So following up on this somewhat vexing issue of the HCV outlook, historically, in this category after each market has peaked, it's begun a steady slow, sometimes slow anyway, decline. We certainly saw a rapid decline after the protease inhibitors, more slow decline after we went to ribavirin and with the introduction of pegylated interferon.","Are you suggesting to us that you think that there is a stable outlook for the HCV revenue on a market-by-market basis from these levels? Or are you suggesting that we should see more like an orderly and steady decline? And could you particularly comment about Europe where I think it was surprising to see patient numbers in the big early markets roll over so quickly, particularly, Germany and Japan. Is that a one-time step-down? Or are we going to continue at or below this level going forward?","Kevin B. Young - Chief Operating Officer","Thanks for the question, Geoff. I think it is encouraging that our patient starts in the U.S. and Europe have been reasonably steady over the past three quarters. Japan's a different story and I can certainly at some point comment on that this afternoon. I think from my perspective and Robin, Norbert, John around the table here, I think it's more of the latter comment that there will continue to be a gradual decline in new patient starts, but an equilibrium will be eventually hit.","Quite the timing of that, Geoff, it's really, really, really hard to peg. I've just got to believe that with the amount of testing, with the amount of diagnoses, with the CDC guidelines, Gilead itself in Q3 \u2013 Q4 of this year are going to do some more educational programs around the need to test and treat that we will eventually hit an equilibrium.","In terms of Europe, Italy and Spain are very steady. I should tell you that in Italy, there are still 200,000 quite sick individuals, people to be treated and they're in treated care. And the Italian government do want to go ahead and try and mobilize providers to do that treating, so still an enormous number in Italy. I think the markets that are more akin to the U.S. like first and foremost, Germany and to a slight lesser extent France, are starting to see that turnover of patients. We've got full access in terms of fibrosis score in Germany. And we're hoping, as I said, that we get broader access in France. The UK is a different situation now. It's largely due to payer restrictions. But again, still an enthusiasm to treat, but one or two of those markets there is some maturing going on.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Very good, thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Regina Grebla - Evercore Group LLC","Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my call. This is Regina Grebla in for Mark. I actually wanted to change topics and shift to hepatitis B. On your Q1 call, you mentioned your hep B program included a vaccine, a TLR-7 agonist, and two other internal preclinical candidates. When will we see any data on the internal candidates? And also you mentioned taking a look at external opportunities for hepatitis B. Is hep B still a potential area of interest for acquisition? Thank you.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer","And so, Regina, you asked a question about what our pipeline is for hepatitis B. So we have, as you know, two compounds that are currently in clinical development. One is an active vaccine, GS-4779, a collaboration with GlobeImmune. That's currently in the later stages of being evaluated in non-suppressed hep B patients. The suppressed hep B patients, those data had been released maybe a year ago. They did not show any activity. So we don't have high hopes that this compound will work.","Then the TLR-7 agonist is just finishing the first cohort, which is in suppressed patients. And we are currently initiating \u2013 the second cohort is ongoing. We hope that we'll have the presentation of the first cohort ready by ASLD. Hopefully, we'll reach the abstract deadline.","Then you said that \u2013 you asked a question about we have two other compounds in development. You know what we're pursuing \u2013 maybe I should answer this more generally. So we're pursuing three approaches to hepatitis B cure. The one is adding another different mechanism to the nucleotides because there's the observation that despite being undetectable with hepatitis B therapies like Viread or TAF, there was always a little bit of virus left, HBV, if you look at very sensitive PCR methods. So by adding another mechanism to it, we could completely suppress virus replication down to zero, would that lead to an eventual cure or hepatitis S conversion.","The second thing we're pursuing is immune therapy, so that belongs to vaccine and to TLR-7 that I've talked about already. And we have a TLR-8 agonist currently that is working its way towards an IND. And the third possibility that's the most hopeful but also the one that's least scientifically proven is going directly after cccDNA. And that's really too early to talk about at this point. It's still in the research stages.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. You talked a lot about volume and demand in the different buckets. But can you talk about the payer mix shift? Specifically, I wanted to ask on Medicaid. Can you just help us out with what percent of sales Medicaid is, and what is going on in that bucket? I presume it's a state-by-state negotiation. Can you talk about what's going on there? Is there a state-by-state negotiation you have to go through? Is that pretty much done? Walk us through that bucket and what percent of hep C that is in the USA so we can understand them. Thank you so much","Kevin B. Young - Chief Operating Officer","Hi, Michael. It's Kevin. Thank you for the question. I'd prefer not to break out specifically the percentage of the public payers in terms of Medicaid. As I said, all our public payers lumped together for the quarter were about 45%. That's an increase from the previous quarter. But as I said, that's all driven by VA. We've seen very little change really in the scale and size of our Medicaid business. I think it would be true to say that Medicaid's \u2013 the states are slowly, progressively opening up.","Forty percent of Medicaid patients come from the five largest states. Two of those, New York and Florida, now have no fibrosis score. So as states do progressively consider opening up, they typically come to us for a contract. We think about those contracts very carefully. Depending on the size of Medicaid, we obviously put our submission in. Realistically, I think we may win, we hope, the majority of those, but there may be occasions when occasionally a Medicaid state goes to the competition.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thanks so much for taking the question. Robin, if you could, address the $279 million one-time swing. We obviously saw a swing in the first quarter and then a swing this quarter again. Can you just give us some insight into what's going on with those changes in chargebacks and if we should continue to expect to see some of those numbers? And then just separately on PrEP, any plans to get a TAF-based regimen approved for PrEP? Thanks","Robin L. Washington - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, I'll take the first part and then Norbert will take the second. Matt, first of all, there are two separate things that we're talking about here, Q2 versus Q1. First, let me address Q2. We did have a sales return reserve adjustment, really related to the fact that as we introduced our new hep C product, we're required to go out and get an external proxy related to sales return reserves. And just recently, just this past quarter we closed several of the lots related to our product regimes, and no further returns are expected. So that gives us a triggering event by which we can look at returns versus how we had been accruing.","The other key thing about the timing of this related to this accrues a lot. So as we bring on a new product, we want to rebase their level of returns that we're expecting to see. So that's really the adjustment there. For the most part, you can see \u2013 it's one-time in nature. We may have small adjustments going forward. But as long as returns continue where they are then that $279 million is kind of a one-time event.","Last quarter, we had a different issue and that related to rebate claims for hepatitis C. And as I said on the call last time, we always have a situation, where we're constantly showing up claims around HCV rebate, because we get those claims one to two quarters in arrear. This quarter was a bit different than last quarters that we saw a modernization of the level of those claims relative to the prior quarter. So it didn't reverse the other way, it was just a slowing of what we saw in Q1.","So we're \u2013 for lack of a better word, we're a little bit more caught up relative to returns this quarter than we were at the end of Q1. So two different items, but we called out the $279 million because that was the one-time event. So we wanted to ensure that you understood relative to the future projection of HCV sales.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for clarification.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer","Hi, Matt, your question about F\/TAF for PrEP, so we and also the outside medical community believes that obviously Descovy or F\/TAF would have advantages in terms of use for PrEP versus Truvada for all the obvious data that were published already. And also, we have data non-human \u2013 in animal models that showed that has the same efficacy. The thing we're debating internally and also we have had early discussions with FDA is what clinical study would need to be done that leads to approval. It would have to be in almost all likelihood a comparative study and then the secret is what would be the sample size and what would be the powering. And that's currently a discussion we're having with FDA. We hope we can come to some conclusion within the next month or so and then let you know.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. And, Kevin, good to hear your voice again. With the list pricing and label established for Epclusa, just wondering what's the right way to think about Epclusa's potential impact on the genotype 2\/3 franchise, particularly, with respect to the net price per patient, treatment duration relative to Sovaldi and just how we should be thinking about the overall market dynamics there? And just wondering if you could also quantify the inventory build this quarter there. Thanks.","Kevin B. Young - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, great question, Brian. Nice to hear your voice as well. Brian, the majority of the revenues in the second quarter, which is right at the end. The majority of that was inventory that Robin called out. So we've really only just begun the introduction, both the promotion and the education around Epclusa. I'm really pleased that the response has been excellent. And our advisory boards and our speaker programs have been good acceptance.","Whilst we have obviously a pan-genotypic label, I think the reality is that physicians are very, very comfortable, as are payers, with Harvoni for genotype 1. Obviously, there's a mix of 12-week treatments and eight-week. Just for your information, the eight-week course of Harvoni is now 45% of patients treated in the United States. So I think people are just really comfortable with the clinical effect and the value proposition of Harvoni in GT 1.","That all means that the slot that people see Epclusa is in the genotype 2 and genotype 3 patient. As I highlighted, it's something like in the order of 20% to 25% of patients in the United States. I think the obvious advantage both clinically and from a payer point of view is you really do have a 12-week single-tablet regimen. You don't have to extend the treatment duration. You don't have to use ribavirin. There was quite a number of patients treated with Sovaldi\/daclatasvir, certainly in United States. So really somewhat it takes away that regimen and is an excellent slot. So we've had very good reception to Epclusa. It's extremely early days. It will take us three months to six months to get payer approval. Physicians can apply based on medical need and we know they're doing that. So just very early days and weeks. It seems to have found a very nice entry point.","Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I have a bigger picture question for you. Really, just following the latest management shuffle back in 2Q, I'm wondering if these changes portend any material shift or consideration of a shift in \u2013 I guess your commercial or pricing strategy really the overall strategy for the businesses or any of the key businesses? And is this playing into the bump in anticipated R&D with the associated downtick in SG&A as illustrated by your updated guidance? Thanks.","John F. Milligan - President and Chief Executive Officer","I think there were a couple of questions. So it's John Milligan. So in terms of \u2013 let me get to the last bit. You said there was a bump in R&D. That is true relating somewhat to our acquisition of Nimbus. So there were charges associated with that and are also charges associated \u2013 I should say, expenses associated with the purchase of an FDA priority review voucher. So we're very pleased to get that on board. And we'll look forward to explaining when we're going to use that. Above and beyond that, actually, R&D expenses were slightly down what we \u2013 beneath what we had forecasted, because we continue to hold the cost centers accountable and continue to drive good value through our clinical teams in getting studies done at a cost-effective way.","So in terms of that, there's no difference. The SG&A line came down a little bit, because of some one-time charges that were lower than we \u2013 I'm sorry \u2013 the IRS charges was lower than we anticipated. So kind of what we would expect. In terms of signaling about pricing or changes in management about structures, I don't really think there's anything to signal there in terms of our pricing strategy. We're highly competitive. We think we have a very good differentiated product. And we'll continue to do the best for the company and for patients by coming to the right level of price and access.","Kevin B. Young - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. And I would just add, Cory, that the Gilead way is always to lead with the science around our product. Nothing's changed in my eyes as I've come back into the company. We lead with science. That's what you do in specialist markets. It is a reality that there's more contracting. I think we've got a phenomenal team working on this. I met with them two weeks ago. And I think they're highly professional. And we always lead with value. That's the key thing. We think we've got tremendous products that either control disease or cure disease and they add terrific value. And that's the course we're going to stay.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Phil Nadeau of Cowen. Your line is now open.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. And, Kevin, it's great to have you back. I have a question on capital allocation. In prepared remarks, I think you mentioned in regards to cash flows being lower in the second half of the year that part of that was investment in R&D. And as you just discussed, that R&D expenses aren't really changing that much in the guidance. So kind of curious whether you have on your list of things to do in the second half of the year more deals, whether M&A or in-licensing, and maybe you could give us some thoughts on how aggressive you're likely to be in those areas.","Robin L. Washington - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Phil, I'll start. I think relative to the cash flow, what I was messaging was really just related to the dynamics of payment, right. So we have accrued rebates and other things that kind of cause volatility to quarterly cash flow. So overall, our cash flows remain strong, but we definitely expect a sequential decrease in cash flow second half.","Relative to our overall capital allocation, it's no different than what we've been messaging; again, more focused on our BD opportunity. But I'll let John speak a little bit more and just again, focus on that. And that additional focus has meant we're somewhat less focused on share repurchases in the second half of the year.","John F. Milligan - President and Chief Executive Officer","And just to follow up on what Robin said, Phil, we were very aggressive in the first quarter of this year. That's why we back off a little bit from where we are in the second half of the year. Mostly, you get the full-year effect or a greater effect of repurchasing the almost 100 million shares through Robin's program.","With regard to business development, obviously, we're a company that has been very open about being interested in doing more deals; especially, deals of a certain size where we think we can get some leverage and we can use our organization to effectively accelerate or expand indications. We've done some good deals both with Galapagos and Nimbus recently. We are very interested in continuing that to add more things to our pipeline, especially, in the non-antiviral area where we continue to see growth and franchises.","It's our hope that as we exit this year, we'll have a better, more complete story of programs internally and externally that we can use to talk about why the long-term prospects for growth are as good as we believe they are. And that's what we'll be focused on.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great, thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas of Citi. Your line is now open.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, the question from me after hearing some of the comments about like thinking about volumes slowing or coming down and then thinking about gross to net changing over time is, how are you comfortable that you can provide guidance with these two variables? Do you have any bookends for how low we can go that gives you the comfort? And then, the question is, you affirmed guidance last quarter and lowered it this quarter. What was the one thing you think that really changed your view over the last three months that led to that? Thanks.","Kevin B. Young - Chief Operating Officer","I'll start and then hand the question to Robin. You know, Robyn, it's really hard. We've got markets in different stages of development whether it be U.S., parts of the U.S., different countries in Europe, and, obviously, interesting and profound dynamics in Japan. So that partly made up of patient flows and partly made up of sort of payer flow. I think the big thing this quarter, from the point of view of the U.S., was very much a payer kind of mix with the large addition of patients from the VA.","So I think in the last three months that was probably the biggest thing. We have not changed our prices in the U.S. Q2 versus Q1. It was largely we're seeing dramatic, but incredibly successful program from VA.","Robin L. Washington - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Robyn, I'll add to that. I agree with Kevin. I think the heavier percentage of more discounted payers along with the fact that on the commercial side, we're seeing slight decreases in the U.S. And Kevin mentioned earlier about what we're also seeing relative to the mix shift in countries in Europe less of Northern Europe, Germany, France, and more of Italy and Spain. The other part of your question is, as we said earlier throughout the call, this is a really difficult area to predict.","It's unlike any other \u2013 it's a curative market and it's very large relative to Gilead's total revenue. So it's a question we have in ourselves as we think in the outer years how can we continue or can we really guide around HCV revenues. So we guided this year, but it's definitely something we're getting a lot of proxy as we think about the trends of HCV going forward and all the dynamics that we're trying to deal with it. It's very complex. So more to follow on that.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ying Huang of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have a quick one on also the pricing environment. So if you look at VA sector and also the commercial sector, what kind of impact are you seeing from competition, particularly in Merck's Zepatier, from the pricing perspective? And then quickly on R&D side, do you plan to develop a doublet maintenance regimen? For example, recently Tivicay plus Edurant, the combination showed actually good results in heavily pretreated patients in the conference. Thank you.","Kevin B. Young - Chief Operating Officer","So I'll take the first part in terms of pricing and competitive impact, very little in terms of our commercial payer areas because the contracts essentially were set up at the end of last year for the full year, so very little change in market share within the commercial payer segments. We still have a very strong position in VA with Harvoni and Sovaldi, particularly Harvoni. I think probably where we're seeing increased competitive activity is in the Medicaid setting where, as I described earlier, some of the smaller states are requesting contracts as they open up access.","So I think that's probably where we see the competition. And again, because of our very strong value proposition, we hope we can be successful in the majority of those. But again, on occasions we may find that they go to the competition.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer","Ying, you asked a question about the pan-genotypic NS5A. So we're, of course, aware of the data that were presented at EASL. They looked fairly impressive. They had a number of genotypes with high SVR rates. However, what they're doing right now in Phase 3 is not looking at the eight-week treatment duration or genotypes in old patients.","I would like to contrast this with our own triple combination, SOF\/VEL\/VOX, that John Milligan mentioned. We are looking essentially at two patient populations. One patient population is experienced that had previously failed other DAAs that treatment duration is for 12 weeks. And then we're looking at all genotypes, cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients, for eight-week treatment duration.","And we have one study in particular that only looks at eight weeks of treatment duration in the most difficult to treat genotype 3 cirrhotic patients because that's still a population where SVR rates are still in the low 90%. And if we could push that up into the high 90%, that would be a step forward. So I think if our Phase 3 program, the data supports our Phase 2 results, then we will be a step ahead of all the competition.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ian Somaiya of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to follow up on the triplet opportunity within hep C. Specifically, Norbert, just I don't know if you could describe the proportion of patients that have maybe failed in the first round of antivirals, whether it be doublet therapy or SOF alone. So I don't know if there's a relevant pool that you can speak to.","And then maybe it's more a question for Kevin. Just how do we think about the triplet and its impact on margin price share?","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer","So, Ian, as you know, we are doing essentially four studies with the triplet, what we call the triplet SOF\/VEL\/VOX. Two of them are in treatment-experienced patients, and what we would aspire to is to have this compound be the universal salvage regimen.","Now, Kevin, maybe you could comment on what the proportion of patients is that would qualify with this. But something I can tell you, in Japan, there's a fairly large number of patients that have been treated with the Bristol-Myers GI NS5A regimen. I think if I remember this correctly, they have SVR rates in the Phase 3 study of about 80% or thereabouts. And there are about 9,000 patients now that we heard of that are treatment-experienced that had failed. And those 9,000 patients would immediately be candidates for our own studies. And I said, I want to say it again, the other two studies are eight weeks' treatment duration for all patients, all genotypes, cirrhotics and non-cirrhotics. Kevin?","Kevin B. Young - Chief Operating Officer","It's a good question, Ian. We're waiting to see some of the obviously emerging clinical data. Right now, I think we've got a situation, certainly in the U.S. Japan with this resistant situation I think is perhaps quite unique in terms of the original use of the Bristol-Myers regimen. But I think we've got patients being cured to an incredibly high level with Harvoni. And now we've got the right treatment, I think, in (1:06:11). So I think in the U.S., perhaps in Europe, it will be far more modest, the opportunity.","Having said that, it depends where we are with those products, our products with where the competition is, obviously what we decide to do in terms of the pricing strategy. I think most importantly, from a company point of view, we think this is the right thing to do and probably the last step in the whole story around hepatitis C to help treatment-experienced or failure patients. So I think first and foremost, we think this is the right thing to do for patients in need.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Alethia Young of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Let me be the thousandth person, Kevin, to say welcome back and it's great to have you here, two questions in the same vein. Just one on oncology, has this remained a focus for you guys as far as building assets there and building up that business as much as it was in the past when you talk about it? And secondarily, just, Norbert, with NASH, can you just talk about some of the data points coming up and like what's going on with the FXR program as well? Thanks.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer","So, Alethia, let me start off by firstly and then John Milligan will have to comment on it too. We are in oncology. We have now momelotinib at the end of the Phase 3 program. We should have data this year. If the data (1:07:30) application next year. We have the MMP9 in gastric cancer in Phase 3. We're looking at other solid tumors. And we're now finally, after sorting out the dosing, starting the first study in combination of PI3K and with BTK in CML.","So with regards to NASH, we have now very interesting four modalities or four mechanisms that we're evaluating in NASH. And at least with three of them, we know that they're doing what they're supposed to do pharmacologically. We will have data this year on the ASK inhibitor that will include liver fat analyses along with histology. The FXR agonist is currently in a Phase 1\/Phase 2a study. And by the way, we know about that compound already; that it has minimal systemic absorption, but there are systemic levels of FGF19. That was always our idea to have a compound that acts in the GI that releases FGF19. The FGF19 has the efficacy. And by that rationale, we both get decidedly other FXR agonist path. And then finally, we have \u2013 wait a moment, ASK inhibitor?","Kevin B. Young - Chief Operating Officer","ACC.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer","ACC inhibitor, the Nimbus compound. And we know those data were presented at EASL that it reduces de novo lipogenesis. So what we're going to do based on these data is firstly with ASK, we could go into Phase 3 next year and with the other compounds into Phase 2 with the FXR and the ACC inhibitor, or even this year. John?","John F. Milligan - President and Chief Executive Officer","I'd just follow up with Norbert's comment by saying, we are committed to oncology. We continue to be interested in assets, collaborations, and partnerships where we could enhance our ability to continue to sell these products. But where we are seeing good progress, as Norbert mentioned, our BTK inhibitor, which is we're developing with our partner from ONO, is now making its way to the clinic. And we've overcome some formulation challenges to allow us to go ahead. So that will be very, very, I think, an interesting avenue for us to continue to explore.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just wondering, kind of, two-parter. The first is just any opportunity to broaden your prescriber base on hep C. Kevin, would love your thoughts on that.","And the second question relates to Genvoya. Can you just give us what percentage of the switches were from Atripla? Thanks.","Kevin B. Young - Chief Operating Officer","Hey, Terence. First of all, in terms of any feature rates of market, I did mention Australia earlier, and that's an incredible story of treating and curing patients and amazing commitment by the government there. We are seeing more patients treated in Brazil. It's a lower price market, but we have seeing more. We are just beginning our launch in Mexico. So, yes, these are smaller markets. Typically, they are lower-priced. But those \u2013 if you like, those smaller ways are starting to work through.","We are thinking carefully about China and how we launch there probably in a very modest, very focused way, very efficient way, should I say. So our expectations, I think, are very reasonable around China. So the second question in terms of switch, about 18% of the switch patients is from ATRIPLA. So I hope that gives you the number.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today.

And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Sung Lee, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Sung Lee","Thank you, Liz, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the second quarter of 2019. The press release and detailed slides are available on the Investor Relations section of the Gilead website. The speakers on today's call will be: Daniel O'Day, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Johanna Mercier, Chief Commercial Officer; and Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Also in the room are Diana Brainard, Senior Vice President and Head of our HIV and Emerging Viruses Therapeutic Area; and John Sundy, Senior Vice President and Head of our Inflammation Therapeutic Area.","Before we begin with our prepared comments, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, financial projections and the use of capital all of which involve certain assumptions risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements.","A description of these risks can be found in our latest SEC disclosure documents and recent press releases.

It's now month five and I'm really pleased that I've had a chance now to talk with you the second time in the second quarter after the first quarter call with some very good results. I would like to share a few opening comments and then I'm going to turn the call over to Johanna Mercier, who joined us at the beginning of the month, as our new Chief Commercial Officer. Very happy to have Joanna with us as well.","Robin will then take over and walk you through some of the highlights of the strong quarter. So let me just start by saying, I'm really pleased with the progress we're making across all the fronts. As one example, as the leader in HIV, we're very focused on continuous innovation as you may have seen from some of the recent data we presented. Biktarvy is the number one regimen in the United States now. Momentum continues to build and we expect that momentum to continue in the future.","I mentioned on the last quarter that I would focus on three key priorities as I came into this organization: The first one was the pipeline; the second one was optimal commercial delivery that's both for our current products but also as we prepare for some new and important and exciting launches; and then, thirdly, really people, the organization bringing the right team together at the right time for Gilead.","And as you can see we've had a very busy quarter. We've announced key changes this quarter that helped to address really all three of these priorities. And importantly we've made these changes against the backdrop of strong financials and really promising pipeline progress. So let me say a few words about the major steps we've taken to, first of all, strengthen the pipeline with the Galapagos collaboration; secondly, I want to dive a little bit into the highlights from our current pipeline; and three talk a little bit about the organizational changes as well.","So first on Galapagos, it\u2019s fresh news. Earlier this month we announced an exciting new collaboration with Galapagos. As you know, Galapagos is a highly productive R&D engine. They have seven medicines now in clinical development including filgotinib, which has a very comprehensive of life cycle program. And they have more than 20 medicines now in preclinical and their model has been very productive at producing new candidates for the clinic every year. And of course with our increased investments we would expect that to even increase in the future.","This is a really unique collaboration because it combines complementary strengths between Gilead and Galapagos and very importantly and, as you know, we structured this to allow Galapagos to remain independent. Many of you know my past. I'm a big believer that innovation requires independence, I think to be preserved. And the structure of this deal allows us to preserve the great science and talent at Galapagos. They can invest and innovate to accelerate the progress based upon our investments. And in return we have an exclusive access right to their proven drug discovery platform.","All of this I believe will help patients, science, and our business in a very significant way. So I was really pleased this was the first collaboration that I could announce under my tenure and yet, this is still a beginning. We'll continue to explore other ways to strengthen our pipeline and our innovation network in the future. Secondly, on the pipeline side, this has been an important time for our existing pipeline. Let me touch on a couple of things that speak to our growth potential before handing it over to Johanna.","And there's two things I want to just highlight here, some recent promising HIV data that we presented recently; and secondly, since the last quarter our plans to file filgotinib for approval. So, first of all, we had a terrific week last week at the International AIDS Society Conference on HIV Science. We were able to present clinical data for our first-in-class HIV capsid inhibitor, the GS-6207. And as you saw the early results support further development as a long-acting therapy that we think will really meet the needs of the community that we serve.","And then we also presented further data on Descovy for PrEP, additional data that reinforces the profile of the Descovy in the PrEP setting. And as you know this is currently under regulatory view in the United States. And we also have plans to file Descovy for PrEP in the EU in the first half of 2020.","We are looking forward to the FDA advisory committee that will be held next week. And overall, we're encouraged by the government's engagement around HIV prevention in many forms. The advisory committee will be an important opportunity and provide an -- a forum for Gilead to talk about the benefits of Descovy in the prevention setting for a broad population of individuals at risk for HIV.","So secondly, on filgotinib, as you know now based upon a meeting with the agency we intend to file for U.S. approval for filgotinib later this year in rheumatoid arthritis based upon our discussions with the FDA. We will also be filing in the EU really eminently at this stage, so overall very good news on the path for filgotinib. I had the chance actually recently to attend the EULAR meeting, the Annual European Congress of Rheumatology in Madrid so I can get a first-hand view of the enthusiasm among physicians and thought leaders about the profile of filgotinib and the potential it has to be a best-in-class among the JAK1 inhibitors.","Finally then a few comments about the work we've been doing to build the right team for the future. I'm very pleased to welcome Johanna who you'll hear from next; and Christi Shaw who joins us from Eli Lilly. She will start as CEO of Kite on August 1. And as you know with Christi's arrival at Kite, Kite will become its own business unit and we remain committed to accelerating the pipeline and maintaining our leadership position in cell therapy.","I'd also like to very much extend the thanks to three leaders who will be leaving Gilead, John McHutchison, Gregg Alton and Katie Watson. John Greg and Katie have all made tremendous contributions that helped to shape today's results that you're seeing and really Gilead's progress over the past many year\u2019s decades in fact. So I'd like to thank them as we transition the team forward for Gilead.","So, in closing, from my side, I just wanted to emphasize how increasingly optimistic I am about the future of Gilead and the potential that it has. This is a unique company. It's a company that cures hepatitis C and transformed HIV. I'm getting an up-close view of the unique strengths that made that possible. I'm looking forward to working with all the talented people at Gilead as we apply those strengths to the next wave of transformational advances in various diseases.","We're making great progress and there's much more to come and I look forward to continuing to share more about my vision for the future later this year as I communicated. But as you can tell, I'm not waiting for that we're implementing along the course of that strategy with many of the things that you've seen in this past quarter. So I'd like to thank all of our employees and partners around the world for their dedication and hard work to bench with successful quarter and whose commitment will continue to make us successful in the future.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Johanna.","Johanna Mercier","Thanks Dan and good afternoon everyone. So although, I'm only one month in I've become to get to know the company the people and I just want to say how impressed I've been by the talent and the strength of the team as well as what we've accomplished so far. And today I wanted to take the opportunity to maybe highlight two areas that really caught my attention, both of which I believe are real growth opportunities moving forward for Gilead. Those are the strength of our HIV business both in treatment as well as in prevention as well as the potential for filgotinib.","So if we start with HIV. You'll hear from Robin describing in more detail our results for the quarter, but our HIV portfolio have never been stronger. Biktarvy continues to be a very impressive launch. It's on an incredible trajectory. It just hit its first $1 billion quarter in the U.S. for Q2. It's now the number one prescribed regimen in the U.S. for both na\u00efve and switch patients as well as number one for na\u00efve in switch in Germany, in France and in Spain.","We just got reimbursement in Italy and the U.K. in the last two months or so, so more to come on performance there. As Dan mentioned we had a really strong showing last week at the International AIDS Society Conference presenting research that really demonstrated the breadth of the scientific work across our pipeline from prevention to treatment to cure. This included a couple of new announces of our Descovy for PrEP. We really believe that Descovy for PrEP could offer important safety advantages over Truvada as it shows superior safety for bone and renal as well as rapid onset and longer duration of preventative therapy than Truvada.","These are really clinically meaningful to individuals, physicians and payers for two main reasons. Individuals at risk of HIV are not patients but they're generally healthy people. So therefore the bar for safety among this population is just so much higher. The second reason is the persistency on PrEP has increased actually similar to that that what we're seeing in HIV treatment patient.","In addition, younger people are initiating this therapy at the time when they're actually building peak bone mass.","So overall, people on preventative therapy are on for longer periods of time, which is what makes these results even more compelling. And that's exactly what we heard from physicians at AdBoard last week during the conference. So we're very excited about what's to come with DESCOVY in PrEP.","Dan mentioned that we're under review with the FDA for the prevention of HIV. And for the reasons, I've just shared we really believe it had significant potential to make a difference in the life of a broad population of individuals at risk of HIV. So that's the first real growth opportunity both in HIV treatment as well as in PrEP. The second one is around filgotinib.","I really see commended potential in filgotinib and the teams you can imagine they're really hard at work in preparing the launch of this medicine. It's a high priority for me and the team and the whole organization. Although, it's a very competitive space and we know that, we truly have an opportunity to make a difference in the lives of people living with RA and potentially even other inflammatory indication as these are just such debilitating diseases.","And yes there are numerous treatments on the market for RA. However, many patients aren't actually helped by the therapies that are currently available. The FINCH studies highlight the strong efficacy and tolerability results of filgotinib in different patient types. Filgotinib a JAK1 specific inhibitor could actually answer a clear unmet need in the marketplace for an efficacious and safe oral agent. So, still to come on that, and obviously more to come on the filing in the second half of this year.","So with that, I really look forward to working with this great team to deliver on the promise of this medicine and to getting to speak with you in more detail in the near future. I just want to take a moment to thank everyone for such a warm welcome as I've arrived a month ago.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Robin. Robin?","Robin Washington","Thank you, Johanna, and welcome. Good afternoon, everyone. As Dan said in his opening comments, we had a strong quarter led by our HIV franchise, predictable performance in HCV and continued growth of Yescarta.","Total revenues for the second quarter were $5.7 billion with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.82. This compares to revenues of $5.6 billion, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.91 for the same period last year. Total revenues in non-GAAP earnings per share for the second quarter benefited from an approximately $160 million adjustment for statutory revenue clawback reserve, primarily related to HIV and HCV sales in Europe from prior years, which contributed $0.10 per share. Non-GAAP earnings per share for the same quarter last year benefited from a settlement of a tax examination, which contributed $0.15 per share.","So starting with HIV. Total HIV sales for the second quarter were $4 billion. In the U.S. HIV product sales for the second quarter were $3.2 billion, up 13% year-over-year, and up 14% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by robust underlying prescription demand growth up 13%. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter in which HIV sales have posted double-digit year-over-year growth.","And the first quarter in which Biktarvy surpassed the $1 billion mark, becoming the number one prescribed regimen for all patients. More than 40% of new patients started on Biktarvy. It is by the growing momentum of Biktarvy, Descovy-based regimens accounted for 83% of our prescription volume for HIV treatment. Sequentially, the increase was primarily driven by the continued uptake of Biktarvy and PrEP and the full quarter impact of price increases taken in March of this year.","In Europe, HIV product sales for the second quarter were $623 million, and benefited approximately $70 million from the adjustment for statutory revenue clawback reserves related to sales meeting in prior years. Excluding the adjustment our HIV product sales in Europe would have slightly declined sequentially. The year-over-year decline was predictable driven by the broad availability of generic versions of Truvada. We continue to see, however, the impact from generics moderating as the uptake of Descovy-based products progresses.","Biktarvy is now available across the EU5 with launches occurring in Italy in June, and in the U.K. in July. Already in France, Germany and Spain Biktarvy is the number one regimen for na\u00efve and switch patients. With access increasing for Biktarvy, we're optimistic that the declines in our European HIV business will continue to moderate and that our Descovy-based franchise will continue to grow.","Turning to HCV total HCV sales for the second quarter were $842 million. U.S. product sales for the second quarter were $355 million, down 35% year-over-year, and down 10% sequentially. The year-over-year U.S. decline was in line with our expectation and primarily due to competitive dynamics and lower patient starts. Sequentially, the decrease was primarily due to the Q1 purchasing activity by a state Department of Corrections. As a reminder, we mentioned on our prior call that Q1 U.S. HCV sales were positively impacted by the timing of the state Department of Corrections order.","We're very encouraged by the performance of the Asegua authorized generics, which accounted for more than 25% of our U.S. HCV revenues and continue to improve our HCV competitive positioning. In Europe, HCV product sales for the second quarter were $277 million and benefited approximately $80 million from the adjustment for statutory revenue claw back reserves related to sales made in prior years. Without the adjustment HCV, product sales would have declined 15% year-over-year and 1% sequentially.","Turning to cell therapy. Worldwide Yescarta sales for the second quarter were $120 million, up 76% year-over-year and 25% sequentially. We were pleased with the steady adoption of Yescarta. Our efforts in the U.S. remain focused on educating providers on the profile of Yescarta and identification of appropriate patients.","Additionally, as the centers for Medicare and Medicaid services looks to finalize the annual Medicare IPPS rule for fiscal year 2020, we continue to engage with agency officials and other stakeholders with the goal of improving Medicare reimbursement and access for patients over 65 years of age. This remains an area of focus to ensure continued uptake of Yescarta.","In Europe, Yescarta has launched in Germany, the U.K., France and Spain among the larger countries. Overall, we have been very impressed with the speed at which countries have provided reimbursement and the pace at which centers are being certified. Finally, I would like to comment on our cardiovascular products.","As expected, we saw generic versions of Letairis introduced during the quarter. Letairis and Ranexa sales totaled $223 million for the second quarter, down 51% year-over-year and down 37% sequentially as a result of competition from generics. Letairis sales were sequentially higher in the second quarter primarily due to a favorable inventory dynamics compared to a drawdown in Q1. But underlying prescriptions demand is eroding and we anticipate going forward, sales will decline as we absorb the full quarter impact of generics.","Now turning to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $916 million for the second quarter, down slightly compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the 2018 impact of our purchase of a priority review voucher largely offset by higher investments to support our cell therapy program.","Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $1 billion for the second quarter, up 21% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to higher promotional expenses in the U.S. and expenses associated with the expansion of Gilead's business in Japan and China. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the second quarter was 21.5% compared to 13.4 % in the same period last year, which was impacted by a one-time favorable settlement of a tax examination.","Moving to the balance sheet. During the second quarter, we generated $2.2 billion in cash from operations and ended the quarter with $30.2 billion in cash and investments. We repaid $500 million of senior unsecured notes, paid cash dividends of $800 million and repurchased 9 million shares of stock for $588 million.","Moving to our guidance, we are raising our full year net product sales guidance based on favorable demand trends in the first half across our portfolio and the one-time adjustment for Europe statutory revenue claw back reserves. Net product sales are expected to be in the range of $21.6 billion to $22.1 billion. We are also updating our full year diluted EPS impact of GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments, which are expected to be in the range of $3.90 to $4 a share as a result of the collaboration agreement with Galapagos. All other components of our guidance remained unchanged.","With regard to full year SG&A guidance, we are leaving that unchanged as we prepare for future lunches of filgotinib for rheumatoid arthritis. Our guidance is subject to a number of uncertainties, which are outlined in slides 23 to 24 in our earnings call presentation.","So I want to thank everyone very much for joining today's call. Let's now open up the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Today\u2019s question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Matthew Harrison","Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask one related to the HIV pipeline. I noticed that you've got a breakthrough designation on the capsid inhibitor, and I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the path to registration and how breakthrough enables you to potentially move that product ahead? And if you could just also comment on what you see as the patient opportunity for that product as well?","Daniel O\u2019Day","Great, Matthew. So, we had Diana here and she will be more than happy to address that.","Diana Brainard","Yeah. Thanks. Hi, this is Diana Brainard. We're very excited that the FDA recognized the importance of the capsid inhibitor GS-6207 by providing it with breakthrough designation for heavily treatment experienced patients with multidrug resistance.","This is a small segment of the HIV population, but represents a really high unmet medical need. These individuals have limited treatment options due to the resistance they have, and this highlights one of the important components of our capsid inhibitor, which is to say because it is first-in-class, there's no pre-existing resistance to this class and it makes it really a unique compound in that regard and that's part of the value it brings. Of course the other piece is that it's long-acting. And so we see it as having value across a broad range of patient populations.","In terms of the past two registration, what breakthrough designation does is allows us to communicate more frequently and have more dialogue with FDA. And in fact we have plans to do that in the coming weeks where we'll get more clarity on exactly how we can best move our capsid inhibitor forward in this population as quickly as possible.","Sung Lee","Great. Thank You. Could we have the next?","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Brian Abrahams","Hi. Thanks very much for taking my question. Maybe another question on the capsid inhibitor. How important will it be to pair that with additional antiretroviral agents? Can you talk about where you are with respect to development of long-acting forms of internal assets that could potentially pair with 6207?","And along those lines, what's your sense at this point kind of mapping the Phase 1 PK data with the Phase 2 of viral decline data as to how often, how frequently you think patients will need to be dosed in order to maintain adequate exposures and still have a small injection volume for that drug? Thanks so much.","Robin Washington","Sure. Well, so I think when we talk about developing long-acting regimens, we're envisioning the capsid will need to be partnered with the second agent. And to that end we've got a number of different internal candidates to become partners with capsid and we hope to be rolling that data out and those plans out over the next coming months.","In terms of the frequency of injection. One of the things about capsid that's so exciting is that it\u2019s got picomolar potency, which really makes it in order of magnitude more potent than any other approved antiretroviral and allows us to give the amount of drug needed for very long-term injections.","And so really the frequency of drug injection is going to be dictated in large part by the partner and also by the formulation and we're still gaining clarity on what the initial regimens will look like, but there's a huge potential here for very infrequent dosing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Yee with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Michael Yee","Hey thanks for the question. Congrats on a good quarter. I wanted to talk a bit more high level about R&D. Obviously, John McHutchison not sure if you're in the room but it's been good to spend the years together particularly in the HCV days, but maybe just to comment either from John, but obviously Dan going forward, where the shape of R&D goes from here? What you would like to try to do in the next say 12, 24 months? How oncology plays with that?","And then the second part of the question is, since you've done this Galapagos deal, it would seem that that's a big part of early stage discovery, how much of your R&D is early stage discovery? And does that help offset some of that again, sort of, it led to the first question. Thanks.","Daniel O\u2019Day","Yeah. Thanks Michael. Can I just get some clarity on your second question, sorry, around Galapagos. I want to make sure I understand what your question was there?","Michael Yee","Yeah. I guess, if you can quantify or describe how much of your R&D budget I think it's $3.5 billion, $4 billion is early stage discovery, it would seem that Galapagos is going to be either additive to that as resources? Or that that could actually allocate some of your R&D early stage to have them and do some of that and supplement that?","Daniel O\u2019Day","Okay, thanks. So Michael first of all, thanks a lot, we will certainly pass your good wishes on to John McHutchison. He's got his team here but he's not in the room today, but John has really made tremendous contributions to Gilead and we wish him nothing but the best as he seeks his next challenge.","But let me just comment first on your first question about the shape of R&D next 12 months to 24 months. Well, again I think a lot has happened in the past quarter just to emphasize -- where we stood when we spoke just a few months ago. Certainly, we've had progress on the HIV front, which we just spoke about in the first two questions with Diana. But we've also gotten much greater clarity around the path forward for Filgotinib. And with that path forward with Filgotinib in rheumatoid arthritis, I remind you we have a very broad and extensive program around Filgotinib and other diseases that's including IBB. And so -- we really have had a good quarter for our internal portfolio.","Now moving forward, I mean, obviously our emphasis is on growth it's on long-term growth. It's on our ability to shape that R&D portfolio into an area where we have a good number of innovative medicines balanced across our stages of development. As we spoke about last time, one of the areas that we really need to continue to strengthen is our late-stage portfolio as well.","And I do think that the collaboration with Galapagos and some of the acceleration of molecules that we have within Gilead will help us to strengthen that late-stage portfolio. I remind you with Galapagos they have two products that are in later stage; one for IPF and one for osteoarthritis in addition to the broad program around Filgotinib.","But moving forward and more on this Michael later in the year, obviously information with the lead with Filgotinib, the work we have on HIV, long-acting treatments for highly experienced patients in care programs, oncology is a clear focus. And it certainly is within the cell therapy realm where we've had really some transformational effects on a subset of B-cell lymphomas.","And -- our strategy there is to bring it to earlier alliance of therapy with B-cell lymphoma to other hematologic malignancies to potentially solid tumors and to allogeneic. And then we're bridging that across to a broader oncology portfolio that will continue to advise you on within Gilead and partners that include small molecules and biospecific antibodies that will be focused on really providing significant benefits for patients with high unmet medical needs in oncology.","And then finally, of course, liver diseases. We continue to work in the liver area and Hepatitis B. We have important data readouts on NASH later this year. So, I think, when we sit here in the next couple of quarters a lot of these things are also going to come to more fruition. We'll get a chance to look at what we have in our hands today in terms of late stage -- in terms of our portfolio.","And we'll continue to supplement that with innovation from the outside, innovation network like Galapagos. Secondarily, on Galapagos in particular, I think, it's probably the best way to put it into context and I said this on the call previously with Galapagos, it's with the collaboration with Galapagos we essentially double our research capacity. And what does that mean? I mean, we've got roughly the same number of scientific colleagues across the two organizations.","In fact Galapagos will be increasing their number to get a little closer to what we have at Gilead, but it provides with two sources of early-stage discovery input into our late-stage portfolio. And I think that's very exciting because if we can get two highly productive research engines speeding the late-stage portfolio that speaks well for kind of the future of our portfolio as we move forward.","We haven't really completely disclosed exactly the spending patterns in each of those areas. I'll suffice it to say that those investments will be driven by the science the decisions on the portfolio will be driven on making sure we keep the bar high for patients and we'll continue to look at other ways to expand that innovation network with early-stage collaborations and deals and when possible late-stage collaborations and deals. Hopefully, Michael that gives you a little color to so far what I can articulate in the past five months.","Michael Yee","I appreciate and look forward to the rest of the year on that. Thanks.","Daniel O'Day","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Porges with Leerink. Your line is now open.","Geoff Porges","Thank you very much and appreciate the question. Dan, there's been a lot of pretty interesting moves in the industry of sort of a macro level companies changing portfolio shifting assets around. And I realized your focus is primarily been on R&D, but is there anything that you believe you could potentially consider moving out of the company's portfolio?","Or do you have any appetite to bring in any macro and products that might be available for any other company's portfolios? And just related to that could you comment on how much of an issue FTC considerations are as you look at outside products given what we've seen so far this year?","Daniel O'Day","Geoff, yes, I mean I guess just taking a step back about how we look at our approach to M&A overall and our partnerships. Again, I would say that you're right there's a lot of moves in the field. I think what's characterized Gilead is the ability to really focus on the science in a way that's been pretty transformational with HCV and HIV. And I've commented before on my observation on the quality of the science and the scientists that are here at Gilead and I would only emphasize again after five months. And that's important not only for the science we do within the company, it's also important for how we can evaluate external scientific opportunities.","I can say that as we partner with Galapagos, the respect and admiration from a scientific perspective between Gilead and Galapagos was very high and that's what led me with confidence to move forward with the team in striking that deal.","So, we will be driven by science for sure. We'll focus on the areas of expertise that we have today. I mean that's HIV, oncology, liver disease, inflammation, and the intersections between those two.","To your point, I mean I don't think we'll have a one-size-fits-all strategy for bringing innovation into the company. I think that the Galapagos structure was the right structure for that collaboration. It allowed independence, it allowed us to secure our investment, it allowed us rights to everything that comes out of that investment, and therefore, that collaboration was fit for purpose for that particular transaction.","But it doesn't mean that we won't look at different ways of transacting when we look at other opportunities out there. Some will be more straightforward, particularly, if they come right into our value chain and our distribution chain for our late-stage aspect.","On the FTC standpoint, I don't really have a lot of comments there. I think we haven't had any issues right now with FTC and the type of transactions we're going after. So, I don't have a whole lot of personal insight into that question as well. So, hopefully, that gives you some indication of how we'll continue.","Geoff Porges","Thanks very much.","Daniel O'Day","Thanks. Geoff.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alethia Young with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.","Alethia Young","Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the very solid quarter. I just want to talk about trends in Europe. I'm slightly intrigued by the fact that you guys tend to like -- or able to mitigate kind of the generic pressures seeing from the Biktarvy offset and I just want to get a little bit more color on why you think that's the case? I mean we all know Europe is fairly cost-conscious. And I understand that there's differentiate profile. But what had really been the driver there that allows you to have growth in Europe your TAF franchise there? Thanks.","Robin Washington","So, Alethia I'll take that one. I mean I think it really has been the underlying opportunity that we have with Descovy. We have seen with the Descovy now launch of Biktarvy -- sorry. Biktarvy we've just seen really a moderating of that deceleration. So, it really speaks to the innovation of the product and the drive and we've seen really solid adoption.","Operator","Our next question comes\u2026","Daniel O'Day","Thanks. Yes, let's go to the next one. Thanks, Alethia.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Carter Gould with UBS. Your line is now open.","Carter Gould","Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe one for I guess Dan or Johanna, can you maybe just to elaborate a bit further on how should we think about PrEP providing another leg of growth for the HIV franchise, particularly, given some of your moves in the quarter, you've improved access in the U.S.? And I guess when you think about Europe some of the historical challenges there? And then I guess a follow-up there just any insight you could provide on what you expect the focus of the AdCom to be for Descovy there? Thank you.","Daniel O'Day","That's great. So, we'll have Johanna pick up on the first aspect to your question Carter and then Diana can talk about the AdCom.","Johanna Mercier","Yes. So, thanks for the question Carter. So, basically in PrEP what you'll see today if you think about our Truvada business, the growth is very solid, it's about a 27% growth year-on-year. But having said that, there's only about 200,000 individuals that are actually on Truvada and that represents that 20% to 25% of the total potential of individuals that could benefit from prevention treatment and that's where Descovy comes in.","And I do think Descovy, as we talked about earlier on this call, real opportunity in light of the fact that it just has such benefit in the prevention setting for a broad patient population -- a broad population of individuals namely because of its superior safety both on bone and renal as well as the fact that there's rapid onset and longer sustained duration of HIV protection in Truvada. So, those things will definitely play an important role as we think about our launch for Descovy moving forward in the second half of this year.","On the flip side, you talked about a little bit about Europe. Obviously, Truvada PrEP in Europe is not available in light of the fact that it was genericized, but we will be looking at filing for PrEP in the first half of next year. And maybe Diana for the?","Diana Brainard","Sure. Yes. So, with respect to the AdCom the FDA has the liberty to convene an advisory committee for a number of different reasons. And in this case for Descovy for PrEP, I think it's probably part of a larger effort to increase awareness and signal the commitments of the government to HIV PrEP efforts.","And this is a forum where experts can come together and provide a discourse on the benefits of PrEP and also the trial results of DISCOVER. And as you know we are seeking a broad indication for Descovy for PrEP and our study was conducted in men and transgender women who have sex with men. And so this will certainly be a topic for discussion as well as the study results themselves and so that's what we're prepared for.","Carter Gould","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Umer Raffat","Hi. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I wanted to focus on two pipeline programs, if I may. First on filgotinib, so based on everything disclosed so far in the pool data, there is no DVT imbalance, and that's very important. But my question was, what about all thrombotic events? So, for example, the retinal vein occlusion in France too was technically not a DVT. So, what about all thrombotic? Is that still no imbalance at all? That's point number one.","And the second one was on the Galapagos IPF program, we know the Phase II trial there ran -- had a meaningful baseline imbalance on FVC median. And my question is have you analyzed the FVC data on similar sets of FVCs on the placebo arm versus the active arm? Thank you very much.","Daniel O'Day","Thank you, Umer. So, we're going to get John involved here. John, Sundy so, thanks John.","John McHutchison","Sure. So, first of all to start off with filgotinib, getting to the issue of -- issues across all thrombotic events, we are still very pleased with the results across all those events, and don't really see anything that would change our perspective on that compared to the specific data that we've presented already.","Moving on to the Galapagos compound, as you might imagine, we looked very carefully at all of the available data in the IPF program. We have quite a bit of experience in IPF ourselves with prior programs at Gilead as well. And we saw that the data really provided the confidence to Galapagos to be able to move ahead and we share that confidence with them.","Umer Raffat","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mohit Bansal with Citi. Your line is now open.","Mohit Bansal","Great. Thanks for taking my question. So quick question on capsid inhibitor, do you think a longer acting agent such as capsid inhibitor could expand to that market, just to say that it is 20%. And then when can we learn more about your plan for capsid in PrEP? Thank you.","Daniel O'Day","Yeah. Before I turn it over to Diana, we'll hear -- I think it's a good question. By the way, we fully intend prior to the capsid to get beyond 20% of the PrEP market with both Truvada and Descovy. I mean and you're seeing the increase of course quarter-on-quarter there, but also our wraparound programs with the community and really taking this more global. So there's lots of opportunity with the current programs. Having said that, Diana, if you want to address maybe the capsid for PrEP concept?","Diana Brainard","Sure, thing. And I didn't catch the second part of the question, but I'll answer the first part. So Johanna mentioned this large gap between the number of people in the U.S., who are eligible for PrEP and the number of people who are on PrEP. And of course we're trying to close that gap. But the part of that strategy is going to be having additional options beyond daily PrEP and the capsid inhibitor could be one approach to that. It's got a long-acting potential. We're looking at preclinical models to assess its efficacy in the PrEP setting, and we're very excited about its potential as our physicians and the community about having this as an option. So we're looking forward to generating the data but that will allow us to get into the clinic with that.","Mohit Bansal","Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.","Daniel O'Day","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Cory Kasimov","Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. So, I guess for Dan, I'm curious how should investors be thinking about building out your management team versus building out the company's capabilities via external BD? In other words, there are clearly some important positions to fill such as a permanent CFO or permanent CSO, et cetera. So how much are there search for assets and technologies and the search for personnel correlated or mutually exclusive? Obviously I recognize what you recently able to do with Galapagos, but there were some established relationship that was already there. Thanks.","Daniel O'Day","Thanks. I really appreciate the opportunity to answer that. I think they can both very much happen in parallel. I mean I can just articulate that the Galapagos collaboration, for instance. I mean it involved teams of people within our organization that are absolutely dedicated to both the discovery platform aspect of it as well as the clinical programs. And so, I don't see any slowdown at all in our ability to proceed to have a corporate development during this period when we're still recruiting key individual.","First of all Robin is here and very active, so we don't like a CFO by any means, and we'll certainly have a good transition of a CFO before Robin leaves. And Robin's appetite to continue to grow the portfolio is good. Isn't it, Robin?","Robin Washington","Very high.","Daniel O'Day","Okay. So that -- we don't settle anything there. We have a very, very effective Corporate Development team in the organization that Andy filled up over the past couple of years, but the most important thing about the effect in this Corporate Development team is that they're interconnected with all the different respective experts within the organization. So, Diana's team and John's team, and the other principal TIA heads, and then Billy's team and the entire research organization. So, that machine is still operating at full steam and full effect in this, so I just want you to know that.","In the interim, of course, we are then proceeding ahead with Robin's replacement and with John's replacement. And we look forward to bringing some additional new colleagues into the organization that will also be focused on science and growth and driving the future of Gilead's mission, like we did with Johanna and with Christi so far. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.","Phil Nadeau","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. My question's specifically on the recent proposed changes to Medicare and specifically Part D. I'm wondering, if you'd be willing to disclose what proportion of your U.S. revenue in Q2 came from Part D? And whether given, it's done any preliminary analysis of those changes and their potential impact on your revenue? It seems like based on the pricing of your medicines, you're right around the breakpoint between helping and hurting your revenues. So I'm curious if you've done any fine analysis to figure what the impact would be?","Robin Washington","You want to start?","Daniel O'Day","Yes. Let me start, Phil. Let me give you a little context and then I'll turn it over to Robin on some details. So, first of all, I mean, I think, it's important to note that there's a lot of things that have been happening in Washington recently and a lot of things that are still need to be provided clarity with.","What I would say is a couple of things over this past quarter have been very encouraging. First of all, the work that we've done with the administration on ending the HIV epidemic, our drug donation and ability to get to many, many more patients with HIV, really shows the support we have around increasing those number of individuals that are eligible for PrEP.","The other thing is the Part D protected class rule was a really important patient choice legislation that was upheld and that's -- we think that's good for patients. We also think that supports our portfolio as well. And then, the other thing that I think is a really ongoing dialogue is the consensus that we have now in such a margin around the need for new solutions and different approaches for CAR T therapies. So I just point to those three things as things that I think have been really encouraging for our portfolio that happened in the past quarter.","Now at the same time we completely accept and understand that there's going to continue to be pressure on drug pricing. I remind you that the vast majority of our business is driven by volume. We're actively involved, of course, in the Part D discussions and where that may go. We believe in initiatives that supports cap to patient out-of-pocket expenses that help patients at the end of the day and Part D reform and that's where we and others in the industry are rolling our sleeves up on, to be active participants in Part D reform. Specifically relative to our exposure to Part D, I don't know, I'm going to turn it over to Robin\u2026","Robin Washington","Yes.","Daniel O'Day","\u2026.and see if she has any other thing she wants to add there.","Robin Washington","No, Dan. I think, you've covered a lot of areas. I will only add so that we don't typically disclose the various specific payer mix, I will tell you that, overall, it's a low double-digit percentage. If you think about Gilead, particularly our HIV, I mean, overall we have a high proportion of public pay rate and we've always come up with innovative programs, as Dan was describing, some that support full access to those patients. So I think that is something that we'll continue to do as we work with Washington.","Daniel O'Day","Thank you, Phil.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Salim Syed with Mizuho. Your line is now open.","Salim Syed","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Dan I just wanted to talk about hepatitis B, as in boy, for a second. So the beginning of the year before you joined, I believe, some of your colleagues mentioned that Gilead plans to be a leader in hepatitis B. I was wondering if you still maintain that view. How you prioritize it within the company, versus perhaps oncology or inflammation areas? And if there's any science that you feel like you don't have that\u2019s of interest to you. Thank you.","Daniel O'Day","Thanks. I'm still digging into that a bit, Salim, but it's clear that we have tremendous expertise in our organization and colleagues that are focused on liver disease and, in particular, hepatitis B. It's also clear that our current product Vemlidy is a significant benefit for patients with hepatitis B and underutilized. So one of the things we're working with Johanna and others on in the organization is, how do we make the current standard of care more available to patients at need and at risk around the world. And that's something you may hear more from us on in the coming quarters.","But relative to your question about the next level of advances in hepatitis B and I also had the experienced to talk to some key thought leaders around us as well. There's no doubt that it's a challenging scientific area to think about coming up with a hep B cure. And yet, I still think there's some very promising scientific avenues. As you can imagine - I won't comment necessarily on specific technologies that we either have in-house or that we think we may need to partner and to collaborate with.","But I wouldn't give you confidence that we know the landscape extraordinarily well, we know the science extraordinarily well. And like many viral diseases, we may need to think about combination approaches in this area to get to longer duration and sustained responses. But because of the sensitivity of some of those programs, I'm not going to get into more detail.","But suffice it to say that I think, as a company with our type of expertise, that we do need to be on the cutting edge of hep B and we need to be thoughtful about how we approach it and what level of investment we put into it. But there's no doubt that as long as our scientists think there's an avenue forward we should be -- we should have some concentration in that area.","Salim Syed","Great. Thanks so much.","Daniel O'Day","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Hartaj Singh with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Hartaj Singh","Hi, thank you. Thanks for the question. I just had a question on Yescarta. You reported now a good quarter, I think two in a row. I think you had indicated earlier in the year this year that you had over 1,500 patients on the therapy, which had accelerated from the end of 2018. Could you just give some more color on the dynamics of the patient in the Yescarta and how you're feeling for the rest of the year? Plus also how over the next couple of years, you would start to roll out into your line of therapy as that clinical data retail? Thank you.","Daniel O'Day","Thanks a lot Hartaj. So let me start and then maybe other colleagues want to add a little bit here. So let me just restate my belief that I said on previous quarters that as Gilead think strategically about how to approach and entry into oncology, I think the concept of approaching it with a pioneering technology is a very sensible path forward. In other words, instead of jumping into where everybody else is right now, really moving to where the treatment paradigm could go, I think makes sense.","Now with the pioneering technology comes all with the rewards and risks associated with being on the cutting edge of science. But I would say that I'm very impressed by the data that's been generated so far from the KITE team and the sustained level of responses we're getting and we'll continue to update you on those responses. I know again later this year as well on the duration of those responses, but we're seeing a very consistent response in that subset of DLBCL patients.","So in addition to the scientific strength of this and the broader R&D program that I mentioned before about moving into earlier lines of therapy, other hematologic diseases, solid tumors and allogeneic, I would say that there are clearly some near-term factors that can affect the trajectory of Yescarta. We're carefully monitoring those something I've been personally involved in is some of the discussions around the reimbursement changes.","Robin mentioned in her prepared remarks around the Medicare reimbursements and then we're also investigating further patient flow dynamics. So I think there's no doubt that in the near term with the pioneering technology where hospitals are getting used to how to get reimbursed, CMS is trying to come up with new programs as you've seen published about how to encourage adoption for Medicare patients. There could be some variability if you like on the quarter-to-quarter sales for Yescarta.","But having said that, when I just take a step back and think about the mid- to long-term trajectory of Yescarta and the duration of response in patients, I continue to be very encouraged. And as the quarters go on, we'll be able to of course provide data for you on the continued profile of Yescarta, just as we did at ASCO of course where we talked about some of the ways to ameliorate some of the initial responses into -- encourage Yescarta and even more patients from an early standpoint. So that's what I would say so far about Yescarta. I don't know Robin would you like to add anything on that?","Robin Washington","No. I think you covered all the areas Dan. And as I've said on the call, we also have Europe now. We're very encouraged relative to the receptivity reimbursement and innovative therapies that we're doing very well with our launch there in addition to all the factors that you mentioned in the U.S.","Daniel O'Day","And just maybe one last point on that. So we expect the new Medicare reimbursement role to go into effect in October of this year. So that's obviously going to be a key pivot point for how we see uptake in using Medicare patients. And we know that the use of Yescarta in Medicare patients also has an influence in centers on how they treat their non-Medicare patients. So lots to continue to innovate here, not just on the science, but also on the reimbursement and access programs, so we're fully committed to that.","Hartaj Singh","Thank you.","Daniel O'Day","Thanks.","Operator","And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Sung Lee for closing remarks.","Sung Lee","Thank you, Liz. And thank you everyone for joining us.

My name is Candice and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode and as a reminder this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Patrick O\u2019Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Patrick O\u2019Brien","Thank you, Candice and good afternoon everyone. Just after market closed today we issued a press release with the details of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2015. The press release and detailed slides are available on the Investor Relations section of the Gilead Sciences\u2019 Web site.","The speakers on today\u2019s call will be John Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Paul Carter, our Executive Vice President of Commercial Operations and Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Also in the room with us for Q&A session are; John Milligan, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Norbert Bischofberger, Executive Vice President of Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer.","Before we begin our formal remarks, let me remind you that we'll be making forward-looking statements, including plans and expectations with respect to our product candidates and financial projections, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in our latest SEC disclosure documents and the recent press releases.","In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. We will also be using non-GAAP financial measures to help you understand our underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in our press release as well as on our Web site.","I would now turn the call over to John Martin.","John Martin","Thank you Patrick and thanks everyone for joining us today. Paul and Robin will elaborate on our commercial and financial results in just a moment. I would like to first comment on our HIV and HCV development programs.","Our newest antiretroviral agent TAF which is under review as part of multiple products for the treatment of HIV has a superior safety profile compared to TDF. This is important because most newly diagnosed patients would now be treated for decades and at the same time many HIV infected individuals who are in treatment particularly in the U.S. and Europe are advancing NIH. It has also become clear that upon diagnosis HIV patients should immediately begin treatment; this point was driven home by the presentation of the NIH-sponsored start study results last week at the International AIDS Society Conference called IAS in Vancouver, and the concurrent publication of results in the New England Journal of Medicine. The start trial was a two arm randomized study in which patients with CD4 count counts of greater than 500 were randomized to immediate treatment versus deferred treatment until their CD4 count had declined to 350.","The study was stopped after it was apparent that there was a clear net benefit in the immediate treatment. For patients facing decades of therapy it's a profile of task suggest that it will be view favorably as a new treatment option. We now have three TAF containing products under review. Two single tablet regimens and a TAF and emtricitabine co-formulated tablet. Important data from Gilead study 109 were presented last week at IAS. Study 109 is an open label clinical trial with more than 1,400 biologically suppressed patients. Who are randomized to switch from a TDF containing regimen to E\/C\/F\/TAF or to remaining on their TDF containing therapies. The study made its primary endpoint and shows statistical superiority of E\/C\/F\/TAF in terms of proportion of patients with HIV R&A less than 50 copies per meal at week 48.","The study also demonstrated statistically significant improvement in bone and renal laboratory parameters. E\/C\/F\/TAF is poised to be the first half based regimen on the market with an FDA PDUFA date of November 5, and regulatory decision expected in Europe before year-end. Our second TAF single tablet regimen or F\/TAF was submitted for FDA review earlier this month. We're using our Priority Review Voucher which shortens review by four months and means that expected FDA action date in March of 2016. Submission of a regulatory file application for R\/F\/TAF EU is planned for the third quarter.","In the developing world more than 30 million people are living with HIV and nearly 8 million now receive TDF based treatment regimens. The switch data presented at IAS and overall safety profile of TAF make it an important option for these patients and Gilead has already licensed the technology to our generic manufacturing partners with the goal of expediting access as soon as initial regulatory approvals are received.","Turning briefly to HCV since the approval of Sovaldi in December 2013 approximately 470,000 patients globally have initiated treatment with Sovaldi or Harvoni. The rapid uptake and utilization of these medicines is a testament to the fact that the real world safety and efficacy parallels the results obtained in our controlled clinical studies. Three supplemental new drug applications for Harvoni were submitted to FDA last quarter, each of which has been granted priority review.","If approved these applications will expand the indicated use for Harvoni to include HCV, HIV co-infected patients, patients with genotypes 4, 5, or 6 and treatment experiencing cirrhotic patients. A decision from FDA for each of these three sNDA is expected by November 15. In closing I would like to thank Gilead's dedicated employees for their tireless efforts and collaboration with our partners to develop new therapies and deliver them to people around the world.","I will now turn the call over to Paul.","Paul Carter","Thanks, John. I am pleased to provide an update on our commercial business which in the second quarter generated $8.1 billion in worldwide net product sales. U.S. revenue was $5.6 billion at 7% sequential increase and a 16% increase compared to the second quarter of last year. European revenue was $2 billion during the second quarter, up 8% sequentially and more than 50% on a year-over-year basis despite the foreign exchange headwinds.","Beginning with hepatitis C, as John mentioned earlier, we're very pleased with the number of patients we're reaching with Sovaldi and Harvoni which have now approved in 51 and 40 countries respectively. Total HCV revenue for the second quarter was $4.9 billion. In the U.S. HCV product revenue totaled $3.4 billion with Harvoni representing 2.8 billion of that amount. In the first half of 2015, an estimated 130,000 U.S. hepatitis C patients started treatment on a Gilead product almost matching the number of treated patients to all of 2014. While this demonstrates that improvements in assets have been made there were still many new prescriptions been written then been filled.","Following the nearly 70,000 patients in quarter one more than 60,000 additional patients started therapy on a Gilead hepatitis C product during the second quarter, this represents the Gilead market share over 90% of all HCV patients with Harvoni alone representing approximately 85% of all patients captured in the standard third-party tracking data. We have also maintained our very strong position with U.S. payers as reflected by our formulary status across all payer segments, 83% of genotype 1 patients have direct access to Harvoni, a percentage that has remained stable since the first quarter.","In Europe hepatitis C revenue was more than $1.1 billion this quarter with over 30,000 estimated new patients start. We saw particularly high patients' initiations in Spain, Italy and Portugal in the second quarter. As one example of this Sovaldi uptake in Spain was driven by unprecedented regional access and a significant increase over historic hepatitis C treatment rate. Additionally Harvoni was launched in April and has surpassed the success of Sovaldi with more than 6,000 Spanish patients got in treatment in the second quarter.","We have seen a continued broadening of access and reimbursement across multiple European markets. Harvoni is now reimbursed in four of the five big EU countries and in France we completed pricing negotiations for Harvoni in June opening access to all five all patients with the fibrosis score of F2 and to all HIV co-infected patients. This is a broader group of patients in those previously treated under the French ATU or early access program.","Looking ahead we are confident in the opportunities to reach more patients in Europe including in the UK where Sovaldi reimbursement is expected to come on online more broadly later the summer and Harvoni will follow after that. In both the U.S. and Europe we're starting to see average treatment durations shortening. For example fewer patients have been treated for 24 weeks and in the United States approximately 40% of Harvoni used in quarter two was for eight weeks. This is an encouraging trend as it suggests the payers should be seeing the value of earlier treatment for appropriate genotype 1 patients. And we believe this makes us strong case for payers to further ease restriction on patients access.","In the U.S. we saw an unusually large number of patients starts in the first quarter, reflecting warehousing of patients in anticipation of access to Harvoni. In the second quarter we saw the number of total descriptions declined from a peak in the month of March reflecting a smaller pool of patients who were in need of immediate treatment. We\u2019re thinking about hepatitis C patient numbers going forward, this market is still in its early days with many patients identified and waiting to be treated. As I mentioned earlier many prescriptions go unfilled due to denials in the prior authorization process. Going forward we believe more payers will lower restrictions allowing patients with lower fibrosis scores to access treatment.","The increasing amount of real world data that should reinforce the confident that are highly differentiated product provide high cure rate that are in line with our clinical trial. Additionally we and others are increasingly active in generating awareness of hepatitis C and communicating the benefits of hepatitis C testing and early treatment. We believe our efforts of bringing a new patients to care and we'll do so in the future. So while the number of new patients starting on treatment will continue to be influenced by the retractions applied by the payers we see encouraging trends and remain highly confident both for the remainder of this year and for the long-term sustainability of the hepatitis C market in the United States.","In Europe the dynamics of our hepatitis C business are defined by each country and their respective launch timings. Like in the U.S. at launch we've seen unusually high numbers of patients being treated as there has been some warehousing and especially so for Harvoni GT-1 patient. We also see a changing mix at the high volume Southern European countries like Spain, Italy and Portugal start to treat patients.","Our pricing arrangements took into consideration macroeconomic circumstances hepatitis C prevalence and countries intend to increase treatment rates from past level. As a result we\u2019re likely to see a changing mix in patient volumes as well as average selling prices over time. We've recognized that there remains a huge unmet medical in Europe and there is just a small fraction of diagnosed patients have so far been treated. As in the U.S. our European teams are working hard to encourage diagnosis and increasing levels of treatments in the years ahead.","Turning to Japan. We\u2019re pleased with the initial introduction of Sovaldi for genotype 2 patients, I'm excited about the prospects that Harvoni in genotype 1. With the approval in July we expect reimbursement for Harvoni to be in place in Japan later this summer. There is consensus within the medical community that Gilead Medications offer patients the simple and effective cure for hepatitis C. This is evidenced in treatment guidelines around the world and from the real world data that have been continue to be generated and presented and published in peer review forums. We\u2019ll continue to work to bring these treatments to more patients as quickly as possible.","And now turning to HIV. This quarter HIV revenues increased 8% year-over-year to $2.7 billion as our sofosbuvir based regimens continue to hold their market leadership position. In the United States revenues were $1.8 billion for the second quarter, showing sequential growth of 21% mostly driven by the price increase on April 01 and favorable sub-wholesaler inventory levels following the draw down in the first quarter as well as increased demand.","In the second quarter we saw the big three wholesaler inventory levels remain at the bottom of established ranges. Underlying prescription demand remained strong, for Stribild and Complera driving the year-on-year revenue growth of 58% and 35% respectively. Gilead's HIV medications continue to be prescribed for approximately 8 out of 10 treatment naive patients initiating therapy. Six of 10 patients initiated treatment with the Gilead single-tablet regimen and our newest single-tablet regiment Stribild and Complera collectively captured five out of ten new patients.","In Europe HIV revenue was $742 million for the second quarter. Despite strong competition volume has grown in line with overall market growth. Overall sequential revenue growth declined due to the impact of negative foreign currency movement net of our hedging activity. Eviplera and Stribild remained the most prescribed regimens to na\u00efve patients in the EU big five and half of new patients started on Truvada based single-tablet regimen. Eviplera and Stribild also remained the most prescribed regimens for switch patients.","Looking to the future of HIV John already gave the detailed accounts of where we stand on the regulatory front and bringing our TAF based treatments to market. And I can say that the Gilead commercial organization is focusing on insuring a successful launch around the world. We\u2019re excited to introduce the TAF portfolio products to our customers and to all the patients who can benefit from them.","In closing we\u2019re very pleased with the commercial results for the second quarter. And now I'll turn the call over to Robin.","Robin Washington","Thanks Paul and good afternoon everyone. We\u2019re pleased to report solid second quarter results with non-GAAP diluted EPS of $3.15 for the second quarter, up 33% year-over-year. Total revenues were 8.2 billion up 26% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. Despite currency headwinds net product sales for the quarter were 8.1 billion up 27% year-over-year, driven by the launch of Harvoni across various geographies continued growth of Sovalid outside the U.S. and increased sales of our newer HIV single-tablet regimen.","Non-GAAP product gross margin was 90% for the second quarter of 2015 compared to 89% for the second quarter of 2014, benefitting from changes in product mix, including a year-over-year decline in Atripla sales which had a lower margin. Turning to expenses, non-GAAP R&D expenses were $702 million for the second quarter, up 30% compared to the prior year due to the continued progression and expansion of our clinical studies, particularly Phase 3 studies in the liver disease and oncology areas.","Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $761 million for the second quarter, up 34% compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in our portion of the branded prescription geography and higher costs associated with the growth of our business including commercial expansion to support our HCV products.","Turning to our balance sheet we ended the second quarter with 14.7 billion in cash and investment and generated cash flow from operations of 5.7 billion. On June 29 shareholders received their first quarterly cash dividend of 633 million or $0.43 per share. Our Q3 2015 quarterly cash dividend of $0.43 per share was announced this afternoon. During the quarter we repurchased approximately 9 million shares at an average price of $102.14 pursuant to our 15 billion share repurchase plan approved in January 2015.","As of June 30th we have 14.1 billion remaining under the current plan and remain active in repurchasing shares. Additionally we utilize 3.9 billion in cash for the early retirement of 46 million warrants which will result in a third quarter decline in diluted shares outstanding of approximately 25 million shares. Approximately 9 million warrants remain outstanding at the end of June.","Finally we are updating full year 2015 guidance which is outlined on Slide 46. The changes are as follows we expect product sales to be in the range of 29 billion to 30 billion an increase of 18% to 23% over 2014. Our guidance for product revenues is subject to a number of uncertainties including inaccuracy in our estimates of HCV patients starts a larger than anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segment such as PHF, FFS, Medicaid and the VA. The commercial launches of Sovaldi and Harvoni in Japan the potential adoption in Europe of additional pricing measures to reduce HCV spending and the potential for continued volatility foreign currency exchange rates. Product gross margin guidance is now in the 88% to 90%. We are lowering R&D expense guidance to be in the range of 2.8 billion to 3 billion driven by cost efficiencies in our clinical development activity and faster than expected enrollment of HIV and HCV studies.","We are lowering our SG&A expense guidance to be in the range of 3 billion to 3.2 billion primarily driven by the favorable one-time adjustment to be expected in place from the IRS for the branded prescription drug fees. Our tax rate is now anticipated to be 17% to 18% all other components of our 2015 guidance remain unchanged.","In summary Gilead had another very solid quarter and we see strong prospects for the remainder of the year with higher than originally forecasted revenues and lower than originally forecasted expenses.","Thank you and we look forward to updating you on our progress during our next call. We would now like to open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from the line of Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Geoff Meacham","Congrats on the quarter very impressive. Want to ask you an excess question about hep C from par. If I look on Slide 25 and you\u2019ve broken out new patients by fibrosis states I have a couple questions one what trends have you seen for F0 and F1 patients. And what could be the tipping point for new starts for F0 and F1 and then how important is that when you guys view in the durability for U.S sales.","John Martin","The data that we have on intense to prescribe. We've seen that in this quarter the data we have the intend to prescribe was about 55% of prescription where F0 through F2. Now we actually don\u2019t believe that nearly that many prescriptions were actually filled. By the definition of intend to prescribe is prescription that have actually been written not necessarily filled. So there is still a lot of restriction in place in the United States and I think this is the variable which really will influence the number of patients that we see being treated or the rates of number of patients been treated in the rest of the year and through the next few years.","So clearly what we're hoping is those restrictions start to unwind somewhat, we're encouraged by a couple of things so we're encouraged that the number of people been treated for eight weeks and genotype 1 patients has started to increase that\u2019s now at about 40% of Harvoni prescription. So that kind of implies that less sick patients have been treated and we also hope that as I said in my script starts to provide some encouragement to payers in terms of value as they think about curing patients. But we'll have to sort of wait and see over time how these restrictions unfold. I do think that as the market starts to become a bit more predictable now in terms of the numbers of patients coming through that the hopefully payers will also feel more encouraged to sort of open the gate slightly.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Mark Schoenebaum","If I may John Milligan perhaps three pharma CEOs companies with market caps some cases smaller than your have said something in fact that mid cap biotech is priced to perfection, one even said it's an bubble, the biggest question on everyone's mind for Gilead is who you're going to buy, who you're going to buy, who you're going to buy, who you're going to buy, who you're going to buy, everyday it's what we talked on investor circles, so I was wondering, A, if you could apply on the general state of evaluations in midcap, midcap small and midcap biotech then? And B, just kind of give us an update about what you're thinking on acquisitions, are you ready to do them now, if so, would you be willing to do a series of smaller ones and would you be willing to do for example a very large transformative type of deal?","John Milligan","Thank you for that one question. A couple of things so one number where you've talked about valuation of our industry, and we have seen the dramatic growth in the valuation of the lot of companies certainly the small and midcap company. I have to say that it has been a company by some really significant increases innovation and some very interesting and innovative products that have come along as I do think the innovation revolution that we're seeing has driven greater value creations that we've seen in the past and so it's a little hard to say that when a bubble when you've seen some dramatic innovations and I've got a lot of that value to innovate. So that's how I think about it.","So the second thing I believe was about what are we going to buy? And so what I -- I think I am going to give you the answer that I usually give which is Gilead is in terrific shape, we've got a very strong work force, we've got a really strong balance sheet. We have great scientific expertise on board so that give us the capability to do a wide range of things as you suggested we could contemplate small deals, we could contemplate larger perhaps in transformative deals. And we're in position to strength we could be fairly selective in terms of the things that we like to do and take our time to make sure that those things that we do choose to do we can execute on them fairly effectively, bring new products to market and continue to grow our top line revenue and EPS and so we'll take all those. And obviously further than that I can't comment specifically on any kinds of targets that would be inappropriate.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges of Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Geoffrey Porges","Congratulations on the quarter probably the most remarkable sort of guidance we've seen in a long time, I have a question for Paul on HCV, you've traded roughly 300, when you and your competitors have actually traded a few as well, 300,000 patients in the U.S. over the last 18 months or so. And Paul my question is, is the patient pool that is still to be treated being replenished via a new diagnosis or new patient identification at the same rate does that 300,000 depletion or faster or slower in that 300,000?","Paul Carter","The answer is yes, kind of correctly, so we have some quantitative evidence, we have some quantities evidence; we have plenty of anecdotal evidence. So we talk to doctors the whole time and positions such as in U.S. and all of them tell us that they have many patients in the queue if you like waiting for treatment and really the barriers of them be treated is the restrictions of the payers are putting on. We're also ourselves and competitors and but also a lot of stakeholders working hard to encourage awareness of hepatitis C, encourage testing, encourage people to think about how they link their status to treatment.","And we do try and measure that to some extent as well, so we do measure the number of patients that are coming from diagnosis to undertreated care. And our definition is that we have better patients who visited doctor in the last 12 months with hepatitis C and we're seeing around at 30 stable rates actually around 30,000 a month moving undertreated care. So that is the answer why I give you guess. We're selling that number I think quite consistently.","And as I said we\u2019re doing a lot, and it takes time to actually get traction on some of these things. We\u2019re doing a lot of things now with the view to the longer-term future as well to really try and think about how do we increase diagnosis rate. We've got about 1.6 million people in the U.S. diagnosed we've treated as you said maybe 300,000 in the last year or two, there is still a long way of diagnosed but we\u2019re not resting on those, we\u2019re thinking about how do we start to increase those diagnosed rates as well.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Roden of UBS. Your line is now open.","Matt Roden","I just wanted to ask about the product sales guidance nice deep raise in the quarter here, but if I plug in your half year sales of about 15.5 billion and look at your full year sales guidance of 29 to 30. That seems to demonstrate you are probably not thinking that hep C sales are going to roll off the cliff in the U.S. in the back half of the year. So could you talk a little bit more about your assumptions that went into your sales guidance raise here for this year in particular around the product mix and geographic mix? And then lastly I know you only provide guidance for this year's numbers but anything you can share about your thinking on the outlook in the 2016 in terms of the mix to the extent you can.","John Martin","We don't think as many patients in the U.S. will be treated for hepatitis C is in the first half and the reason for that really is not that we feel that profoundly patient numbers are being treated less than that, but we did see a very big spike in quarter one as I mentioned in the script because there was such a warehouse of patients waiting and people really needed to be treated waiting for interferon free Harvoni to come along. And I do think that we should put in perspective Harvoni really did change everything for patients waiting for treatment.","And to give some context to that, in quarter four last year Gilead treated about 45,000 patients. In quarter two we just had treated over 60,000 patients, and that -- and as two data points but that\u2019s a 40% increase in patients. So we don't feel that the overall trend is this market is going down and down, but we did have this very big spike in quarter one and we don't see that that\u2019s going to be repeated in the U.S. during the rest of the year. ","And we\u2019re still subject to how the restrictions by payers play out in the rest of this year, so I think we've been fairly conservative in our view, we also have the VA situation which is well publicized where the VA is depleted funds at the moment, we've already seen VA purchase drop off towards the end of quarter two. Our assumption is that those purchase will start to come back again when their fund hope to get -- that bucket of funds gets filled hopefully from October, so we've taken that into consideration.","And then outside of the U.S. we've got various dynamics going on. And as I said country-by-country in Europe we\u2019re launching Harvoni and we\u2019re seeing somewhat like the U.S. kind of early spike in volumes as these people who are very sick and really need immediate treatment do get treated. And then it started to stable off. We also see in Europe budget ceilings, the level of treatment in some of the countries is so high at the moment that we do recognize this budget ceilings maybe reached and we\u2019re taking fairly conservative view of that as well.","Then we have Japan I touched on we\u2019re off to a good start but still a lot of uncertainty as the how our launch is go a very encouraged Sovaldi posted the only product interferon free GT2 patients, Harvoni has had incredible 100% FBR clinical data to support its filing for GT1 patients and we should hope to get pricing agreed in the next couple of months. So we\u2019re excited about Japan. But I think overall we\u2019re taking a fairly conservative view U.S. is still the big market for us and we\u2019re recognizing that the second half is probably going to be smaller than the first half, that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it.","Going into 2016, we hope all the efforts that we\u2019re putting into increasing diagnosis, increasing linkage to just to -- just to cast off too -- we're putting a linkage cure now, because our SVR rates really are so high in real life starts to play out and we\u2019re see that still a lot of patients in the U.S. in Europe around other countries in the world to be treated, we've only touched that top of the iceberg and I should mention countries like Canada, Australia, some of the Asian countries that will be coming on stream in the next year or so.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. ","Michael Yee","Just a follow-up on a couple of these things I guess taking a step back. Should the takeaway be that U.S. patient treated continued to get a bit smaller here over the next few quarters but it's offset by OUS and to get people comfortable with the U.S. where do you think it's starts to stabilize or bottom out, how do you get comfortable with that and then start to pick back up. And to that is Medicaid a big part of that I know that you were talking about medication contract and there started to come on and haven\u2019t really heard much about that but that\u2019s part of the population. But with those contracts where is that in all editions where do you think U.S. can start to stabilize and stop declining.","John Martin","We don\u2019t know for sure yet whether the U.S has actually stabilized but we have a sense that directionally it will stabilize and it will stop to grow as the payer restriction start to get loosen up. I mean we feel very clear about that we mentioned the VA of now VA should start to come back on three I think in the fourth quarter. And we will see a gradual shift that makes the payers in the U.S I think slightly towards the public payers, year-to-date we're about 70 to 30 public and Medicare to private Medicare to the public payers, and we would anticipate that might grow to 60, 40 let's say in the second half of the year. So I'm not sure I've answered your question really but\u2026.","Michael Yee","Well I guess the Medicaid population.","John Martin","Yes the Medicaid population will start to come out. Our competitors have exclusive access to some Medicaid we have to other, Harvoni is patient in Medicaid around about 34 states have signed deals with to make Harvoni available that\u2019s about two thirds of the patients covered by Medicaid. So we're getting reasonable access there and as I said I think that mix will start to shift very slightly towards Medicaid during the rest of the year.","Operator","And our next question comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Matthew Harrison","So I guess I wanted to ask a little bit more about the access expansion that you\u2019ve talked about in the U.S. What's the biggest hold up in the access expansion obviously you put rebates in place it sounds like you put a lot of ways to help people and plan whether it's eight weeks or things like that to help them expand access. So what is stopping them and are there anything that you can do or I guess what your confidence that just taking a little bit extra time will allow them to expand access.","John Martin","I think our confidence is high Matthew the restrictions will start to loosen up. The question really is how long will that take? And I think real world evidence is a great help there. So as I said a couple of times we are seeing a numerous studies now being publish and presented which demonstrate that real world data matches or even it better than our clinical data in some cases. So I think it give payers a level of confidence that an expensive investment is worth making and I think that will start to play out. I think also the patient stories and there family stories really do resonate very strongly and when people hear of friends and relatives who been cured in a very simple way and in some cases in a shorter date week. That is a very strong message and a great encouragement.","We are hearing stories show you but some patients are actually taking legal actions against their insurers because there insurers are not paying for them, paying for their treatment despite the fact they are insured. So I think it's a whole lot of things gradually put pressure. And as I also mentioned earlier not least as we start getting to slightly more predictable environment without despite of patient that just immediately need treatment and warehousing and so on, once it gets to a more predicted situation this kind of works with the models of the private payers and hopefully again they will feel more confident in opening up restrictions.","Operator","And our next question comes from Phil Nadeau of Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.","Phil Nadeau","Just a specific question on gross to net adjustment HCV franchise on the Q1 call you highlighted the fact that had enough we adjusted during the quarter. In your prepared remarks this quarter you suggest that the full effect of the payer contracts is being felt. But your last comment it does sound like you still going to give more adjustment in future quarters because of public pay becoming of your portion of reimbursement. So could you kind of discuss where we are in evolution of gross to net in this quarter's run rate good for the second half of the year or is there is more net adjustment to come?","Robin Washington","This is Robin, I would say this year is far articulated script. We do feel that we got more towards what we'd expect with having a full quarter of the contract in place and that impact on the growth to net was thus probably the biggest adjustment got to near the point estimate that we talked about at the beginning of the year which we don\u2019t necessarily want to repeat. I would say also as Paul mentioned you can't expect the little further adjustment based on the payer mix going into the second half again going from 70 to 30 to 60 40. But for the most part in few added stage we don\u2019t anticipate significant changes quarter-on-quarter at this point relative to growth to that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov of JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Cory Kasimov","Just following up on Phil's gross to net question. Would you expect to go through another round of payer negotiations upon the potential approval of Merck's regimen early next year?","John Martin","Cory I'll try on that one We have agreements in place and I think if we look at all the lives in the U.S. about 96% of lives now so the covered have been agreed and Harvoni has access to 83% either as an exclusive or a parity access. I would take the opportunity to just emphasize yet again and the Gilead does not believe in exclusive access, we believe in physicians and their patients having the rights to prescribe whatever they want to prescribe and not been kind of dictated to by payers. So certainly we're not aiming to establish any more kind of exclusivity in a competitive way.","So we have agreements in place with most of the payers most of those agreements are multiyear and we hope that we can compete on our products and we think that that's the way it's going, but we will depend on market share vigorously. We have competed before with the competitors want to compete on price and I think the results speak for themselves, so we will consider every scenario and be ready to for it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Robyn Karnauskas","Just to focus on something just for on the oncology area you have Celgene very aggressive in the blood cancer space with acquisitions and you've also mentioned I think many times probably about thinking about immuno-oncology, so just wondering, how aggressive you think you have to be in oncology to compete and do you think and I think you've said before blood cancer is crowded, do you think it's more like ready to in solid tumor reduction and how you're thinking about blood cancer versus solid tumor in new competitive landscape?","John Milligan","Robyn, this is John Milligan. That's a good question, how aggressive you want to be in the certain areas, so it has been fascinating again the rate of innovation that we've seen in the blood cancers space and it has gotten extremely crowded leaving fewer opportunities I think for new products or follow-on products to make headway into this area, so it has got quite crowded. So we're broadening our criteria for the things that we would be interested in and are looking at a wide range of things.","I think you've mentioned immuno-oncology specifically we've not called that out specifically as an area of interest also partially due to how crowded it is and certainly in the PD-1, PD-L1 space, but we wouldn't us keep from thinking about areas that were novel and could provide further benefit to patients in those areas. But I don\u2019t know on what scale we can talk about aggression, but I do think it's clear where it's going to be active will be opened to opportunities that can benefit our portfolio and the best we think possible.","John Martin","Yes, Robyn, I would also like to point out that we are pursuing solid tumors we have our MMP9 antibody in gastric cancer pancreatic cancer and lung cancer. So you know there is of course evidence that these compounds do have effect on myeloid derived suppressor cells which is in a way of immuno-oncology as well.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Skorney of Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.","Brian Skorney","I guess just looking at Sovaldi, it looks like it's pretty big quarter in the U.S. it didn't quite match with the prescription data relative to the last few quarters, so I was just wondering if you could give any color is there some source of Sovaldi revenue that isn't getting captured in there or was there any one-times last quarter or this quarter that we need to keep in mind? And also I am just curious if there is specific midcap company who you think role in the biotech innovation wave that you've mentioned is maybe underappreciated by the public markets?","John Martin","I don't think it was anything particular about the Sovaldi, there was a tiny little bit of inventory growth. Sovaldi seems to be in a pretty stable at this point in terms of patient number, so I don't think there was anything special about Sovaldi.","John Milligan","And in terms of your question undervalued small midcap stock, I am not into business of giving stock tips to folks but I think I'll continue to decline that.","Operator","And our next question comes from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Terence Flynn","Maybe just two part for me, so first it just looks like if we take sale to buy about patient numbers in the U.S. looks like average price per patient was higher this quarter versus last I was just wondering if that's simply a mix question meaning more Sovaldi patients versus Harvoni? And then the second question was just as we think about 5816 Phase 3 date now, just how to think about positioning there relative to Sovaldi. Would you guys pull Sovaldi from the market or would you keep it on the market and then anything to think about on pricing?","John Martin","Yes, Terrence, the first question on -- it's a mix is the answer to your question. And I hand it over to Norbert.","Norbert Bischofberger","And Terry with regards to 5816 one clearly opportunities here treatment of genotype 3 patients there is still an unmet need. You have might have seen the clatters we're in combination with Sovaldi, that we've got approved a few weeks ago and the response rates while substantial there suboptimal and particularly in cirrhotic patients they have response rates or SVR12 rates about 60%. So that's clearly an unmet need but we're also looking at other genotypes. And with regards to Sovaldi, no, we would absolutely not pull Sovaldi from the market Sovaldi still has a lot of value in subpopulation and then use other agents like the Gilead is here so et cetera.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ying Huang of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Ying Huang","First of all can you talk about Europe? Do you think the growth could be meeting a bottleneck as restricted by the governments' budget process in the second half and also next year. And then secondly your competitor AbbVie commented on the earnings call that they thinks the U.S. GT-1 patients being treated will be annualized at about 175,000 to 180,000, do you agree with AbbVie or do you think you're going to see actually higher number of patients being treated in the U.S.?","John Martin","So let's just deal with the U.S. patient number question. I think that we feel that -- I think we feel that the AbbVie fee numbers are little bit low, we\u2019re fairly confident and this depends somewhat as I said on the payers in the second half of the year, whether they open restrictions further or not, and it also to some extent making some assumptions about that VA coming back on stream. But we see no reason why there shouldn't be 250 plus patients treated in the U.S. next year, that total patient not just GT-1 and its total patients not Gilead share.","We've said in the past I think we still feel that the capacity in the U.S. to treat HCV patients is around 300,000 we've no reason to believe will be higher than that at this point. So I think in the years going forward we\u2019ll see 250,000 to 300,000 patients being treated in the U.S. and that will even flow somewhat but the main variable would be restriction by payers.","And then the European question, well I said that the agreement that we had made with European government taken to consideration ability to pay and that defined by some of the macroeconomic metrics on countries by the prevalence of HCV in those countries, but probably most importantly by the political will of those countries to increase treatment rates above historical level. And so we work with them to agree a kind of volume based rebate structure that encourages high number of patients to treat and we\u2019re seeing those becoming sort of executing now. And as I said in Southern Europe Italy, Spain, Portugal we\u2019re seeing a substantial number of patients being treated. We\u2019re also very aware of the fact that these countries single payer systems do you have finite budgets and the countries have made great efforts to increase those budgets to treat more patients because they do see the value of treating hepatitis C patients.","Whether we hit those budgets or not, I can't predict at this moment, but one thing is for sure that either at the rate of patients being treated they allow have to slow down somewhat in some of those countries order have to increase their funding over the next couple of years if they want to keep it treating at the rate they are doing. But anyway we\u2019re greatly encouraged that a lot of patients have being treated and we\u2019re greatly encouraged that the real world data really support that investment in treating patients and we hope that will encourage further increases in budget.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Sonnier of William Blair. Your line is now open.","John Sonnier","The question is for Paul, with the Japan coming on line can you talk a little bit more about the HCV market opportunity there. And I'm particularly interested in how the pricing mechanism works and whether or not there is any statutory discounting downstream or based on volume?","Paul Carter","So Japan is exciting opportunity for us and as you may know it's the first product we've launched in Japan. So on the back of this we\u2019re actually establishing or have established our Japanese entity and we hope that, that entity will be a platform in the future for us to launch whole series of future products, not just in the hepatitis C space. So it's exciting, we've launched Sovaldi for GT-2 we've launched that late in May, 25th of May we've got pricing agreement and launched and it's got off to a good start although it's extremely early day. They are around 200,000 GT2 patients in Japan who are diagnosed and as I already mentioned have really no interferon free option other than Sovaldi so we\u2019re very happy to be able to help meet that unmet medical need.","We\u2019re working to agree pricing on Harvoni, we should have that agreed fairly soon and we\u2019re confident that, that will be a happy outcome for everyone and we shouldn't have any delays in launch. There are no statutory discounts on pricing in the first years, there is a statutory system and it's typically 2% to 5% discount every two years or so that we've seen historically and we would envisage that that would happen. There is also a mechanism whereby you have to forecast your revenues going forward and there is a system of capping prices based on whether you go through that ceiling that you've sort of self agreed. So there are mechanisms but no discounts per-se on a day-to-day basis, and we wouldn't expect any discounts on Sovaldi or Harvoni at least for the first two years.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jason Kolbert of Maxim Group. Your line is now open.","Jason McCarthy","This is Jason McCarthy for Jason Kolbert. My question is in terms of building the market for Harvoni in the U.S. How do you see it, I know it's been discussed before? The cost cutting insurance carriers and discount is like with express script trying to control pricing and how that could have impact the growth of Harvoni going forward?","John Martin","Well I think we have to stand back and look at our products and recognize if there is incredible amount of value and incredible amount of innovation. First of Sovaldi then Harvoni and then in what we're calling our wave 3 and wave 4 products. And I think it's that innovation that is our negotiation strength really and I think all payers would like fundamentally to make highly innovative medicines that work incredibly well available to their patient. And so we have to negotiate and come up with terms that work for both sides. But we're very optimistic and we work very hard to keep good contact with the payers across the U.S to make sure that fully aware off and what's coming next and making sure that we\u2019re all on the same page. And so I think we we're quietly confident that we can continue to have strong and good relationships and high levels of excess to all of our medicines and especially our next HCV innovations.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Alan Carr of Needham and Company. Your line is now open.","Alan Carr","Could you comment more about the R&D and SG&A spend this year? Why this quarter is a bit lower than expected. I know you comment, if you could take a bit more about that and then your thoughts on long-term trends from that into '16 and '17.","Robyn Karnauskas","Sure the overall year-over-year basis both of SG&A and R&D kind of increased and again the R&D was driven by discontinued acceleration of our pipeline. But as we always do and look we've had really good enrollment levels with those trials. So as we look at our out year or second half guidance you're able to turn it back again still making progress but doing it even faster than we have initially thought. On the SG&A side the one big adjustment that you saw Q1 versus Q2 related to the branded prescription drug fee. The rest is just related to the ongoing commercial advance since they were making Paul talked about the launch in Japan the other launches is ex U.S as well as just a direct to consumer investment that we're making. Even with all of those as we looked at our guidance again we've always been focused on conscious expense management and ended up being able to do a little bit at your given thoughts since reducing the guidance. The most of the SG&A reduction was related to the one-time adjustment in the brand and prescription drug fee.","Alan Carr","And then with respect to a longer term trend here. Do you expect this to continue these levels in the '16 or '17? And any reason to believe will be any dramatic growth here or it might come down?","Robyn Karnauskas","Yes it's a good question we haven\u2019t really given long-term guidance. I think overall relative to our launches we continue to expand geographically which will drive some of the cost and as Paul articulated we're focused a lot on brining additional patients to care and look at care I don\u2019t see that being major incremental step up in terms of SG&A. So there is no significant trend difference in what I'd say but I'm hard press to kind of give too forward look forward without providing additional guidance. Relative to R&D I think we've always taken approach that we'll advance things in the clinic as it makes sense right. We feel good with the level of spin we have today but we're very optimistic about our pipeline. So you could see absolute dollars go up where that falls relative to percentage of revenue that is something that will to be determine if we provide guidance in '16 and beyond.","Operator","Thank you.

I like to turn the conference back over to Mr. O\u2019Brien for closing remarks.","Patrick O\u2019Brien","Thank you Candice, and thank you all for joining us today.

My name is Chelsea, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Sung Lee, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thank you, Chelsea, and good afternoon everyone. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with the earnings results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016. The press release and detailed slides are available on the Investor Relations section of the Gilead website.","The speakers on today's call will be: John Milligan, President and Chief Executive Officer; Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Kevin Young, Chief Operating Officer. Also in the room with us for the Q&A session are Norbert Bischofberger, Executive Vice President of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer; and Jim Meyers, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Commercial Operations.","Before we begin formal remarks, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, financial projections and the use of capital, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the latest SEC disclosure document and recent press releases. In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.","Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release as well as on the Gilead website.","I will now turn the call over to Robin.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thank you, Sung, and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased to share our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016. I'll first review financials and Kevin and John will make a few comments.","2016 was a productive year for Gilead with strong performance across the HIV and cardiopulmonary franchises. The year was not without its challenges, notably navigating the changing dynamics of the HCV market in countries around the world. We continue to be an operationally and financially efficient organization with high operating margins and a healthy balance sheet as 2017 begins.","Total revenues were $7.3 billion for the fourth quarter 2016, with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.70. This compares to revenues of $8.5 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.32 for the same period last year. For full year 2016, total revenues were $30.4 billion, down 7% year over year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings was $11.57 per share for the year, down from $12.61 per share for the same period last year.","Product sales for the year were $30 billion, down 7% year over year driven by lower HCV sales, partially offset by increased sales in HIV and other therapeutic areas. Turning to the U.S. Product sales for the year were $19.3 billion, down 9% year over year. HCV product sales were $8.4 billion, down 32% year over year driven primarily by lower Harvoni demand, higher discounts and payer mix. Within HCV sales, Epclusa, which was launched in June of last year, achieved $1.6 billion of sales in 2016. HIV and other antiviral product sales for 2016 were $9.1 billion, up 27% year over year due to strong uptake of our TAF-based regimens.","Turning to Europe, product sales for the year were $6.1 billion, down 15% year over year primarily due to lower HCV patient starts and unfavorable currency movement. In Japan, product sales for the year were $2.5 billion, up 31% year over year primarily driven by higher sales of Sovaldi and Harvoni, which were launched in Japan in May 2015 and September 2015 respectively. The increases were partially offset by the mandatory price reduction on our HCV products of 32% effective last March.","Turning to expenses for the full year 2016. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $3.7 billion, up 32% compared to the prior year, reflecting the continued progression of the product pipeline including milestone payments related to advancing clinical studies and the purchase of an FDA priority review voucher. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $3.2 billion, which represents a slight decrease compared to the prior year, driven by lower branded prescription drug fee expenses partially offset by expenses to support new product launches and geographic expansion.","Turning to the Idenix Merck litigation matter, which is ongoing. As of December 31, 2016, we have not recorded any charges to our financial statement, as we believe it is not probable under accounting rules that the company will incur a loss on this matter. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K will contain detailed disclosures on the amount of potential damages and royalties Gilead could owe Merck in the event the appellate court upholds the jury's verdict.","Turning to cash flow. We generated $16.7 billion in cash from operations for the full year 2016 and $3.5 billion for the quarter. We continued to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During the fourth quarter, we utilized $1 billion in cash to repurchase 13 million shares, bringing our total 2016 share repurchases to $11 billion and 123 million shares. Earlier today, we announced a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.47 to $0.52 per share, which will become effective in the first quarter of 2017. This increase underscores the confidence of the board and management in the strength of the business and future cash flows.","In 2017, leveraging our capital to pursue external opportunities to expand our R&D pipeline is our primary focus. As a result, we will reduce the level of capital dedicated to share repurchases this year and focus a greater percentage of our shareholder return on our dividend. We currently have $9 billion remaining under our 2016 share repurchase authorization, and we'll utilize it over time to maintain our current share count. Over the longer term, we may be opportunistic with additional share repurchases.","Finally, I would like to cover our full-year 2017 non-GAAP financial guidance, summarized on slides 21 through 25 in the earnings presentation available on our corporate website. Given the unique dynamics of the HCV market and patient starts, which have the greatest impact on our HCV revenues, we have split our net product sales guidance between non-HCV and HCV net product revenue. Non-HCV net product sales are expected to be in the range of $15 billion to $15.5 billion. HCV net product sales are expected to be in the range of $7.5 billion to $9 billion.","Our guidance is subject to a number of uncertainties, including: the accuracy of our estimates of HCV patient starts in 2017; unanticipated pricing pressures from payers and competitors; lower than anticipated market share in HCV; slower than anticipated growth in our HIV franchise; an increase in discounts, chargebacks, and rebates due to ongoing contracts and future negotiations with commercial and government payers; a larger than anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments such as PHS, FSS, Medicaid, and the VA; market share and price erosion caused by the introduction of generic versions of TDF and the fixed-dose combination of FTC\/TDF outside the U.S. later this year; an uncertain global macroeconomic environment; potential amendments to the Affordable Care Act or other government action that could have the effect of lowering prices or reducing the number of insured patients; as well as volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.","Slide 24 provides further information on Gilead's estimate of HCV total market patient starts across key commercial geographies, which is the primary factor used in developing our 2017 HCV product sales guidance.","We expect our non-GAAP product gross margins to be in the range of 86% to 88%. We expect our non-GAAP R&D expenses to be in the range of $3.1 billion to $3.4 billion. We expect our non-GAAP SG&A expenses to be in the range of $3.1 billion to $3.4 billion. For the full year, our non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 25% to 28%. We anticipate the full-year diluted EPS impact of acquisition-related, stock-based compensation, and other expenses to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.91 per share.","I would like to now turn the call over to Kevin.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thank you, Robin, and good afternoon everyone.","Before beginning my comments on the quarter, I'd like to formally introduce our new Executive Vice President of Commercial Operations, Jim Meyers, who joins the earnings call team. Jim has been at the company for 20 years and has been instrumental in building out the company's commercial operations in North America, including leading successful product launches across the company's portfolio of products. I've personally worked with Jim for more than 10 years and can vouch for his unique insights into the complexities of the various markets and therapeutic areas for which we serve patients.","Now I would like to provide an update on our commercial performance during the fourth quarter and share a few highlights from markets around the world. Let me say from the outset that I see the very highest levels of operational excellence across Gilead, people every day supporting best-in-class products in viral, cardiovascular, and pulmonary diseases. But as I will describe in some detail, there are very different external dynamics when comparing treatments for chronic diseases like HIV with treatments that can cure a disease like hepatitis C.","Starting with HIV, without question, 2016 was one of our strongest years, led by the rapid adoption of TAF-based regimens. In the U.S., total HIV and other antiviral revenue was $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up 20% year over year and down 6% sequentially. As a reminder, third quarter results benefited from a one-time favorable adjustment of $332 million to rebate reserves, primarily related to TDF-based regimens. Excluding this one-time adjustment, there was a 7% sequential increase in the fourth quarter, driven by robust underlining growth and some inventory build consistent with prior years.","Genvoya, our first TAF-based single-tablet regimen, surpassed $1 billion in revenue in its first year. No other HIV product has achieved this level of success, and this performance is a testament to the clinical profile of TAF in combination with elvitegravir in one tablet. As highlighted on slide 33, Genvoya quickly became the most prescribed regimen across all U.S. treated HIV patient groups within nine months of launch.","At the end of 2016, TAF-based regimens made up 37% of Gilead's HIV prescription volume in the treatment market. This is remarkable considering that Genvoya was launched a little more than a year ago, and Odefsey and Descovy have been on the market for just nine months. Most patients on these products switch from Gilead's older regimens due to the improved safety profile of TAF. Additionally, an estimated 10% of patient switches are coming from non-Gilead therapies, resulting in incremental growth for the franchise.","Turning to Europe, total HIV and other antiviral revenue was $705 million in the fourth quarter, down 6% year over year and down 3% sequentially. This was driven by negative foreign exchange and a full quarter impact of an imposed price reduction in France.","Strong uptake of Genvoya continues across launch markets in Europe, including Germany, Spain, and the UK. In Spain, Genvoya is the most prescribed regimen for switch patients and the second most prescribed regimen for treatment-naive patients. And just last week, I am delighted to say that Genvoya began its commercial introduction in France. As many of you know, France is the largest developed HIV market outside the U.S. Finally, to complete the European major market picture, we hope to have Genvoya introduced in Italy by early quarter two.","Turning to Descovy and Odefsey outside the U.S., we now have the products available in 13 and 11 countries respectively. Additional launches are anticipated in 2017 as pricing and reimbursement discussions continue.","Beyond TAF, there continues to be a strong uptake for the use of Truvada for pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP. At the end of 2016, approximately 110,000 people in the U.S. were using Truvada for this indication. When used in combination with other prevention strategies, Truvada for PrEP can have a meaningful impact on public health by helping to reduce HIV transmission rates.","The majority of PrEP prescribing to date is concentrated in four cities where awareness is high, most notably San Francisco. The city recently announced a reduction in HIV infection rates as a result of greater testing, the use of anti-retrovirals for treatment, and the adoption of PrEP. There is an opportunity to replicate this success in other areas across the United States, and Gilead has been encouraged to play a more prominent role in PrEP education and has done so via the hiring of a field-based team. We believe that Truvada for PrEP will continue to be an integral part of our growth in HIV in the U.S., as communities embrace the public health benefits of prevention.","Before leaving HIV, one event that should be highlighted in 2017 is the loss of the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate exclusivity in some countries outside the U.S. We have forecasted the financial impact of this event on our non-HCV sales guidance as shown in Slide 22 referred to earlier by Robin. Nevertheless, we believe the rapid adoption of TAF for HIV treatment and the uptake in Truvada for PrEP in the United States underpin a strong Gilead growth trajectory some 15 years after the introduction of Viread in 2001.","Turning to HCV, in the U.S., total HCV revenue was $2 billion in the fourth quarter, down 15% year over year and down 1% sequentially. Total HCV treatment starts in the U.S. for the full year 2016 were an estimated 231,000, approximately 25,000 less patient starts than in 2015. There were a few one-time events that impacted this number in 2016. Notably, one, the opening of access of two of the largest U.S. commercial payers which happened in quarter one. Two, the increase in the number of patients treated through the VA system, especially in quarter two. And three, the treatment of genotype 2 and genotype 3 warehouse patients following the approval of Epclusa in the second half of 2016.","Since we do not anticipate the same or similar factors repeating themselves this year, our expectation is that patient starts in 2017 will be lower than in 2016. Above and beyond the factors I just cited, the decline we expect is also due to a change in the profile of patients coming into treated care. A greater number of patients have less advanced disease, and thus there is less urgency to begin using curative DAAs like Harvoni and Epclusa. In addition, an increasing percentage of untreated patients face circumstances that favor delay such as ongoing drug or alcohol use, co-morbidities or unstable living conditions.","Turning to Europe, total HCV revenue in the fourth quarter was $628 million, down 26% year over year and up 4% from the previous quarter. The sequential performance was primarily a reflection of the small bounce back in patient starts, following normal summer seasonality in markets like Spain and Italy.","Despite the year-end pickup, we expect patient starts to continue to decline in 2017. Countries like Germany, France and the UK are fast exhibiting the same characteristics as the U.S. Spain and Italy continued to experience budgetary constraints, and the treatment of F0 to F2 patients in these countries has been limited.","In Japan, product sales for the fourth quarter were $314 million, down 77% year over year, and down 31% sequentially due to the decline in patient starts and the entry of another company's product to the market.","Our local intelligence punched us some unique dynamics in Japan that are potentially behind the profound decline in patient starts relative to other countries. First, recall that approximately 40,000 patients were treated with another DAA regimen prior to the launch of Sovaldi, decreasing those who were very sick and warehoused. Second, up to 40% of HCV infected patients in Japan are over 80 years old and often under the care of a general practitioner, not a specialist, who better understands the importance of treating patients regardless of age. Third, there is a lower awareness of hepatitis C and the fact that there is a cure among the general Japanese population.","Before leaving our HCV results, I'd like to return to my theme of earlier. This disease has unique dimensions, the most important of which is that it can be cured. And thanks to Harvoni, it can be cured in as little as eight weeks in a genotype 1 patient. Whilst earlier HCV therapies had their limitations, you can still observe the dynamics that a cure has on patient starts following the introduction of a new class of medicines as shown in slide 37.","As we look as best we can at the near-term horizon, we see 2017 total HCV patient starts declining relative to 2016 in all major markets. By comparison, the U.S. numbers are still vastly higher relative to treatment levels before the advent of DAAs. Gilead's role as market leader is to appropriately work with the various components of HCV care, providers, professional associations and infected individuals where allowed, to bring patients into specialists' care and successfully cure them of a destructive virus.","Moving on to hepatitis B, Vemlidy, our TAF-based therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B was approved by the FDA in November, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in December and the European Commission last month. This is the first medication approved to treat chronic hepatitis B in nearly a decade. While still very early, we are pleased with the uptake of Vemlidy in the U.S. Initial feedback from healthcare providers suggests that they strongly believe the long-term safety profile of Vemlidy represents an important new development for people living with chronic hepatitis B.","Finally, as I highlighted last quarter, our U.S. cardiovascular team continues to deliver impressive results. Letairis and Ranexa revenue totaled $436 million for the quarter and achieved nearly $1.5 billion for the year.","I would now like to turn the call over to John. John?","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thanks, Kevin.","I'd like to make a few closing remarks before we get to your questions. Gilead was very productive in 2016, launching four important new therapies, two for people with HIV and two for the treatment of viral hepatitis. As mentioned by Robin and Kevin, we are very pleased with the progress of Gilead's TAF-based regimens based on the benefits they provide. With the successful launches of Odefsey and Descovy, we now offer three different and important new options for patients with HIV.","We continue to innovate in HIV, and next week we will present data from a Phase 2 study of bictegravir, Gilead's non-boosted integrase inhibitor. The 48-week study compared bictegravir to dolutegravir, each given in combination with F\/TAF and the data will be presented at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Seattle. The detailed results are embargoed at this time and we look forward to sharing the data with you as soon as we're allowed to do so.","CROI is one of the most important meetings for HIV research and this year's meeting gives us an opportunity to present promising data from multiple research and clinical programs aimed at addressing the unmet needs of people living with HIV. Included in the conference will be data from our programs on novel, long-acting agents, next generation nucleotides for highly treatment-experienced patients, and new data on our efforts to cure HIV patients. Gilead remains firmly committed to R&D focused on improving the lives of people with HIV.","Similar to HIV, we have revolutionized the treatment of viral hepatitis by providing medicines that cure chronic hepatitis B infection or managing chronic hepatitis B more effectively. Gilead's HCV therapies offer cure rates between 95% and 99% regardless of genotype with fewer side effects and a far less treatment time than prior treatments. When we launched Sovaldi in late 2013, most of the patients had quite advanced liver disease and had been under care for many years. In nearly every country, the healthcare system expanded to unprecedented levels in order to care for these sicker patients as time was running out for many of them.","Following this great success, patients seeking care today have a quite different profile and these patients tend to have less advanced disease and require more time for workup prior to initiating treatment. Additionally, many have co-morbidities or other issues that may prevent treatment until resolved. As a result, our analysis situation predicts that fewer people will be treated in 2017 than in 2016 in the United States, Europe, and Japan. These healthcare systems each should see lower spending in this category as a result.","We continue to work to ensure patients have access to HCV medications. For example, in the U.S., we've offered very generous rebates and discounts into the various entities that reimburse for prescription drugs. Contrary to the sometimes misleading headlines citing our list pricing, in 2016 in the U.S., the volume-weighted average price for Harvoni was reduced to less than $15,000 per bottle inclusive of discounts and rebates. This average was skewed by the significant discounts provided to Medicaid and the VA and the 340B program. For example, our average price per bottle to Medicaid is less than $10,000 for states that are opening up access to all patients. Prices for 2017 are expected to be similar.","Despite the fact that prices of direct-acting antiviral HCV medications have never been lower, getting payer access to these therapies is often an onerous process for patients and doctors. With the declining rates of patient starts, it's our hope that progress can be made by next year to simplify the access process for patients with less advanced liver disease. Patients who are early in their disease have the highest cure rates and often require only eight weeks of treatment, resulting in an even lower cost per cure.","There is still one unmet medical need in HCV treatment: patients who fail direct-acting antivirals. Gilead filed a new drug application for its single-table regimen of SOF\/VEL\/VOX in December and the FDA granted priority review status with a set target review date of August 8, 2017. A market authorization application in the EU was filed in January. If approved, SOF\/VEL\/VOX would be the first STR for HCV patients who have failed prior treatments.","Our NASH programs continue to advance. We believe that NASH is a growing unmet need around the world with data suggesting that perhaps 3 million people in the United States have advanced NASH with fibrosis. We're committing significant R&D resources towards this public health problem. At AASLD in November, we presented positive Phase 2 data on selonsertib, showing both an improvement in fibrosis scores, and a decrease in progression of disease after only 24 weeks of treatment. Selonsertib is a first-in-class ASK-1 inhibitor and we were pleased with the efficacy seen at a relatively low once-daily dose.","Based on these promising results, we consulted with regulatory agencies and initiated two Phase 3 studies of selonsertib. One is in patients with F3, and one is in patients with F4 fibrosis scores. Patients with F3 and F4 fibrosis have the greatest medical need, and impose the highest cost on the healthcare payers. In addition, patients with NASH and F4 fibrosis have a median life expectancy of only five years.","We're also continuing with two other promising agents for the treatment of NASH and other metabolic diseases, GS 0976, an ACC inhibitor, and GS 9674, an FXR agonist. As these programs advance through this year, we may also begin to look at the combinations to determine if two mechanisms, one that hits the metabolic dysfunction of hepatocytes and one that reverses fibrosis, can improve efficacy with an acceptable safety profile.","In the area of inflammation, Phase 3 studies of Filgotinib in rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are now underway and enrolling. Filgotinib has a very large safety database of more than 1,400 patient years, and has proven to be well tolerated. With this once-daily dosing and safety profile, we'll continue to look at Filgotinib across a range of different inflammatory diseases where JAK1 activity is implicated, and we have plans to initiate up to six phase 2 studies during the year.","2017 marks Gilead's 30th anniversary. Over the past three decades, Gilead's many innovative products have helped transform the HIV infection from a fatal and debilitating disease into a chronic","manageable condition, giving individuals with HIV a chance to live out their lives. More than 10 million people are now receiving a Gilead-based HIV regimen every day. We are proud of our ability to help HIV patients access their medications globally.","In the U.S., for example, we've worked closely with public health systems to ensure access. In fact, Gilead has frozen prices to the federal and state funded AIDS Drug Assistance Program since 2008, and state Medicaid programs pay less for Truvada today than at launch in 2004. Gilead's commitment to these important safety net programs has allowed them to expand over the years, now providing coverage to slightly more than half the people living with HIV in the United States.","Over the last several months, I've had the opportunity to talk with public and health policy experts, healthcare providers and industry leaders about the various access that remains, and how we can collectively help address them. We at Gilead will continue to seek solutions so that today's medicines can be accessed by all the people who need them, while supporting the innovative needs for fighting tomorrow's public health problem.","Finally, we will continue to maintain our strong operating and financial discipline and focus our efforts in 2017 on continuing to build out our pipeline, aggressively progressing internal programs and pursuing partnerships or acquisitions that are the right strategic fit with our company.","I'm confident in the future of Gilead, and I'm looking forward to sharing with you the many accomplishments across this organization in 2017. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our employees. It's because of your commitment and drive that we're able to help millions of people live healthier, more fulfilled lives.","Thank you for your time. And let's now open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for the question. So, John, when I look at the year on year trends on hep C over last year, they're obviously weaker as you progress through the year. What I find impressive though is your cash flow generation remains somewhat stable. So I know on this call you'll get a number of deal questions, but I wanted to get a sense as to how much your cash flow informs the urgency for deals versus other metrics such as operational synergy or valuation. And then a real quick one for Kevin. Just wanted to know the payer attitudes towards PrEP in the U.S. and Europe and how they've changed. Thanks, guys.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hey Geoff, thanks for the question. If you think about the different models and we think about our budget for 2017, we still have a very impressive net income and operating margin and importantly cash flow out of it. In fact, it would rank at or above nearly every one of our comparable companies. So we still feel very good about the company. We feel very good about our cash flow for the future. I think it's still for us a desire and a need to have a right strategic fit for the company. That is the driver for why and when we do any mergers or acquisitions or partnerships, much more so than the need for cash flow, because we feel very comfortable about where we are.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hey, Geoff. It's Kevin. Let me take the PrEP. Thank you for asking it. I just want to repeat that we now have deployed a small but very focused PrEP team around the country. It's very much in urban areas. And we do hope that we can support PrEP education along the lines, as I said, of the likes of San Francisco. Right now, there is fairly good payer coverage in the United States for PrEP. It's largely through the commercial payers, and they see the benefit. So largely the patient groups that are currently using PrEP have good coverage. Obviously, we're going to take it into a wider audience, so we'll have to make sure that we get perhaps some of the public payers onboard with support for PrEP.","Generally in Europe, it's government reimbursed. A year ago we had France give us coverage, and we have about 3,000 patients now on the medication in France. And we're starting to see other governments come out. The UK came out with a statement fairly recently on providing support for PrEP. So we're seeing some momentum starting to build outside Europe.","The other thing I would just very quickly say about PrEP that we see as an important signal of adoption is that we're seeing more persistency of treatment for the PrEP patient. In other words, they are getting repeated bottles month after month, in some ways rather like an HIV patient. So that's encouraging that it's starting to become established and routinely used for its preventative benefits in patients.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question and I appreciate all the granularity around guidance, just a question on the hep C guidance. What's the right way to think about the potential decline in new patient starts in the U.S. versus Europe that you might anticipate this year? And to what extent might new competitive entrants impact price or share this year even before the traditional annual renegotiation of formularies? Might we look for that to maybe contribute more beyond this year and into 2018?","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Brian, I'll probably ask Jim to help me a little bit with a very good question. You can see from slide 24, we deliberately broke out the U.S., the EU5, Japan. There are very similar dynamics going on here. In fact, if you look deeper into the EU5, again, irrespective of the type of healthcare system, there is this decline going on. It is more profound in Japan, and I tried to describe that effect. So these are our best estimates, Brian.","We've taken into account some of the trends we see through prescriptions. We've tried to listen to some of the public payers like the VA. The VA don't publish their data on treatment starts, so we just really got to sense how they're doing in terms of moving through their patients. We obviously also take judgments on the opening of access from a Medicare\/Medicaid point of view. It has been relatively slow. We have blocked together the competition, the share, and the treatment generation, bearing in mind that slide 23, that is total around Europe, so it takes into account all competitive dynamics. But perhaps, Jim, you may have one or two questions on how we think about this.","James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","I would just reiterate what Kevin said that the biggest impact of course is patient starts, and that's what we're seeing. It's across all of the different segments in the U.S. and really across all global markets. Whenever there's a competitive entrant, historically there has been some level of magnitude. It varies by competition on both price and share. So that is factored in here.","Again, there are multiple launches later this year. It's not just a competitor. We have a launch later this year. We don't expect formularies to change. That really happens with payers in the fourth quarter in the U.S. But all of this is taken into account in that bucket that you see on slide 23. But again, I can't say enough how much the primary driver is the dynamic we're seeing in patient starts.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","I'd also just add, Brian, we're still very, very confident in the profile of the two options that we have for hepatitis C. Harvoni is still a tremendous product. I would just add that it's about 50% now of the patients that are using eight weeks of Harvoni in genotype 1. And as you've seen from the numbers, there's been tremendous uptake of Epclusa in the genotype 2 and 3 patients.","Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC","Very helpful, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question and thank you for all the color on the guidance. It's really helpful. I guess I think the question that I think a lot of people will ask me is, you've bottle volume is declining aggressively this year. And while you haven't given guidance beyond that, maybe help us think about, could this happen again next year? Is there anything that gives you comfort that we could see some stability in the patient volumes at least in the near term? Thanks.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hi, Robyn. It's Kevin. Let me start, and maybe perhaps one or two of my colleagues might chip in here. This market's been full of surprises. It surprises on the way up, I think, Robyn, and it surprised us in some ways on these dynamics we see coming down the other side. So it's the kind of market that in some ways we take one year at a time. We're almost learning as we're going along. And we have tried, particularly Jim and myself, but we've tried every way to look at this market. We have vast amounts of data, but what we're always doing is forecasting with no backbone of chronic patients. So it's all about how you just judge the starts. So what we've got here in 2017 is really our very, very best estimates. We've put them out there, and it's difficult for us really to go beyond this coming year.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Robyn, I would say that our efforts and the efforts around us to try to open up access to the less severely ill patients will be instrumental in helping stabilize that, and that's one of our focuses for this year. In fact, even today we saw some potential opening at one of the big plans. So all this could be very useful in terms of stabilizing that number, and that will be a big focus of the company this year.","James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","And maybe one final comment, Robyn, just would be that's why we continue to invest in direct-to-patient initiatives and disease awareness campaigns, because even if it is a slightly different profile of patient that's coming into care, they're ultimately all going to need treatment, or the vast majority are. So we need to continue to invest in that to ensure that there is a steady flow of patients for many years in the future.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","As you say, Jim, it's a different patient presenting and it's a longer journey.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Leerink Partners. Your line is now open.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you very much. Thanks for taking the question. My question is concerning the guidance. It looks as though, back of the envelope, you're guiding for operating margins to be down by 700 or 800 basis points and tax rate up by 600 or 700 basis points. And so we go back to the question about looking ahead.","First, if you do a deal, Robin, is there space in that R&D guidance for additional R&D investment in a deal, or would that be incremental to your current guidance? And then secondly, to the extent that there's variability principally around HCV, is that the basis for the trend in the tax rate guidance? And should we extrapolate that if we believe that the trend will continue, where might the tax rate guidance end up if you were straight HIV and the rest of the portfolio?","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Sure, Geoff. So thanks for the questions. I mean, to your first question regarding R&D expense, yes, there is opportunity to do some deal and add incremental R&D expense to get us back to levels commensurate with last year that we've thought about. But more importantly than just the year, we've kind of thought about that relative to some of the actions we've looked at or thought about relative to our overall portfolio and our allocation across the various therapeutic areas that we support. So I'm not going sit here and guarantee that we wouldn't increase R&D expense. We will to do the right thing and get new product in the acquisition market, but there is some opportunity there to absorb some of that.","And relative to tax rate, yes, when we started with hep C, we kind of gave these ratios which don't necessarily work on the way down. But I think one of the clear drivers with the delta in tax rate here is the fact that, as outlined in our guidance slide, a lot of the growth in HIV is coming from the U.S. So you're seeing more of our revenues be U.S.-driven which have a higher tax rate as well as less hep C, which again takes the tax rate up. So it's a balance, again, highly dependent on patient starts which is the primary driver across things. So if you see more patient starts and higher hep C revenue, you'd see us on the lower end of tax guidance.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay, thank you very much for that color.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys. Thanks for take the question. Thanks to Sung for all the help my team while I was out. John, good to hear your voice. So let me ask you a deal question maybe a little different way, if you don't mind. And, John, this is a question I don't expect a yes or no. I expect you to just riff on it. When you look at Gilead, can you take the revenue base in 2016 as a starting point? And do you believe that you could grow that revenue base by 2018 without an acquisition of external assets? And then the second part of that question is, your leverage ratio right now at least on 2016 according to your slide deck 1.4. I know your EBITDA next year will be a little lower, so maybe that's 1.6 or something now. But any kind of thoughts, Robin or John, on like where that could go if you saw the right opportunity? Thanks a lot. I really appreciate it.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","First of all, Mark, it's really nice to hear your voice and we're glad to have you back.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Thanks, John.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Maybe less there now that you've asked a hard question. As I understand it, what you're asking is if you take the, say, circa $30 billion we had in 2016, can we do an acquisition that would grow off of that basis.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","No, could you grow the company without an acquisition?","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Oh, without an acquisition.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Was an acquisition a necessary requisite for revenue growth off 2016 levels over the next year or two?","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","We don't have a lot of things launching over the next few years. If you think about it, we have bictegravir which will be filed later this year, launching into next year. We're very confident of our HIV franchise. That is going to be a good growth driver for us. We are facing some headwinds in 2018 and beyond on other patent expiries we'll have, including the U.S. patent for TDF. We'll also have patents on Letairis and the following year Ranexa.","So that puts some downward pressure on that non-HCV revenue base and so that makes it challenging for us to grow without some sort of acquisition in those area. I'm not going to say exactly when that would pick up again. It will depend a little bit on where HCV stabilizes and it will depend quite a bit on the uptake of bictegravir, which as we keep pointing out, we're very excited to be able to share the data with you and hopefully you'll share our enthusiasm for how this can transform the HIV market going forward.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Mark, I'll chime in on your debt to EBITDA question. I mean, I think we've been fairly thoughtful particularly dealing with the rating agencies and in thinking about debt levels that we feel very comfortable that we can support acquisitions and increase our debt to EBITDA. Most importantly because given our cash flows, which we expect to continue for a very long time, we can easily delever over time with our existing therapeutic area franchises. And this is totally exclusive of any potential tax changes, or particularly if there were repatriation. That would make all that even simpler. So we feel comfortable that from an asset standpoint that we could support any type of acquisition that we'd need to do to support Gilead's growth.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Thanks, Robin. Good to hear your voice, too.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess I wanted to ask relative to some of your projections for this year and relative to guidance, instead of talking about where you can see further compression but where you might be able to see some upside. So I guess as you think about the projections you've made across HCV patient starts, how your HIV business performs or even some pipeline assets, where might you think about are sort of maybe potential upside SKUs in some of those projections? Thanks.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hey, Matthew. Let me make a start and again, you'll get some other views from around the table. I do want to go back to HIV. It's going really, really well. I mean if you look at our results, year on year we were up 17% in HIV and other antivirals and adding nearly $2 billion of revenues to the company. Now a large part of that came from the U.S. And as you see from slide 22, we are predicting anywhere between $0.9 billion and $1.2 billion of growth from the U.S.","I don't know whether you picked up on my comment, but we already have 37% of treated HIV, Gilead-treated HIV patients on tap, which in a year is really a remarkable achievement. And it's our intention that we continue that growth and that momentum for Genvoya. So I really want to emphasize that. Yes, we have an interesting dynamic, as John pointed out, in Europe coming up with the loss of the TDF patent in July. But I have to say that Europe is a kind of a mosaic of countries at different points in the TAF launch. So we'll just have to see how that event comes through.","Now in terms of HCV, we would like to see a lot more access in Medicaid states, but that has been slow. We would certainly like to see access way improving, which we think a lot of patients could be cured. And we talk a lot to our government affairs team about that. Fibrosis scores are now in some ways opened in Europe. We still have some challenges around Southern Europe, Italy and Spain, but generally that's not a barrier. Geographically, I think we're doing well around the world. We are thinking about a small build-out in China for the private market, but that really would be a 2018 and beyond effect.","So what we have today, I think, is a really thriving HIV business. And as John has said, we are excited about bictegravir and we've got these interesting dynamics around HCV. And I concur entirely with Jim. We're going to continue to support HCV with a great deal of enthusiasm because there are still a lot of affected patients, and we'd like to bring them into care. And we have such an efficient operating model that we can do that.","James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","I would agree, Kevin. And just maybe one, to build on one thing you said around PrEP earlier. As Kevin had said, we already have 110,000 patients on PrEP. Nearly twice that many have ever been exposed, and again that's before what Kevin had mentioned, the deployment of a 40-person prevention specialist team. And some very targeted direct-to-patient and direct-to-provider advertising that we're going to do.","I think as Kevin had mentioned, the vast majority of PrEP prescribing right now is in four or five cities where the awareness is very high. The area where HIV is, people are at highest risk of contracting HIV right now is in underserved, inner city areas. If you're an African-American MSM, your lifetime risk of HIV right now contracting it, is one in two. So we're going to have people in areas like, in epicenters, New Orleans, Baltimore, DC, Newark, Oakland, areas that we haven't been before. But also doing that through targeted advertising, and particularly trying to get at populations that don't engage in healthcare.","So we'll be using social media and dating sites and Tumblr and Snapchat and things like that, that are much better, are much more I would say likely media to reach this type of population. So we are bullish on, particularly in the U.S., the potential upside of PrEP as well. And again, there was an earlier question about the payers. I think the one thing that I believe payers are starting to see is if we can reduce the \u2013 if we can prevent HIV from occurring, ultimately that's going to bring down costs of treatment. And that's a lifetime cost of treatment. So again, that's one of the messages that we communicate as well when it comes to PrEP.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for the question. In regards to 2017 guidance, I think it was quite a surprise what the numbers were. Is there some conservatism built in there? Is it kitchen sinking? Is it absolutely very realistically what you see? Maybe you could just characterize how you're thinking about it and whether you're trying to be conservative at all? And then when I think about the patient numbers that are implied in there, which I think is on slide 28 or so, is there a cadence to the new patient starts across the U.S. dropping from 230,000 to 160,000? Is that steadily across the area \u2013 what is the one big thing I guess in 2017 that's different from 2016 as you built out that projection perhaps in your starts.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hi, Mike. It's Robin. I'll start and then I'll have the commercial team chime in. I wouldn't say that our philosophy around guidance has changed year to year. And I think what we've tried to do is to be very transparent, but we're cognizant of the fact that given what you've heard in our commentary, that we expect HCV market patient starts to go down. The reality of it is, is exactly how that will happen and when is still very difficult for us to really hone in on, hence the wide variability in our HCV guidance relative to our non-HCV guidance where we do have much more predictability given that it's a chronic market. So I wouldn't say there's over conservatism built in. I mean, there's always some conservatism built into guidance but I wouldn't characterize the way we've guided here to be different than we have in the past.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Michael, just very quickly, I had a comment. Again, I said it earlier, we've used our best efforts. We've shared I think pretty much all our data that we have with you today. So we've really used our best efforts on trending, on the various payer buckets of patients. I would highlight on the slide that we've supplied on patient starts, there is the call-out of the 20,000 patients that was the uplift in 2016. So in total it was 231,000 patients but there was an uplift of 20,000. So whilst 2017 seems a big step down, it's not as great when you take into account the uplift that took place in 2016.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So heading into CROI, can you remind us the design of the B\/F\/TAF study versus your ongoing Phase 3, and maybe how we should be thinking about this update next week? In light of the decision to use a lower dose in Phase 3, I guess I'm wondering how much that impacts the read-through, if it does in any way. Thanks.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thanks, Cory, for the question. I thought this earnings call might end without ever anybody asking me a question, so thanks for the question.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","It's my pleasure.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","So the design of the study was very similar to Phase 3. It's dolutegravir versus bictegravir given with F\/TAF. And our Phase 3 study is the same design but using the single TAF\/F regimen instead of the individual component. And then the dose that was actually used for bictegravir is it gives you the same exposure as the Phase 2 dose. So the Phase 3 dose is the same exposure as the Phase 2 dose. There was some slight drug interaction when you co-formulated the bictegravir into a single TAF\/F regimen.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's helpful.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","And of course, by the way, the other Phase 3 study, there are four Phase 3 studies. The other controlled Phase 3 study, a single TAF\/F regimen versus single TAF\/F regimen which is bictegravir F\/TAF versus Triumeq. And then there are two switch studies.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you, Norbert.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Alethia Young with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess maybe just going to HIV and talking a little bit about the dynamics that may change over Europe. I saw that you included it in the guidance. That was helpful. But one, will the generic switches come from new starts or switches in HIV when you think about some of the markets in Europe? And then also, like should we expect the slope to be kind of the same, or will it kind of further go down as we move through the years, you think? Thanks.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hey, Alethia. It's Kevin. Generally, and this is a general statement, switches are the dynamic part of HIV. It doesn't matter whether it's the U.S. or it's Europe. So generally, that's where the action is, if you like, in the HIV market. I do want to repeat my comment of earlier, Alethia, that we've got different countries at different stages of the TAF rollout. And that will have some impact on what happens if and when we see generics start to enter the various countries, because of course, whilst we aggregate for our results and aggregate for our comments, Europe is this whole, whole series of different countries.","We're getting tremendous uptake of TAF in the early launch markets. I think you can see the chart we put in of Germany, which is just absolutely tremendous. Descovy as well, by the way, even better than Genvoya, we have a lot of separate components in Germany. It just happens to be less of a STR market. So Germany's going great. Spain's going great. I think Jim and I have very high hopes for TAF in France, which is just this past week. So I think you've got a little bit of a picture to paint, and we'll just have to see how that emerges around the event that we've highlighted and we've been realistic about that versus how TAF in its various forms is adopted.","James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","I agree, Kevin. And I would just add, just having been over there, that we're not seeing any delay really in any of the reviews of TAF right now. And again, I think that's important. The generic impact will largely be limited to the compounds coming off patent. So it will be Viread, which is little used, Truvada, which is in the early launch markets decreasingly used, and then ultimately Atripla. It will have less if any impact on Stribild and Complera and hardly any impact on the TAF products once they're listed. So that's the whole key that Kevin said was we're at various stages of rollout, but once we get those products listed, it's a 2017 with dynamics moving in a couple different directions. But once we get beyond that and we have the full TAF launch, we see this as a very sustainable growth driver for the company.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, thanks for taking my questions, a quick one for Robin. If I look at your midpoint for 2017 guidance for SG&A and R&D, SG&A is roughly flat, but R&D continues to go up. So 2017 is a year where your earnings will come down. I was wondering how much operating leverage you might have in terms of those items on P&L.","And then maybe for Kevin, on slide 23, if I take the midpoint of the $1.9 billion to $2.5 billion negative impact from increased competition, shorter duration and do the math, it's roughly 15% down from 2016 level, potentially for pricing. Is that the right way to think about how pricing would trend in 2017? Thanks.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","So, Ying, it's Robin. I'll start with your first question. I think relative to the ranges, first just the one thing I want to mention on SG&A is it's going up primarily because of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee. And even with HCV revenues going down, we ended up with an IRS credit in 2016. So the comparator makes it look like it's going up. Across the board, as I said and John mentioned, I think we remain operationally efficient and do have leverage.","Obviously, our operating margins have been very high, driven by our revenue. But we never really grew our company to the rate that our revenues grew. So we do feel we have operational leverage. And even if you look at some of the things we're investing in, in 2016 in SG&A and R&D, they were done by other things we've chosen not to invest in. So we'll continue to be able to currently make the necessary trade-offs, absent M&A, we think to remain efficient and focus on operational excellence.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hey, Ying. It's Kevin. Just to address your second question, I really do hope we've been helpful with slide 23 to break out both the starts and three of the elements, which is pricing, market share, and duration. We won't go any further on the latter bucket. We believe we've really put our foot forward and tried to be helpful. But please bear in mind that slide 23 is the whole world of Gilead. There's Europe in there. There's Japan in there. There's the U.S. in there. So it's a whole basket of multiple dynamics around competition and duration.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","And maybe just one last thing is, keep in mind that Epclusa has only launched at this point in Germany. So this takes into account a competitive marketplace. Epclusa is going to, we expect reimbursement in the UK in the first half, the rest of the countries in the second half. And it takes into account competitive dynamics, which are share and pricing around that.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen and Company, LLC","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question, just a question on intermediate term competition. Two things that investors are debating is the impact of the doublets that are based on dolutegravir that we could see data from this year or early next as well as potentially the competition from AbbVie's new doublet regimen in HCV. How is management looking at those two potential threats? Thanks.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Phil, so the first question about the doublet, keep in mind, what we haven't seen here is the efficacy of the doublet in a whole spectrum of HIV patient populations, particularly those with high viral load. Those have been excluded until now. And until and unless we see that it is really useful across all viral load spectrum, it's really difficult to say what competition that will be. But having that said, if it is efficacious and if it is dissimilar to triple, single-tablet regimens, then it will be a competitor to ours.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hey, Phil, in terms of hepatitis C, difficult to ever know what a competitor does. From what we can see of the data, it is a step up in terms of competition. But I'd like to just repeat what I said earlier. We have a heck of an offering in Harvoni and Epclusa. We've maintained very, very healthy market shares to date, I think probably exceeding what many, many people thought we would do. So we'll continue to be very active and believe that we have the best options. The contracts for the U.S. are 12-month contracts for 2017, so it's probably largely or more a 2018 type of event.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Josh Schimmer with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hey, thanks for taking the question. I'm very into the growth question, but hopefully you can start to wind that down. Roughly when do you expect to see at least stabilization of the bottom line? And if you can't answer that question, why do you think investors should have a favorable outlook for the company?","And then on the PrEP franchise, can you elaborate on your plans or strategy to convert that to Descovy and how much you think you can convert? Thank you.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hey, Josh. We're not hearing you too well. We had a little bit of interference, so we hope you've got the questions. So the PrEP, the PrEP, Descovy, Norbert, in terms \u2013 or Andrew in terms of the Phase 3 studies, perhaps you can give a comment on that and we'll come back to the other question.","Andrew Cheng - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hi, Josh. It's Andrew Cheng speaking. And I would say that for our Phase 3 trial, right now it's ongoing. We're in the middle of enrollment. So it's very difficult to address how easy we would convert them without knowing the results, quite honestly.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","And, Josh, in terms again, I think I'd come back to my earlier comments. We are taking one year at a time. I do hope, again, whilst you may not be satisfied with perhaps some numbers we've put out there, Josh, we really have put our best foot forward and given you all the data, virtually as much as we know. So we're almost as intrigued by this market as you are, and we're doing our very best to try and model it. And by putting out the 2017 numbers, we hope that is helpful. 2018 will be what it will be when we get there.","Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just two part on hep C. So, Kevin, can you tell us what new diagnoses were in 2016 and then what you're assuming for 2017? And then Express recently published their annual drug trend report. They're projecting hep C spend declines over 30% in 2018 and 2019. So maybe just help us think about, again, I know those aren't your numbers, but as we think about the out years, what could be some of the drivers going into those assumptions? Thank you.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hey, Terence. I'll take the first part of your question. If you look at slide 41 in our deck, it has the new diagnoses out there for you. We don't right now have 2016. It's always basically a database that's one year in arrears. So we do the best we can. This is the most up-to-date data that we have and we've now given to you. I would point out one thing on slide 43 and just like we're seeing healthier patients to be treated are being treated, you can see that there's basically less fibrosis in the presenting patients. So again around this theme of patients essentially coming forward who just don't quite have the urgency that had been previously. Jim?","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yeah, and then regarding ESI, I think it's probably a combination. I can't speak directly for them, but what I would hypothesize would be, you're probably aware that they did add Harvoni to the national formulary, so they now have an eight-week option, which is one of the best ways to reduce costs in HCV that they didn't have when they had the Viekira Pak as their sole option. So that's playing a role in what they're looking at over the next couple of years. But again, other than that, it's patient starts and their ability to project beyond 2017 is probably similar to ours. So it's challenging. And we're confident in 2017 and those are the drivers.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with BMO Capital. Your line is now open.","M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks. Two questions. I'm not going pretend it's two parts. On bictegravir, just given the excitement related to the data and obviously the opportunity that you've spoken to before, just give us a sense for what impact it will have on the rest of your HIV portfolio. And ultimately, should we expect you to regain some of the share that you've lost to the product offerings from ViiV? An unrelated question, but previously you've stated an unwillingness to compete on price in hep C. Would product offerings being more similar? Is that still the company position?","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","So, Ian, I'll take the HIV question first. Part of the success of bictegravir is based on the success of Genvoya. And this 37% already of treated patients is terrific. And that bodes very, very well for TAF bictegravir. So what we like about this is that we are building once again the HIV franchise for Gilead. So we'll have a terrific Genvoya part of this and we believe we'll also have a terrific TAF bictegravir. So it's really I think operating on all fronts. As you've seen from the comments I made on Genvoya, we're getting about 10% of our Genvoya business from patients who are not currently on a Gilead regimen and we would hope to maintain that, perhaps even do better, once we have the additional arm of bictegravir F\/TAF coming to join Genvoya. So we think about, if you like, both fronts. And Odefsey, Descovy also contributing to that but basically left hand\/right hand Genvoya and bic F\/TAF. In terms of pricing?","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Competing on price.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Compete on price? Jim?","James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","I'm sorry. I didn't get the second part of the question.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","The question was, he said, you typically don't compete on price, but this category has been unique in this industry and that competition has lowered prices. So in fact, we have been competing on price for a few years now. So I don't see, I don't understand the question because that's been the nature of how we've been competing in these markets, especially with regard to both the public and private markets.","M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I guess the question was more specific to AbbVie's new product offering and potential for pricing to go down further. Is there a willingness to sort of hold ground here? Or are you willing to compete on price if the price is going down?","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","I'm not going to comment on that because I've been advised by counsel that we can't comment on future product launches and how we would react to them. So I can't say anything.","M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. I appreciate that, John. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Katherine Breedis with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Katherine Breedis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. With HCV, would it possible to perhaps provide a little more granularity around the patient volume by payer mix in the U.S.? And along those lines, are we still tracking toward potentially reaching a point where the majority of VA patients with HCV will be treated by the third quarter of 2017? Thanks.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Great questions, Katherine, and I'll let Jim take the VA. Right now, in terms of payer mix, and it's been fairly steady for the last three quarters, about 45% of our HCV patients are coming from the public and about 55% from the commercial Medicare Part D. So that would be I think the rule of thumb. Obviously, that moves around depending on the very thing that you've raised, which is the VA. And I'll let Jim comment on the VA.","James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yeah, no, sure. I just would first say that no single entity has done a better job of identifying patients and getting them linked to care and treated than the VA and I think they're a model for the other sectors out there. They have treated a higher percentage of diagnosed patients than any other sector. So they're actually ahead of the non-VA population. And we're seeing similar dynamics within the VA as we are outside of the VA and we do expect a lower rate of treatment because of that in 2017. And because the VA is actually ahead of the non-VA population, we would expect that VA patient starts would represent a decreasing percentage of Gilead HCV patient starts in 2017 compared to what they've represented over the last several years. So again, the vast majority of diagnosed veterans are going to get treated. I can't tag an exact date on that, but they're doing a great job and funding has not been an issue.","Katherine Breedis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And maybe if I could ask a follow up. Is it tracking faster than we have seen? I mean, is it possible that that patient population will be treated earlier than the third quarter of 2017? Just to get a sense of the gating of the tails. That would be great. Thank you.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Katherine, if I could just jump in there. We have no real hard data from the VA. Our type of feel for the VA is through conversations. As Jim said, it's been very, very impressive. And you got to give the VA credit. So again, the slope, the times are very, very difficult for us to get specific on.","James R.

I guess when I look at slide 22, and we're talking about non-HCV net product sales guidance, I'm just wondering, it looks like where you have bracketed off the ex-U.S. tenofovir patent expiration, it seems like that assumes the entire loss of ex U.S. Viread sales to make that number despite it not expiring until July. So I'm just wondering, is there anything more we should be expecting in terms of the tenofovir patent expiration impacting other products that you're taking into account there? And where in this slide are you taking into account any ex-U.S. HIV growth? Because it seems like there's only U.S. HIV there. Thanks.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hey Brian. There is some very nice growth. Again, I direct you back to the slide on Genvoya, Descovy, Odefsey in Germany, which is those lines that I'm absolutely delighted with. And again, I repeat that our teams, whether it be here in the U.S. or around the globe, are really executing at a high level. I would simply say that the block that you're looking at on slide 22 does include a mix of our TDF products. So it's Viread it is also Truvada, because I think as you might know, the FTC patent predates the TDF patent in Europe. So there is the potential for effect not only on pure Viread, but on Truvada.","James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","And recall as well, it's a year in which we're going to have launches throughout the year of the TAF portfolio.

Your line is now open.","Jim Birchenough - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah, hi guys. Thanks for fitting me in. I guess you're describing two very different businesses with the non-HCV sales growth and the declining HCV portfolio without a clear sense of where the bottom is there. So the question is, is there any thoughts of splitting those businesses? It's a question I've got. I've thought about it. I'm wondering what the logical considerations would be against doing that? And then the second part would be assuming the business remains melded together, what commitment can you make to growing the overall business beyond 2017? I understand taking it a year at a time from a projections perspective, but I think investors would like some commitment to growth and to understand the initiatives you're going to take to do that.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Jim, the answer is no. We're not considering splitting up the company. And while it looks good in the world of Wall Street from a multiples perspective, I think it's an economically and financially a bad idea for the company. So we are committed to growing the company. We're committed to our field of NASH. We're committed to growing that HIV field. And we are going to continue to accelerate our pipeline through acquisitions and whatnot over the course of the year. This is a challenging situation. I understand it. We understand it. And we're here somewhat reporting the news to you of what the world of HCV looks like as it's declining faster this year than we would have predicted last year. And we're dealing with it through our strength of our balance sheet, through the cash flow we'll have at HCV, so that we can get the company back to growth.

My name is Candice, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Sung Lee, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thank you, Candice, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market close today, a press release was issued with earnings results for the third quarter of 2016. The press release and detailed slides are available on the Investor Relations section of the Gilead website. Joining today's call will be John Milligan, President and Chief Executive Officer; Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Kevin Young, Chief Operating Officer; and Norbert Bischofberger, Executive Vice President of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer.","Before we begin formal remarks, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, financial projections and the use of capital, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the latest SEC disclosure documents and recent press releases. In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP-to-non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release as well as on the Gilead website.","I will now turn the call over to Robin.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thanks, Sung, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to share our results for the third quarter of 2016. I'll first review our financials, and Kevin, Norbert, and John will then make a few comments.","Total revenues for the third quarter were $7.5 billion, with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.75. This compares to revenues of $8.3 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.22 for the same period last year. Product sales for the third quarter were $7.4 billion, down 10% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. These declines were due to lower HCV sales, partially offset by increased sales in HIV and other therapeutic areas. Sequentially, declines in our HCV sales in the U.S., Japan and Europe were partially offset by increases in U.S. HIV and other product sales.","Turning to the U.S. Product sales for the third quarter were $5.1 billion, down 9% year-over-year. HCV product sales were $2 billion, down 37% year-over-year, driven primarily by lower patient starts for Harvoni and lower revenues per patient, primarily due to a higher percentage of sales to more deeply discounted segments. The decline was partially offset by demand for Epclusa, which was launched at the end of Q2 2016 and generated $593 million in its first full quarter of sales.","Sequentially, our HCV product sales were down 12%. These sales were essentially flat compared to the second quarter, excluding the favorable adjustment to our HCV sales return of $279 million that we made last quarter. HIV and other antiviral sales increased 32% year-over-year and 19% sequentially. The quarterly revenues of $2.6 billion were positively impacted by strong uptake of our TAF-based regimen and a one-time favorable adjustment of $332 million to our rebate reserve, primarily related to our TDF-based regimen. Without the adjustment, U.S. HIV and other antiviral sales grew 15% year-over-year and 4% sequentially.","Turning to Europe. Product sales for the third quarter were $1.4 billion, down 16% year-over-year, primarily due to lower HCV patient starts and unfavorable currency movement. Sequentially, sales were down 12%, primarily driven by lower HCV patient starts and summer seasonality, consistent with the usual decreases in demand during the European summer holiday month.","In Japan, product sales for the third quarter were $452 million, flat year-over-year, driven by higher sales of Harvoni, which was launched in September 2015, offset by mandatory price reductions for both Sovaldi and Harvoni, which we discussed during our last call. Sequentially, sales were down 27% as a result of lower Harvoni and Sovaldi patient starts.","Now turning to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $981 million for the third quarter, up 38% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the progression of our clinical studies which included a $200 million milestone expense associated with our purchase of Nimbus. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses for the third quarter were down 8% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to lower branded prescription drug fee expense.","From a balance sheet perspective, during the third quarter we generated cash flows from operations of $4.3 billion and ended the quarter with $31.6 billion in cash and investments, which is inclusive of the issuance of $5 billion of senior unsecured notes. We have a healthy balance sheet to invest in our pipeline and external opportunities. While our cash flows will remain strong, we do anticipate a sequential decrease in Q4 2016 due to required cash payments related to accrued government rebates as well as milestone payments associated with our R&D pipeline.","Shareholder return via dividends and share repurchases year-to-date remain strong. In the third quarter, we repurchased 11.7 million shares for $1 billion under the $12 billion 2016 share repurchase program. For 2016, the total share repurchases through the third quarter were 110 million shares at a cost of $10 billion. Year-over-year, we have seen an 11% decline in our diluted shares, primarily driven by our share repurchases.","Finally, we are reiterating our full year 2016 guidance which was revised on July 25, 2016 and summarized on slide 27 in the earnings results presentation available on our corporate website. As a reminder, guidance for product sales is subject to a number of uncertainties, including an uncertain global macroeconomic environment, adoption of additional pricing measures to reduce HCV spending, volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, inaccuracy in HCV patient start estimates, additional competitive launches in HCV, an increase in discounts, chargebacks and rebates due to ongoing contracts and future negotiations with commercial and government payers, and a larger-than-anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments, such as DHS, FFS, Medicaid, and the VA.","I would like to turn the call over to Kevin now.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thank you, Robin, and good afternoon, everyone. I am very pleased to take you through a solid set of operating results for the third quarter. Starting with HIV, Gilead continues to make significant steps in delivering improved single-tablet regiments to patients around the world. We have seen strong adoption of our TAF-based regiments in the U.S. and in the European markets where we have received reimbursement.","In the U.S., of the nearly 840,000 people on antiretroviral therapy, approximately 80% receive a Gilead regimen. Genvoya is the most-prescribed regimen for both treatment-na\u00efve and switch patients. This month we expect cumulative prescriptions of Genvoya to surpass Atripla's prescription at the same point in time post-approval. This will make Genvoya the all-time most successful product adoption in its first year in the 30-year history of HIV therapy in this country.","The uptick in Genvoya, Odefsey, and Descovy have largely been driven by the switch from Gilead's old STRs due to the improved safety profile of TAF. It is also encouraging to see a notable number of patients from non-Gilead therapies moving to TAF-based regimens. Approximately 10% of Genvoya switches are incremental to the Gilead HIV franchise.","Turning to Europe. Total HIV and other antiviral revenue was $728 million, up 1% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. Third quarter European pharmaceutical revenues are typically affected by summer seasonality. In Italy, Spain, and Portugal, we saw lower prescribing risk consistent with prior years. Genvoya has been launched in 18 markets in the EU, including Spain and Germany, where we are seeing rapid uptake, similar to the U.S.","Descovy has been launched in nine markets and Odefsey has been launched in eight markets, the largest being Germany in both cases. We expect our TAF-based therapies to continue to grow in Europe, with Spain still early in its commercial launch of Genvoya. Pricing and reimbursement discussions are ongoing in France and Italy, with the goal of having these complete by year end.","Guidelines historically have had a significant impact on prescribing patents. Genvoya is already listed as a preferred regimen in several HIV treatment guidelines, including the European AIDS Clinical Society, as well as country guidelines in Germany, the U.K., Spain, and Italy.","I would like to make a few comments about HIV prevention and the use of Truvada for PrEP. The growth in people stocking Truvada points to the valuable role the therapy can play when used as part of a comprehensive strategy to prevent transmission. We estimate that in the U.S., approximately 80,000 to 90,000 people were using Truvada for this indication in the third quarter. We are also starting to see uses of PrEP in France, where approximately 2,000 people have been prescribed Truvada since it received reimbursement in January this year.","We expect PrEP to continue to be a significant part of Gilead's growth in HIV going forward, particularly in the U.S. With the rapid adoption of TAF-based regimens, the potential of PrEP and our exciting pipeline programs, especially bictegravir, I'm very positive about the long-term lifecycle potential we have in HIV.","Turning to HCV. Approximately 61,000 people in total began HCV therapy in the U.S. in the third quarter of 2016. This represents the fourth consecutive three-month period where patient starts have been in the 50,000 to 60,000 range. We estimate that more than 85% of treated patients in the most recent quarter received a sofosbuvir-based regimen.","The uptick of Epclusa has been most encouraging in its first full quarter post-launch. Although it is important to point out that we have observed a small, yet noticeable, warehousing effect. As expected, the vast majority of Epclusa is being used in Genotype 2 and 3 patients according to our 12-week label.","In terms of payer coverage, formulary reviews for Epclusa are on track. 11 state Medicaid programs have already added Epclusa for Genotype 2 and 3 patients, and most commercial and Medicare Part D plans are providing entrant coverage for Epclusa based on medical need. Finally, the VA has added Epclusa to their national formulary and have begun ordering.","The 2017 Commercial and Medicare Part D contracting cycle is now essentially complete. And whilst I can't share with you plan-by-plan details, suffice to say that we are pleased with the picture for the coming year. Discussions with all major PBMs and MCOs proved to be productive and recognized the clinical leadership of Gilead's HCV options, especially as demonstrated in real-life settings. But barriers to access still remain, as Medicaid continues to be the outlier in terms of access, restricting coverage to only the more advanced patients.","Turning to Europe. Total HCV revenue in the third quarter was $604 million, down 30% year-over-year and down 22% sequentially. This was driven by lower HCV patient starts. While overall patient starts declined, our market share remained largely unchanged across the major markets, with the exception of the U.K., which was slightly down for the quarter. We estimate that 21,000 patients started on a sofosbuvir-based regimen in the third quarter compared to 27,000 in the second quarter.","At our last earnings, I described how we were observing lower patient starts in the early EU launch markets of Germany and France. Put simply, many of the high-need patients have been treated and cured. We are now starting to see this trend unfold in Southern European countries, particularly in Italy and in Spain. Performance in the region is also likely somewhat affected by summer seasonality, similar to the dynamics we observed in HIV.","Epclusa has now been launched in Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Denmark. I'm pleased to say that there have been the same positive reception as in the U.S. We expect to launch in the other large EU markets once pricing and reimbursement is in place by the second half of 2017. Not only does 12 weeks of Epclusa deliver incredibly high cure rates, but as a new standard of care, it is considerably cheaper than previously used interferon-free regimens, especially treating genotype 3.","As I conclude my remarks on hepatitis C, it is very important to reiterate that more work needs to be done to identify and cure HCV-infected people around the globe. A key objective for Gilead is to appropriately raise disease awareness, highlight the importance of age-related testing and encourage linkage to specialty care. To help with this effort, we recently launched new educational campaigns in the U.S. and Japan to urge all individuals at risk for or living with HCV to talk to their health care provider.","You may have seen our new advertisement on television here in the U.S. It debuted last week, and I am very pleased with the positive and responsible tone it takes to emphasize to people the need to be screened for a disease that can now be cured in as little as eight weeks. We have received numerous positive comments from advocacy groups, providers and, not least, the many people already cured of hepatitis C who want others like them to benefit.","Moving on. One other liver disease that warrants some mention today is hepatitis B, for which we are well-prepared for the launch of TAF. With our PDUFA date coming, we are hopeful that we will have the opportunity to speak to physicians at the AASLD Meeting and in the field about the strong data for this product as soon as next week.","Finally, as I highlighted last quarter, we have a very strong U.S. cardiovascular team that continues to deliver impressive results. Letairis and Ranexa revenue totaled $385 million for the quarter and surpassed $1 billion in the year-to-date.","In closing, I'd like to reiterate the positive progress Gilead is making in addressing viral diseases. We will soon have treated 1.2 million HCV-infected individuals around the world, most of whom are now cured. By any measure, this is a profound contribution to global health care delivery. And in the field of HIV, not only are we effectively managing the disease with our new TAF-based regimens, but Truvada is helping more and more people avoid infection. I am confident that we will close out the year with continued strong financial performance underpinned by a passion for operational excellence and our focus on putting the patient first.","I will now hand the call over to Norbert.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thank you, Kevin. During the third quarter, a number of Phase II and Phase III studies concluded, providing insights into efficacy and safety of both approved and experimental Gilead agents in the areas of HIV, liver disease, inflammation, oncology and cardiovascular disease. Some of these results were disappointments, some were exciting successes.","To start off with the disappointments. We now have the final analyses from three 96-week studies of the anti-LOXL2 monoclonal antibody, simtuzumab. The data indicate that, while safe and well-tolerated, there is no evidence of efficacy in one study in primary sclerosing cholangitis and in two studies in NASH. One NASH study was in patients with cirrhosis and one was in patients with liver (20:54) fibrosis. Consequently, we will not develop simtuzumab any further in these or any other indications. We will present these data at future conferences.","As for GS-5745, an anti-MMP-9 antibody, we stopped a Phase II\/III study in patients with ulcerative colitis because of the lack of efficacy. This decision for the planned interim DSMB analysis after the first 150 patients had been enrolled, that the study met pre-defined futility criteria. Also, and not unexpectedly, there was no evidence of benefit of GS-5745 in a Phase II study in patients with Crohn's disease. Consequently, we will not further pursue GS-5745 for ulcerative colitis or Crohn's. In these studies, GS-5745 was safe and well tolerated, and we're continuing to evaluate GS-5745 in rheumatoid arthritis as an add-on to anti-TNFs or other therapies.","Eleclazine, or GS-6615, failed to meet its primary endpoint in a study of patients with ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or VT\/VF, and implanted cardioverter-defibrillators. Patients were randomized to two doses of eleclazine or placebo. The primary endpoint was the number of electrical interventions, including shocks and pacing, by the implanted device. And there was no evidence of efficacy of eleclazine compared to placebo. Consequently, we will not develop eleclazine any further for VT\/VF. Evaluation in long QT-3 syndrome and in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is continuing.","But now to the excitement, starting with HCV. The pan-genotypic single-pill triple combination regimen of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir, voxilaprevir, or I'll call it SOF\/VEL\/VOX, has been studied in four Phase III studies called POLARIS-1, 2, 3 and 4. POLARIS-1 and 4 evaluated the regimen in patients who had previously failed a direct-acting antiviral and included patients with cirrhosis. Treatment of these salvage patients with SOF\/VEL\/VOX resulted in SVR rates of 96% and 97%.","The two other studies, POLARIS-2 and 3, compared the triple combination regimen in treatment-na\u00efve patients given for eight weeks to Epclusa given for 12 weeks. POLARIS-2 was open to all genotypes, whereas POLARIS-3 enrolled only genotype 3-infected individuals with compensated cirrhosis, where the unmet need is the greatest. In POLARIS-2, the SVR rates obtained with 12 weeks of Epclusa were numerically higher than those obtained with eight weeks of the triple combination, whereas in POLARIS-3, the SVR rates were comparable.","Particularly in POLARIS-3, which involved the most difficult to treat Genotype 3-infected cirrhotic patients, Epclusa for 12 weeks resulted in 96% SVR rates. These results underscore the value of Epclusa as an excellent treatment option for patients across all genotypes and they also suggest that the future role of SOF\/VEL\/VOX will be for patients who previously failed an antiviral regimen. The full data from these studies will be presented at AASLD in a few weeks, and we will submit Marketing Authorization Applications to regulatory authorities imminently.","Another exciting result was the anti-fibrotic effect observed with GS-4997, an investigational small molecule inhibitor of apoptosis signal regulating kinase 1, or ASK1. GS-4997 was shown to inhibit inflammation apoptosis and fibrosis in settings of increased oxidative stress associated with NASH in preclinical models. This Phase II clinical study involved 72 patients, two-thirds had F3-stage fibrosis and one-third had F2-stage fibrosis. There was evidence that treatment with GS-4997 for only 24 weeks resulted in fibrosis reversal and decreased fibrosis progression in a dose-dependent manner.","At the highest dose tested, which was18 milligrams, 43% of patients showed at least a 1-point decrease in their fibrosis score compared to only 20% in the simtuzumab control arm. At the same time, 20% of the Simtuzumab-treated patients progressed to cirrhosis compared to only 3%, or one out of 30, at the 18-milligram dose.","The full data from these studies will be presented at AASDL in a few weeks. Based on these exciting data, we will initiate discussions with regulatory authorities and plan to move GS-4997 into Phase III clinical development in patients with NASH. Based on the Phase II results, we intend to evaluate GS-4997 in patients with the highest unmet need, that means those with F3 and F4 stages of fibrosis.","At the same time, we have two other compounds with different mechanisms currently in two Phase II studies in patients with NASH and fibrosis, and that is GS-9674, an FXR agonist, and GS-0976, an ACC inhibitor in the studies of 24-week and 12-week duration, respectively. Pending demonstration of single-agent efficacy and safety in these two Phase II studies, we plan to initiate combination studies with the three agents towards the middle of next year.","In HIV, we're continuing to explore the utility of TAF-containing regimens in various uses and different populations. Last week, data from three Phase III studies were presented at the HIV Conference in Glasgow. 96-week data were disclosed from one study, where 663 virologically suppressed patients were randomized to either continue on their Truvada-based regimen or to switch to a Descovy-based regimen.","In two other studies, 630 and 875 virologically suppressed patients on Complera and Atripla, respectively, were randomized to switch to Odefsey or stay on their current regimen. In all studies, switching to a TAF-based regimen was non-inferior with regards to efficacy, but was superior in regards to renal and bone laboratory safety parameters.","The Phase III development of the single-tablet regimen of bictegravir F\/TAF is continuing. Four Phase III studies are now fully enrolled and we anticipate unblinding these studies towards the middle of next year, with regulatory submissions planned for the third quarter of 2017. We also plan to present 48-week Phase II data on bictegravir F\/TAF at the Scientific Meeting in the first quarter of 2017.","In oncology, a Phase III study of GS-5745 in patients with gastric cancer is ongoing as well as a Phase II study in patients with gastric cancer in combination with nivolumab. We're also evaluating GS-5745 in other solid tumors.","In addition, we have now completed two Phase I safety studies of our combination kinase inhibitors. We were able to establish safe doses of our PI3K inhibitor, idelalisib, in combination with our BTK inhibitor, GS-4059, and our Syk inhibitor, entospletinib, in combination with the BTK inhibitor, GS-4059. Consequently, we will now first evaluate the PI3K BTK combination with and without anti-CD20 therapy in relapsed refractory CLL patients in collaboration with the German CLL Study Group.","We will also be announcing initial Phase Ib\/II data on our Syk inhibitor, entospletinib, in acute myeloid leukemia at the upcoming ASH Conference in San Diego. We have entered into a collaboration with the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society to provide entospletinib for their Beat AML Master Trial. This trial will employ the latest genomic technology to match specific AML mutations in newly-diagnosed patients over age of 60 with an appropriate investigational drug or drug combination.","In summary, great progress has been made with some of our programs. The very nature of R&D is that you often face both closures and progress. Going forward, I'm pleased we now have the ability to focus our attention on development programs in NASH, inflammation, oncology, and HIV. We now have seven new molecules in advanced clinical development. The PDUFA date for TAF for HPV is coming up in a few weeks, and we plan to file an NDA before the end of the year on SOF\/VEL\/VOX for use as salvage therapy for patients who have failed a previous direct-acting antiviral.","Four molecules are continuing in Phase III, that is momelotinib for myelofibrosis, bictegravir F\/TAF, the single-tablet regiment for HIV infection, filgotinib for three separate indications, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's, and GS-5745 in gastric cancer. Finally, we plan to advance GS-4997 for NASH to Phase III.","I would now like to turn the call over to John.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thanks, Norbert. I would like to make a few closing remarks before we get to your questions. We continue to have success with the important work we do in HIV and viral hepatitis. There's still a great need for innovation in these fields. Both of these include patients whose needs remain unaddressed and both represent global epidemics.","Our researchers are working to bring to options to a wider range of patients than ever before. This includes people with HIV who've been on therapy for decades and may need to change their medication due to side effects, or patients who may be failing to fully suppress their virus due to the presence of resistance. Approaches our research teams are pursuing include new molecules for treating resistant virus, novel formulations in combinations that may be dosed infrequently and opportunities to cure HIV patients by clearing out the viral reservoirs from their bodies.","Our innovative work in conjunction with our many partners has already allowed our HIV medicines to reach millions of patients worldwide. We're particularly excited about the role that TAF will play. With a small daily dose and improved side effect profile, it is ideal for resource-constrained areas of the world and requires only one-tenth of the manufacturing capacity to supply the same number of patients.","In the area of viral hepatitis, the data now obtained with Epclusa suggests that we have an excellent option for the many parts of the developing world for genotyping HCV and determining the stage of disease can be difficult, if not impossible. With Epclusa, there's no difference in dosing for the different genotypes or stages of liver disease and so there's no need for these diagnostic procedures. We are working around the globe to rapidly introduce Epclusa as well as Sovaldi and Harvoni.","Finally, in hepatitis B, as Kevin and Norbert mentioned, we are approaching the launch of TAF. HBV continues to be an under-treated disease despite the long-term data showing improvement of liver for people who remain on effective therapy. TAF provides an important new option for patients with chronic HBV, and we'll have the opportunity to introduce the product at the Liver Meeting in the coming weeks in Boston.","We also recognize that treating such a prevalent disease chronically is a major global challenge, and we continue to seek ways to provide finite duration of treatment such that patients can control or eliminate the virus without having to endure a lifetime of treatment. Gilead's largest research effort is in the area of HBV cure.","Beyond our work in antivirals, we are making great progress in new disease areas for Gilead. We are pleased to be able to share with you today our top-line data for GS-4997 in NASH. GS-4997 targets ASK1, a previously unexplored target for NASH. The data are very suggestive of strong anti-fibrotic activity after only a 24-week period of treatment. And we look forward to future in-depth discussions once the data are presented at AASLD.","We think about GS-4997 as a potential backbone molecule, one that can be used alone or in combination. NASH is an understudied, but increasingly prevalent, disease. And Gilead's liver disease team now has three exciting molecules to move forward into clinical studies. We understand that there's a lot of work to do in providing both the rationale to the patient and to the payer as to the benefits of treating NASH. An active compound such as GS-4997 could really move this deal forward and we're in the process of designing comprehensive studies to demonstrate the health system benefits of treating such a prevalent and growing disease.","In the area of inflammation, we are executing nicely on our development plan. Phase III studies of filgotinib in RA are up and running, and studies in Crohn's and ulcerative colitis have just begun screening patients in the first of these studies. I'm pleased with the progress we are making and the work of our teams and collaborators to get these trials up and running as quickly as possible. We're also looking forward to exploratory studies of filgotinib in a wider variety of inflammatory diseases so we can fully understand the potential of this specific JAK1 inhibitor.","As you know, we are also focused on augmenting our portfolio with external opportunities, particularly in the field of oncology. However, our interest in partnerships and potential acquisitions is not limited to oncology, and we are considering opportunities where there is strong science and where we see the possibility of developing a truly differentiated product. We've been going through an extensive internal review of programs and opportunities, and an important aspect of our approach is that we remain open-minded, but disciplined. So while we have the balance sheet to execute on multiple opportunities, we will keep the bar high.","With two months of the year remaining, I want to take the opportunity to thank the 9,000 employees of Gilead for their hard work and dedication. Every day, more than 10 million individuals around the world take a Gilead medication and every day our teams come to work to improve upon that number.","Thank you for your time. And let's now open the call to questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Today's question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. And our first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. John or Kevin, I've got one for you. I just wanted to ask about hep C, but in a broader context. So you guys have had flat patient numbers despite better access in the U.S., and revenue is down sequentially, but on payer mix. So the question is, how do you think about the return on investing continually in hep C, either commercially or in new products, versus, say, looking outwards and being more aggressive in a new therapeutic category? Thanks.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hey, Geoff. It's Kevin. Let me just take maybe half a step back from your question and just a few more observations. I've got to tell you that I think we're really executing well in the area of hepatitis C. I've spent a lot of time this quarter with many Gileads and with several providers. And I think the variables that we can directly influence, we're really doing a good job on.","Our market share is staying incredibly strong. We're ensuring access whilst preserving the value of our hepatitis C drugs, and we're executing on new versions coming to the market. I think you've seen that with Epclusa. And the area that we can less control but we can influence, you're now seeing some new activities from us in terms of unbranded awareness campaigns. And you may have seen our advertisement that came on the television just over a week ago. So I think, from my point of view, in terms of operational excellence, we're doing a very nice job.","It is true that the treatments are staying about the same. Actually, I consider that very positive. Let's not forget that we're at treatment levels that are 2.5 times the treatment levels that were there before the Gilead regimens came to the market. So I take at the level of 50,000 to 60,000 patients as very good. The vast proportion of those are Gilead patients. Epclusa had a very big effect in this quarter, so it goes to show that there's still room for new patients, albeit that we're entering a high level of satisfaction. But with Harvoni for Genotype 1, both 12-weeks and now a high proportion at 8-weeks, and now Epclusa for the 2 and 3 patients. Yes, we have got patients being cured at very high levels.","In terms of our triple, I do agree that it'll be a relatively small proportion of patients, but it's the right thing to do and it completes our whole picture for hepatitis C. So I think to have the range of products that we have, to have the efficacy that we have, is the right offering for healthcare. So we continue to move forward and I think we have a healthy franchise. And we are getting better access from particularly the commercial payers, although, as I pointed out and I often discuss with the team here, the Medicaid is still a little bit on the slow side in terms of access. But great progress as far as I'm concerned in the third quarter.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Geoff, it's John. The second part of your question was something about investing in this area versus other areas. So I would say from a pipeline perspective, with SOF\/VEL\/VOX being our fourth generation of HCV product now being approved, there really isn't much left in terms of unmet medical need. And so from a pipeline perspective, this is really the end of what we'll be developing in terms of HCV molecules and that will allow us then to turn our attention to the important aspects in our fibrosis and NASH franchises and our oncology franchises. So we've really largely turned our attention away from HCV to those areas already.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Brian Abrahams of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Norbert, a question on 4997. Wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the go-forward plan there, particularly with respect to a potential Phase III trial duration, and whether or not a fibrosis endpoint might be acceptable, just given the effects that you saw in such a short time period in Phase II and the plan to target more severe progressive patients. And then can you confirm that there were no baseline imbalances in the Phase II that might have influenced the fibrosis data or progression to cirrhosis data? Thanks.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hi, Brian. So the second question, yes, I can confirm that there were no baseline imbalances. And regarding the Phase III study, no, we're going to make the proposal to regulatory authorities to use just fibrosis as the endpoint. We feel very convinced that that's the right thing to do because, as you may know, fibrosis is the only histological correlate to clinical outcomes.","There was a large study published a few years ago where they looked at baseline histology and they correlated histological variables with clinical outcomes. And steatosis didn't correlate, inflammation didn't correlate, ballooning didn't correlate. The only thing that correlated was fibrosis. So we are going to propose two Phase III studies, both looking at fibrosis 48-week as the endpoint.","The other thing we're going do with the studies, in F3, F4 patients, again, the rationale is that that's where the unmet need is. And also since ultimately for full approval you will need some clinical endpoint, we think we can get there much faster maybe with a 96-week study even if we start off with F4 patients. But having all of that said, this all has to be agreed upon by regulatory authorities. We have a date with the FDA, but we have not discussed this with them yet. So stay tuned. Some time early next year I think we can update you on the exact plan.","Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Thanks for taking the call. Sorry, I was on mute. Can I just ask \u2013 you made two comments related to HCV that I just want to get some more clarity on. You talked about that you're pleased with the 2017 payer cycle. Could you just tell us if we should expect any significant changes in pricing or not? And then can you describe what you think is the size of the Epclusa warehouse and if you think you've moved through that or you would expect to see more of that through the end of the year? Thanks.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hey, Matt. It's Kevin Young. I'll take your second part first. Yeah, there was a small warehousing effect. We think that \u2013 and this is anecdotal and qualitative, we think that providers probably held people for a quarter, two to three-month period. So this is nothing like the warehousing that we saw with Sovaldi or with Harvoni. So we think it's largely a Q3 effect. It might go into the fourth quarter, into the quarter now, but we really think it's mostly a 2016 effect.","In terms of our negotiations and contracts, I really can't make any specific comments. Obviously they're confidential. But we are pleased with the outcome. We feel we're in a strong position for 2017, and most providers will have very, very good access in the private and Medicaid, Medicare Part D setting to both Harvoni and Epclusa. So we think we're in good shape and our providers will have the Gilead options to look forward to giving to their patients as we have done in 2016. So feel good about that.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from John Scotti of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","John Scotti - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask one on capital allocation, if I may. So last quarter you spoke about potentially having a more complete story of internal and also external programs by year end, and you've continued to be relatively light on the buyback in 3Q. So a couple things. Can you characterize right now your current appetite for M&A and if that's changed the current thinking more along the lines of larger transformative deals? Or should we expect a string of in-licensing deals similar to what we saw with filgotinib and Nimbus? And how should we think about the sense of urgency here given your comments and going into year end? Thanks a lot.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hi, John. It's John. I think you asked a capital allocation questions and switched to strategy. We'll try to answer that for you. So as we said in our opening comments, we're still very actively evaluating opportunities. We're actively evaluating a series of different partnerships. But as I said in my comments, we're going to remain disciplined and we're going to keep the bar high.","You don't want the sense of urgency to overwhelm your discipline because then you'll do things that don't make long-term sense. And that's been the history in all businesses, and that's one we apply here. So we're currently very, very active. We'll do things when they make sense for us and not before then. And that's really as much as I can say.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges of Leerink Partners. Your line is now open.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you very much. Appreciate the question. Robin, just a couple for you, if we may. First, operating margin trending down by 200 basis points to 300 basis points a quarter. Is that something that we should anticipate continuing, or are there some variables in there?","Secondly, just on Epclusa. Was there any channel inventory build in the reported number? And then lastly, how are you judging the share buyback? You spent $10 billion, as you pointed out, this year, and the average cost is around $90. Compared to other things that you might have invested in, how are you feeling about that buyback going forward? Thanks.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Sure, Geoff. So I'll start on a reverse order and address the buyback first. We really look at buybacks on a long-term perspective, which is pretty much what I mentioned during the last quarter call. So we're still very comfortable where we are. We did front-load a significant component of our share buybacks. As a matter of fact, I think just in the first quarter we did more than the entire three quarters of 2015. And we messaged very early on that we would see those decline towards the second half of this year, very much in alignment with John's comments on being prepared for M&A.","It's still clearly part of our capital allocation strategy along with dividends. So I think balancing that with overall looking for growth is something that we're still focused on doing. And as John mentioned, these things take time to play themselves out.","I'll let Kevin answer the inventory question. But I think to your question of operating margins, yeah, the quarterization of our margins do get impacted by revenue dynamics as well as expenses. Keep in mind, R&D had a $200 milestone payment this quarter included that. Overall, I think our margins still remain high \u2013 high relative to overall industry, et cetera. And we're comfortable with them, we're very prudent with expense management. You saw SG&A expenses down.","I think the other thing you're slightly seeing is some mix changes between HCV and HIV. That has a little bit of an impact on our gross margins. But, overall, with the continued conversion of TAF, long term you'll continue to see that go down, but it will be impacted relative to HCV becoming a smaller component of our total revenue.","And I can't really give guidance on our gross margins, but I think the bar still remains high for them and we still remain a very disciplined spending type of organization.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yeah, Geoff, just to comment on Epclusa. If you recall, we launched Epclusa in the last week in quarter two. So that's when our opening inventory went in. Like any growing product, major wholesalers tick up their inventory basically because they've got a standard calculation for days on hand. So basically that just ticks up as a product grows, or indeed comes down as a product \u2013 comes down, as likely Sovaldi, because it's now becoming Epclusa, will in the future. So there was nothing unnatural about inventory for Epclusa in the third quarter. But as I said, we did get a very nice bump in usage from a small warehousing of patients.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks very much, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Corey Kasimov of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Good afternoon, guys. And thanks for taking my question. John, I wanted to go back to your comments on the strategic question you just got. When you talk about having a high bar in the M&A front, does that mean you see a lack of interesting opportunities out there that just don't meet that bar? Or is this more of a price disconnect given the continued volatility in the market? Thanks.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Discipline has both components to it. There are a number of things that I think are probably too early for us to take part in. There are a number of things that I think are just overpriced. And so it's been a combination of those two things looking backward. Going forward, we'll have to see what makes sense for us and where we're willing to go to bring in new products.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask a question on patient volumes in hep C, specifically as it relates to slide 41, I guess. Previously I would have thought that changes in payer access would have opened up the availability of these drugs to get reimbursed for the healthier F0s and F1s. I guess with patient volumes flattish, are you seeing these F0s and F1s coming in, are they getting treated? Or is your bottleneck there? They come in and they don't get treated? Just wanted to understand your dynamic on that and whether you think that that's going to drive some positive development of volumes.","And then in Europe the same question. Europe declined from 27,000 down to 21,000. How do you think that plays out I guess going forward? What are the dynamics there for volumes? Thanks so much.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hi, Michael. Two great questions. Let me try to deal with those in the order. So the first the U.S. If you look at our slide, actually the percentage of F0s to F2s has increased over time. It was sort of 50% a little while ago, and now it's up to 60%. So, clearly, a fitter patient, they're less sick, are being treated. And of course, that's as a result of coverage.","But I want to say that the patient journey, I think, is becoming longer in the U.S. now. If you think about it, patients really are starting further back because they are healthier. We are continuing to see approximately 30,000 patients coming into specialist care, so in other words, 90,000 patients a quarter. 60,000 of those are coming out of the other side and are being treated and cured. That's probably not a bad ratio in itself.","Not every patient is treated and not every patient is immediately treated. Now, we shouldn't forget that sometimes patients drift in and out of specialist care. Some patients have compounding factors that complicate the start of therapy, most notably, drug use or alcohol use. And the patients who are just less sick have less motivation themselves and the physician has less motivation to really push those sort of therapy.","And lastly, the paperwork and the administrative process for authorization is still there, like it is with any specialist product. So I think those are mostly the dynamics and it's mostly around the patient being less time in the physician's practice. They're not patients that have been held for a long time. They're not patients that failed one or two prior therapies and a great urgency by the physician.","In terms of Europe, as I said, we did see a down tick in the patients treated in the Southern European markets, primarily Italy and Spain. And I think that's because they are working through the sicker patients and becoming more like France and Germany. There still are more patients in the Southern European markets, but I do think they are clearing the most obvious patients to treat and cure.","And I want to emphasize that market share has stayed very, very solid in those markets. And whilst there's not an obvious mechanism through advertising, television advertising, in the European markets, we are doing a lot of partnership with KOLs, with societies, with patient groups, to again try to encourage the right screening practices and the right transfer of patients into specialist care.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas of Citi. Your line is now open.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thank you for the question. So just to ask the HCV question from a fourth quarter and payer perspective. I remember last fourth quarter, you started to see hints of changes in HCV. So given it looks like the U.S. has stabilized, are you seeing anything that hints that payers could change how they're viewing hep C, or any changes in fourth quarter that you're seeing that could influence 2017?","And then given you maintained guidance, how are you thinking now about providing \u2013 what kinds of guidance you might provide in 2017 to help investors feel comfortable that you can predict going forward? I know you can't give guidance, but can you give any hints on how you're thinking about giving us some color next year? Thanks.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hi, Robyn. I'll take the first part. I think, again, come back to the quality of the discussions that we had for 2017 contracting. And I think they were very good. Let's not forget the fact that Gilead are in a very strong place by virtue of our Harvoni being in a good proportion of patients in eight-week therapy. So it's a very big advantage for us and I think that's really appreciated from the point of view of managing costs from a commercial payer.","We didn't see much change in the ratio of the public to private payer in the third quarter. It was still about 45% of patients who were covered as a public patient as opposed to a commercial or Medicare Part D plan. Part of the commercial part of the market is, of course, the VA. The VA was a little bit lower in the third quarter versus the second quarter. They still seem to be very enthusiastic, very engaged in recalling patients. But I think that's perhaps one of the variables that will unfold in 2017 is the VA and their continuing ability to recall and treat patients.","But I think with our efforts around highlighting the CDC and need to treat the Baby Boomers and the activity of all the companies involved in hepatitis C, I'd like to think that we can continue our progress in 2017.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","So Robyn, it's Robin. I'll take the second part of that question. I think, as we said, this is a curative market, HCV, and it's difficult to predict. And Kevin just outlined this patient journey taking a longer bit of time and just changing dynamics. And we spent a lot of time this fall working through the planning cycle, figuring out what that means around 2017 and beyond.","Obviously, I can't give the answer yet, but how we guide will again depend on our ability to bracket the risk and opportunities around those dynamics and what those mean. It continues to change and it's something that we monitor very closely. But that patient flow, as Kevin said, is something that's just very difficult for us to control.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yeah, I'd also add, Robin, if I might, how solid and good we feel about HIV going into next year with that chronic model and the uptick of our TAF-based regimens.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ying Huang of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one maybe is for Kevin. Our channel checks indicated that VA is paying about $15,000 to $17,000 per patient. Do you think that's the absolute floor for HCV pricing?","And then another question for John and Robin. Sounds like you guys have a really high bar for acquisitions. If you don't deploy capital in acquisitions, would you consider hiking dividends to a much higher level, like 5% to 6%, so that a lot of investors would be willing to take this off a (1:01:21) dividend payment? Thank you.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hi, Ying. It's Kevin. I apologize, but in terms of commenting on our net pricing to the various channels, to the various constituents, it's not something that we directly comment on, so I couldn't go any further than that at this time.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yeah, Ying. And I'll take the second half. As we said, the bar is high, but we're very engaged and remain engaged in M&A. When we think about our overall capital allocation, we wouldn't want to do anything that would constrain us and reduce our flexibility to purchase if we found something that we thought could really grow our top line. So we talk with our board all the time about dividend increases and dividends in general as well as share repurchases, and that's something that we'll continue to do.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Phil Nadeau of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. And unfortunately it's another one on HCV pricing for you, Kevin. You mentioned two factors that impact the average per patient price that have been changing. One is the public versus private payer mix, which you said changed over the last year, but maybe stabilized now, and then also the rebates given to private payers. You didn't really discuss those too much on this call, but in the past your predecessor said that he expected the rebates to actually increase when Merck entered the market next year. Some of your comments today could suggest the opposite.","So I guess just curious for 2017, how should we think about those two factors? Do you think public versus private has plateaued? Is 45% the number we should be thinking about for 2017? And then on the rebates to the private payers, should we continue to expect those to tick up in 2017? Or is your feeling different now that you've gone through the negotiation cycles? Thanks.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Difficult for me to comment in any great detail, Phil, on either of those questions. I'll take the commercial first. They have gone well. As I keep emphasizing, the advantage we have in eight weeks \u2013 think about it. 45% right now of Harvoni patients, genotype 1 patients, are receiving eight weeks. So if you think about 45% of genotype 1 with just that eight weeks, that's a very good economic offering for our payers that they really appreciate. So I believe we've done very well in our position going into 2017.","In terms of the ratio between public and private, again, very difficult for me to make a prediction. VA did come down a little bit, but there was an increase, just a tick up, to replace that by Medicaid. I made the comment that the Medicaid opening is really slower than we would like, but I think there may be that change in mix going forward.","Difficult to predict VA. VA is still a big part of the public, and we'll just have to see. It's very impressive what they've done and I know they're very committed and they feel that they haven't done their job yet. We, and that's Gilead, will estimate that between 35% and 40% of patients in the VA system have been treated to date. So still a lot of work to do and I think they want to do it. So 45%, 55%, seems to have been the level for the last couple quarters and not entirely clear if that's going to be maintained into 2017. But seems reasonable to me.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks helpful. Thanks for taking the question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Alethia Young of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to talk a little bit about Genvoya launch, maybe how it's faster than even the Atripla launch, which obviously a very good launch. Maybe if you can just frame how doctors are looking at this. Are they looking at it more as just for everyone that comes to the doctor, they just go and get this drug? Or just give us some more flavor on the dynamics. Thanks.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hey, Alethia. Thanks for an HIV question. I really appreciate it. Alethia, I was at our International Advisory Board a couple of weeks ago, and we had some of the foremost HIV doctors from around the world. And it was absolutely unanimous the commitment to switching patients. All things being equal, particularly in terms of pricing, physicians see the benefit in terms of bone and kidney from the point of view of TAFs. So I think there's an awful strong commitment.","Let's not forget that in most practices now, half the patients are over the age of 50 and they've been on long-term therapy and physicians just see a natural and fairly straightforward switch going on. I really didn't think I'd ever see an uptake quicker than Atripla. As you remember, there were the components of Atripla that could just be put together and the patient switched. These are slightly different with Genvoya because it's a switch of regimen.","So I'm delighted with the way it's going. 80% of Genvoya comes from switches, and right now half of those switches are from Striva, (1:07:38) which is the natural TDF-to-TAF switch. So my expectation is that we'll continue to convert patients. I'm super enthusiastic about it. And once we get more countries online in Europe, I think we can have that same expectation. Germany's going great. Spain's going great. And we're on the threshold of getting the most important market up and running, and that's France.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just wondering if you guys can comment on the GSK ViiV doublets for HIV. Maybe just help frame for us how to think about that if those are successful in either treatment or maintenance setting. Would you look to explore your own doublet regiment, or do you think you've already set a high enough bar there? Thank you.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Terence, the debate in with bictegravir is not doublet or triplet. We're developing bictegravir F\/TAF because it has three excellent components that have proven safety and enormously high efficacy. If you look at the ViiV Triumeq compound, of course that continues abacavir. So in that scenario, there is an incentive to get rid of abacavir and go to a doublet, as you call it. But in our case, we have no incentive whatsoever to do that.","I would like to point out it's an interesting strategy. It's a potential competitor. The only thing I would like to point out, the safety efficacy has to be still proven in a larger patient population, number one, and, number two, in a more diverse patient population, particularly in patients with high viral load.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ian Somaiya of BMO Capital Markets. You line is now open.","M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks for taking my question. Just a question for you maybe, Robin, on just R&D spend going forward. The filgotinib program, Phase III programs, may in aggregate cost about $1 billion. You're about to embark on a fairly sizable NASH program. Just how should we think about R&D spend going forward? Are there any files that are completing that might provide an offset? Just if you could give us some color related to that.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yeah. So maybe, Ian, I'm going to answer the first question and Robin can join in. So as we indicated before, our hepatitis C research is winding down or the development is winding down. Really with this SOF\/VEL\/VOX, this will be our last development candidate. And we have spent over the last three years probably most of our money on hepatitis C, so that's winding down. And also on HIV coming down because bictegravir F\/TAF is going to be our last single-tablet regimen for a broad patient population. And that I think will offset the increased spending in the other areas, as you pointed out, filgotinib and also oncology.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yeah. I think Norbert summed it up, Ian. I'd only add that I think the rigor remains very internally high within Gilead as well. We're always making the various trade-offs. And we look to do the right thing scientifically, so you could see variably in cost. But overall, there's still a high bar internal relative to how we allocate our research spend. But a lot of our projects ongoing, as mentioned, will be paid for with a decline in some of the larger products we've had with HIV and HCV.","Operator","Thank you.

Please go ahead, sir.","Patrick O'Brien - Senior Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Candice, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market close today we issued a press release with the details of our earnings results for the third quarter of 2015. The press release and detailed slides are available in the Investor Relations section of the Gilead Sciences website.","The speakers on today's call will be: John Martin, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Carter, Executive Vice President of Commercial Operations; and Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Also in the room with us for the Q&A session are John Milligan, President and Chief Operating Officer, and Norbert Bischofberger, Executive Vice President of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer.","Before we begin our formal remarks, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including plans and expectations with respect to our products, product candidates, and financial projections, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks, and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements.

Martin - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Patrick, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Paul and Robin will address commercial and financial highlights in just a moment.","I would like to first comment on some of the significant progress we have made on our drug development programs during the quarter. First, as you are aware, three NDAs and marketing authorization applications for TAF-based regimens for the treatment of HIV are currently under review by FDA and European Medicines Agency, which could lead to approval of three new products in the next six months.","The PDUFA date for the first TAF-based regimen E\/C\/F\/TAF, or GENVOYA, is next week on November 5. In September the European CHMP adopted a positive opinion on the Marketing Authorization Application for GENVOYA, and the final regulatory decision is expected by the European Commission by the end of this year.","Our second TAF containing product, F\/TAF, has been assigned a PDUFA date of April 7, 2016. And in the EU, a CHMP opinion could be adopted in the first quarter of 2016. F\/TAF met its primary 48-week objective in an ongoing Phase 3 study conducted among 663 HIV-infected virologically suppressed adults who were randomized to either maintain their TRUVADA-based regimen or switch to an F\/TAF-based regimen. At week 48 the F\/TAF-based regimen and the TRUVADA-based regimens achieved similar rates of virologic suppression based on the proportion of patients with HIV RNA of less than 50 copies per mL. The safety profile of F\/TAF was consistent with that observed in previous TAF studies, including improvements in bone and renal laboratory parameters.","Marketing Authorization Applications for R\/F\/TAF were submitted in the U.S. and the EU in July. FDA assigned a PDUFA date of March 1, 2016, and a European Commission decision is expected in the second half of 2016. The application is supported by data on the use of R\/F\/TAF for the treatment of HIV infection in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older.","Finally, we are investigating two additional TAF-based single-tablet regimens: TAF emtricitabine, and GS-9883, Gilead's proprietary integrase inhibitor, for which we'll initiate Phase 3 studies this quarter; and TAF emtricitabine\/cobicistat and Janssen's darunavir D\/C\/F\/TAF, which is being developed and will be commercialized by Janssen.","HIV patients are living longer, thus facing additional health challenges to those experienced by newly diagnosed patients a decade ago. Our teams at Gilead and the healthcare community overall are motivated to continue improving on existing treatment options. The need for efficacy together with improved long-term safety has driven Gilead's development programs and the design of the studies we have completed and those that are planned. We look forward to introducing this new generation of F\/TAF single-tablet regimens that we have created to address the evolving needs of people living with HIV.","TAF is also being evaluated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. Data from two Phase 3 trials may be available before the end of the year, with regulatory submissions expected in the first quarter of 2016.","Moving to prevention of HIV infection, there is a clear and growing enthusiasm for PrEP. WHO issued new guidelines that will significantly increase the number of people who are eligible to receive TRUVADA for PrEP. We continue to work across multiple fronts to help ensure that TRUVADA for PrEP is used safely and appropriately as part of a comprehensive strategy to prevent HIV transmission and preserve health.","Turning to HCV, one of the biggest achievements we have made as a company relates to the manufacturing of our NS5A inhibitors, ledipasvir and velpatasvir. API production is complex and involves multiple novel steps. Both molecules are high molecular weight compounds that need to be spray-dried in order to improve their oral absorption. We have increased production capacity around the world to meet the unprecedented demand for our HCV therapies, and this continues to be a focus as we bring forward the next generation of pan-genotypic fixed-dose combinations to patients around the world.","Last month we announced positive top line results from four international Phase 3 ASTRAL studies evaluating our fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir, or GS-5816, for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C across genotype 1 through genotype 6. The ASTRAL study results demonstrate that a 12-week course of therapy with the first fixed-dose combination of two pan-genotypic compounds can provide high cure rates for patients across HCV genotype 1 through genotype 6.","Sofosbuvir and velpatasvir has been granted accelerated assessment in the EU, potentially shorten the review period by four months. We expect to file for regulatory approval in the United States in the coming weeks. The detailed results from these Phase 3 ASTRAL studies and other data will be presented at the annual AASLD [American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases] meeting, which will commence on November 13 in San Francisco. More than 70 Gilead program-related abstracts have been accepted, highlighting the scientific progress across our liver disease pipeline, including HCV, HBV, NASH, and PSC.","Finally, we received European approval on several supplemental new drug applications for HARVONI that expand the indicated use to include HCV\/HIV co-infected patients, advanced liver disease and post-liver transplant recipients, and patients who have previously failed treatment on a sofosbuvir-based regimen. In the U.S., we are awaiting FDA action on our application to expand the indicated use of HARVONI to include HCV\/HIV co-infected patients, patients with genotype 4, genotype 5, or genotype 6, and treatment-experienced and cirrhotic patients. A decision from FDA for each of these sNDAs is expected by November 13. Another sNDA was filed on August 28 to expand the indicated use of HARVONI in the U.S. to include advanced liver disease and post-liver transplant patients.","In the area of cardiovascular disease, on October 2 FDA approved the use of LETAIRIS in combination with tadalafil for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension [PAH] to reduce the risk of disease progression and hospitalization for worsening PAH and to improve exercisability. The new labeling is supported by data from the AMBITION study. In this clinical trial, first-line treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension with the combination of LETAIRIS and tadalafil reduced the risk of disease progression by nearly 50% compared to either therapy individually.","This combination represents a new treatment strategy for patients living with this debilitating and life-threatening disease. Our partner GlaxoSmithKline, which commercializes LETAIRIS outside the United States, announced on Friday that the CHMP granted a positive opinion to expand the indication for Volibris, as ambrisentan is known in Europe in combination treatment for PAH.","Lastly, I wanted to mention our work on Ebola. In the summer of 2014, news of an Ebola outbreak consumed the world, with the virus infecting approximately 30,000 and killing almost half of those individuals. Commerce, travel, and healthcare systems around the world were impacted. At that time, our scientists had engaged in an extensive evaluation of nucleotides with activity against RNA viruses. We were able to quickly select GS-5734 as a candidate for development. All necessary IND-enabling studies were completed, and we initiated a clinical trial in healthy volunteers in August of this year to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of the drug.","In parallel, convincing efficacy data obtained from studies in Ebola-infected animals were presented at the IDWeek meeting earlier this month in San Diego, showing full protection of animals treated up to three days after infection with a lethal dose of the Ebola virus. As you may know, Royal Free Hospital in the UK announced last week that they dosed a relapsing Ebola-infected patient with GS-5734 following a request to Gilead for compassionate access. This is another example of how individuals at Gilead take initiative to address unmet medical needs.","I will now turn the call over to Paul Carter to provide a commercial update.","Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President-Commercial Operations","Thank you, John.","I'm very pleased to provide an update on our commercial performance, which in the third quarter generated $8.2 billion in worldwide net product sales. U.S. product revenue reached $5.6 billion, which was in line with the prior quarter and up 33% compared to $4.2 billion for the same period in 2014. European product revenue reached $1.7 billion, which is down 15% sequentially from the second quarter, mainly reflecting expected summer seasonality, but up 17% on a year-over-year basis despite absorbing a negative 11% foreign exchange movement. For the rest of the world, which includes Japan, product revenues were $958 million.","Beginning with hepatitis C, we continue to be pleased with the number of patients we are reaching with SOVALDI and HARVONI, which are now approved in 57 and 44 countries respectively. Total HCV revenue for the third quarter was $4.8 billion, a 2% decrease over the second quarter and a 70% increase year over year. In the U.S. HCV product revenue totaled $3.2 billion, with HARVONI representing more than $2.5 billion of that amount. We saw a gradual downward trend in demand for the retail market during the third quarter but less so in the non-retail sector, largely due to increased spending by the VA.","Since the beginning of the year approximately 190,000 U.S. HCV patients started on treatment on a Gilead product. This represents a Gilead market share of more than 90% of HCV patients, reflecting the positively differentiated profile of HARVONI in particular. In fact, HARVONI and SOVALDI continue to perform well in real-world settings, with safety, tolerability, and cure rates comparing favorably to those observed in our clinical studies. Several of these real-world data sets will be presented at the upcoming AASLD conference in San Francisco.","That being said, payer restrictions, including eligibility criteria based on fibrosis score or other patient characteristics, still remain to varying degrees. We expect those restrictions could lessen over time as patient volumes become more predictable and payers recognize the benefits of treating less sick patients earlier and further benefiting from the value of just eight weeks treatment for many GT-1 patients.","As I commented last quarter, we saw an unusually large number of patient starts in the U.S. in the first quarter of this year, which reflected the rapid access to treatment for many warehouse patients. It is clear that the number of warehouse patients has now diminished. We anticipate that the rate at which new patients start treatment at the end of this year may be more indicative of the pace of new patient starts in 2016.","Turning to Europe, HCV revenue was approximately $870 million this quarter, with around 80,000 patients beginning treatment with HARVONI or SOVALDI since the start of the year. We saw strong demand for HARVONI, particularly in recently launched markets like Spain and Italy. In early launch markets like Germany, which as in the U.S. saw an initial large spike in warehouse treatments in the first few months after launch, we are now seeing a lower but more predictable and consistent level of patient starts.","In the UK, we're delighted that NICE, the government's health technology assessment agency, issued its final appraisal determination for HARVONI. NICE has found HARVONI to be cost effective and recommends that the National Health Service fund HARVONI to treat the majority of adult patients with HCV genotype 1 and genotype 4 in England and Wales.","On the reimbursement front, we have recently received expanded approvals in Austria and Sweden. We also received broad approval in the Netherlands and Poland during the quarter and will launch SOVALDI and HARVONI in both countries next month.","Looking ahead in Europe, we anticipate that our HCV revenues will be constrained by country-specific budgets rather than the number of patients in need of treatment. We will continue to work hard to educate governments and other groups about the benefit of diagnosing and treating HCV-infected people as early as possible.","Turning to Japan, we are very pleased with the execution of the launches of our two HCV products. HCV revenues for the third quarter were $454 million. Since the launches of SOVALDI in May and HARVONI in September, through the end of the quarter we have generated sales of approximately $515 million in Japan. The Japanese Society of Hepatology has recently updated HCV treatment guidelines to reflect HARVONI as well as SOVALDI in combination with ribavirin as first choice in treatment for patients with genotype 1 and genotype 2 respectively.","To conclude my comments on HCV, we recognize that there remains a huge unmet medical need around the world and that just a small fraction of diagnosed patients have been treated so far, even in the early launch markets. A key objective for Gilead moving forward is to bring diagnosed and undiagnosed patients into care. It's clear that governments, healthcare systems, policy makers, payers, patients, and healthcare advocacy groups recognize the opportunity to treat many more people now that we have simple, safe, and highly effective medicines for HCV. We're working together with them on a number of fronts, with the aim of bringing all diagnosed yet untreated patients into care over time while recognizing capacity and budget constraints.","We're also working on programs to encourage more screening and increase the level of diagnosis and subsequent linkage to care. This is akin to the work we have done over the years with HIV in both the most developed and the poorest countries, where step by step we have seen great progress. Today we have Gilead teams around the world focused on collaborating with these diverse groups and supporting their efforts towards a long-term ambitious goal of controlling and possibly eliminating HCV. Indeed, we have several collaborations in different countries and different settings that aim to demonstrate that upscaled HCV intervention and treatment can be highly impactful to individuals and public healthcare systems.","In conclusion, we see progress, encouraging trends, and remain highly confident in the long-term sustainability of the HCV market in the United States, Europe, Japan, and many other countries around the world.","Now turning to HIV, this quarter revenues increased 7% year on year to $2.9 billion, as our TRUVADA-based franchise continues to hold its market leadership position. In the U.S., revenues were more than $1.9 billion for the third quarter, a 16% increase from a year ago. Underlying prescription demand remains strong for both STRIBILD and COMPLERA, with year-on-year growth of 44% and 14% respectively. During the quarter, seven out of 10 patients initiated treatment with a Gilead regimen. HIV revenue growth also benefited from renewed purchasing from the VA and a slight increase in wholesaler inventory.","In Europe, HIV revenues were $715 million for the quarter, down 4% from Q2 and 12% year over year, due to foreign exchange impacts and mandatory price cuts. However, prescription volume growth remains strong. EVIPLERA and STRIBILD are the number one and number two treatments respectively for treatment-naive patients in the five largest markets in Europe. These single-tablet regimens are maintaining strong franchise share in the face of competition.","Looking to the future of HIV, John already gave a detailed account of where we stand on the regulatory front in bringing our TAF-based treatments to market. And I can say that the Gilead commercial organization is focused on ensuring a successful launch. We're excited about and prepared for the launch of GENVOYA, or E\/C\/F\/TAF, as early as next week.","In closing, we are very pleased with the commercial results for the third quarter, and I'll now turn the call over to Robin.","Robin L. Washington - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone.","We are pleased to report third quarter results, with non-GAAP diluted EPS of $3.22 per share for the third quarter, up 75% year over year. Total revenues were $8.3 billion, up 37% year over year. Net product sales for the third quarter were $8.2 billion, up 38% year over year, driven by the launch of HARVONI across various geographies, continued growth of SOVALDI outside the U.S., driven primarily by Japan, and increased sales of our newer HIV single-tablet regimen. U.S. net product revenues during the quarter have benefited from strong VA purchases following allocation by Congress of $500 million in additional funds for HCV treatment.","Non-GAAP product gross margin was 90% for the third quarter of 2015 compared to 87% for the same quarter of 2014. Gross margin benefited from changes in product mix, including a year-over-year decline in ATRIPLA sales, which have a lower margin, and an increase in HCV product sales.","Turning to expenses, non-GAAP R&D expenses were $713 million for the third quarter, up 22% compared to the prior year due to the continued progression of our clinical studies, particularly our HIV TAF-based programs. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $850 million for the third quarter, down 4% compared to the prior year, primarily due to a cumulative catch-up of the branded prescription drug fee in the same quarter last year, partially offset by higher expenses associated with the growth of our business, including our commercial expansion to support our HCV products.","Turning to our balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with $25.1 billion in cash and investments, a sequential increase of $10.4 billion. During the third quarter we issued $10 billion of senior unsecured notes and generated cash flow from operations of $4.1 billion. The approximately $1.6 billion sequential decline in operating cash flow is due to the timing of cash payments related to current liabilities, which include rebates associated with HARVONI sales. Recall that during our Q1 earnings call, I mentioned that unpaid rebates associated with the launch of HARVONI may impact future cash flows as they are paid out.","We continue returning capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. During the quarter we repurchased 28 million shares for $3.1 billion. As of September 30, we had $11.1 billion remaining under our current share repurchase plan and remain active in purchasing shares. Through our repurchase program, we have reduced our diluted shares outstanding to 1.5 billion. Shareholders received a cash dividend of $626 million in September, and this afternoon we announced our Q4 2015 quarterly cash dividend of $0.43 per share. In total, in the first nine months of 2015, we have returned more than $8 billion in cash to shareholders in the forms of dividends and share repurchases. Including our Q2 2015 warrant settlement of $3.9 billion, total cash returns to shareholders have exceeded $12 billion year to date.","Finally, in regard to full-year 2015 guidance, which is outlined on slide 45 of the earnings deck, we are increasing our net product revenue guidance, and now expect product sales to be in the range of $30 billion to $31 billion. All other components of our 2015 guidance remain unchanged.","In summary, Gilead had another successful quarter. We believe our strong financial position and our future cash flows provide us with financial flexibility and support our pipeline growth and take advantage of external opportunities as they may arise.","Thank you, and we look forward to updating you on our progress during our next call. We would now like to open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Mark Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me have the first question. I really appreciate it. And, John Martin, it was nice to see you a couple weeks ago in California.","I wanted to ask about GS-9883. Maybe you talked a little bit about this in the prepared. I had to hop on and off. But it looks like that has been accelerated. This is the unboosted integrase inhibitor. It looks like that's been accelerated. I looked back at your slide deck from last quarter and you were just talking about viewing the Phase 2 data around the end of the year. So I was wondering if you could talk about that product. What gave you the confidence to move into Phase 3 because this is obviously transformative to the HIV business once you combine it with TAF? And what is the IP on GS-9883? When should we model a loss of exclusivity for GS-9883? Thank you.","Norbert W. Bischofberger, PhD - Executive Vice President, Research and Development & Chief Scientific Officer","So, Mark, I'll answer the first question. So we have Phase 2 data. We had discussions with FDA. They have accepted our plan, so it will be two studies. One will be, as we call it, a single variable experiment, so we compare GS-9883 to dolutegravir in the background of F\/TAF. And the other one will be a double variable experiment. We'll compare the two single-tablet regimens, so TRIUMEQ versus GS-9883 F\/TAF single-tablet regimen. And so we hope to enroll the study by the end of this year, so it's all...","Patrick O'Brien - Senior Director-Investor Relations","Start enrollment.","Norbert W. Bischofberger, PhD - Executive Vice President, Research and Development & Chief Scientific Officer","Start enrollment, so it's all fast forward.","Mark Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","And the IP?","John F. Milligan, PhD - President & Chief Operating Officer","Mark, it's a good question. We're scrambling right now because I don't have that one in front of me. So it's a fairly recent invention from Gilead.","Mark Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Okay.","John F. Milligan, PhD - President & Chief Operating Officer","So I think it's pretty far out there, but we'll get that number out for you as soon as we can.","Mark Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","And the plan is to combine this with TAF and whatever, and you would have a single-tablet regimen unboosted, with the most desirable new TAF through presumably 3030 or so?","John F. Milligan, PhD - President & Chief Operating Officer","Correct.","Mark Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","2030.","John F. Milligan, PhD - President & Chief Operating Officer","Not 3030, yes.","Mark Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Okay, I'll let everybody else ask about HCV.","John F. Milligan, PhD - President & Chief Operating Officer","But you're correct. It's going to be an STR. And because of the amount of API, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in that tablet, it's in fact going to be one of the smaller STRs available, and we're quite excited about it.","Norbert W. Bischofberger, PhD - Executive Vice President, Research and Development & Chief Scientific Officer","It's smaller than a single-tablet regimen, yes.","John F. Milligan, PhD - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yes.","Mark Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","And does this compound have any known advantages over the current unboosted integrase out there that you're willing to talk about? And then I'll stop.","Norbert W. Bischofberger, PhD - Executive Vice President, Research and Development & Chief Scientific Officer","Mark, I'm not sure clinically if it will have any advantages. It has some slight advantages over in vitro if systems proved out.","Mark Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Thank you, Norbert. Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you, and the next question comes from Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good afternoon, guys, good quarter and thanks for taking the question. I've asked this before on hep C, but is there anything you guys can do to further incentivize payers to cure more F0-F1? I look at the fibrosis data on slide 25, and it looks to be going the wrong way when you compare that to Q1 or Q2. And a related question, just from last week, given label changes from your competitor, do you guys anticipate going back to payers if formulary status for HARVONI or SOVALDI wasn't as favorable? Thanks.","Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President-Commercial Operations","Hi, Geoff. So on the first question, we still see, as you recognize in the chart, very high levels of restrictions still through F0 and F1 patients, and we see this in a formal way in the contracts that we're working with. But we also see it qualitatively when we talk to doctors where, dependent on insurance company, doctors I think in some cases don't even bother to write prescriptions because they know they're going to be rejected. And we do see the rejection rates, and some of them are quite high. But I think we just need to keep encouraging our partners to try and treat earlier and consider treating less sick patients.","And I think as we see these patient flows \u2013 and this is pretty much the same answer I gave last time as well, I'm afraid \u2013 but as we see patient flows begin to stabilize and become more predictable, that does work better with the payers and the PBMs' models. So again, I hope that will encourage them to consider treating people earlier. And of course finally, they do get much better value, especially for the less sick GT-1 patients if they treat for eight weeks. So we hope all of that will continue to encourage them, but it is a bit frustrating, I agree with you.","John F. Milligan, PhD - President & Chief Operating Officer","Geoff, the second part of your question is will the label update from our competitor allow us to go back in the contracts, and I would say that's really not the philosophy here. I think people who are choosing between us and the competitor have to make decisions on behalf of the plans, their ability to pay, and the patients that they want to treat. And it would really be up to them to look at the level of access that they want to give, because frankly, the 2016 contracts are all in place. Those have been negotiated, and the payer \u2013 it's really \u2013 we've left it up to them to determine the level of access that they would want to give to us versus them, and as Paul pointed out, also the level of access they're willing to give to patients with lower fibrosis scores. So I'm sure every new data set that comes out allows them to rethink a position. But from where we are right now, I don't see any major changes occurring.","Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President-Commercial Operations","Maybe I can just add to on that. We are very happy, as I mentioned in the script, that plenty of real-world data sets are coming out and really do I think hopefully give payers the confidence that investing in relatively expensive medicines is worthwhile because of the cure rates and the tolerability and safety profile. So the more real-world data sets that come out, we hope that will be encouraging. And finally, yet again I'd take the opportunity to say that Gilead believes in making sure that prescriptions are in the hands of physicians and their patients and not forced upon them by exclusive contracts. So all of that we hope will encourage perhaps a rethink.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got you. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Roden of UBS. Your line is now open.","Matt M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC","Great, thanks very much for taking the question; congrats on a nice quarter here. Paul, you mentioned bringing the undiagnosed into care. We've seen some data that's showing pilot screening projects by various public and private parties that has increased the identification of undiagnosed patients and the linkage to care. So I guess the question is how is the screening effort going to be handled going forward? How is it going to be scaled up? And do you see any tangible evidence that the screening has brought more patients into care over the past year? And then lastly, I think the Department of Health and Human Services wants to get to 66% of the U.S. hep C population diagnosed by 2020. Do you think that's achievable? Thanks.","Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President-Commercial Operations","We are very, very busy behind the scenes. In fact, we just had a conference here locally last week with a number of partners that we're working with. We have a program called FOCUS. We have partners with about 100 different external organizations across I think 18 cities so far across the U.S. And the objective here is increasing diagnosis with various programs around screening and then importantly linkage to care. And there's a whole list of programs that we've been hearing about their initial work. One of the things that is quite surprising I think to everyone is that the levels of prevalence, albeit in fairly high targeted areas, have been way higher than people anticipated, so roughly double in fact the numbers that people have expected.","As for the DHHS question, I can't really comment on that. But there is a lot of work going on out there and because I think of the simplicity of the treatments and the very high levels of SVRs we're seeing, people are getting more and more encouraged to address the problem.","Matt M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, thanks. Following up on some hep C, on slide 25 where you nicely break out the scripts which I think are written, can you take that a little bit further and maybe quantify what you think are the breakdown of fibrosis for scripts filled? Is that primarily all F3\/F4? And I guess to further move beyond that, what are the one or two or three things you're trying to work with the payers and trying to understand? I guess John said that he didn't really expect it to change anytime soon. So should we expect to continue the current trends that we're seeing with U.S. scripts as they are, and where do you think that bottoms out to? Thanks.","Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President-Commercial Operations","So the slides you're looking at, the top right-hand corner is the fibrosis scores. And I just want to emphasize the title on the top here. This is intent to treat. So essentially, this is prescriptions that are written but not necessarily filled. And what we do know is that although it suggests that half the scripts are F0 through F2, we know that a lot, probably the majority of those F0 through F1 at least are not being filled, certainly by some of the payers who are easy to identify. In the F2 area, it's a borderline situation. We know this quantitatively. But again, we also know it qualitatively through our sales force and their interactions with physicians, where it's still quite hard work to get F2 patients through the prior authorization process and time consuming and bureaucratic. So it's a situation that's frustrating for everyone.","As I said in my comments just a couple of minutes ago, I think that as we see treatment flows becoming more predictable, as we see more real-world data with the products building a higher level of confidence, that SVR rates and safety profiles are good, that we hope that payers will start to relax criteria around fibrosis scores and other patient characteristics that we've seen acting as barriers to treatment. And we will continue, as we have done and will do, to talk closely with our payer partners and try and encourage them to treat more people and reduce these barriers to treatment.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Abrahams of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC","Hi, thanks for taking my question and congrats on a nice quarter. You recently reported some promising data for the SOF\/VEL regimen, including in genotype 2 and genotype 3. I'm wondering. How should we be viewing this as a potential revenue expander in those genotypes? Should we think about that regimen as potentially increasing market share because of its better convenience, you guys potentially having better pricing power because you're eliminating the ribavirin component, or is it more likely to be positioned as really a defense against competitive entrants going forward? Thanks.","John F. Milligan, PhD - President & Chief Operating Officer","Thanks, Brian, it's John Milligan. So just to be clear, so when we thought about this product, we thought about it being a better alternative medically for patients with genotype 2 through genotype 6, and that includes some patients in the United States, but the vast majority of patients who fall in that category are of course outside the United States. With HARVONI maintaining its place in genotype 1 particularly because, as Paul was alluding to, we have such a very strong safety data set now on HARVONI, including over 600,000 patients who have been treated with SOVALDI now in various forms; the fact that we have the eight-week option for patients, which provides quite a savings for the appropriate patient, and as you've seen, very high cure rates in real-world settings at that eight-week regimen.","So I do think there are going to be some patients who would benefit from the shortening of duration, not having to go to 24 weeks in some cases, not having to have ribavirin in other cases, and allowing us to then have a very good option for those patients genotype 2 through genotype 6. I don't think there's a big warehouse effect of patients waiting for that, but I do think this provides a very important option for patients who would want a pan-genotypic option and for doctors who may not be able to genotype as effectively. And so I think it's a very important breakthrough for us and will allow us to continue the longevity of the franchise more so than provide any sort of bolus effect up front.","Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC","That very helpful, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Obviously, M&A has been and continues to be a big topic of conversation. However, given the volatility in the markets since your last quarterly call, I'm wondering if you've detected a shift in the receptivity from other companies with the valuation resets many have seen, basically curious whether or not you think this kind of market makes it harder to get a deal done. Thanks.","John F. Milligan, PhD - President & Chief Operating Officer","I guess there's an implication that we've been out making offers. So I'd say I don't think the market really changes all that much dynamically in terms of M&A activity. And so I can't tell you people's expectations have changed based on valuation changes, but I've seen these cycles go up and down over the years. And when there's a deal to be put together and it's timely, it can be done. And so I don't think it changes the overall outlook for M&A at all. I just think from my perspective, it's about the same as it was at the beginning of the year.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Phil Nadeau of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Phil M. Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. Paul, in your prepared remarks, you suggested that the volumes that we see at the end of this year will be more indicative of what to expect in the U.S. in 2016. That suggests that we probably will see a stabilization of script trends. I'm curious why you think that. What data points do you have that suggest that's likely to happen? And also, what makes you think that what we see the end of this year is going to be extrapolatable through the end of next year?","Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President-Commercial Operations","Hi, Phil. Thanks. First of all, I'd say you see the same data that I see with the weekly scripts. What you don't see is the non-retail sector perhaps, and you may not see what we call NBRx, which is the new-to-brand, which is essentially the new starts data.","I think that we're fairly confident. We've now seen a flattening out of the trends of patient new starts in the U.S. As I said earlier, I've said a couple times now that we saw a very strong first quarter, which really was reflecting the warehousing of patients waiting for HARVONI in the U.S., and HARVONI was such a step-change for GT-1 patients.","But we've had a fairly flat two quarters in terms of patients starting on sofosbuvir products. In quarter four last year, just to put it in perspective \u2013 and HARVONI was already launched then, by the way, we saw about 45,000 patients being treated. Then we had this big bolus in quarter one, about 70,000 patients. In quarter two we saw about 62,000, and in quarter three we've estimated about just around 60,000. So it's flattening when you add the retail and the non-retail together. And as I said, as we go into quarter four, I think we can expect that to be fairly stable as we go into next year.","Having said that, and again, from my prepared remarks, I emphasized that we are doing a lot of work across the country and around the world to work with governments and other stakeholders to really try and encourage earlier treatment, more screening, and so on, so that we can extend this hepatitis C business for many, many years. And we think that's going to be the case because even now we've treated just a tiny, tiny fraction of the diagnosed patients and hardly touched the undiagnosed area in terms of volume and potential. So we're very confident of the future, but 2016 I think will be a more stable year in the U.S.","Phil M. Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC","And just so I'm clear, does your comments about 2016 rely in any way on an opening of restrictions in who gets reimbursed in the U.S., or is this simply restrictions stay the same and patients start working through the system?","Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President-Commercial Operations","I think it's going to be patients working through the system, but I think we're fairly optimistic that over time, and it may take a little bit longer time than shorter time based on what we've seen so far, there are fibrosis scores and other patient characteristics which would represent barriers to start treatment will be relaxed somewhat. And it's self-fulfilling in a sense that predictable and stable patient flow works with the business models of the payers. And I think they will start to feel more comfortable about relaxing constraints. So gradually, we should start to see more patients coming through.","Phil M. Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC","And just one last follow-up. In Europe, you said that the volumes are more dependent upon the reimbursement levels of governments. Can you give us some sense of where we are bumping up, where we are in comparison to the reimbursement limits that have been set by governments? Are we now bumping up against those constraints, or is there still more room to come?","Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President-Commercial Operations","We have to be fairly specific by country, and looking at Europe in aggregate doesn't necessarily paint the full picture. So let me just talk you through quarter three and what's being happening I think in Europe. So we've seen early launch markets like Germany begin to stabilize at lower levels but more consistent levels. And that's a parallel somewhat to what we saw in the U.S. So that would be Germany and France being the early launch markets.","We've then seen markets that have high prevalence and ambition to treat a lot of patients like Spain and Italy really starting to address their warehouse patients in quarter two and starting to go into quarter three. And we've seen, I would say, I would suggest somewhat of a spike in those countries, and we would expect those going forward to come down to lower levels but more consistent levels. And then we started to see new markets like the UK coming onstream during quarter three. A confusing aspect in quarter three in Europe is because there's a very high level of vacations in July and August, not just for patients but for treaters and wholesalers and so on, so there are a few moving parts there.","Going forward, I would expect Europe to start to flatten out and stabilize somewhat. But of course, as I said, there are different dynamics country by country. And I mentioned in the script a couple of the smaller countries who haven't even launched yet but we will be launching in the next quarter.","Phil M. Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC","That's very helpful, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Wendy Lam of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Wendy Lam - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I may have missed this earlier in the call, but I was wondering what percentage of patients on HARVONI were on the eight- week regimen versus the 12-week regimen. I believe last quarter you said it was around 40%, and I was wondering if that has changed that much this quarter.","And just one quick question on simtuzumab, for the 48-week interim futility analysis this quarter, will there be any announcement of the results, whether they're negative or positive, or do we have to wait for the 96-week results? Thanks.","Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President-Commercial Operations","Okay, I'll answer the first question, which is the eight weeks regimen. So our estimate is about 40% of GT-1 patients in the U.S., which is similar to last quarter, have been on the eight weeks regimen. That hasn't changed too much. If you look at just the epidemiology and look at the GT-1 patients who would qualify for eight weeks, that's more like 70% of those. So I hope that answers that part. And I'll hand you over to Norbert.","Norbert W. Bischofberger, PhD - Executive Vice President, Research and Development & Chief Scientific Officer","Wendy, I would say the answer to the 48-week is that there won't be an announcement. We have an agreement with FDA. The endpoint in that study is HVPG, Hepatic Venous Pressure Gradient, and the FDA felt that the 48-week data would really not suffice for an approval, that we needed 96-week data. Of course, there could be the possibility of some spectacular results like prevention of SMEs or something like that, or the opposite also. There could be a surprise about harm, in which case the DSMB could make a recommendation to either stop the study or unblind it, but I think that's unlikely.","Wendy Lam - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ying Huang of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, thanks for taking my questions as well. First of all, I think John was saying that the 2016 contracts with the payers are pretty much in place and there's no major change in access. I was wondering what would prompt the payers to actually provide wider access. Would lower pricing give you guys more access? And in relation to that, there's a third player coming into the market for HCV in January. What's your view of the pricing trend in marketing 2016?","John F. Milligan, PhD - President & Chief Operating Officer","So as I said earlier \u2013 this is John Milligan. As I said earlier, the contracts have been finalized for 2016. That always happens earlier in the year. In fact, we're already starting to talk a little bit about 2017 with the payers. And they have a range of options, much like they had in the past. They can choose what level of rebate they would want to have based on their ability to open up access. And I think 2015 was a bit of a shock to the system with the warehouse patients. And as Paul implied, next year we think will be a much smoother base from which we can then try to impact the growth of the overall market. And so they will have options based on how they negotiate with their clients to open up access or not for next year. So that will be an ongoing discussion with them and within their internal groups as well as the data emerge on this.","So we feel very positive about this in the long term. And it sometimes just takes data and time for these things to work themselves out. And with regards to \u2013 yes, go ahead.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just quickly, I know you guys made a 46% gross-to-net announcement. Probably you cannot give us a quantitative answer, but qualitatively speaking, can you talk about the gross-to-net adjustment trend in Q3 versus Q2 and Q1?","John F. Milligan, PhD - President & Chief Operating Officer","No, we're not putting that number out there for the gross-to-net. I think one thing to focus on is what Paul had said earlier. What we are seeing is a trend towards shorter therapy, so a lot fewer use of the 24-week option for patients and then a lot of the eight-week option for those patients. So that is a real benefit of driving the cost down by bringing in shorter care to the patients as well. And so that's what you would expect as the more sick patients in those categories work themselves through.","You also had a question about competitors coming to market. I think we feel very strongly about our position in the market. We feel very strongly about the value that we've been able to bring, and importantly, the safety database that we have that will give us a very strong position in the market regardless of who comes in, in the future.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thanks for taking the question. So I wanted to ask \u2013 I saw on your milestone chart you're going to start a Phase 3 study for the triple HCV regimen you said in the fourth quarter of this year. So I'm wondering what you hope to achieve there. I know you've looked at six weeks, eight weeks, and 12 weeks and what duration you think you're going to be going forward with and what impact you think that could have on the market. And then separately, if you're willing, could you quantify for us how big the VA tailwind was to you? Thanks.","Norbert W. Bischofberger, PhD - Executive Vice President, Research and Development & Chief Scientific Officer","Matthew, so our thoughts for the triple combination HCV regimen is twofold. First of all, we're going to do one study, and we still have to talk about all the details that will show \u2013 that will explore the utility of the triple combination regimen to be a universal salvage regimen. So whatever you have failed before, whether it's non-nukes, PIs, or NS5As, this triple combination regimen will provide a universal salvage possibility.","And the second thing we're exploring is eight weeks duration of therapy in various patient populations. And again, we're working with the FDA through all the details of that. We haven't decided. The final decision has not been made, but those are our two-pronged approach. And then the other question?","John F. Milligan, PhD - President & Chief Operating Officer","Matt, you asked about the VA tailwind. And unfortunately, we're not able to share any details about prescribing habits or business in the VA, so I can't help you.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Skorney of Robert Baird. Your line is now open.","Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess just on the hep C triple combo data, I know you said you have top line data out. The AASLD abstract only has data for six-week duration for the genotype 3 patients. Can you just remind us if you're still exploring a six-week duration of treatment with this triple combo in other genotypes? And if so, in what context we should think about a shorter duration when we might see some data?","And then just on the safety data that we heard about with Viekira this week, if Express Scripts' national formulary committee makes a determination to add SOVALDI and HARVONI due to these issues, will you insist that they pay gross price?","Norbert W. Bischofberger, PhD - Executive Vice President, Research and Development & Chief Scientific Officer","Brian, I'll answer the first question. We are not exploring a six-week duration regimen anymore. And the reason is simply that our experience has been that it works for a subset of patients but not for a broader patient population. If you look at cirrhotics or treatment-experienced patients, then the response rates, the SVR rates are not as high as they should be. And I want to remind you, you'll notice that the response rate \u2013 if you just get 90%, people won't accept that anymore. It really has to be 95% or more, and we're not seeing that across a broad patient population with six weeks of therapy.","Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Does that mean that you're no longer pursuing the pan-genotypic protease inhibitor anymore too?","Norbert W. Bischofberger, PhD - Executive Vice President, Research and Development & Chief Scientific Officer","That was the previous question, Brian. The pan-genotypic PI together with velpatasvir together with sofosbuvir, the triple is going to be a universal salvage regimen and potential universal eight-week duration therapy. That's what we're thinking, but not six weeks.","John F. Milligan, PhD - President & Chief Operating Officer","Brian, I think your second question was about what Express Scripts might do. Obviously, it's up to Express Scripts to figure out what they want to do given where they are. The national formulary, where there is exclusivity for the Viekira Pak, of course is about 15% of the covered lives of Express Scripts. Obviously, we're open to discussions anytime they want to call us, but I have no idea what their thoughts would be. I have no idea how the label update would impact their business at all. That's up for them to decide medically what's the right thing to do for their patients, of course.","Norbert W. Bischofberger, PhD - Executive Vice President, Research and Development & Chief Scientific Officer","Brian, I would like to add something. If you looked at the six-week duration treatment would still be two prescriptions. It's not possible to package 42 tablets into a bottle and have that be one prescription. So that's another reason why six weeks is not as appealing. Eight weeks is the result of two prescriptions.","Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And, Mr. O'Brien, we have time for one more question. And our final question comes from Alan Carr of Needham & Company. Your line is now open.","Alan Carr - Needham & Co. LLC","Hi, thanks very much. I wanted to come back to HIV and talk a bit about your thoughts on how well the HIV franchise is doing relative to V-regimens, better or worse than you expected? And then also to come back to GS-9883, what are your timelines there for wrapping up the Phase 3 and submitting the NDA? Thanks.","Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President-Commercial Operations","Okay, so let me just talk a little bit about the HIV franchise. So actually one of the encouraging pieces of news in the U.S. is that eight out of ten patients now are receiving a single-tablet regimen, which I think demonstrates that the concept of single tablet regimens is really very well established now. TRIUMEQ has been doing well on its launch, and it has been taking some market share from Gilead, although seven out of ten patients new to treatment are receiving a Gilead product and six out of ten roughly are receiving a Gilead single-tablet regimen. So the conversation in HIV having been focused somewhat on third agents over the last few years, we feel now is going to come strongly back to the backbone of these HIV single-tablet regimens.","And really up until next week, TRUVADA has been well established as the standard of care backbone in these single tablet regimens. But as of November 5, our PDUFA for TAF or F\/TAF-based regimens, that changes, and F\/TAF will be the standard of care backbone for single-tablet regimens going forward. So with the launch of GENVOYA next week, we are very confident that we will see a major milestone in the upgrading of HIV treatment. And as John said earlier, because patients are living longer with HIV, have a lifetime of therapy, this is a major improvement for patients and a compelling data set that we're launching with, both for patients naive to treatment and for switch patients. And with switch patients, it takes time to get patients to switch. It won't happen by itself but the commercial organization and the medical affairs organization in Gilead are very well prepared and very motivated and very excited about the launch. So we're very confident.","Alan Carr - Needham & Co. LLC","All right, thanks. And then around GS-9883 timing?","Norbert W. Bischofberger, PhD - Executive Vice President, Research and Development & Chief Scientific Officer","The timeline, so if we start enrollment at the end of this year, assume six-month enrollment, 48-week endpoint, that's middle of 2017, two months to write it up and submit and then another 10 months for review, so that gets us roughly into mid-2018 timeframe.","Alan Carr - Needham & Co. LLC","Great, thanks very much.","Patrick O'Brien - Senior Director-Investor Relations","Great. Thank you, Candice, and thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead, and the team here looks forward to providing you with updates on future progress in future earnings calls.

Please go ahead sir.","Patrick O'Brien","Thank you, Janney and good afternoon everyone. As you will have seen we issued a press release earlier this afternoon and our earnings results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2014. The press release along with detailed slides is available on the Investor Relations section of our Web site. Speaking on the call today will be John Martin, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Carter, our Executive Vice President of Commercial Operations; and Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Also in the room with us for Q&A, are John Milligan, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Norbert Bischofberger, Executive Vice President of Research & Development.","Before we begin our formal remarks, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including plans and expectations, with respect to our product candidates, estimates for the number of HCV patients we believe the U.S. Medical System will treat in 2015, estimates of the blended rebate percentage for government and private payors in our HCV franchise and financial projections, all of which involves certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in our latest SEC disclosure documents and the recent press release.","In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. We will also be using non-GAAP financial measures to help you understand underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in our press release as well as on our Web site.","I will now turn the call over to John Martin.","John Martin","Thank you, Patrick and thank you all for joining us today. I will mention a few highlights for the past quarter and then make brief remarks about the year ahead before turning the call over to Paul.","2014 was marked by the launch of our first oncology product Zydelig, our second Hepatitis C product Harvoni, regulatory filings for the next-generation HIV medicine E\/C\/F\/TAF and a doubling of product revenues relative to 2013. We are entering 2015 with financial strength, a portfolio of 19 marketable products that address significant unmet medical needs and a pipeline for which we respect a number of milestones and data readouts during the coming year. Regarding HCV since the launch of Sovaldi in December 2013 and Harvoni in October 2014 more than 170,000 individuals around the world have been treated with the sofosbuvir-based regimen. Harvoni has become the most widely used Hepatitis C regimen since its approval in October 2014 and prescription data at year-end indicate that for each Sovaldi patient, three patients started therapy with Harvoni.","Gilead continues to investigate the use of Harvoni in different patient groups including non-genotype 1 infected patients and HIV co-infections and in patients with advanced liver disease. Data from these studies support the utility of Harvoni in these patient populations and the results will be presented at upcoming scientific conferences. In addition to sofosbuvir we are exploring other potent pan-genotypic agents. A single-tablet of sofosbuvir and GS-5816 is currently being evaluated in four Phase III studies and top-line data from all these studies will be available in the third quarter of this year. Moreover, we are exploring GS-9857 a pan-genotypic protease inhibitor in combination with sofosbuvir and GS-5816 to potentially further reduce treatment duration from eight to 12 weeks to four to six weeks.","Even though great progress has been made in the treatment of HCV worldwide, only a fraction of the people infected the large majority who lives in lower income and middle income countries have been diagnosed to treat it. Progress is being made to expand access in less developed countries. Data presented at the first Hepatitis Conference last month showed that in Egypt since initiation of a national program in October 2014 738,000 patients have been registered, 40,000 have been selected for treatment and 15,000 have started Sovaldi therapy. Sovaldi has been approved in India and marketing authorization applications have been filed in 12 additional emerging and developing market countries.","In HIV, regulatory submissions for our first TAF contained product, the single-tablet regimen of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine and TAF abbreviated E\/C\/F\/TAF have been submitted in the EU, and the U.S. The application was validated in the EU and in the U.S. it will undergo standard review with an anticipated FDA action date of November 5. The E\/C\/F\/TAF NDA was one of our largest HIV submissions and included data from two large Phase III studies in treatment na\u00efve individuals. One study in which fully suppressed patients were switched to E\/C\/F\/TAF, a study in renally impaired patients and a study in adolescence. Detailed data from these studies will be presented at an upcoming Scientific Conference this quarter. Our agreement with Janssen R&D Ireland was expanded to include the development of a single-tablet regimen of rilpivirine, emtricitabine and TAF. In addition, we are pursuing the development of a fixed dose combination of emtricitabine and TAF. We expect to file for approval of all the products before the end of the year.","Progress also continues in oncology and the inflammation. In the year since John McHutchison\u2019s role was expanded he has recruited Philippe Bishop to lead Oncology Hematology and also John Sundy to head up the Inflammation Respiratory Therapeutic area. A number of additional hires have been made to strengthen these teams. Our oncology pipeline is expanding, we recently entered an exclusive license agreement with ONO Pharmaceuticals for the development and commercialization of what is now called GS-4059, a BTK inhibitor for B-cell malignancies and other diseases. With this agreement Gilead now has compounds targeting four signaling pathways associated with B-cell malignancies, PI3K Delta, Syk, JAK und BTK. The use of this BTK inhibitor will be studied in combination with Gilead\u2019s other kinase inhibitors with the goal of achieving more pronounced and more durable response rates.","GS-5745 the anti-MMP9 antibody is undergoing evaluation in ulcerative colitis and gastric and pancreatic cancer. Based on promising safety and efficacy data we anticipate moving the compound forward in clinical development for ulcerative colitis and gastric cancer in 2015. In addition, Phase II studies are planned in Crohn's Disease. Simtuzumab the anti-LOXL2 antibody has been in evaluation for myelofibrosis, pancreatic cancer and colorectal cancer. In these three indications there was no evidence of efficacy although Simtuzumab was safe and well tolerated. Simtuzumab is undergoing evaluation and NASH, PSC and IPF, with the Phase II NASH and PSC clinical studies fully enrolled and the Phase II IPF study approximately 80% enrolled. Also for NASH an ASK-1 inhibitor and FXR agonist will be advanced into clinical development.","Right to FXR agonist were acquired through an agreement with Phoenix that we announced in January. The ASK-1 inhibitor is currently into Phase II studies for diabetic neuropathy and pulmonary arterial hypertension. And we will begin a Phase II study in NASH in the first half of this year. Finally the Board has approved a quarterly cash dividend program to commence in the second quarter of this year and a new $15 billion five year repurchase program, Robin will provide more details on these items in a few minutes.","The year ahead is expected to be as busy as 2014 and all of us across the organization and in collaboration with our many partners are working toward a shared goal of developing new treatments and providing access to Gilead\u2019s medicines for patients in need. I am pleased with the progress we have made and look forward to updating you as the year progresses.","I will now turn the call over to Paul Carter to provide a commercial update.","Paul Carter","Thanks, John and good afternoon, everyone. Gilead achieved $7.2 billion of net product revenue in the fourth quarter, representing a 137% year-over-year growth. Net product revenue for the quarter consisted of $5.5 billion U.S. sales, $1.4 billion of European sales and more than 300 million sales from the rest of the world, the primary drivers of the Company\u2019s strong performance during the fourth quarter with a continued uptake of sofosbuvir containing HCV regimens and the continued healthy demand in our HIV business.","I'll start with some commentary around our HCV business. Hepatitis C revenue increased to $3.8 billion in the fourth quarter. In the U.S. revenues were 3.2 billion with 1.2 billion from Sovaldi and 2 billion from Harvoni. We estimate that 43,000 patients started treatment on a sofosbuvir-based regimen in the quarter with 31,000 of those starting on Harvoni following its launch in October. To-date approximately 140,000 patients have started HCV therapy on a Gilead product in the United States. Harvoni's launch in the U.S. is going well with filled prescriptions tracking above Sovaldi\u2019s at the same time point.","The base of treated is expanding with more than 10,000 physicians now having prescribed a sofosbuvir-based regimen about 11,000 of who began subscribing after the launch of Harvoni. Indeed seven out of 10 HCV patients initiating treatment in the fourth quarter started on Harvoni the remainder on a Sovaldi containing regimen. Across our franchise about three quarters of patients treated were genotype 1, 16% were genotype 2, 7% were genotype 3 and 3% were other genotypes. As in prior quarters we saw prescriptions written for all stages of fibrosis. Although after the launch of Harvoni we saw payor restrictions increasingly in place across all patient types and especially for those with lower fibrosis scores.","As expected there was a net inventory build in our HCV business in the fourth quarter following the launch of Harvoni. This was partly offset by a decrease in Sovaldi inventory and we believe that in total HCV inventory ended the year at the higher-end of the normal range necessary to support demand. As we've seen in years past we think that treatment inventory could draw down in the first quarter and then track more normally with demand through the rest of 2015. In the fourth quarter price volume negotiations for Sovaldi were finalized with a number of countries including France, Italy and Spain and the product is now being sold in the majority of countries in Europe. Overall Sovaldi contributed more than $1.5 billion to European sales during 2014.","Harvoni was improved in the EU in November and the product is now available in Austria, Sweden, Finland and Germany. In France and the UK it is available under early access program. Across the EU 32,000 individuals have started treatment with a Gilead HCV regimen approximately 26,000 of those are in the EU big five countries and of these 4,000 have initiated treatment with Harvoni. We are in the process of securing reimbursement for Harvoni across numerous countries in the EU and we expect this to be completed at least as quickly as we experienced for Sovaldi. We expect both sofosbuvir-based therapies to continue to perform strongly in 2015. And we are confident in the differentiated clinical profile of our products. Harvoni offers an unparallel combination of efficacy safety and regimen simplicity for Hepatitis C genotype 1 patients including treatment na\u00efve and treatment experienced patients and patients with and without cirrhosis.","Our new arrangement with the majority of National Pharmacy Benefit Managers or PBM will ensure that Gilead\u2019s drugs are readily available for patients within these systems. We anticipate far fewer restrictions on reimbursement and the updated professional guidelines will likely open up treatment to many more individuals. This should reduce hurdles and the time it takes the medical stuff to navigate the reimbursement process, particularly for patients with earlier stage disease. There has been as you're all aware a substantial amount of public discussion about the payor landscape. As a Company we believe that treatment decisions are best made by doctors and their patients. We will however continue taking the steps necessary to ensure as many patients as possible have access to our best-in-class Hepatitis C treatments.","We expect our 2015 growth to net adjustments for our HCV products in the United States to be approximately 46% or a little more than double of that where we ended 2014 which was around 22%. This increase is the result of the recent and ongoing round of negotiations with payors and PBMs and includes the shift towards a higher proportion of public payors and high prescribing of Harvoni amongst those payors with rebates to payors such as the Medicaid and the VA exceeding 50%. Again these higher levels of rebates are tied directly to opening up access and streamlining the process of starting a patient on therapy. Overall with these new arrangements in place we are confident that a substantially higher number of patients will be treated in the United States in 2015. We think that there is capacity to treat at least 250,000 patients across all genotypes.","Before I move on I wanted to mention that we are well prepared for launch of Sovaldi and Harvoni in Japan in anticipation of their respective approvals during 2015. As you know a significant number of patients are suffering from HCV in Japan and the country has one of the highest rates of liver cancer of any industrialized country.","Moving on to HIV, in 2014 Gilead continued its commercial and clinical success. In the U.S. our HIV business generated $1.9 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter and 6.3 billion for the full year. While underlying demand was strong HIV inventories ended the quarter at the high-end of the inventory management agreement range. Full year growth of 17% was driven by our Truvada-based single-tablet regimens Complera and Stribild. In particular volume for Stribild doubled year-over-year and the product passed through $1 billion of revenue in 2014. More than 80% of new patients initiated therapy on a Gilead product with nearly 70% on one of our Truvada-based single-tablet regimens. Stribild remained a number one most prescribed regimen in treatment na\u00efve patients, Complera number two and each of the top-five regimens across treated patients included the Gilead Truvada back pain.","In Europe our HIV business generated 3.2 billion in sales for the year with Eviplera and Stribild more than doubling versus 2013. Eviplera remained the most prescribed regimen for treatment na\u00efve patients and our very latest information shows that Stribild in fact has moved up from fourth to second position. As a reminder, the data shown in the slides we provide on our Web site reflects a one quarter lag. Eviplera and Stribild also remained the most prescribed regimen for switch patients.","I also wanted to mention the approval of two new fixed dose combinations that combine Gilead\u2019s cobicistat or boosting agent with protease inhibitor. Cobicistat is of course part of Stribild and a component of E\/C\/F\/TAF. Bristol-Myers Squibb announced approval last week of Evotaz a once-daily pill combining atazanavir with cobicistat and Johnson & Johnson announced approval of PREZCOBIX a combination of darunavir and cobicistat. FDA approved both products to use in combination with other anti-virals for the treatment of HIV in adults. We are very pleased to expand the use of cobicistat with these new options to patients.","With regards to our cardiovascular portfolio Ranexa and Letairis together represented more than $1.1 billion of revenue during 2014. We submitted a supplemental NDA with the data from the Letairis AMBITION study in December and anticipate inclusion of these data in the U.S. label during 2015. In summary I am very pleased with the efforts of our team and our results in 2014 and excited about the progress we will make in 2015 across Gilead\u2019s areas of therapeutic focus.","And with that I will now turn it over to Robin.","Robin Washington","Thank you, Paul and good afternoon. For the first time we have announced the initiation of a quarterly dividend of $0.43 per share that will begin in the second quarter of 2015 subject to a declaration by our Board of Directors. The quarterly dividend is equivalent to a $1.72 per share on an annual basis and approximates an annual yield of 1.6% based on yesterday\u2019s closing stock price. Also the Board of Directors authorized a new 15 billion five year share repurchase program, which we will initiate in 2013 on completion of our currently authorized $5 billion program. The initiation of a dividend and our increased level of share repurchases underscore our abilities and the strength of our future cash flow. Consistent with prior communication we also believe our future cash flow will provide us with adequate financial flexibility to support our pipeline growth in any future M&A opportunities or collaborations that we might consider.","Turning to the financial results. Total revenues were 24.9 billion for the year, up 122% year-over-year and 7.3 billion for the fourth quarter up 21% sequentially. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $8.09 per share for the year. Net product sales for the year were 24.5 billion ahead of our 2014 revised guidance. Our product sales for 2014 excluding HCV products were 12.1 billion an increase of 13% compared to the prior year, driven by continued uptake of our HIV single-tablet regimen across geographies. During 2014 Complera, Eviplera and Stribild product sales each exceeded the $1 billion mark for the first time. Our HCV product sales were 12.4 billion for 2014 and 3.8 billion for the fourth quarter, an increase of 36% sequentially, driven by continued launches of Sovaldi across geographies and the launch uptake of Harvoni following U.S. and European approvals during the fourth quarter.","Turning to expenses for the full year 2014. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were 2.6 billion, up 33% compared to the prior year and reflecting the continued progression of our product pipeline. In particular in oncology and liver disease and supportive geographic expansion as well as one-time items such as our collaboration with ONO Pharmaceutical and the purchase of an FDA priority review voucher during the fourth quarter. Absent these one-time items R&D expenses would have been within our guidance range. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were 2.8 billion up 77% compared to the prior year driven by the commercial launch of our HCV and oncology products and as discussed last quarter an increase in the planned prescription drug fee of $481 million for the full year, resulting from the issuance of final regulations by the IRS which required manufacturers to recognize an additional year of expense in 2014.","Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter decreased to 17.3% primarily due to the extension of the federal research tax credit in the fourth quarter reducing the full year 2014 non-GAAP effective tax rate to 17.9%. We generated 12.8 billion in cash from operations for the full year 2014. During the fourth quarter, we raised 4 billion in debt financing for general corporate purposes including share repurchases, repayment of debt and working capital needs. We also repaid 1 billion in previously outstanding debt during the fourth quarter. We utilized 5.3 billion in cash to repurchase 59 million shares at an average price of $90.29 per share in 2014. In the fourth quarter, we utilized 2 billion of the May 2014 5 billion share repurchase plan.","Finally, I would like to cover our full year 2015 non-GAAP financial guidance summarized on Slide 56 in the earnings presentation available on our corporate Web site. We expect product sales to be in the range of 26 billion to 27 billion, an increase of 6% to 10% over 2014. Our guidance for product revenues is subject to a number of uncertainties including the continuation of a challenging macroeconomic environment in Europe, inclusive of the potential adoption of additional pricing measures to reduce HCV spending. The potential for continued volatility and foreign currency exchange rates inaccuracy in our HCV patient estimate and increase in discount, charge back and rebates due to the ongoing commercial payor contract negotiation and a larger than anticipated shift in payor mix to more highly discounted payor segment such as PHF, FFS, Medicaid and the VA and the commercial launches of Sovaldi and Harvoni in Japan.","Our non-GAAP product gross margin is expected to be in the range of 87% to 90%. We expect our non-GAAP R&D expenses to be in the range of 3 billion to 3.3 billion as we continue to invest in our product pipeline. We expect our non-GAAP SG&A expenses to be in the range of 3 billion to 3.3 billion, which is due to the continued build out and expansion of our commercial infrastructure in Europe and Asia to support Sovaldi and Harvoni. For the full year, our non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 18% to 20%. This excludes any impact from the 2015 federal R&D tax credit which if extended this year would lower our overall effective tax rate. We anticipate the full year diluted EPS impacts of acquisition related restructuring and stock-based compensation expenses to be in the range of $0.82 to $0.87 per share. In closing, we are pleased with our 2014 results and our ability to provide additional clarity around our capital allocation strategy. We look forward to the opportunities ahead in 2015.","We would now like to open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Geoffrey Porges from Sanford Bernstein.","Geoffrey Porges","Many items to ask questions about, but first and could you just quickly give us a comment on your intentions with the dividend is this something that we should expect you to continue to grow in the future or is it sort of static as it is? And secondly, is your guidance assuming 250,000 patients treated and a greater than 40% gross to net or is it assuming something different to that? Thanks very much.","Robin Washington","Hi Geoff, it's Robin, I\u2019ll answer the first part of the question and I\u2019ll turn the second part over to Paul. It is our intention to grow the dividend overtime, but I would say at the moment we still use share repurchases as the component that would be the larger percentage of our share return strategy, it will be larger than dividends for the foreseeable future.","Geoffrey Porges","And thanks very much.","Paul Carter","Yes Geoff, I mean in terms of our guidance we have still some variables ahead of us here, but mainly the number of patients that are coming through, we believe that the system has the capacity to treat as I said in my script in excess of 250,000 patients and the agreement that we have entered into, a design to open up access and we\u2019re confident that we\u2019re going to see a large increase in the number of patients across the U.S. So yes, our guidance does consider the patient numbers that we think, plus the gross to net, that we just described.","Operator","The next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays.","Geoff Meacham","So just want to know what you guys have learnt from the field in Hep C in the U.S. and in Europe that supports the market that\u2019s just different from older stats some of the stats that we see out there are pretty tired and maybe decades old? And then how does it speak to the sustainability of patient inflows and I guess for that part of the question you may be consider the volume increases that you may expect to see for the next several year from the launch? Thanks.","John Milligan","Geoff this is John Milligan just to be clear you said the stats that are getting a little tired are you meaning the number of patients who are available for treatment?","Geoff Meacham","Correct yes some of the prevalence and in incident stats I think are pretty dated I know you guys have updated on one of your slides. But I wanted to kind of get your view from the field John and maybe some of the sources of some of the stats that you guys have collated?","John Milligan","Yes thanks for clarifying that. So it's pretty clear based on our field-based research and the comments from the doctors that there are a lot of people continuing to seek therapy who were denied therapy and it was getting pretty difficult through the last part of last year for patients even as high as F3 scores to get some treatment. So we believe based on this and trying to triangulate with the numbers that are in the public domain that there is a very considerable number of patients who will seek therapy for 2015 thus the numbers that we're talking about in terms of the potential of patients who could seek care.","Looking beyond that we still feel that it is a number that\u2019s pretty strong is the 1.6 million people who are currently diagnosed and have been under care at least at some point in the past and we see there is great opportunity for Gilead in future years to drive those patients into care. And so there are a number of program that we'll be embarking upon this year. Educational campaigns, with things like primary care not with the intent of them treating but with referring and identifying the disease and all the way through advertising campaigns that in 2016, 2017 and 2018 and beyond and probably a number of years beyond that we will continue to strive those patients into care.","I think additionally as these therapies have gotten both more affordable for the system and better because of the simplicity of use we will see those other patients that roughly 3 million to 4 million people who are out there. The additional two plus million who are out there or above the 1.6 we'll also have an opportunity to seek care and we do see a great opportunity to drive those patients. So we do see this as a long-term sustainable business based on what we\u2019ve seen to-date despite the rapid influx that we saw in 2014 and the continued influx that we anticipate in 2015.","Geoff Meacham","The same situation John in Europe?","John Milligan","In Europe the situation is actually quite sustainable I think for a number of years. What we're seeing our commitments from the public sectors to treat a certain number of patients and in most of those cases it's a considerable higher number of patients and have historically been treated. But when we look at the denominator the total number of patients who could be treated this is something that plays out roughly 10 to 15 years or in the cases some of the high prevalence countries like Italy even beyond that. So we do think it is quite a sustainable market through Europe.","Operator","The next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from ISI.","Mark Schoenebaum","Just a clarification on Geoff Porges\u2019 question I am not sure you answered if you did I apologize. But within your guidance rather than passing the system what actually is your patient estimate AbbVie of course on their call mentioned they thought 175 roughly to 215 a U.S. G1 patients would be treated would actually be treated in 2015 I was wondering if you would be willing to tell us what you're actually, how many patients are actually assuming will be treated? And then what was your government to private mix in '14 and what do you expect it to be in '15? Thanks.","John Martin","So Mark let's just start with the first part of that question in terms of what our guidance provides and so there is a specific patient number that I'm going to give to you. What we have in there is the range of different prices depending on the mix of private to public and there are a range of different discounts offered across all those areas. There is a range of market share assumptions that we have put in there and then of course there is a range of patient numbers in there and I thought the AbbVie sort of general range of patients was a reasonable one we think there could be capacity to go up as Paul said up to $250,000 but our assumption on total patient numbers isn\u2019t actually $250,000 it's less than that. Sorry $250,000 patients it\u2019s less than that, so it's fair to say that there is a range of things that will come into play and that will determine how we do on a quarter and on yearly basis as we hit that different mix of patients across those segments. Your second question was about last year and about 70% of our patients last year came from the private sector.","Mark Schoenebaum","And this year?","John Martin","This year we're not actually sure because there is a number, so I can't tell you that number because there is too many factors that flux right now. Including the different contracts that we and AbbVie are competing for in the Medicaid sectors we do anticipate that these contracts will get signed earlier than they have historical in fact some are being signed now. And so you will see a sort of historically if you think about Gilead it starts very private with our launches and then it eventually becomes to sort of a steady state with the public and private mix, we will get to that mix much more quickly this year because of the acceleration and the negotiations and so we should have a better handle on that as we get into Q2, but I don\u2019t know exactly where it\u2019s going to shake out right now because there are so many contracts in flux right now.","Operator","The next question comes from Matt Roden from UBS.","Matt Roden","And also thanks for the increased clarity on the gross to net, that\u2019s obviously been a major issue for people. You obviously felt confident enough about that number to disclose it, but you mentioned contracting is one of the uncertainties reflected in your guidance the range of payor mix et cetera. So how confident are you that you can hold that level for this year? And then what would you expect when additional entrants come to market next year and years to come? Thanks.","John Martin","So, we think that as of today and some of the negotiations are ongoing but about 60% of the covered lives across the U.S. have now been negotiated and signed on, and of that 60% Gilead we think has access or patients have access around 80% of those, of that 60% will access to Harvoni. The rest of the 40% is still in play. But I can say for the 60% part of covered lives that we are very confident that the terms that have been negotiated will last through the rest of this year. And as I already said those terms have been designed to increase access. So we do expect to see a significant number of patients increasing through those PBMs and payors compared to 2014.","Matt Roden","Okay, and for the coming years when there is additional entrants to the market?","John Martin","Well, I think the real life-data first of all on our products is going to be a key piece here. And I should say I would like to emphasize that in our negotiations already with payors most of those payors have really taken into consideration the highly differentiated product that we offer compared to competition and have made a full assessment of that. So I think we have to wait until we see the profile, the real-world profile of our existing competition and of course the data with the future competitors before we start. We are very-very confident in Harvoni with its one pill once a day and the ability to treat perhaps 50% of GT1 patients in the U.S. with just eight weeks with no need for ribavirin issues, no need for drug-drug interaction issues with tenofovir and for most classes of patients absolutely fine to take Harvoni unlike our competitors. So I think time will tell a little bit before we can see what happens.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Yee","One question is you have been talking about government versus non-government or commercial versus non-commercial, versus in the patients treated in 2015 what do you think that breakout is between those two buckets 30-35 or 65 closer to 50-50 how should we think about those two buckets which obviously have different rebates?","John Martin","As John said in 2014 the proportion of private to public was about 70-30, we expect during 2015 it might be a little bit more public but I suspect it will be more in that type of proportion.","Michael Yee","Well how does that differ in Europe, because we are thinking about one payor system but there is obviously competition and should we be thinking about similar negotiations where they are thinking about exclusives or we should be thinking about equal parity and they are offering both the drugs just so we understand the stuff that come across the table in the course of your negations, countries getting deals?","John Martin","Yes, we have negotiated for Sovaldi with most of the countries in Europe and these have not been on an exclusive basis, but the nature of the arrangements are tied directly to increasing access to patients. So we have volume type incentive to try and encourage a much higher number of patients treated going forward than has ever been seen in the past. So, I think our competition will be doing similar kinds of arrangements but again we are very-very confident in the clinical profile of our drug and we hope that will be very successful in Europe as we have been so far.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Abrahams from Wells Fargo.","Brian Abrahams","Just curious of the plans that allow access to both Harvoni and the competitive drug Viekira what proportion of patients are you seeing go on to Harvoni. And you have patients with relative use to be eight week or 12 week Harvoni regimen? Thanks.","John Martin","It\u2019s just too early, I think as a launch of the Viekira Pak is less than a month old, so we don\u2019t really have any good data to suggest how our competition is fairing versus how we are fairing. So it\u2019s too early to say in terms of how these parity deals are working out for either of us. And many of these things have just been point of high so it\u2019s very early day so please be patient with us. You had mentioned also whether the eight week versus 12 week. It was our expectation and our continued expectation that in the initial launch of Harvoni far more patients to go on to 12-week than the eight-week because there were the more severely ill patients and that in fact is what we\u2019ve seen that the very small percentage of patients perhaps that has used at least 20% of patients going on the eight weeks versus the 12-weeks. We do anticipate that that will increase overtime as restrictions go down and as less severely ill patients come onboard and those patients get benefit from the eight-week therapy.","Operator","The next question comes from Yaron Werber from Citigroup.","Yaron Werber","If you don\u2019t mind I just have a follow-up and the new question, the -- if I sort of listen to what you're saying and I am sort of backing into the commercial discounts, I am still getting about sort of 40% range assuming just a slight year-over-year increase in the component of public over private, am I sort of in the right ballpark? And then secondly, when you look at Europe, Europe grew by 10% quarter-over-quarter, how fast should we think about the volume increasing in Europe, now that you have reimbursement? Thanks.","John Martin","Yaron, yes, let me just talk about the European peace and I\u2019ll hand back to John. So, the European part we\u2019re seeing most of these agreements have only really been finalized in the last quarter of 2014. So, I would say, I would characterize Europe as really just beginning access to the majority of patients, and what we\u2019ve tried to do though is with each of our agreements is work with the governments to assess that budgetary constraints, the prevalence of patients in the country and then tried to come to an arrangement which as John had alluded to earlier, probably the kind of longer-term approach to addressing their HCV challenge. So kind of lower proportion of the total diagnosed patients will be treated each year, but we do think there is going to be a significant increase in patients treated across Europe and we\u2019re starting to see the first signs of that as we exit 2014.","John Milligan","And Yaron, we\u2019re just not going to be able to give you any greater conformation of any specific discount, I just want to remind you of a couple of things, this is a blended discount that is across those Sovaldi and Harvoni inclusive of public and private and I want to remind you as Paul said in the lot of these private negotiation this were related to certain relaxation of restrictions so that more patients could get access and so that was factored into this as well, but other than that I can\u2019t give any more color on what the exact specific discount would be.","Operator","The next question comes from Ian Somaiya from Nomura Securities.","Ian Somaiya","Just trying to get a I guess a better handle on how we should model what are the essence of the cost of cure, and I know you mentioned that the duration of treatment therapy is roughly 20% it reached 30% I think 12 weeks. How should we think about that going forward and given the more moderate pace of patients being treated in Europe, how will that differ relative to the U.S.?","John Martin","So I mean Ian, I think we\u2019ve given you all the things that you need to model this, we\u2019ve given you the specific gross to net, we\u2019ve talked a little bit about where this eight-week versus 12 could come out, we think it could grow to close to half of U.S. patients, I can\u2019t tell you how that\u2019s going to play out during the course of this year as some doctors still prefer 12 and we don\u2019t know what the percentage of patients with different underlying for gross disclosure would be that would preclude them from the eight-week. So it's challenging for us as it is for you, but I think we\u2019ve given you the -- as many details as we can to build out a model to get to where we are in our guidance as well.","Operator","The next question comes from Phil Nadeau from Cowen and Company.","Phil Nadeau","First, on the gross to net that seems to be taking everyone by surprise, you qualitatively discussed whether this gross to net is about where you thought it would eventually get to or because of the things that you're doing to open up access is the gross side a bit bigger than you would have anticipated? And secondly in Europe, it sounds like you have a lot of information on budgets and whatnot. Can you give us a sense of overtime more proportion of your HCV revenues in any given year do you think will come out of Europe? Thank you.","John Martin","Phil, I am trying to figure out how I would answer this question but what my expectations were, my expectation that overtime prices in this deal would go down based on two things; one would be, increased competition and the other would be decreasing time of therapy and both of those things are occurring and so I guess my expectation is that it came down a little bit more than we thought but at the end of the day we felt that it would come down to a level of about this for the treatment of HCV. And so I think we\u2019re at about where we thought we would be in this area.","On the Europe part, I think it was just proportionately we\u2019re going to head, I mean I think overtime we\u2019ll see Europe as a bigger proportion relative to the U.S. and that is partly because of the time lag on the regulatory process and agreeing pricing and really kind of Europe getting into a swing. But I would caveat that by just kind of repeating that there are these clear budget caps across European countries which will slow things down there. So, I think probably our HCV business will be proportionately same to the U.S. as it is in HIV overtime when we kind of get to that sort of steady state they and just to emphasize again we do see Europe as having a long sort of time tail to it. So we should see our business continue to grow there for many years.","Operator","The next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Deutsche Bank.","Robyn Karnauskas","But I am just trying to think about the discount I think are ahead of what the street is thinking and as a blended rate and we know that other competitors are coming on in the market. How aggressive how low can we go, can you give us any comfort on these gross to net can't erode significantly over the next year or two? And then a question on the volume side as I'm looking at what you're saying like the 250 range you\u2019ve mentioned before as being a really great year. How much do you think the system can handle is 250 like what these payors have said that they actually could handle so they will control volumes to keep it that way? Or do you think eventually we could higher and they may be willing to go higher if prices remain relatively stable? Thanks.","John Martin","On the first one as I look at our products then I look at the future competition that we're going have and I look at our emerging really remarkable profile of our Harvoni it's proving to be useful on a far greater range of patients than we thought. And look at our next-generation opportunities and I think we have by far the most competitive portfolio out there and that gives me great confident that we will be able to continue to have good product pricing throughout our segments. I am not at all concerned about future competition that people seem to be concerned about I think it's a very as it is a very strong category for us with our profile. So I think this first decrease in gross net is getting everybody to about where they want to be for the industry and for the patients as well. I forget the second question circle you can remember what it was?","Robyn Karnauskas","The volume so you've mentioned like 250 being a good year and like the question is, can the system handle more at the same price like overtime or would they keep it in that range managing by fibrosis score, do you think that that\u2019s like what they could handle overtime?","John Martin","So right now that number is not a number that\u2019s being managed. Paul did mention some things in Europe for their accounts. This is not a specific number that our managed care is working towards this is our estimation of what the capacity of this system would be and an estimation of what we think the patient inflows could be for 2015. The capacity of this system will depend on quite frankly on how well these products perform how many patients it cures and how many of the restrictions are really taken away for the physician and patient to get on therapy. And there are commitments that we have seen to remove those restriction we will have to wait to see how that plays out and whether those restrictions will capped at a certain level or not in the future. I don\u2019t know beyond 2015 what our expectation is yet because I have to see how things perform in 2015 so it\u2019s very difficult for us to predict.","Paul Carter","Yes, and would add our sales team has been spending a lot of their time focused on kind of securing access during 2014 and we do see them being able to shift to really driving demand for the products and differentiating product benefits going forward. So it\u2019s a good thing.","Operator","The next question comes from Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.","Cory Kasimov","I'll get off with the HCV market dynamic questions for a minute and go back to the dividend. So I don\u2019t think many people are expecting you to start paying one just yet. I am curious have anything changed with your thinking on this front and does this imply anything about the acquisition opportunities that you currently see in this market? Thanks.","Robin Washington","Hi Cory not at all this is Robin and may be John will chime in as well. But no really the timing of our dividend really reflects a confidence that we have in our business and our robust balance sheet as well as just the strength of our future cash flow as we look at it and again as we said all along there are no so vehicles that we can use to return free cash flow this gives us a disciplined approach of having a portion of it regular and something that people can count on or bake into their models and the rest will allow us to be flexible. But also as I mentioned it doesn\u2019t in anyway prevent us from invested in our business our pipeline or M&A it be between our free cash flows as well as our access to borrowing capacity we don\u2019t feel constrained in anyway by issuing a dividend.","John Martin","I think Robin you said it all very well. I agree with that.","Operator","The next question comes from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Harrison","I just wanted to ask specifically about access restrictions. We saw in the Express Scripts\u2019 release where they talked about specifically lowering the fibrosis status we haven\u2019t seen that out a lot of the releases that have gone for a Gilead product can you just maybe specifically state what sort of access restrictions have you gained with the discounts and what do you see is sort of the ability of patients to access. Are we talking all the way up to zero or are we talking only F1 sort of just top categorize that a little bit? Thanks.","John Martin","Yes Matt as I said negotiated with the aim of increasing access and we've submitted during those negotiations what I describe as a kind of big metrics in order to secure those agreements and those bid matrices encourage why the access base on fibrosis scores amongst other things. So the agreements we have signed will not be going to any specific ones do go as far as opening up to F0 but if actions don\u2019t mean words then those rebates wouldn\u2019t be given. So that\u2019s kind of how we are looking at it. And I can confirm that in some agreements we have got full access signed up, in terms of fibrosis scores.","Matthew Harrison","And maybe just the follow-up the 46% growth there that you talked about, what kind of access on that metrics are you assuming?","John Martin","Well we cannot go into any detail on that. I mean as John said earlier it\u2019s a whole mix of product mix of payor mix of timing and it\u2019s a calculation we have done but I wouldn\u2019t want to equate that to any kind of access criteria.","Operator","The next question comes from Howard Liang from Leerink.","Howard Liang","So maybe I will have some R&D question. Could your three HCV regimen the 9857 Sovaldi and 5816 could be four week and six week data to be available earlier than second half of \u201915 than to the start of in the fourth quarter. And could you start a Phase III this year?","Norbert Bischofberger","And so Howard this is Norbert. Thanks for asking and non-gross to net non-capital allocation question. I really appreciate it. So, yes, we are looking at the three door combination in pan-genotypic and we are currently looking at four weeks, six weeks, cirrhotic, non-cirrhotic treatment experienced treatment na\u00efve. You should see some of those data in EASL in April in Vienna. And based on the emerging data and it\u2019s really just merging we will then make a decision to go into Phase III and that could happen sometime in the second half of this year, yes.","Howard Liang","And just a follow-up, have you made it into a single tablet?","Norbert Bischofberger","Yes, it kind of goes without saying that all the combination we will doing the single-tablet regimens, yes.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Skorney from Robert W. Baird.","Brian Skorney","Just on the 250,000 patient number that you have been talking about for this year, if we look back last year at IMS and something health data, NRx is actually a really good surrogates for the numbers you have being given us for new patients. But if I look back like the last couple of weeks of total NRxs I mean it would indicate that if annualized and it actually sees somewhere around 300,000 patients in 2015 and that\u2019s it looks so on a pretty early growth curve trajectory and that is assuming that Viekira is not being underreported at what you with the at least says but it is, -- I guess where is the disconnect there? Or what we are seeing in IMS data not actually a reflection of what you are seeing in terms of new patients coming on anymore?","John Martin","Well Brian we have put a lot of faith in a couple of data points, and so that would be my main concern there is if you are taking two points and drawing a line out for the future and there is a lot more variability that than, since we are just getting into the early part of a launch. So we will continue to monitor as will you and come up with some better idea what the long-term sustainable rate of patients is for the year.","Brian Skorney","And if I could just ask on Sovaldi can you give us any indication in terms of the breakout of usage over the last couple of months say, are we still seeing genotype 1 new patients or has this kind of become now a non-genotype 1 market here?","John Martin","Brian there a are few genotype 1 I would say that Sovaldi according to the latest research we have which is mainly around quarter four I would say that about 30% of Sovaldi use is in genotype 1, but we would imagine that would disappear fairly quickly during quarter one and quarter two.","Operator","The next question comes from Ying Huang from Bank of America.","Ying Huang","First question how should we think about European pricing, because we know that Sovaldi is priced at about 20% to 40% discounts the VAT pricing for U.S. pricing. Should we think about a Harvoni pricing in Europe at that range of discount on top of the 46% growth in that already? And then second quarter is exactly in terms of the patients taking Harvoni today, what is the percentage of patients that are F0 to F2 and how much more relaxation do you think you will get from the payors if you already have seen a significant amount of patients who are early stage? Thank you.","John Martin","Yes the European prices we are not going to go into any detail of any of our arrangements there between countries, what I can say is that we have public prices, list prices in several of the countries which are in the public domain most of those are underpinned by the positive endorsement that NICE gave in the UK which shows Sovaldi is the highly effective at that price. We do have and I have alluded to this some rebate arrangements in place which encourage significant increase of volumes in those countries. And I think that\u2019s all I can really say about the European arrangements.","Ying Huang","Sure.","John Martin","F0 to F2 we don\u2019t have very good data on this. What we do have data on is what the intension to describe rather than the prescriptions that are actually filled. So, I can say F0 to F2, the intention to describe as defined by prescriptions written in the U.S. is actually around -- a surprisingly high around 50%. We believe that the actual prescriptions filled for those fibrosis types is significantly lower historically because of all these restrictions that were put in place. So, we would anticipate that that number would increase during the first couple of quarters this year in line with the arrangements we\u2019ve signed up.","Operator","The next question comes from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn","Just wondering if you guys have, thought about a target payout ratio with respect to buybacks and dividends overtime? And then second question is just regarding, you gave us some pretty detailed data on U.S. capacity, but what about EU capacity, any color there long-term? Thanks.","Robin Washington","Hi Terence, I\u2019ll start with the first part. We don\u2019t really want to set a target, again as I mentioned earlier our focus will still be primarily share repurchases for shareholder returns and that\u2019s the level and aggressiveness with which we do them will really be based on how we feel about our evaluations. If you look over the past several years, we returned about 50 a little over 50% of our free cash flow and based on our evaluation, I mean that\u2019s an area that we\u2019re comfortable with, but we reserve the right to ratchet that down overtime I think particularly as you think about a dividend for the second half you\u2019d expect us lower share repurchases a bit.","John Martin","And the European capacity, I mean I said in my script, that so far up till the end of 2014 with just Sovaldi really in the EU we treated we think around 32,000 patients last year. Now we\u2019ve only really timed up several of the governments on Sovaldi towards the end of last year and we\u2019re moving fast with Harvoni and we would anticipate Harvoni being a far more attractive product because of its simplicity and all the other very clear benefits it has. So it's hard to say, but I think that we have got a substantial number of patients in Europe that could and should be treated it will depend somewhat on the budget tax as I\u2019ve already alluded to how strictly those are enforced. But I think we have a large and healthy growing and sustainable market in Europe for many years.","Terence Flynn","But can you give us directionally versus the U.S. the 250, the same magnitude lower or higher?","John Martin","I think it's just a really hard question to answer, I am sorry, I can\u2019t answer that, but I think that if you thought of a number north of a hundred thousand that would kind of seem logical.","Operator","The next question comes from Thomas Wei from Jefferies.","Thomas Wei","Just wanted to ask about the waterfall part perhaps fee and the bar that\u2019s missing on the diagnosed patients that are under the care of a physician? And then also wanted to ask about Simtuzumab, I thought I heard you say no activity in myelofibrosis, I thought you were looking at bone marrow biopsies there and does that mean you did not see any effect as like any anti-fibrotic effect and what do you think that in terms of NASH? Thanks.","Norbert Bischofberger","Yes, so Thomas it Norbert I\u2019ll answer the last question first, quick. And so we\u2019re looking at it in myelofibrosis, pancreatic and colorectal cancer in all of those three educations there was no activity and you're right in myelofibrosis we looked at histology at the end point and the other two indications that was PFS. But I would like to point out that it's -- myelofibrosis is biologically different from liver and pulmonary fibrosis and I do not think you can extrapolate those two diseases. So, we still have hope and somewhat confidence that it's different and we\u2019ll see that in Phase II for NASH or PSC and for IPF.","John Martin","And Thomas your first question was about the missing bar in the waterfall and we just didn\u2019t have any confidence in what number to put in for patients who are under care, we\u2019re confident in the 1.6 million people who have been diagnosed, we do recognize that a number of those have soft care directly from that bar if you will and many of if any care over the course this year and sort of bypass that middle part of the waterfall and because it's such a fast moving field and because our data is a quarter to rare as we felt it was no longer representative and so we stopped using the draft ball together the last quarter, but brought back the diagnosed bar and the overall bars for more confident that those two numbers are reasonably accurate. We just can\u2019t tell you who is in the care right now because it is moving so quickly.","Operator","And Mr. O'Brien, we have time for one more question. Our final question comes from Josh Schimmer from Piper Jaffray.","Josh Schimmer","Just given that you\u2019ve experienced rapid acceleration and then deceleration in earnings growth, is it a priority to find a more stable and sustainable face of EPS growth, and so when do you think you\u2019ll become or you\u2019ll move on to a more stable trajectory and do you believe that over the long-term you can continue to deliver double-digit earnings growth despite some of the mid to long-term headwinds? Thanks.","John Martin","Josh there is a lot of pronouncements in there. We have certainly made great progress over the last year I think we continue to make great progress and have a very reasonable stable base of business. But as always we're going invest in numbers pipeline and continuing to bring products out we have some really interesting things going on as we announced today the MMP9 antibody is moving ahead because it shows activity in two different times of very interesting long-term diseases and we'll continue to invest in products by licensing. So I feel we have as Robin said the capability financially to buy back shares to pay dividends and to invest heavily in the pipeline for the future. I frankly never have felt like the Company has been in better shape in terms of our stable base of business and our way forward. So we'll continue to focus on that.","Patrick O'Brien","Great and thank you Janney and thank you all for joining us today, we appreciate your continued interest in Gilead, the team here looks forward to providing you with updates on future progress.

My name is Candace, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead","Patrick O'Brien - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Candace. And good afternoon, everyone. Just after market close today, a press release was issued with earnings results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015. The press release and detailed slides are available on the Investor Relations section of the Gilead Sciences website.","Joining today's call will be John Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Milligan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Norbert Bischofberger, Executive Vice President of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer; Paul Carter, Executive Vice President of Commercial Operations; and Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before beginning formal remarks, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements including plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, financial projections, and the use of capital, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks, and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the latest SEC disclosure documents and recent press releases. In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.","Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings release press release, as well as on the Gilead Sciences website. I will now turn the call over to John Martin.","John C. Martin - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Patrick, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. 2015 was an exceptional year for Gilead, with progress in a number of therapeutic areas, most notably in the development of TAF-based therapies for HIV and hepatitis B and new agents for the treatment of liver disease. Gilead is entering 2016 from a position of financial strength; a portfolio of 20 marketed products that address significant unmet medical needs, including Genvoya, the most recent product to be introduced; and growing pipeline with multiple programs for which milestones are expected during the coming year, including regulatory decisions on two products for HIV and one each for HCV and HBV.","As you all know, we announced on Friday that John Milligan will be appointed CEO, a role he will assume in a few weeks. I will be taking on the role of Executive Chairman and will continue to be actively engaged in the company. John Milligan has been with Gilead for more than 25 years and over that time has built expertise in every functional area of the company's operations. The board and I are confident that this is the right time for this transition and that John is the right person to lead Gilead in the next few years of evolution.","John, congratulations. I'll now turn the call over to you to make a few remarks.","John F. Milligan - President and Chief Operating Officer","Thanks, John. I'm honored and excited by the opportunity to lead this company and the great team we have. In my new role, I will continue to work hard to help Gilead's business grow beyond antivirals and into new therapeutic areas for the betterment of patients. I'm also greatly appreciative that John will remain closely involved as the Executive Chairman.","Turning to the business and results of the quarter. Genvoya, the company's first TAF-based single-tablet regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, is now approved in the U.S. and Europe. Genvoya achieved preferred status in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services treatment guidelines within the first two weeks after approval, which speaks to the profile of the product and the important need it addresses. Two other TAF-based regimens are pending regulatory approval in the U.S. and EU. F\/TAF has been assigned a PDUFA date of April 7, and in the EU a CHMP opinion could be adopted in the first quarter of this year. R\/F\/TAF has been assigned a PDUFA date of March 1, and a CHMP opinion is expected in the second half of this year. This means that Gilead could launch two new TAF-containing products in the coming months, giving patients a wider range of options for the treatment of their HIV.","During the last quarter, four Phase 3 studies of GS-9883, Gilead's proprietary integrase inhibitor combined into a single-tablet regimen with F\/TAF, were initiated. Two studies will evaluate the safety and efficacy of GS-9883\/F\/TAF in HIV-1-infected, treatment-naive adults. One will compare GS-9883\/F\/TAF to Triumeq, and the other will compare GS-9883\/F\/TAF to dolutegravir plus F\/TAF. Two other studies will evaluate patients who switch from Triumeq or a boosted PI to GS-9883\/F\/TAF.","Phase 2 data on GS-9883\/F\/TAF will be presented later this year at a medical conference describing the safety and antiviral activity over 48 weeks of treatment. Analysis of the data through 24 weeks indicated that an STR of GS-9883\/F\/TAF may represent a valuable option for many patients. And based on current timelines, the U.S. NDA and EU MAA could be filed in the second half of next year.","Last month, Gilead submitted a new drug application in the U.S. and a marketing authorization application in the EU for TAF as a treatment for chronic hepatitis B. Regulatory submissions are also expected in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and India this year and China in the first half of 2017. Phase 3 study results reflect high efficacy and improved renal and bone safety parameters, similar to those seen in clinical studies evaluating TAF-based regimens for HIV.","Beyond TAF for HBV, several ongoing research programs are focused on therapies with finite duration of dosing that achieve long-term viral suppression. The first is an immunomodulatory approach where multiple programs are evaluating different ways to activate the immune system to eliminate infected hepatocytes. The most advanced is our TLR7 agonist, GS-9620, which is currently in two Phase 2 studies. Other approaches include the combination of novel direct-acting antivirals and agents that modulate cccDNA transcription. Two of these new programs may enter into clinical trials in the first half of 2016.","In hepatitis C, Gilead's focus remains on advancing care of people with the disease, regardless of genotype or disease severity. Since the launch of Sovaldi in December 2013 and Harvoni in October 2014, more than 770,000 individuals around the world have been treated with sofosbuvir-based regimen. In November, FDA approved Harvoni for expanded use in patients with genotype 4, 5, and 6 chronic HCV infection and in patients co-infected with HIV. In addition, Harvoni plus ribavirin for 12 weeks was approved as an alternate therapy to 24 weeks of Harvoni for treatment-experienced genotype 1 patients with cirrhosis.","Sofosbuvir and velpatasvir is an investigational once-daily pan-genotypic combination studied for the treatment of genotype 1 through 6 chronic HCV infection, including patients with compensated and decompensated cirrhosis. FDA granted priority review and has set a PDUFA date of June 28, 2016. Additionally, sofosbuvir\/velpatasvir has been granted accelerated assessment in the EU. If approved, sofosbuvir\/velpatasvir will represent a significant step forward, particularly for genotype 3 patients. It would also become the first and only regimen offering high SVR rates with 12 weeks of treatment for patients with all HCV genotypes.","The advances in treatment of HCV with Sovaldi and Harvoni over the past two years have allowed Gilead to work with governments and public health experts on eradication strategies among specific populations and geographies. Programs such as those ongoing in the Republic of Georgia and Iceland could serve as examples for other governments around the world seeking to eradicate HCV.","Public health programs to prevent HIV transmission are also underway, including efforts to raise awareness about the use of Truvada for PrEP. Today, more than 40,000 patients in the U.S. are receiving Truvada for its preventative indication. Yesterday, the MAA was validated for Gilead's Type II variation of Truvada for PrEP, and it is now under evaluation by the EMA.","Gilead continues its R&D efforts in NASH, or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Phase 2 studies of simtuzumab, a LOXL2-targeting antibody, are ongoing in patients with NASH and also primary sclerosing cholangitis. The data monitoring committee for these studies recently met and recommended the continuation of the studies, which have a 96-week endpoint. Additionally, clinical studies of the FXR agonist GS-9674 have been initiated, with the first patients receiving treatment in Q4 of last year.","Moving to oncology, Gilead continues to study Zydelig in several hematological disorders. Phase 3 study results show adding Zydelig to bendamustine and rituximab provides statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in progression-free and overall survival compared to bendamustine and rituximab alone. Supplemental regulatory filings are planned in the U.S. and Europe early this year to include these important new data. Beyond Zydelig, Gilead also is exploring novel combinations of investigational therapies for a range of cancers, including four classes of kinase inhibitors, PI3K, SYK, JAK, and BTK, that each target different signaling pathways.","Progress has been made in inflammation as well. Gilead entered into a global partnership with Galapagos late last year for the development and commercialization of filgotinib, a JAK1 inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases. Phase 2 trial data show that filgotinib has the potential to be an effective and well-tolerated oral therapy for patients with RA and Crohn's disease. Phase 3 studies of filgotinib in RA and Crohn's are planned to start later this year.","In summary, Gilead's substantial pipeline offers numerous opportunities for continued growth, both in the short and longer term, and the financial strength of the company allows us to be thoughtful and opportunistic in pursuing partnerships or acquisitions that will further expand the future portfolio of products. 2016 will be a busy year for Gilead, and I want to take this opportunity to thank all of our employees for their support in this transition, and for their continued hard work and dedication.","Paul Carter will now provide a commercial update.","Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations","Thanks, John, and good afternoon everyone. Gilead achieved $8.4 billion in net product revenue in the fourth quarter, representing 16% year-over-year growth. U.S. product revenue reached $4.8 billion in the fourth quarter, which is down 14% from the third quarter and down 12% on a year-over-year basis, largely due to a decrease of HCV revenue. European product revenue reached $1.7 billion in the quarter, which was in line with the prior quarter and up 22% on a year-over-year basis, despite a negative 11% foreign exchange impact. For the rest of the world, product revenues were $1.9 billion for the fourth quarter and $3.8 billion for the full year, driven largely by HCV launches in Japan.","Beginning with hepatitis C, total HCV product revenue reached $4.9 billion in the fourth quarter. In the next few minutes, I'll describe the results for quarter four by region and also describe how we're thinking about the year ahead. In the United States, HCV product revenue totaled $2.4 billion, which is down 27% from the third quarter. This decline was impacted by substantially lower VA sales in the fourth quarter. In quarter three, Congress allocated an additional $500 million to the VA for HCV treatment, and this was fully utilized in quarter three. New patient starts in the VA were very limited during quarter four due to the uncertainty of future funding at that time. Congress has since allocated substantial funding of $1.5 billion for the fiscal year, which will allow treatment in the VA to resume this quarter.","In terms of patient numbers in 2015, nearly 250,000 U.S. HCV patients started treatment, with more than 90% of these patients receiving Gilead HCV therapies. As I commented last quarter, there were an unusually large number of patient starts in the U.S. in the first quarter of last year, indicative of the rapid initiation of treatment for many warehoused patients, followed by a flattening of patients in the remaining quarters of the year.","Looking to the future, even with nearly 400,000 patients treated since the launch of Sovaldi, there remain more than 3 million HCV-infected individuals in the U.S. who have yet to be treated, approximately half of whom are diagnosed according to recent CDC data. Long-term education and awareness efforts to increase rates of diagnosis and the flow of HCV-infected patients into treated care are important and will play out over many years, as we know from our experience in HIV.","Turning to Europe, hepatitis C revenue was $846 million in the fourth quarter. And we estimate that more than 110,000 patients were treated with sofosbuvir-based regimens in 2015. Following the normal summer seasonality in quarter three, there was an increase of patient starts throughout Europe in quarter four, including in the UK following the final appraisal determination for Harvoni from NICE. A number of countries in Europe have volume-based incentives for Sovaldi and Harvoni, which serve to encourage a higher number of patients being treated. In quarter four, the growth in revenues did not match the growth in patient starts because of the impact of certain volume-based agreements, combined with adverse foreign exchange movements.","In Japan, hepatitis C revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.4 billion. Since the launch of Sovaldi in May and the launch of Harvoni in September, sales of $1.9 billion have been generated in Japan, with Harvoni representing more than $1 billion of that number. In late December, pricing and reimbursement negotiations for Sovaldi and Harvoni in Australia were finalized.","There are a number of variables to consider when thinking about HCV patient numbers and revenues for 2016. Patient starts in the U.S. will likely be similar to 2015 levels, both observed in the second half and extrapolated for the full year, while the Europe numbers will continue to grow as early launch markets stabilize and new markets ramp up treatment. In Japan, patient numbers are difficult to predict because launches are still in the early stages, and to some extent, we are likely seeing the impact of warehoused patients. In the rest of the world, we're excited to reach new patients in several new markets, notably in Asia-Pacific and in Latin America.","As we think about revenue, we anticipate that variables to consider include potential shorter durations of treatment, the full-year effect of payer contracts in the U.S., and by price volume deals in some European markets, which may allow more patients to be treated at a lower per-patient cost. We also anticipate that payer mix in the U.S. may shift slightly towards public payers, while in Japan, new legislation will likely result in lower pricing for Sovaldi and Harvoni.","We're confident in the long-term sustainability of HCV markets worldwide. Despite the number of patients treated to date, there are still millions of HCV-infected individuals who have yet to be treated and many that have yet to be diagnosed. There are significant efforts under way by industry, governments, and patient organizations to increase rates of diagnosis and linkage to care.","We're also confident in our competitive position as we enter 2016. Sovaldi and Harvoni are breakthrough therapies that set the bar with cure rates of up to 99%. Data presented at AASLD in November show real-world cure rates with Harvoni that met or exceeded what was predicted by clinical trials, including the eight-week duration of therapy. We also look forward to launching our next HCV product, sofosbuvir\/velpatasvir, in due course around the world, starting later this year.","Turning to HIV, HIV product revenue reached $3 billion in the fourth quarter. In the U.S., revenues were $2 billion, a 3% increase from the third quarter and up 5% on a year-over-year basis, driven by the continued demand for Stribild, Complera, Truvada, and the recent launch of Genvoya. Stribild and Complera have a strong underlying prescription demand with year-on-year growth of 40% and 12% respectively. Seven out of 10 HIV patients in the U.S. initiate therapy with a Gilead product, and nearly six in 10 receive a Gilead single-tablet regimen.","Genvoya sales have been very encouraging in the first few weeks of launch. Revenues for the quarter were $44 million, with early product uptake well ahead of the launch of Stribild at the same time point. Access and reimbursement have been consistent with historical norms in HIV, and the rapid addition of Genvoya to the DHHS treatment guidelines as a preferred first-line treatment reinforces the safety and efficacy profile observed in clinical trials and reflected in our product label.","In Europe, HIV revenues were $747 million for the quarter, up 4% from the third quarter, driven by the sales of Stribild and Eviplera, with a slight decline year over year caused by foreign exchange. Seven out of 10 patients in Europe also started on a Truvada-based backbone in 2015. Genvoya was launched in Europe in November. Similar to the U.S., we are seeing encouraging early product uptake in the six countries launched during the fourth quarter. A final comment on HIV is that the commercial organization is getting ready to execute the launches of R\/F\/TAF and F\/TAF in the next months.","Turning to other therapy areas, total revenue for products outside of HIV and HCV, which includes Zydelig, AmBisome, Cayston, Letairis, and Ranexa, totaled $1.9 billion in 2015 and grew 16% year over year. Over the last quarter, progress has been made in the area of cardiovascular disease. Since the inclusion of the AMBITION data in the Letairis label, we've seen a great deal of interest and engagement from the medical community. Revenue for the full year for Letairis reached $700 million, and market share for the products among patients initiating therapy is nearly 50%.","In closing, Gilead had a remarkable 2015. The commercial organization's excited about the opportunities across all of Gilead's therapeutic areas, both in the near term and over the longer term, to help many more patients around the world.","And I'll now turn the call over to Robin.","Robin L. Washington - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to share full-year and fourth quarter 2015 financial results and provide 2016 guidance.","For the fourth quarter, total revenues were $8.5 billion, up 16% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Net income for the quarter was $4.7 billion or $3.18 per diluted share, compared to $3.5 billion or $2.18 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the fourth quarter was $3.32 per share, up 37% compared to the fourth quarter 2014.","Turning to fiscal year 2015, full-year total revenues were $32.6 billion, up 31% year over year. Net income for the year was $18.1 billion or $11.91 per diluted share, compared to $12.1 billion or $7.35 per diluted share for 2014. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $12.61 per share for the year, up 56% year over year. Product sales during the year were $32.2 billion, up 31% year over year. HCV product sales increased year over year to $19.1 billion, up 54%, and non-HCV product sales increased year over year to $13 billion, up 8%.","The increase in HCV product sales for the year was primarily driven by sales of Harvoni, which launched in October 2014. Further, the annualized HCV growth-to-net estimate that was shared with you during the Q4 earnings call a year ago is on target and reflected in our 2015 results. Non-HCV product sales growth for the year was primarily driven by Stribild and Complera\/Eviplera, partially offset by Atripla.","Turning to expenses for the full year 2015, non-GAAP R&D expenses were $2.8 billion, up 10% compared to the prior year, reflecting the continued progression of our product pipeline. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $3.2 billion, up 17% compared to the prior year, driven by expenses to support our growth and geographic expansion. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the full year was 16.2%, which was lower compared to guidance, due to the permanent extension of the federal R&D credit that was passed in December. If you recall, the permanent extension of the credit was not included in 2015 guidance. Cash flows from operations were $20.3 billion for the full year 2015 and $4.9 billion for the fourth quarter.","With respect to shareholder returns, $3.1 billion in cash was utilized to repurchase 29 million shares during the quarter, bringing total 2015 share repurchases to $10 billion and 95 million shares. Including the Q2 2015 warrant settlement of $3.9 billion, dividends, and share repurchases, Gilead has returned more than $15 billion in cash to shareholders in 2015. Earlier today, we announced an increase of the quarterly dividend from $0.43 per share to $0.47 per share, which will become effective in the second quarter of 2016, subject to a declaration by the board of directors.","Additionally, the board authorized a new $12 billion share repurchase program to be initiated after the completion of the current $15 billion program, which, as of December 31, 2015, had $8 billion remaining. Also announced was the utilization of $5 billion of the current program to enter into an accelerated share repurchase agreement, which is expected to be completed in the next three months. This is in addition to the ongoing open market share repurchases that have continued under the current share repurchase program since January of this year.","The increase in the dividend and increased level of share repurchases underscore the confidence of the board and management and the strength of the business and future cash flows. Since 2010, in addition to financing ongoing R&D programs and business development activities, more than 75% of free cash flows were returned to shareholders, and share count was reduced in excess of 20% while maintaining and improving investment-grade credit ratings, which Gilead values.","Looking forward, the plan is to continue to return a significant component of free cash flows to shareholders via share repurchases and increases to our dividend over time. As in the past, there could be future periods of time when share repurchases are reduced due to acquisitions and other pipeline investments that are prioritized to drive future long-term growth. This strategy provides agility and financial flexibility to support R&D investments, as well as any future acquisitions or partnership opportunities we may consider.","Finally, I would like to cover full-year 2016 non-GAAP financial guidance, summarized on slide 51 in the earnings presentation available on the Gilead website. Product sales are expected to be in the range of $30 billion to $31 billion. Guidance for product sales is subject to a number of uncertainties, including an uncertain global macroeconomic environment; adoption of additional pricing measures to reduce HCV spending; volatility in foreign currency exchange rates; inaccuracy in HCV patient start estimates; additional competitive launches in HCV; an increase in discounts, chargebacks, and rebates due to ongoing contracts and future negotiations with commercial and government payers; and a larger-than-anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments such as PHS, FFS, Medicaid, and the VA.","Non-GAAP product gross margins are expected to be in the range of 88% to 90%. Non-GAAP R&D expenses are expected to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion as a result of the continued investment in our product pipeline. This includes the financial impact of the Galapagos collaboration, which closed in January.","Non-GAAP SG&A expenses are expected to be in the range of $3.3 billion to $3.6 billion. This reflects an estimated $200 million increase for the U.S.-branded prescription drug fee. Please note that 2015 included a favorable adjustment of approximately $100 million based on the receipt of the 2015 invoice from the IRS.","For the full year, the non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 18% to 20%. This includes the impact of the federal R&D tax credit, which was permanently extended at the end of 2015, and the increase for the U.S.-branded prescription drug fee, which is not tax deductible. Full-year diluted EPS impact of acquisition-related restructuring and stock-based compensation expenses is expected to be in the range of $1.10 to $1.16 per share.","In closing, we are pleased with 2015 accomplishments across the organization. Thank you, and we look forward to updating you on our progress. Let's now open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Carter Gould - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, guys. This is Carter Gould on for Geoff. Congrats on the quarter. With regard to 2016 guidance, how should we think about the top line guidance and what that implies for any loosening of restrictions in the lower fibrosis score groups or any changes in net pricing? And if maybe that's a little more detail than you're ready to go into, maybe you can just frame how we should think about these levers in 2016 relative to 2015. Thank you.","Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations","Okay. So I think I said in the script that we should anticipate in the United States that 2016 revenues should be more or less based on the second half of 2015, extrapolated for the year. I also mentioned that we had some lumpiness in the second half of the year due to the purchasing profile of the VA. And we anticipate that that will smooth out during the course of this year.","I've also said numerous times before that in quarter one last year, we had a very large bulbous of warehoused patients being treated, which of course we're unlikely to see again. But to some extent, that gets substituted as the payers, commercial payers that are well known are beginning to loosen restrictions. So there's a few dynamics in the U.S., but I think the way that I would look at it is a fairly flat, stable, perhaps marginally growing number of patients flowing into treatment. If we see public payers stepping up, like Medicaids and perhaps the correctional facilities start treating more patients, then patient numbers could go higher than that in 2016.","There's a few other factors which I also mentioned as we think about the revenue aspect as opposed to just patient numbers. The less sick patients, GT1 patients that qualify, are more likely to be using the eight-week Harvoni treatment duration. And of course, therefore revenue per patient would come down proportionately. Having said that, the offset is that budgets for treating patients go up, and we would like to think that more patients could be treated. So I think that's sort of the main things.","I think from the competitive point of view, we feel very confident that our label is very strong and that we're very much supported by the real-world data we've seen since the launch of Harvoni with very high SVR rates and a very strong safety profile, at least as good if not better than the one that was used in our registrational trials. So I think we feel good about the year. The U.S. is fairly steady and possibly could even grow, as I said, if some restrictions are loosened and public payers step up.","Around the world, as I mentioned, we expect patient numbers to grow in Europe. They've started to stabilize in the major markets now, again following more or less the shape of the curve in the U.S., where there was a large lump because of warehoused patients being treated initially. That is smoothing out now, and many of the smaller markets are now beginning to come onstream. And so we should see higher number of patients in Europe, but the same thing, we're likely to see more patients being treated with shorter durations. And as I also mentioned, we do have a number of price-volume agreements in place, which are deliberately incentivized to encourage higher volumes of patients being treated, but at a lower revenue per patient, if you like. So we should think about that.","And then around the rest of the world, Japan, I mentioned very early days. We're still in that warehousing phase I think in Japan, although we're very pleased with the launch there so far. And then there are various other smaller markets around the world, and medium-sized markets, Australia being one of the medium-sized markets that are yet to launch yet. So we have plenty of patients around the world, but there are some other dynamics, as I said, around shorter treatment and of course the competitive situation.","Carter Gould - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Volodymyr Nikolenko - Evercore ISI","Hi, guys. Thank you. It's actually Vlad Nikolenko on behalf of Mark Schoenebaum. I have a question about filgotinib specific JAK1 inhibitor, the one that you got from Galapagos. Just to hear your thoughts about testicular tox concerns on filgotinib, as well as whether your base case will be a 200 milligrams daily dose going forward in the years. And sort of somewhat related questions, what exactly impact on your 2016 guidance on R&D expenses from Galapagos collaboration? Thank you.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer","Yeah, so maybe I could answer the first few questions. So we were very excited about filgotinib because of the clinical profile. As you know, they have now data. Galapagos has generated data in RA and also Crohn's. Both of those have very remarkable efficacy. And also importantly, we think that filgotinib can be distinguished from competitors because of its safety profile, in particular the lack of hemoglobin decreases and very low infection rates.","The other thing you asked about, the dose, that still needs to be negotiated with the FDA. We actually have a meeting coming up in the next couple of months where we will talk about, in detail, the Phase 3 program design, including the doses. So it's really, at this point, too early to say what the dose will be.","Robin L. Washington - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","This is Robin to answer the second part of your question. We really have included, relative to the collaboration, some of the upfront milestone payments, as well as the cost associated with some of the Phase 3 trials that Norbert just spoke about. So we don't break it out in detail, but I would assume a couple of hundred million incremental to 2015 included in our guidance to support those projects.","Volodymyr Nikolenko - Evercore ISI","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Roden of UBS. Your line is now open.","Matt M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much for taking the question, and congrats to John Martin for an amazing 20 years at the helm here. So I have a big-picture question \u2013 seems like a good time to ask it, I guess, with the transition \u2013 is over the last two years, you've tripled your revenues, you've increased your earnings by about six fold over that period. The market seems to be discounting your ability to grow the business from here. Just wanted to see if you could maybe lay out a vision of the development of the various franchises that you have. You have lots going on in cancer. You've added to the inflammation franchise, you have TAF and 9883 in HIV. Just wondering if you could just maybe shine the light on how you visualize the growth out to say 2020, something like that? It would be really helpful to hear your thoughts. Thanks.","John F. Milligan - President and Chief Operating Officer","Matt, this is John Milligan. I assume the question's for me, not the congratulatory one to John Martin.","Matt M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC","Whoever will take it.","John F. Milligan - President and Chief Operating Officer","So whoever will take it. Well, I'll take it; I'd be happy to. So It's a really good question. So you're right, we've faced an extraordinary time when we've been able to triple revenue over the last couple of years, which is a very unusual thing for an organization to be able to do. And we're moving our pipeline along as fast as we can. And as we mentioned, there are some very interesting opportunities for us.","So we do see very good opportunities in organic growth. I have great confidence in the HIV portfolio that with the three STRs we talked about on the call today and the other STR being developed by our partner, Janssen, that we'll have a very meaningful, continued growth of both patients and revenues in the future in HIV; I think that's a very important thing for us. We're continuing to accelerate HCV to bring sof\/velpatasvir to market and try to work in more countries than we ever have before. So those are important initiatives on things that are current to market.","We're very excited about filgotinib. I think there's great opportunities for us in inflammatory diseases. We haven't spoken about it very much about it in the past, and sort of quietly we've been investigating our MMP9 antibody, 5745, which we didn't talk about on this call, which now has positive data in three of the four indications we've looked at in inflammatory diseases, with a fourth under investigation. And so not only do we have filgotinib potentially for RA and inflammatory diseases, but we have an antibody which has a mechanism, which is very refractory to current care. It could be a good beginning to an inflammatory disease franchise.","Of course, you mentioned the kinase inhibitors that we have for oncology. There's always the potential that those could be useful in various diseases in combination with filgotinib as well and we will explore that, although I still think the vast value of it is the fact that it's a very good-looking drug and some very positive data in Crohn's disease. So we are going down the pathway of inflammatory diseases by virtue of the successes we've had in our pipeline and successes in licensing.","In oncology, Zydelig has been a good start for us. We really need to continue to try to ramp up our efforts in this area and to continue to broaden the areas we want to work in. It's pretty clear we have to do additional partnerships or find other avenues to broaden the revenue stream there for the future. And as Robin mentioned, with our balance sheet, we have the great flexibility of doing partnerships or acquisitions that could get us there. And so that would be an important consideration for us. That may not be the only avenue. We'd also look at other areas where we could bring in different programs, potentially accelerating to revenue as soon as possible in some of those areas when those things are available. And I'd say the environment has shifted dramatically in our favor for doing those sorts of partnerships and whatnot. So that's a good \u2013 2016, I believe, will be a good year for us, because of the strengths of the underlying business and the economic uncertainty that's driving the market today.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer","John, can I add something, maybe?","John F. Milligan - President and Chief Operating Officer","Please.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer","I would like to reiterate what Robin said in her script. If you look back at the last six years, it has been remarkable. We have done many, many deals \u2013 CGI, Arresto, Calistoga, Pharmasset, Galapagos \u2013 and yet, we were able to return 70% out of free cash flow to shareholders. So I think that is a good way to think about the future, to in-license through collaborative efforts while at the same time returning money to shareholders.","Matt M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks, and my congrats to John Milligan as well. Looking forward to a new era. I wanted to ask a bit of a two-part question. One was you gave some guidance here, and remarkably like the last question, it actually looks like you're a little bit flattish or whatnot this year. Do you expect qualitatively to be growing over the next year? And, two, do you expect that this is a bit of trough revenue here? I just wanted to get your view on that. And, importantly, when you look at managed care \u2013 second part of the question \u2013 look at managed care, given that there's a new competitor on board, do you expect minimal to no changes or minimal changes in terms of access and things like that? Just given the new competition, can you talk a little about that? And there's a little bit of nervousness on how that may change things on the payer front. Thanks.","John F. Milligan - President and Chief Operating Officer","Michael, it's John Milligan. First of all, thank you for the congratulations. Second of all, unfortunately, we can't tell you about revenue growth beyond \u2013 we have a lot of opportunities, but obviously we don't give 2017 or beyond guidance. In this business, you almost have to take things one year at a time, especially in hepatitis C as we understand the rate of diagnosis and patients coming into care, which is \u2013 there's great opportunity out there with a 1.5 million patients, as Paul mentioned, still being diagnosed but not yet under care. So really good opportunities for us.","With regard to the competition coming to market, we have a very, very strong position. But I'm going to turn this over to Paul because he'd like to give you some of his thoughts on what the competitive landscape looks like versus Harvoni.","Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations","Yeah, thanks, John. I mean, I think if we cast our minds back 12 months, we had the first competitor coming into the hepatitis C space. And I think the managed care view at that time was that these products were interchangeable and could be treated like commodities to some extent, which really triggered off the pricing and negotiations we saw in the early part of last year. That has been proven to be a totally incorrect view of the hepatitis C products. And what we've seen, fortunately with Harvoni in particular, is the real-world data has really strengthened its position and people's understanding of what that product does. It cures people with an incredibly high SVR rate, and the safety profile has been extremely good and in line, if not better, than its label.","That hasn't been the case of competitor products so far. In fact, we've seen safety warnings added to labels, and we've seen a differentiation. And that's played out in the market. So I think, as we see a new competitor coming into the market now, payers are really thinking this through. There isn't any kind of instinctive reactions. People are being very thoughtful, and we notice because we have very close discussions with the managed care main players, and we're working with them as they think through this. And I think we feel pretty confident that we'll maintain a strong position as we enter 2016.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question, and I want to extend my congratulations to both Johns. I thought if I could just ask two related specific questions. So first, Paul, maybe \u2013 I just want to make sure I understand what you're trying to say with respect to U.S. HCV volumes. If we look at the two volumes and the numbers you've given us in the third and the fourth quarter, it's about 105,000 patients together, which is about 210,000 on a full-year basis, which is below the 236,000 you guys reported. And if I take the low end of the 47,000, which it sounds like you're saying is too low because of the VA from the fourth quarter, that's 188,000 annualized. So I just \u2013 if you can just give us some direction on \u2013 I'm sure you're not going to tell us a number \u2013 around those numbers, just so we're clear on exactly what you're trying to say. And then maybe related to that, can you specifically address where you think access is going to go from Medicaid in prisons this year? Thanks.","Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations","Sure. So if you've got your pencil ready, these are the numbers that I think happened last year. In fact, I'll take you back even into quarter four 2014, where we think 46,000 HCV starts were in the market. This is total starts, by the way. In quarter one 2015, there were 72,000. That really was the peak of this warehoused patient part of the curve. Then drop down into quarter two of 65,000. There were still some of those warehoused patients coming through. And then quarter three was 62,000, and quarter four was 50,000. We know that in quarter three, a lot of patients were treated by the VA, who by the way seem to be incredibly efficient at getting patients into treatment. And we know that in quarter four, very few patients were initiated by the VA. So I think if you do the basic math on that, we'd get up to about 230,000-something, forecasting that forward into 2016 if you assume the VA picks up.","Then I think this sort of merges into the second part of your question, which is what happens with Medicaid and other public payers who to date have really treated very, very few people. So our assumption is they're still not going to treat that many more patients this year, is the way we're thinking forward, but we are hopeful that that will be a trend that improves over time as people start to see how effective these drugs are and particularly the eight-week usage of Harvoni, which, as I've mentioned, in the real world seems to be incredibly effective and offers very good value. So that's how we're thinking about it. I hope that's clear.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Cory Kasimov of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Thank you, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions, and also my congrats to both John and John on a great run and a great opportunity. So wanted to ask about longer-term trends, the evolution of the HCV market. I know it's hard for everyone to get their hands around it, but you indicated again there are about 3 million HCV patients in the U.S. that have yet to be treated. About half of those are diagnosed. In terms of new patients that are entering the system, how similar or different are they from the existing patients or those that have already been cured in terms of I guess the overall motivation to be treated, fibrosis score, insurance coverage? We get a lot of questions on, are these future patients actually legitimate candidates in terms of being under the care of a doc, not IV drug users, et cetera. So can you just comment, try to give us a little bit more comfort on how we can be thinking about this longer term evolution in the U.S.? Thanks.","Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations","So, Cory, I've mentioned before that we have some proprietary research that we do to try and monitor the flow of patients into treated care, and that means people who are diagnosed with hepatitis C and are registered with a hepatitis C prescriber. And that number has been remarkably consistent at around \u2013 we have actually three different sources of data, and it's around high 20,000s to 30,000 patients a month have been falling into that category. So they're diagnosed with HCV and they're registered with a treater. So if you do the math on that, clearly that's 360,000 patients coming into treatment a year, and we're seeing treatment levels a lot lower than that. What that speaks to is the types of patients are different amongst that 360,000 group, and their sort of pathway to actual treatment varies considerably.","But there does appear, again doing the math and assuming the research is correct, that there is a line at the door of patients that still need to be treated and are accessible. I don't think those are the people that are, let's say out of society or these are people that are accessible, and for one reason or another reason, they haven't started treatment yet. But there's a strong flow of patients still out there, and I don't think we're anywhere near getting to the point where we're dealing with patients that are extremely difficult, let's say, to manage.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, and our next comes from Phil Nadeau of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question, and let me add my congratulations to John Martin and John Milligan. John Milligan, a question for you. I found it interesting that in your prepared remarks, right after you were introduced, you mentioned that you wanted to take Gilead into therapeutic areas outside of antivirals. And I know in an answer to a prior question, you went through the assets you have in other areas. But I'm curious whether you're signaling a need for even more assets in those areas, and in particular, if you had a shopping list, which areas would be on the top of your list?","John F. Milligan - President and Chief Operating Officer","So I mean, it's pretty clear we've done some great things in HIV and HCV, but for the company to grow, we have to work in other areas. That doesn't mean that we're not going to continue to work in hepatitis B, which is important to us, and there is the potential to cure that disease. We all recognize that is a hard thing to do, as well as curing HIV, which is an equally or harder thing to do, perhaps.","So that does imply that we have to go outside of antivirals for continued growth, and we're interested in doing that as we've been hiring and growing with new things in our portfolio over a number of years. And I think I have some good core teams that can help us grow into those areas. And so the answer is yeah, we're very interested in acquiring assets through partnerships or potentially acquisition that could help us grow in those areas. And with the tripling of our revenue over the last few years, the need to do so sooner rather than later is heightened.","That being said, we want to get the right assets at the right price. And so we have the flexibility certainly with our balance sheet, in the current business, to be patient to get things \u2013 to not be forced into doing something before we want to. And so we are looking in the area of oncology. We are looking at additional things in inflammatory diseases and things that are adjacent to there, to see what opportunities might fit within our portfolio, so that we can create a really strong franchise like we have in HIV and HCV with multiple options for success in those areas.","Some of it will depend on what happens in our portfolio this year as we make progress with our MMP9 antibody or not. Obviously we're looking heavily in NASH with the FXR agonist. We're very interested in liver diseases, so that's a very important area for us, and we'll continue to try to bolster those to make sure that the company has the assets necessary to have the progress for the future.","Is there a shopping list? There's always a list that you have in your mind or sometimes on paper. That's probably dangerous, so mine's in my mind, in which I think about things that would be important for us or things that could have the right opportunity at the right price. Whether or not those things ever come to fruition depends on a lot of factors. But clearly we're going to be very interested in taking a look this year.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC","And with the assets having sold off pretty aggressively in the public markets over the last several months, does that make things more attractive to you, or is it really about getting the right asset that's derisked and price is secondary?","John F. Milligan - President and Chief Operating Officer","Well, it makes it more attractive, there's no question.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great, thanks for taking my question.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from Ying Huang of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. First one on maybe pricing trend. If my math is right, if you take about $5.6 billion you booked in second half, divided by about 112,000 patients, starting treatment, you're looking at roughly $50,000 per patient revenue in the U.S. in the second half of 2015. So now, with Merck's new drug they are launching in HCV, how should we think about pricing trend in the market in 2016? And then also I have a question about the diagnosis rate. Based on experience you have in the field, can you provide a little bit more color on the rate of newly diagnosed patients in HCV? Thanks.","Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations","Well, maybe I'll talk about pricing first of all. I mean, I think everyone knows this, but it's really net prices that are the important number here for payers in the U.S. and indeed in Europe. So there seem to be over the last few days somewhat of misinformation or confusion around the WAC price and discounts. So we feel that our pricing is extremely competitive and offers very, very good value given the competitive set. And as I said earlier, payers in the U.S. this time around are taking a very much more thoughtful look at the labels and trying to make sure they do the right thing for their clients. And so we feel pretty strong and pretty confident in the solid basis, let's say, of our price in the U.S. market. And the second question was about HCV.","Patrick O'Brien - Vice President, Investor Relations","Percentage of newly diagnosed patients.","John F. Milligan - President and Chief Operating Officer","I think that's a hard thing to get at. We still see about 30,000 patients coming into care every month. So that's been an interesting metric for us, because more patients are coming into care than are being treated. We don't know how many are newly diagnosed and how many are coming out of the bucket of diagnosed patients. But it is interesting to note that our most recent data still suggests there's about 1.5 million patients diagnosed in America, which means that \u2013 and that was about 1.6 million when we launched Sovaldi. So that implies that there has been a refilling of that bucket, a replenishment, if you will.","I don't know if buckets are the right way to think of it, but in this category of patient, as more patients are being diagnosed and working their way through the system. So we don't have a firm handle on the exact numbers, so that's the closest approximation I can give you. But it does suggest that there's a pretty good flow of patients who are now becoming aware and coming in to at least be diagnosed. We don't know the characterization of those patients. There was an earlier question about whether those are patients eligible for treatment, since many of the Medicaids are not treating many patients, and that's something we're trying to figure out right now.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer","And Ying, I may want to add that there's the CDC recommendation about general diagnosis. We have a number of projects in a number of American cities to look at subpopulations that we test, and we demonstrate that you can actually have fairly high diagnosis rates up, to 20% in some of these populations. And I think as people become aware of these things, I think the diagnosis will increase. That's our belief.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, Norbert.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Alethia Young of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And to both Johns, congrats on a great history and a great future. Two questions; they're sort of \u2013 one's quick. In Japan, can you just help us understand, like kind of think about this, whether it's a 12% or maybe perhaps the larger kind of 50% range of discount when it comes to what kind of a pricing discount will happen? And then also, just on Genvoya, I was just \u2013 and I saw Stribild was down a little bit in new start and total share. So I just wanted to understand if you think the total lion's share is coming from Stribild or do you think there's like some maybe Atripla kind of new starts or maybe switches coming in with the Genvoya launch? Thanks.","Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations","Okay. Maybe I'll comment on Japan. We are fully aware of the new pricing regulation that's just been introduced in Japan. We are, let's say, highly confident that that will affect Harvoni and Sovaldi in Japan. We're not totally certain yet on the number or the timing of that, of that likely price cut, but we have factored that into our guidance. And the second question was on Stribild -","John F. Milligan - President and Chief Operating Officer","And switches from Genvoya.","Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations","And switches from Genvoya.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And Genvoya.","Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations","Yeah, yeah. Well, Genvoya's got off to a really good start. We think that about 80% of the Genvoya business to date is from switches, and we think that the majority of those switches are actually from Stribild so far. So that probably accounts for the Stribild share number. We think, of the switches to Genvoya, about 10% of those switches so far have come from non-Gilead products. So we're pleased with the pace of switching, and we're pleased that we're also getting some incremental growth.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Abrahams of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC","Hi. My congratulations to John Martin on all your accomplishments as CEO and to John Milligan on your well-deserved new role. So a question related to the inflammatory franchise. Historically, you guys have had a lot of success developing and commercializing products with best-in-class features along efficacy, safety, and dosing that enable you to really dominate a space, such as an HIV and hep C. RA and inflammatory bowel diseases are a little bit different. They're a lot more crowded. Wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of the ways you're thinking about conducting the development paths for drugs like filgotinib and 5745 to maximize differentiation. Perhaps maybe you could talk about combination opportunities there and how this ties into your long-term commercial strategy as you enter these new therapeutic areas.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer","Yeah, so, Brian, as I said before, we believe filgotinib by itself, if you compare it with other JAK inhibitors, is a very valuable franchise. It has a good efficacy, and it could have safety advantages. And I'm saying it could have because I'm making cross-study comparisons, so until we do a large Phase 3 program, we don't really know that for certain. But then as you pointed out, where we have to work fairly quickly want to go with filgotinib is in combination therapy.","We believe that in inflammatory bowel disease and also RA, there's a huge unmet need still. If you look at some of the ACR20 responses, they're up to 80% but ACR70s are only in the teens or 20% at most. So that means there's a huge improvement left to be done, and that, we believe, could be done with combination therapies. We're going to go ahead and combine our JAK inhibitor with our MMP9. That's going to be the first thing. And afterwards also possibly with the SYK compounds and the BTK inhibitors. That's where we think we could have a big impact on the future of the treatment of inflammatory conditions.","Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, Norbert.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Skorney of Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.","Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question, and my congratulations too to John and John. Just two, I guess. I guess the first question is in terms of Japanese sales, I understand there's a government-mandated price cut given the revenue that Sovaldi and Harvoni are generating. Could you just walk us through how that flows as of Jan. 1? And can you give us a scale of what we should expect for the price cut? And then just to dig down a little more on Merck's pricing and how it impacts you guys, I think we were all surprised by the quickness in the gross-to-net discounts that AbbVie and you had applied for the initial launches. I guess the question is, Merck clearly is going to take a pretty substantial discount versus what you guys have out. Are you at a point where you're comfortable enough in the profile that you're drawing a line in the sand to say you're essentially not going to be discounting anymore?","Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations","Let me start by talking about Japan, Brian. We're not going to say what our assumption is around the tax outcome. I mean, I think I already said before, we understand the rules. It's pretty clear what the range is. And we're going to be somewhere in that range, and we're also not sure exactly the timing of that. But we've built an assumption into our guidance that we've given, and I can't really comment further on that at this point.","Then on the gross-to-net, I mean, I think your question is, are we confident enough to walk away? And I think the answer is yes, we are. But we're hopeful that our close discussions with payers and the strength of our label and the strength of the \u2013 sorry, the relative strength of our label as compared to the competitors, and of course this enormous wealth of real-world data that we've got gives us a position where we sincerely hope the right thing is done for patients and patients get access to our medicines. So I think that's the way we think about it.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer","And, Brian, other than the costs of drug, you should also consider of course the cost of treatment. There is a genotype required for genotype 1a, the resistance test will cost about $700, and incurs some time delay. There's tests for ALTs at eight weeks and at 12 weeks if you have to dose for 16 weeks. And also, it's possible that \u2013 well, a fairly significant number of the genotype 1a patients, and you know those are 50% in U.S., they will require 16 weeks with ribavirin. So that's not \u2013 it's more than \u2013 it increases the treatment cost proportionally compared to 12 weeks or eight weeks in our case with Harvoni.","Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations","But I think the good news, just to reemphasize, is that the payers across the United States are being very cognizant of this and thinking carefully. The full implications and not being dazzled by the headlines of a low WAC price.","Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Got you. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And we have time for one more question. Our final question comes from the line of Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I have two, because I'm guessing you might not want to answer the first one. But just for Robin on capital allocation, you mentioned 77% of free cash flow returned from 2010 through 2015. As you look forward, do you guys have a target payout ratio in mind? And then the second one was just on EU hep C patient volumes in 2016. Paul, you gave us a lot of context for U.S., but maybe just if you could be a little bit more specific in terms of actually thinking about volumes in Europe? Thanks.","Robin L. Washington - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Terence. I'll take the first one. You're right, I'm not going give a specific number. And as I mentioned on the call, I think it varies based on the other investments we're making, and the numbers we gave you were on average. There have been periods where we've been higher and periods we've been lower. But by using the word \"substantial,\" I think you can assume it to remain significant, but it could vary year to year is how I'd look at it.","Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations","And on the EU volumes, we estimated that in \u2013 the EU, I should say, so the 28 countries of the EU where the product's been launched so far in 2015, around about 140,000 patients in total were treated. We have a slightly lower market share in Europe than we do in the U.S., and that's because of payer-type arrangements that our competitor have got in place. The range of market shares ranges from 70% to 90%, but I would say the average would be about 80%, of that 140,000. All of the main countries, the big countries in Europe, have now gone through their sort of warehoused point of the launch trajectory or the patient flow and are getting into more stable patient flows, but are growing. So I think that's my main point.","We anticipate higher numbers of patients in 2016 over 2015. Countries like the UK really didn't treat very many patients at all so far, but they are now beginning to ramp up. And then some of the smaller countries \u2013 Netherlands, Austria \u2013 are beginning to grow patient numbers. Having said that, I also mentioned earlier price-volume agreements. These are set up to try and encourage more patients being treated. But obviously, the flip side to those arrangements is that the price per patient comes down and there's better value to treat more patients. The other thing, I think, is the real-world data with eight weeks of Harvoni treatment. It looks stronger and stronger and is more convincing to European payers. And therefore, they will also use that opportunity to try and treat more patients, but of course, at a lower revenue per patient.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great.

And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Patrick O'Brien - Senior Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Candace, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market close today, a press release was issued with earnings results for the first quarter of 2016. The press release and detailed slides are available on the Investor Relations section of the Gilead website.","Joining today's call will be: John Milligan, President and Chief Executive Officer; Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Paul Carter, Executive Vice President of Commercial Operations; and Norbert Bischofberger, Executive Vice President of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer","Before we begin formal remarks, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, financial projections, and the use of capital, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks, and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements.

Milligan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Patrick, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. While we want to keep our remarks relatively brief to allow plenty of time for your questions, I do want to make a few comments about the first few months of 2016 and what I see as the outlook for the rest of the year.","Gilead's HIV franchise is off to a great start with the recent U.S. FDA approvals of Odefsey and Descovy, which followed the approval of Genvoya late last year. Over the last six months, I've had the opportunity to talk with physicians and patients about the importance of having highly effective and safer options, especially for patients facing a lifetime of therapy. With the approval of our three new regimens, we are now able to offer a range of options to address the diverse medical requirements of people with HIV, including those new to treatment, those who have been on therapy for a long time and have run short of options, and those who desire to switch medications for a variety of reasons.","Since 2001, Gilead therapies have played a transformative role in changing HIV infection from a fatal and debilitating disease into a chronic and manageable condition. That's true around the world, as broader access to HIV treatment has helped avert millions of AIDS deaths.","Innovation remains important in the continuing fight against HIV, and we're proud that Descovy is the first new backbone approved by the FDA in more than a decade. Gilead continues its commitment to helping HIV patients around the globe with our research and development activities, including novel agents for daily treatment, long-acting regimens, and HIV cure.","In liver disease, we just wrapped up an exciting week in Barcelona at the International Liver Conference, or EASL [European Association for the Study of the Liver], as it's known. It was a remarkable meeting, especially considering the significant change in the HCV treatment landscape since the conference was held last in Spain four years ago. The outlook for patients has completely changed, with dramatic improvements in cure rates for a wider range of patients.","Presentations at EASL included results from several Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies evaluating sofosbuvir\/velpatasvir and sofosbuvir\/velpatasvir plus GS-9857. These are two investigational pan-genotypic fixed-dose combination therapies for the treatment of HCV. The data presented continues to underscore the high cure rates and safety of our sofosbuvir-based therapies and support their utility across all HCV patient genotypes and a wide range of disease stages.","Data were also presented on the use of TAF for patients with chronic hepatitis B infection. Forty-eight week results from two Phase 3 studies demonstrate its potential to advance the treatment of HCV, offering a similar efficacy profile to Viread with improved bone and renal safety parameters. Based on these results, we submitted a New Drug Application for TAF, and FDA has set a PDUFA date of November 11. We also submitted regulatory applications for TAF in the European Union and Japan last quarter.","I'm particularly encouraged by the work that's going on in NASH, which we've augmented with our agreement to acquire the Nimbus Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase, or ACC program, as was announced last month. NASH affects up to 15 million people in the U.S., and is expected to become the leading indication for liver transplantation by 2020. Including the ACC program, Gilead has four investigational compounds that target unique disease pathways, including production of lipids, inflammation, and fibrosis, each of which are thought to contribute to or cause NASH.","Data at EASL were presented supporting the development of Gilead's investigational agents for the treatment of NASH, including: simtuzumab, a monoclonal antibody that is selective for LOXL2, which is also being evaluated in primary sclerosing cholangitis: GS-4997, an ASK-1 inhibitor; and GS-9674, an FXR agonist. Nimbus also presented positive Phase 1 data for the program's lead candidate, NDI-010976, which targets ACC, a key step in lipid biosynthesis pathway.","Overall, I'm enthusiastic about the future of Gilead and excited to have opportunity to help build on the company's long history of success. Over the past few months, I've had conversations with external stakeholders and employees across all parts of our organization. It's gratifying to see the extent to which Gilead's products and commitment to access have uniquely changed the course of diseases for so many people throughout the world. We now have the opportunity to do so again in many new areas.","A few things stood out from those conversations; first, physicians and patients share the excitement that our medical and commercial teams have regarding Gilead's new treatment options for HCV and HIV, particularly the new TAF-based therapies. Access continues to improve for people with HCV around the world. And in fact, we have treated close to 1 million patients with Sovaldi-based regimens since Sovaldi was first approved in late 2013. That's a remarkable achievement in just over two years.","With regards to HIV, as many of you are aware, TAF was added to the medicines patent pool and to our various access programs. The clinical data suggests TAF-based regimens may be the best option in both the developed and developing world. We will build on the success we've had with the TDF-based regimens, now used by nearly 10 million people every single day, to make TAF regimens successful around the world, providing much-needed new options.","Secondly, I believe we have a rich pipeline, creating opportunities that may allow the transformation of the treatment of many diseases like NASH, HBV, inflammatory diseases, certain cancers, and cardiovascular conditions for which few, if any, options exist. We are committed to building on our company's long history of success, and I'm confident that our innovation and our hard work will deliver on our shared goal of delivering new treatments and providing broad access to Gilead's medicines for patients in need.","Finally, we continue to look for business development opportunities that add to our core therapeutic areas and are a fit with Gilead's expertise and capabilities. We are actively assessing options and will make moves when the right opportunities present themselves.","I will now turn the call over to Robin, who will provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter. Robin will be followed by Paul, who will provide additional color on the company's performance across products and geographies.","Robin L. Washington - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone.","We are pleased to report our first quarter results, with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.03 per share compared to $2.94 for the same period last year. Total revenues for the quarter were $7.8 billion, up 3% year over year and down 8% sequentially. Product sales for the quarter were $7.7 billion, up 4% year over year and down 9% sequentially.","Starting with HIV and other antivirals, product sales for the first quarter increased to $2.9 billion, up 19% year over year, primarily driven by increased sales in the U.S. We continue to see start strong uptake of our newer single-tablet regimens, including Genvoya, which was launched in November of 2015. Additionally, year over year, Stribild and Complera grew 34% and 19% respectively. Sequentially, these sales decreased 4%, primarily driven by sub-wholesaler inventory decreases in the U.S., reflective of the seasonal inventory pattern from quarter four to quarter one.","HCV product sales for the first quarter decreased 6% year over year to $4.3 billion, primarily driven by a decrease in Harvoni sales in the U.S., which was partially offset by the launch of our HCV products in Japan and other international markets. In the U.S., the year-over-year Harvoni sales decline was driven by lower patient starts and the full quarter impact of higher commercial rebates, which were entered into during the first quarter of 2015.","Sequentially, HCV product sales decreased 12%, primarily driven by revenue declines in the U.S. in Japan. In the U.S., the decline was due to the increase in discounts required to open up access to patients with lower fibrosis scores and a modest shift in payer mix toward more deeply discounted government payer segments. In addition, revenue was further impacted by higher than expected prior-quarter rebate claims. Rebate claims come in one to two quarters in arrears and were updated in Q1 to reflect the higher claims received.","In Japan, Sovaldi volumes declined from high early launch levels, similar to other markets. And channel inventory pricing for Sovaldi and Harvoni was adjusted during March for the mandatory price reduction, effective as of April 1.","Turning to our other therapeutic areas, product sales of cardiovascular, respiratory, and other were $498 million, up 19% year over year and down 5% sequentially.","Moving to gross margin, non-GAAP product gross margin was 87.2% for the first quarter of 2016 compared to 90.9% for the same period last year. The decrease reflects a $200 million charge or $0.12 earnings per share related to the jury verdict in the Merck trial in March. Although the proceedings in the Merck trial are not complete and the losing party will appeal once the court enters judgment, we booked the charge to comply with accounting rules related to contingencies.","Now turning to expenses, non-GAAP R&D expenses were $769 million for the first quarter, up 18% compared to the same period last year, due to the continued progression of clinical studies, particularly in liver disease and HIV. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $638 million for the first quarter, up 6% compared to the same period last year. These expenses increased primarily due to higher costs to support the growth of Gilead's business and were offset by favorable adjustments related to the Branded Prescription Drug Fee of $191 million following receipt of the preliminary 2016 IRS invoice.","From a balance sheet perspective, during the first quarter we generated cash flows from operations of $3.9 billion, and ended the quarter with $21.3 billion in cash and investments. We continue to return capital to our shareholders through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. Earlier this afternoon, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.47 per share for the second quarter of 2016, an increase of 10% from the prior quarter.","$8 billion in cash was utilized to repurchase shares of our common stock during the quarter, consisting of $3 billion of open market repurchases or 33.4 million shares and $5 billion under the accelerated share repurchase program ASR that we announced in February. 46.1 million shares were repurchased under this program during the quarter. The final settlement of the ASR program was completed earlier this month, and we received an additional 8.1 million shares. In total, 54.3 million shares were retired under the ASR program at an average price of $92.09 per share.","As of March 31, the amount of capital returned to shareholders, consisting of dividends and share repurchases, exceeded the total amount of capital returned during the first three quarters of 2015 combined. During the quarter, we completed the $15 billion share repurchase program approved by our board in January 2015, and as of April 1 have begun repurchasing shares under our $12 billion 2016 share repurchase program approved in January of this year. Since 2012, we've repurchased over 260 million shares, or 17% of shares outstanding.","Finally, we are reiterating our full-year 2016 guidance provided to you on February 2 and summarized on slide 25 in the earnings results presentation available on our corporate website. As a reminder, guidance for product sales is subject to a number of uncertainties, including: an uncertain global macroeconomic environment; adoption of additional pricing measures to reduce HCV spending; volatility in foreign currency exchange rates; inaccuracies in HCV patient start estimates; additional competitive launches in HCV; an increase in discounts, chargebacks, and rebates due to ongoing contracts and future negotiations with commercial and government payers; and a larger than anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments such as PHS, FFS, Medicaid, and the VA.","I will now turn the call over to Paul to provide more details on our commercial results for the quarter.","Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations","Thanks, Robin, and good afternoon, everyone.","Our commercial performance remained strong through the first quarter. I'd like to start with HIV and Genvoya, the first of our TAF-based single-tablet regimens.","We're pleased with the launch of Genvoya both in the U.S. and in the European markets where we've achieved reimbursement. Starting with the U.S., through five months post the launch of Genvoya, cumulative prescriptions were twofold more than any HIV product from any company since Atripla, which was the first single-tablet regimen to come to market back in 2006. As expected, most of Genvoya's initial prescriptions came from switches. Qualitative feedback from HIV prescribers is very encouraging and indicating a clear intent to switch patients at the earliest opportunity.","Stribild and Complera showed strong year-over-year prescription growth, at 18% and 5% respectively, and in quarter four 2015 Stribild was the leading product in the U.S. for patients naive to treatment.","With the launches of Genvoya and now just very recently Odefsey, we expect switches out of TDF-based single-tablet regimens into the TAF regimens to grow significantly. In fact, 82% of Genvoya's prescriptions have been switches. 49% of the switches have come from Stribild.","We are seeing an improvement in our ability to retain switch patients, meaning fewer patients who switch from Gilead TDF-containing regimens move to non-Gilead products. Of all the patients who switch to Genvoya, 91% came from a Gilead regimen and 9% came from a non-Gilead product.","In addition to switches, preliminary quarter one 2016 data indicate to us that Genvoya may soon be among the most prescribed products of patients new to treatment. Historically in quarter one, we've seen a decrease in sub-wholesaler inventories following a buildup in the prior quarter. We observed this effect again this year, leading to a sequential decrease in HIV product sales.","Finally, in the U.S., I'd like to highlight the growing use of Truvada for PrEP, which was more than 20% of Truvada demand last quarter and drove 17% year-on-year growth in prescriptions.","Turning to Europe, we're also pleased with the way that our HIV business is performing, with successful reimbursement and launches of Genvoya in several countries, including Germany and the Nordics. In other countries, Stribild and Eviplera continue to replace Atripla. Stribild remains the most prescribed regimen for patients naive to treatment in the EU, with Eviplera in third place.","Genvoya was launched in Germany during quarter one. And at the end of the quarter, preliminary data indicate that it had the leading market share for both naive and switch patients. The product was launched and fully reimbursed in Spain just two weeks ago, and we're very excited about the opportunity to offer providers another important option to address the needs of their patients.","It's also been recognized as a preferred regimen in numerous country guidelines, including Germany, Spain, and Italy, even before reimbursement has been agreed. This is testament to the favorable clinical profile of Genvoya, a single-tablet regimen that better addresses the needs of patients who require long-term chronic therapy. We're working hard to negotiate timely reimbursement across the rest of the European markets.","Finally on HIV, we launched Descovy this month in the U.S. and the EU. We see this launch as a milestone in HIV treatment, as Descovy is the first new NRTI backbone since Truvada 10 years ago. Given the very high use of Truvada as a preferred backbone with multiple third agents, including Tivicay, we're confident that Descovy will quickly replace Truvada and become the leading HIV regimen backbone in all our markets.","Now moving to hepatitis C, we continue d to see revenue dynamics around the world which vary by country. As Robin noted, our overall HCV product revenue decreased 6% year over year and 12% sequentially. I'll now describe the different dynamics by geographic region.","Starting with the U.S. market, we've seen an increase of new patients in the first quarter, offset by lower revenue per patient due to several factors that include an increase in our gross-to-net adjustments as well as a shortening average duration of therapy. Total market patient starts increased around 10% over Q4 to an estimated 55,000 in Q1. This was primarily driven by the continued opening of access across payer segments to allow for the treatment of patients with lower fibrosis scores as well as an increase in treatment by the VA during the second half of the quarter, as funding made its way to the various VA sites.","The revenue associated with this increase in patient starts was partially offset by an increase in discounts associated with our contract agreements entered into during the first quarter of 2015, which provide for additional discounts if access is provided to a broader patient population. We also saw a gradual shift to more deeply discounted payer segments such as VA, PHS, and Medicaid compared to the prior quarter.","In addition, revenue was further impacted by higher than expected prior-quarter rebate claims, which come in one to two quarters in arrears and were updated in quarter one to reflect the higher claims received. The average duration of therapy has shortened, as fewer patients require 24 weeks of treatment and a higher proportion of genotype 1 patients are treated for eight weeks, resulting in slightly lower revenues per patient. The ability to treat for eight weeks notably is a strong competitive differentiation.","In fact, our market share remained strong, with more than 90% of all patients treated in the quarter being prescribed either Harvoni or Sovaldi. Qualitative feedback suggests that prescribing HCV physicians are encouraged by the fact that real-world outcomes mimic the experience in clinical trials. Several presentations of real-world data at EASL reinforce what has been seen in clinical practice.","As we think about the rest of the year in the U.S., patient flow peaked in quarter one 2015, then declined in quarter two, and stabilized in quarter three and quarter four of 2015. In quarter one of 2016, there was an uptick in new patient starts. Our data show that 25,000 to 30,000 patients a month are entering treated care, which exceeds the number of patients starting therapy on a monthly basis. That means there were many more people who could benefit from treatment who are already linked to care. We expect new patient starts to remain consistent through the rest of 2016.","Despite the number of patients treated to date, there are still over 3 million patients in the U.S. who have yet to be treated. About half of these patients are undiagnosed. Education and awareness efforts to increase rates of diagnosis are important. And as we well know from public health efforts in the HIV area, these efforts play out over many years. We're encouraged to see data that screening and diagnosis rates have increased at least twofold over the last five years.","Now turning to Europe, total HCV revenue in Europe was down 13% year over year and down 1% sequentially. While overall Gilead patient starts increased 5% sequentially to around 31,000 in the quarter, average revenue per patient declined due to a shift in geographic mix and shorter average treatment duration. We also saw a negative foreign exchange movement, which affected HCV revenues by about 8% year on year and 3% sequentially. The mix of sales in the EU is such that more patients are now being treated in countries which have lower net prices per patient.","European countries continue to vary significantly in terms of patient access, with many still limiting treatment to patients with high fibrosis scores. We anticipate that as sicker patients are treated, these restrictions will start to loosen, as healthier patients can be cared for within existing budgets. Again, as in the U.S., we treat just a small fraction of patients diagnosed. We are encouraged by ongoing efforts and commitments by governments to increase diagnosis and treatment across Europe.","Now moving to Japan, revenue was over $1 billion during the quarter. We're pleased with the successful launches of Sovaldi and Harvoni, where a strong patient flow and high market shares continued through quarter one. More than 30,000 patients were treated with Gilead products during the quarter, representing a market share greater than 90%.","Other markets where we recently launched our HCV products include Australia, where nearly 5,000 patients started treatment in Q1. This reflects a strong commitment by the Australian government to address their HCV burden and the usual warehousing of patients prior to the launch of sofosbuvir-based regimens.","In closing, our underlying HCV business is strong and sustainable. We've treated around 700,000 patients in the U.S., Europe, and Japan. And despite strong competition, Gilead has maintained high market shares in all regions. The Gilead commercial organization is focused on executing our numerous HIV and HCV product launches across multiple geographies during the remainder of the year. In addition to our three TAF-based HIV products, we're preparing to launch our pan-genotypic HCV product as early as next quarter in the U.S.","Thank you, and now let's open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. It seems like lower revenue per patient was one of the bigger contributors to the sequential trends, so a couple questions. What's the initial outlook for higher volumes coming from commercial patients just with respect to broader access for F0 and F1? And then was the volume contribution this quarter pretty meaningful from the VA system? I just want to get a sense for the sequential trends there too. Thanks.","Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations","Hi, Geoff. So several things happened in the quarter in relation to volume and revenue per patient, so maybe I'll try and deal with all of them. So the first thing, as you said, we had, and we expected this and hoped for it, that several of the large commercial payers opened up access to patients regardless of their fibrosis scores during quarter one. The consequence of that was that they triggered discounts that had been previously negotiated in order to incentivize that opening up of restrictions. So that was the first thing.","And then the VA, as you know, treated very few patients in quarter four last year because of lack of funding. That funding was agreed for a two-year period and focused on HCV medicines, and was clarified late December. Then the VA went through a process of evaluating the clinical evaluation of product available from not just us, but obviously new entrants to the market. And that process took through till mid to late January. And we had to negotiate with the VA, and we did give the VA some extra discounts, which resulted in them putting our products on their formulary and also opening up, again, access to all patients within the VA. So there were no restrictions on patients. And again, we see this as a large positive. And as that funding got distributed around the VA centers, we started to see a very large uptick in VA treatment from about the middle of the quarter, and we anticipate that that will continue through the year.","The second area that happened, of course, is we had the entrance of Merck into the market, and so we judiciously exercised our contractual right to preserve access. And in a few cases, we did increase a little bit of discount to some payers to ensure that Harvoni in particular remained on formularies and with full access.","The third thing I think we've seen, as I indicated in the comments, was a slight and gradual shift of payer mix away from the commercial and Medicare Part D payers towards the more government payers, and that was probably about a 10% shift from quarter four to quarter one.","And then the final piece, as we indicated, is we did have a catch-up, a true-up of some rebate claims that came in respect to quarter three and quarter four that were a little bit higher than we estimated last quarter and which we put right during quarter one. So that really is the dynamic between volumes and revenue per patient.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks a lot, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys. By the way, John, I really enjoyed your opening comments. Everyone is very focused on what you're going to do with your cash, BD, M&A. So I have actually one simple question probably for John. Would you be willing to go hostile? And if not, why not? How do you feel about that? Because clearly what we're hearing is that the small companies won't engage right now because they don't like the valuations, but the large companies are very interested. Thank you.","John F. Milligan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Mark. It's John. Mergers and acquisitions are always a process, and so the ability to go hostile is limited by how much data or how much cooperation you need. And so in each situation, you'd have to think about what do I need to know about the pipeline or about things that are not public about a company in order to be comfortable making a public offer for the company. But that being said, we've never declared ourselves unwilling to go hostile. I do prefer a friendly process, but it would just depend on the situation itself.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges of Leerink Partners. Your line is now open.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much and, John, welcome to leading your first call completely. I guess to follow up on that question, you've invested it looks like about $19 billion or $20 billion over the last year reducing your share count. The share count has come down by about 10%, but your EPS is pretty much flat, maybe up low single digits versus last year. Are you convinced that that's the best use of your capital? You've got $21 billion in cash and about the same amount of debt. So are you going to revisit that, or is that more or less the path that you believe generates the best returns here?","John F. Milligan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Geoff, I think that was directed at me, but I'm going to let Robin answer the first part of the question.","Robin L. Washington - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Geoff. It's Robin. I think as we said all along, we look at how we leverage our cash as not only being share repurchases and dividends, but also we consistently look at investing in our core pipeline as well as M&A where appropriate. And similar to the amounts that you called out relative to cash, it's actually about a 17% reduction in share count, as I mentioned on the call. We have done a lot of M&A as well. And I think we'll continue to do that, as John said, when the right opportunities present themselves.","So I think we've always been fairly clear that we're balancing doing all of those things, and we have purposely focused on share repurchases because in the absence of M&A it allows us to be flexible and more opportunistic. But when the right M&A opportunities present themselves, it allows us to reduce our share repurchases in order to make those necessary acquisitions and leverage our cash and debt and borrowing if we need to.","John F. Milligan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","For us it's fairly simple. We have the flexibility to do both things; that is, return shareholder value through stock repurchases and dividends and of course continue to be opportunistic in M&A. How we're deploying it is a reflection of the things we're interested in. I think, for example, the Nimbus acquisition, while relatively small, could bring a very, very unique product to us and something that we had focused on during the quarter. We're continuing to look for opportunities like that, and we will continue to aggressively look for opportunities to deploy our cash in investing in things other than Gilead.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay, thanks. I'll get back in the queue.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, good afternoon. I wanted to revisit some questions that you were talking about related to price and volume. You did mention on the positive that net new patient starts were up about 10%, which is great. But then the total revenues in the U.S. declined by 11%. So someone could do the math and imply that price was down 10% to 20%. Can you comment on that or maybe just describe where you think the price\/volume equation was in the quarter and how we should think about net price changing quarter over quarter and how that should change over the year? Thanks.","Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations","Mike, I think we are in a much more stable place than we were one year ago at this time. I think I described it just now. We've made some contractual moves which have opened up access. We're very happy about that. We're happy that some of the government payers are beginning to treat a few people. We're very happy about the VA in particular ramping up its treatment levels. I said that we've had to compete in the VA, and we did that, but we're enjoying very high market shares wherever physicians have the choice of prescribing. And that's always been our aim, to make sure that physicians and patients can choose what drug they think is appropriate. And wherever that's the case, Gilead seems to do pretty well.","So I would say looking forward, we're in a fairly stable place now. Clearly, over time as competition increases, prices are likely to incrementally move in one direction, I would think. But I think we're stable.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So on one side we're getting lots of access, but on the other side my math is not totally off, just to be fair.","Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations","Correct.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, got it. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Going back to the strategic theme, you've talked in the past about wanting to be a leader in oncology. But given the issues you've had with Zydelig and the leadership changes you've also had, are you as committed to that space as you once were? And if so, what's your thought on the potential opportunities you see out there between solid tumors and Heme\/Onc [Hematology\/Oncology]? Thanks.","John F. Milligan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Cory, it's John. That's of course a big question. So if you think about where we are in our oncology portfolio, we have been focused heavily on a number of activities around these kinase inhibitors and how that actually behind Zydelig a number of opportunities are moving in the clinic, including our SYK inhibitor, our BTK inhibitor. I should probably let Norbert go on about this, but I would say we have numerous opportunities that we're continuing to pursue.","You had mentioned we want to be a leader in oncology. We think of oncology as one leg of a future company that could be important to us along with our investments in NASH and inflammatory diseases. We do see some good opportunities out there and we see some good opportunities internally. So the Zydelig setback hasn't changed our appetite for trying to do more transformative things in oncology. It was never going to be a franchise product like Viread or sofosbuvir but was a good beginning for us, and I really haven't changed my thought process around it as a result of the setback because of the toxicities we've seen. Norbert, do you want to add anything to that?","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer","No. As John said, Zydelig has not only not decreased our appetite, it has increased our appetite to do more in oncology. And we're now at a point where a number of programs are coming to fruition. For instance, momelotinib we're intending to file early next year. The Phase 3 studies are fully enrolled. We should get results at the end of this year. The anti-MMP9 antibody is in Phase 3 for colorectal cancer. We're at the end of dose-ranging with combinations of PI3K, SYK, and SYK\/BTK, and that will move into front-line treatment. So we have a number of interesting things ongoing internally. And of course, like John said, we're continuously looking externally at finding suitable opportunities. And if the right opportunity comes along, then we will take advantage of it.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Abrahams of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about hep C diagnostic initiatives and maybe some of the pull-throughs that you're seeing or might expect to see on patient identification. And I'm particularly curious if you have a sense among the growing number of new patient starts, who may have been identified last year and are now getting access with fewer restrictions versus patients who are getting identified this year and coming onto treater care concurrently? Thanks.","Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations","Should I comment on that, John, maybe? So it's actually very hard to tell when people have been diagnosed and who's been treated when. Anecdotally, I can tell you, and I was out visiting some doctors in California just last week. Patients are \u2013 there are plenty of patients there. There are many people who are linked to care now. And with the fibrosis restrictions being dropped now, most physicians can treat \u2013 certainly in the commercial area and Medicare area, can treat whoever they want. One thing is clear though that there are still prior authorizations in place and there's still a fair amount of office paperwork and bureaucracy that have to be put in place for each patient.","Then there are the patients themselves, many of whom just simply aren't quite mentally ready or psychologically ready to commit to that disciplined eight-week or 12-week treatment. And with these products, of course, insurance companies aren't keen to do it twice. They want to try and get it right the first time, the doctors want to get it right the first time, and the patients want to get it right the first time. So we're seeing that some of the delays in patients starting has to do with the patient just being ready to commit to a disciplined eight or 12 weeks of patients.","On the diagnosis side, again anecdotally, we just know that there are a lot of activities going on. A lot of people are telling us what's going on around the countryside, and we do see diagnosis rates increasing significantly. So I think there are plenty of patients being diagnosed and there are plenty of patients coming into treatment and there's a waiting list of patients at most offices. By the way, our estimate on diagnosis is about 200,000 new diagnoses happened in the U.S. last year.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer","Brian, I might want to add that we have a number of demonstration projects ongoing in the United States to look for places, institutions, populations and figure out what the diagnosis positivity would be. And it's surprising, we've identified some places like ER rooms that have seropositivity rates of greater than 10%. We hope that those demonstration projects will then lead to a broader recognition of the value of diagnosis and identification of hepatitis C in infected individuals.","Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Brian Skorney of Robert Baird. Your line is now open.","Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess two quick ones. I know we talked a little bit about this at EASL, John, but just first on the timeline in terms of when you think you can get sofosbuvir [sof]-based regimens approved in China, how you think about pricing that there to capture share of patients who are looking at a branded drug versus potentially penetrating further in.","And then just on the U.S., have you guys heard anything in terms of a warehouse build in genotype 3 ahead of a sof\/vel [velpatasvir] launch? Should we be expecting a small bolus of patients upon that approval?","John F. Milligan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, Brian, I'll start with the China question. So in terms of timing for China, there is a fairly fixed process. And according to the recent processes, we could possibly have sofosbuvir on the market in 2017. As you may have seen, there are new \u2013 the Chinese government is working hard to try to accelerate review and approval of HCV drugs because currently none are on the market of the direct-acting antivirals, and that could help us accelerate the timelines into China, and we are working on that. Particularly of interest to us would be accelerating the timeline for sof\/velpatasvir because there are so many different genotypes in China. Genotyping is not common in China, and this could provide a very good option for the people of China. So there's hope, but we can't guarantee of course that we can accelerate that approval beyond its current timeline, which is 2019.","The Chinese market is fairly large. Between 10 million and 20 million people are thought to have HCV. I don't want to get into public discussions of pricing, but I do think there's a price\/volume relationship that would work for us and for the Chinese health system that could be very, very good for us both. And so that's what we're working towards is access in China.","Your second question was on warehousing for genotype 3 patients. Currently a lot of genotype 3 patients are being treated with sof in combination with daclatasvir. And so there seems to be fairly decent access for that. So I'm looking at Paul. I don't think there's any real warehousing going on, but maybe you're more aware of it than I am.","Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations","About 7% or 8% of the U.S. HCV epidemiology is genotype 3. We don't have any data on it, but certainly we get \u2013 I'm getting the impression from my team anecdotally there is a little bit of warehousing, but not least because sofosbuvir\/daclatasvir is a very expensive regimen. And the hope is that the cost of the genotype 3 treatment will come down somewhat after sof\/vel comes onto the market, which is the PDUFA date is June 28, so people are thinking about that. So we're optimistic.","Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from Phil Nadeau of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good afternoon, a few questions on Japan. I know you said that there was some change in pricing because of the April 1 price declines during the quarter. What other dynamics were going on in Japan during this quarter? Where do you think you are in treating the bolus in Japan? How much longer could that go?","And then separately, I believe that there are price discounts that come in with a certain volume being reached. Are we right to assume that those could be hit in July? And what kind of dynamics do you expect to see in the Japanese market going forward?","Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations","So we're very, very pleased with the execution of our launches in Japan. In terms of patient flow, the genotype 2 patients, which represent about 20% of the Japanese epidemiology in HCV, are beginning to stabilize now. So those are the patients being treated with Sovaldi. Those numbers \u2013 we launched on May 25 last year. We initially had a bolus and then those numbers came down through quarter four. And quarter one is at a lower level than quarter four, but we're seeing a stable flow of patients now in genotype 2, and we would anticipate that to be stable through the rest of the year.","Genotype 1 is treated by Harvoni. We treated an enormous number of patients initially. We're not quite sure if the curve in Japan is identical to the curves we've seen in the U.S. or other major markets, and that's because there was a DAA [Direct Antiviral Agent] in the market before Harvoni, which did treat quite a few people. So there might not have been quite such a large amount of warehousing.","In any case, we're seeing the Harvoni patient numbers coming down gradually. It's not quite as steep as some of the markets. And that's yet to stabilize, but I'm pretty sure \u2013 I know it will stabilize sometime in the next quarter or two. So that's how we're seeing it. We treated about 30,000 patients during the quarter. So that number, it will be there or thereabouts I think for the rest of the year.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC","And what about the volume discounts, are those going to come later in the year, and what kind of dynamics?","Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations","I'm sorry. We're not anticipating any further price movements in this year in Japan.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great, thanks for taking my question.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Sorry, can you hear me?","Patrick O'Brien - Senior Director-Investor Relations","Yes, now we can.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thanks, I guess one follow-up on Phil's question on Japan. Can you just be clear with us? The pricing that you talked about in March, was that the full extent of the 30% price cut or would there be more in April, just so we can understand how much was reflected in this quarter?","And then on the rebates that you talked about, the true-up that happened, would you expect that to swing again through the rest of this year, or do you think that that is now at a level that expresses what your forward-looking expectations are for the level of rebates? Thanks.","Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations","I'll do the first part and Robin will talk about the second part. So the pricing in Japan, the official price reduction was just under 32% and officially from April 1. We actually reduced our prices into wholesalers early in March, and the reason for that was because the price cut was announced much earlier, and therefore we wanted to just smooth out the inventory situation, so that's why we reduced our price into wholesalers a little bit earlier. And by the end of the quarter, inventory levels were up to I would say reasonable levels relative to demand. And actually a little bit, inventory levels were a little bit down from where we ended quarter four because overall demand was slightly down because of Harvoni. Robin?","Robin L. Washington - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. And going back to answer the second part of your question relative to the rebate accruals that both Paul and I mentioned, we regularly have to adjust our accruals to reflect the trends and timing of rebates. And I would say still the trends and the dynamics and the complexity around reimbursement in these markets still make them somewhat difficult to predict. So I wouldn't say they were all one-time in nature. There may be a small component that you could say when we were trying to look at the level of inventory that maybe was one-time in nature, but these dynamics I think we may see continue into the future. The honest answer is we don't necessarily know.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. First of all, I want to probe a little bit about the rebates. Can you clarify whether it's actually access-based or volume-based? Because we can see from the scripts apparently the volume is not really picking up after those big insurers opened up the access regardless of F [fibrosis] scores. So I wonder what happens there.","And then secondly, I think, Paul, you mentioned that the payer mix is getting a little bit worse this quarter. But can you talk about your thoughts on payer mix going forward? Is it going to be continuing shift to the public payers or I guess the lower price environment or not? Thank you.","Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations","Hi, Ying. So the first question was about patient volumes coming in and relative to the opening up of the fibrosis scores. So I'm not sure whether you look at this data or not, but we get new-to-brand data, which is really the leading indicator of new starts in the quarter. So we've seen, and this is just retail scripts by the way, so that doesn't include the VA, it doesn't include scripts that go through ESI [Express Scripts] and various other groups, so it's partly representative. And what we've seen amongst those scripts is new starts in the quarter have gone up, and that's gone up exactly in line with our expectations with the fibrosis scores being released.","Total scripts have remained relatively flat, and part of that is because in quarter four of course the patient numbers, throughout really 2015 quarter on quarter, the new starts were coming down. And therefore the refills associated with those new starts falling into quarter one were somewhat down. So the aggregate of that makes the numbers of total prescriptions in the quarter look relatively flat and slightly disengaged from the fibrosis piece. So I think that hopefully covers that. And then of course, the VA, as I said, isn't included in that group and that was a large number of patients coming into the system.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then the payer mix?","Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations","The payer mix, I think directionally, this is not a dramatic move. I think directionally we anticipate that Medicaid will start. There's a lot of pressure on Medicaid to treat patients. And we anticipate that the public payer sector will start proportionately getting a little bit bigger in our mix. Just as an example, around 77% of our payer mix at the end of quarter four or during quarter four was really commercial and Medicare Part D. That number has dropped down now to about 64% as a proportion. So we're seeing a shift, and I would imagine that that will continue gradually.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then would you guys ever talk about the relative magnitude compared to the 46% you flagged last year?","Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations","No, we're not going to give guidance on our guidance. We gave the gross-to-net number once. We've built that into our guidance for the rest of the year, so we're not planning on breaking that out it all.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you, Paul.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas of Citi. Your line is now open.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. So just thinking about the moving parts over the course of the year and the color you gave on fibrosis scores, so with so many people getting rejected early on based on fibrosis score, how might they flow into the system during the year? Because there are a lot of patients. Do you see them coming on evenly, or could they come in a bolus and we could see some choppiness in the quarter?","And then the second question I had was how comfortable are you that some of the pricing negotiations have been done and we won't see further pricing negotiations coming with the new nuke-based regimens coming next year? Do you think there's going to be another round of surprises in 2017 for discounting, or do you think we've reached a little bit lower of a steady state? Thanks.","Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations","I think it's hard to tell on the flow of patients first of all. What we do know is there are plenty of patients out there. As I said, our data, we've got three different sources of data which shows that 25,000 to 30,000 patients are coming into treatment. Obviously, a lot less than that are actually being treated. And anecdotally as I said, I think it's because there's bureaucracy still in the physicians' offices, which give a kind of \u2013 I guess that's a gating in the sense of the number of patients that can be treated. And also there's from the patient side people actually ready to be treated. I think they want to be teed up, if you like, for treatment, but they might not want to actually start tomorrow morning. So I think we should expect patient flow to be fairly stable through this year.","And then on the negotiation side, I think with real-world data, payers are tending now to really take a lot more time and put a lot more thought into evaluating the clinical profiles of the products. And until we see the clinical profiles of the new products, it's very hard to predict how competitive they are. If they're competitive, I think we have to anticipate prices will come down and we'll negotiate because we certainly don't want to lose any access to patients for our products, and we'll defend our market share vigorously.","So it's hard to predict. I think directionally, competition equals lower prices, but we're going to be focusing on looking at differentiating our products. We've got great products out there now and our pipeline looks really exciting. So I think we're in good shape for a long and sustainable and healthy HCV business in the U.S.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from Alethia Young of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just one, if we go back to the beginning of this year and think about the $30 billion to $31 billion you put out there, has the mix between hep C and HIV changed? It seems like HIV is doing a little bit better on the nuances and hep C has more pricing pressure. And then just also, can you confirm maybe if we're seeing any competition in the big five from new competitors like Merck coming to the market?","Robin L. Washington - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Maybe I'll see if I can take the first part of your question. This is Robin. We gave guidance for the full year. I would say yes, this quarter we had a slightly uptick relative to our HIV expectations and slightly down relative to HCV. But I think we've still got three quarters to play things out. And as Paul said, we continue to be optimistic relative to patient starts and a more stable, predictable environment going forward. But it's still very early to tell.","Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations","And in Europe, I've got to say the payers are treating the products generally with less consideration to the clinical differences than we're seeing in the U.S. And there are some payers who are treating the products a bit more like commodities, and we're working hard to make sure that we educate them as best as possible. And I think the real-world data, much of which originates from Europe, is really supporting us in that. But we have seen some instances, for example, tenders in the Nordics, which have a very binary outcome. And there are certain times that we've decided that those tenders' prices don't warrant the value of our products. So our market shares have been a little bit less in Europe.","And specifically to answer your question, I think all three players are out there in Europe trying to get business. But at the end of the day, we hope that people will recognize that the Gilead products are highly effective, very simple, very tolerable. And the real-world data, which is now there are vast amounts of it, really does support us when physicians make their choices. And as I said earlier, where physicians have the freedom of prescription, we tended to have very, very strong market shares, in the 90%-plus.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from Ian Somaiya of BMO Capital. Your line is now open.","M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks. Maybe just changing the topic a little bit, a question for Norbert. I was hoping you could just speak to the three oral candidates you have for NASH now, just how you're planning to develop them, how they might come into play, potential combination strategies?","And as you think about the larger BD question that keeps getting asked, do you have enough data on your internal programs to make decisions in terms of what additional products that might benefit your internal efforts in NASH and also in hep B?","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer","So, Ian, actually it's four products that we have currently in early clinical studies if you include the Nimbus compound. That deal, by the way, has not closed yet, but it should close in the next week. So we have the ASK inhibitor, the ACC1\/ACC2 inhibitor, simtuzumab, and then the FXR agonist. And we could by the end of this year be in four Phase 2 studies really in NASH to look at the effect of any one of these agents by themselves.","And then we would also at the same time look at our star combination studies to see \u2013 we always have SYK. We believe in the three points of PET disease pathogenesis. There's fibrosis, inflammation, and metabolic, and yet we don't have agents that address all of them. And you're absolutely \u2013 our hypothesis is that ultimately it's a complex biological disease and probably more than one agent would be needed. And we're looking forward, maybe sometime next year we will then go to Phase 3.","With regards to BD, we're of course looking. At the moment there is nothing out there that I would say we have to get. As I said, we have four components. We're going to look at those individually and then as the results come in make decisions what else we would need.","M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And then what about hep B, just similar question? With the assets you do have, I know that you provided very little information or shared very little information with us. But just as you think about your internal portfolio, do you feel like you have the assets you need to move forward with them and obviously capture the market?","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer","I would say we have, as you know, GS-4774. GS-4779, that's the GlobeImmune vaccine. We've presented data at the last AASLD so they're showing that at least in virally-suppressed patients it did not lead to a reduction in its antigen. We are currently doing a study in treatment-naive patients. We then have GS-9620, the TLR-7 agonist in Phase 2 as well \u2013 or Phase 2a.","And then we have two other internal programs that we haven't disclosed yet. They are pre-IND, but we have identified with two different mechanisms molecules that we want to develop or evaluate in human clinical studies. But having that said, it's early as a general statement in hepatitis B cure that we are really having a very open mind and looking outside what else is there potentially that would fit our portfolio.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, thanks for taking the questions. I was just wondering. You mentioned this 25,000 to 30,000 per month number of patients coming into treatment, and then you gave us the new diagnosis last year in the U.S. And so that equates to about 17,000 per month. So is it safe to assume that of the new patients coming onto treatment, half are newly diagnosed and half are coming from the currently diagnosed pool? Am I thinking about that the right way?","And then the second question was just, can you tell us the percentage of patients that are getting eight weeks of therapy this quarter? Thank you.","Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations","Hi, Terence. I think broadly speaking, your math is correct on that. It's hard to tell exactly where the patients are coming from, but I think mathematically that sounds about right. Sorry, what was the second question?","Patrick O'Brien - Senior Director-Investor Relations","Eight weeks.","John F. Milligan - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","On the eight weeks.","Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations","Oh, yes, sorry, eight weeks. We've drifted slowly but surely upwards on the eight weeks. I think we're about 43% now. I've got to emphasize the data we have is called intent-to-treat rather than actual prescriptions. So the intent to treat in the U.S. is about 43%. The epidemiology, as we've previously said, would probably suggest that about half our genotype 1 patients would fall into the criteria that would trigger off eight-week treatment.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from Jim Birchenough of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","James Birchenough - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, guys, a bit of a maintenance question and then a more meaningful question. On the maintenance side, you refer to a bit of a shift from 24 weeks to eight weeks. Could you break down the eight-week, 12-week, and 24-week treatment numbers in HCV and where you see that heading?","And the more meaningful question is NASH is obviously an important part of your future growth strategy. FXR is in that category. How confident are you that you can separate out the metabolic effects of FXR agonism versus the beneficial effect? What's the basis for that cohort, and when will we see that data? Thanks.","Paul R. Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations","We're not going to break down the weeks of therapy. I just said what we think the eight-week amount is, but the rest you'll have to just model yourself. And I'll hand over to Norbert for the second question.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer","So, Jim, as you know, steroid FXR agonists do many, many things, not only in the liver, but in other target organs. So our philosophy is that we have an FXR agonist that purely acts at the level of the GI. So it does not get orally absorbed to any meaningful degree.","And then what it does at the level of the GI, it releases FGF19, and we believe that FGF19 does everything that it needs to do in order to impact on NASH. That's our hypothesis and we're testing that, and we should have data available in the third or fourth quarter of this year. So that's a fairly easy experiment to do. You simply look at bio-availability which is below, but the FGF19 \u2013 increase the FGF19 levels with some of the consequent metabolic effects. That way we also think we can prevent colitis, we can prevent the cholesterol effects, we can prevent alkaline phosphatase elevations, et cetera. So if that all is true, it should be a much safer and cleaner FXR agonist.","James Birchenough - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And, Norbert, when is the form for that data release? And I guess what are the next steps for that program? How far behind are you from things that are in Phase 3 right now as an FXR agonist?","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer","We could probably have some of the preliminary data at the AASLD, and we would then move into Phase 3 soon after that. So we're not that far behind other companies.","James Birchenough - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, thanks for taking my question.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes the line of Alan Carr of Needham & Company. Your line is now open.","Alan Carr - Needham & Co. LLC","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wondered if you can talk a little bit more about the new diagnoses in 2015 that you mentioned.

Carter - Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations","I don't have a lot of details at my fingertips actually, Alan. I would say, just to build on what Norbert was saying earlier, the interactions we're having with many people working on diagnosis projects around the country are that there's a lot of \u2013 a surprisingly high level of positive diagnosis in some of the urban centers and in ER rooms in particular in those urban centers, where diagnosis rates have been double at least what even the local investigators had anticipated. Why that is, I'm not sure, but this has been consistent throughout the country. So I would say that diagnosis rate, the 200,000, would grow rather than shrink, certainly for the next few years. And there are great efforts of course now to encourage diagnosis because people know that at the end of it, they're going to be treated and have a high probability of being cured.","Alan Carr - Needham & Co. LLC","Great, thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you, and we have time for one final question. That question comes from the line of Tony Butler of Guggenheim. Your line is now open.","Charles Anthony Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Norbert, very quickly if you could, recognizing that Nimbus closes next week, have there not been other ACC inhibitors which have actually failed? And if that's true, what might be unique about the Nimbus program? I understand it may attack a different part of the molecule, which would be interesting for you to elaborate on if that is indeed the case. Thanks.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer","So, Tony, you are exactly right. There have been previous ACC programs at Merck and Pfizer. They have not been successful, and the reason had to do with the specificity. This compound is really unique, it's a low nanomolar inhibitor of both ACC1 and ACC2. And it inhibits not only the pathway that goes to de novo lipogenesis, so based on low Coenzyme A production, but it also inhibits at the level of the mitochondrion. It stimulates, I might say, lipid acid beta oxidation. So it does really two things. It inhibits the formation of lipids, palmitate mostly, and at the same time it stimulates the beta oxidation of lipids.","And so there are actually some anecdotal reports from the Pfizer compound that inhibition of ACC1 and ACC2 results in a decrease in liver fat. That's by the way something we will do as one of the next experiments. We would look by MRI on the reduction of \u2013 we've already shown at the EASL presentation that it inhibits lipogenesis. Now we have to show also that it inhibits lipid fat content of the liver. It's a very straightforward and easy experiment to do. And I think once we have shown that, we have pretty high confidence that there would be a meaningful clinical benefit of the combo.","Charles Anthony Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great, thank you.","Patrick O'Brien - Senior Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Candace, and thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead, and the team here look forward to providing you with updates on our future progress.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

My name is Liz and I will be your conference operator today. I would now like to turn the call over to Sung Lee, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thank you, Liz, and good afternoon everyone. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the second quarter 2017. The press release and detailed slides are available on the Investor Relations section of the Gilead website. The speakers on today's call will be Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Kevin Young, Chief Operating Officer; Norbert Bischofberger, Executive Vice President of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer; and John Milligan, President and Chief Executive Officer.","Before we begin formal remarks, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements including plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, financial projections and the use of capital, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the latest SEC disclosure documents and recent press releases. In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.","Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release as well is on the Gilead website.","I will now turn the call over to Robin.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thank you, Sung, and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased to provide you with an update for our second quarter. I'll review the financial results, Kevin will address the commercial performance, Norbert will highlight the progress made in R&D, and then John will make a few closing comments.","Our strong performance in the second quarter was driven by a continuation of the positive trends in our non-HCV business and better than expected results from our HCV business, particularly in the U.S. Total revenues for the second quarter were $7.1 billion, with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.56. This compares to revenues of $7.8 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.08 for the same period last year.","Product sales for the second quarter were $7 billion, down 8% year-over-year and up 10% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was due to lower HCV sales partially offset by increased sales in HIV and other therapeutic areas. Sequentially, HCV sales grew 11% and HIV and other therapeutic area sales grew 10%.","Turning to the U.S., product sales for the second quarter were $5 billion, up 2% year-over-year, driven by favorable demand for our non-HCV products offset by lower HCV sales, and up 12% sequentially, primarily due to the continued strong uptake of our TAF franchise and favorable inventory movements for HIV and HCV.","Turning to Europe, product sales for the second quarter were $1.4 billion, down 13% year-over-year and up 11% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to competitive dynamics in HCV and unfavorable currency movements. The sequential increase was primarily due to the one-time recognition of deferred revenue related to an HCV contract, demand for Epclusa and the continued uptake of our TAF-based regimens. Kevin will provide more color for the U.S. as well as the other regions.","Now turning to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $812 million for the second quarter, down 22% compared to the same period last year, due primarily to the purchase of an FDA priority review voucher in 2016. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $827 million for the second quarter compared to $838 million in the same period last year.","We remain focused on operating in a highly efficient manner and are proactively managing expenses and investing in areas of strategic importance to generate industry-leading operating margins, significant cash flows and a strong balance sheet.","We ended the quarter with $36.6 billion in cash and investments and generated cash flows from operations of $3.5 billion. While we anticipate strong cash flows in the second half of 2017, we expect a sequential decrease in the second half of the year as we anticipate large cash payments for government rebates, both in the U.S. and abroad, as well as other seasonal payments.","As part of our plan to return capital to our shareholders, we paid cash dividends of $680 million and repurchased 2 million shares of stock for $130 million to offset dilution in the second quarter. We continue to prioritize the use of capital for investing in the long-term growth of our business including partnerships and acquisitions.","Finally, I would like to update our full-year 2017 guidance provided to you on May 2 and summarized on slide 6 in the earnings results presentation available on our corporate website. We are increasing net product sales to a range of $24 billion to $25.5 billion. Non-HCV net product sales are expected to be in the range of $15.5 billion to $16 billion. HCV net product sales are expected to be in the range of $8.5 billion to $9.5 billion.","This guidance reflects the strong performance we have seen in the first half of 2017 across our businesses, specifically in the U.S., while continuing to anticipate increased competitive dynamics in the U.S. and EU during the second half of the year.","This guidance is subject to a number of uncertainties which are highlighted on slide 16 in the earnings results presentation, including the accuracy of our estimates for HCV patient starts for the remainder of 2017, unanticipated pricing pressures from payers and competitors resulting in lower than anticipated market share in HCV, and lower than expected market share and greater price erosion as the result of the introduction of generic versions of TDF and the fixed-dose combination of FTC\/TDF outside the U.S.","We are narrowing the R&D expense guidance to a range of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion. We are also narrowing the SG&A expense guidance to a range of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion. Finally, the diluted earnings per share impact of GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be in the range of $0.86 to $0.93. All other components of our guidance remain unchanged.","I would now turn the call over to Kevin to provide more details on our commercial results for the quarter.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thank you, Robin, and good afternoon everyone. We continue to see strong uptake of our TAF-based regimens in the United States and Europe. In the U.S., total HIV and HBV revenues were $2.6 billion for the quarter, up 19% year-over-year and up 10% sequentially. These results demonstrate the strength and sustainability of our HIV franchise.","At the end of June, our TAF-based regimens accounted for 51% of Gilead's total HIV prescription volume. Leading the way was Genvoya with a treatment-na\u00efve patient share of 41%, more than twice that of the second-most prescribed therapy. This represents the highest treatment-na\u00efve patient share for a single product or regimen since the early days of Atripla.","In addition, more than one third of patients who switch HIV therapy now switch to Genvoya. More broadly, Gilead single tablet regimens represented four of the top five most prescribed products across all categories, treatment-na\u00efve, switch and total treated patients.","Beyond TAF, Truvada for PrEP continues to be an important option when used as part of a comprehensive strategy to prevent HIV transmission. We estimate that approximately 136,000 people in the U.S. were using Truvada for PrEP as we exited the second quarter. We are also encouraged to see third-party providers announcing new initiatives on broadening access to PrEP.","Turning to Europe, total HIV and HBV revenues were $732 million in the second quarter, down 3% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease was driven by negative foreign exchange. The sequential increase was due to robust demand for our HIV therapies.","Strong uptake of our TAF franchise continues throughout Europe. Based on preliminary data for the second quarter, Genvoya is expected to be the most prescribed therapy for both treatment-na\u00efve and switch patients across the top five European markets collectively. I'm delighted to say that in France, the largest HIV market in Europe, Genvoya became the most prescribed HIV regimen for treatment-na\u00efve and switch patients just four months after launch.","Turning to Descovy and Odefsey. We now have these products available in 19 and 16 European countries respectively. Additional launches are anticipated in 2017 as pricing and reimbursement discussions continue. Guidelines have a significant impact on prescribing patterns. Following the recent inclusion in France, Genvoya is now a preferred regimen in country guidelines in all five of the major European markets.","Turning to HCV, total revenues in the U.S. were $1.9 billion in the second quarter, down 17% year-over-year and up 13% sequentially. The quarter-on-quarter increase was primarily due to a change in inventory and the timing of patient starts. Our market share for the quarter remained high at approximately 80%.","HCV patient starts in the first six months were better than we originally anticipated. As a result, while we still expect a gradual decline over the second half of the year, we estimate total U.S. market starts to be 185,000 to 200,000 for 2017. Approximately 9 million individuals were tested for HCV in 2016, a 15% increase from 2015.","As you may recall, we launched an educational campaign in October of last year to encourage baby boomers to get tested. Our research shows that there has been an 80% increase in HCV antibody screening by baby boomers since the start of this initiative. As testing has increased, so has diagnosis. Approximately 190,000 people were newly diagnosed with HCV in 2016, a 32% increase from 2015. This reinforces our belief that there is a significant opportunity to treat and cure many HCV infected individuals for years to come. Gilead is committed to raising disease awareness and urging all individuals at risk for or living with HCV to talk to their health care provider.","Turning to Europe, total HCV revenue in the second quarter was $591 million, down 24% year-over-year and up 21% from the previous quarter. As Robin mentioned, the quarter-on-quarter increase was due to the one-time recognition of a deferred revenue related to an HCV contract.","Gilead patient starts were approximately 23,000 for the quarter, as declining trends in early launch countries were offset by the opening of access in other markets. With the addition of France, Italy and Spain earlier this year, all five major European markets have now agreed to expand access to patients regardless of fibrosis score. This means that there are now 16 European countries that allow patient access regardless of disease severity.","We are seeing rapid uptake of Epclusa, mirroring the same success we had some nine months ago in the U.S. Epclusa is quickly becoming the standard of care for HCV patients with genotypes 2 and 3, and reimbursement has been achieved in 21 countries.","While many people have been diagnosed with HCV and cured, there remain millions of people infected with HCV throughout Europe. In Germany, there are over 100,000 people estimated to be infected with HCV who are unaware that they have the disease. In partnership with the German Liver Foundation, Gilead has launched its first large multichannel disease awareness campaign to communicate that HCV can affect anyone and encourage all individuals at risk to talk to their health care provider.","Looking to the second half of 2017, and with the launch of Vosevi, we believe that Gilead has the most comprehensive portfolio of products to meet the needs of almost all hepatitis C patients, regardless of disease severity, regardless of genotype and regardless of prior treatment.","Finally, as I highlighted last quarter, our U.S. cardiopulmonary team is delivering consistently impressive results. They embody the same tenets of operational excellence as our HIV and liver teams. Letairis and Ranexa revenue total $430 million for the quarter.","I would now like to turn the call over to Norbert.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thank you, Kevin. Earlier this week we announced the exciting results presented at the IAS meeting in Paris from two Phase 3 studies, studies 1489 and 1490 evaluating a fixed dose combination of B\/F\/TAF compared to the triple-therapy regimens containing dolutegravir among treatment-na\u00efve patients.","In Study 1489, adults with HIV were randomized to receive B\/F\/TAF or the fixed-dose combination of abacavir, dolutegravir, lamivudine, and in Study 1490, adults with HIV were randomized to receive B\/F\/TAF or dolutegravir plus F\/TAF. In both studies, B\/F\/TAF met its primary objective of non-inferiority as defined by the proportion of patients who achieved biological suppression. There was no treatment-emerging resistance through 48 weeks. B\/F\/TAF was well tolerated and no patients discontinued study medication due to renal events in either study.","Additionally, no new safety signals were observed, and the nature and incidence of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities was similar among treatment groups with the exception of nausea in Study 1489 which occurred with higher frequency in the abacavir-dolutegravir-lamivudine arm. It was also reported at the conference that in Study 1489 there were more patient self-reported neurological and constitutional adverse events in the abacavir-dolutegravir-lamivudine arm.","These results reinforce the value of pairing bictegravir, an unboosted integrase inhibitor with a high barrier to resistance, with the demonstrated long-term safety profile of the F\/TAF backbone, addressing the limitations of current HIV therapy. B\/F\/TAF could represent an important advance in the triple-therapy treatment for a broad range of HIV patients including the aging population and those with mild to moderate renal impairment.","Last month, Gilead filed a new drug application for B\/F\/TAF with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration based on data from studies 1489 and 1490 and two other ongoing studies evaluating the single-tablet regimen in virologically suppressed patients.","In both these studies, patients were randomized to either switch to B\/F\/TAF or remain on their existing regimen, which in one study is a triple-therapy regimen containing abacavir-dolutegravir-lamivudine, and the other study, a regimen of two nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors and a boosted protease inhibitor. We plan to present data from these studies at scientific meetings later this year. In addition to these four studies, we have one other study ongoing where patients on dolutegravir and Descovy are randomized to stay on that regimen or switch to B\/F\/TAF.","In the European Union, Gilead's marketing authorization application for B\/F\/TAF was fully validated earlier this month and is now under evaluation by the European Medicines Agency.","With regards to HIV prevention research, we're pleased to report that the DISCOVER trial is now fully enrolled ahead of schedule with more than 5,000 participants across North America and Europe. The DISCOVER study randomized patients to receive Truvada or Descovy to evaluate whether Descovy is safe and effective at reducing the risk of HIV infection when used as a pre-exposure prophylaxis.","Turning to NASH, two Phase 3 trials, STELLAR 3 and STELLAR 4 are underway, evaluating selonsertib, which is our ASK-1 inhibitor in patients with F3 bridging fibrosis and F4 cirrhosis. Enrollment in these studies is going well, and since initiating the studies in March of this year, we have already screened more than 1,000 patients. We're confident that these studies will be fully enrolled in the first half of 2018.","Recall that in a phase 2 study, selonsertib was shown to reverse fibrosis and decrease fibrosis progression in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, two other compounds with different mechanisms of action, an ACC inhibitor, GS-0976, and an FXR agonist GS-9674, are currently in Phase 2 with data readouts anticipated in the second half of this year. We're also exploring combinations of the three agents in Phase 2a studies.","In oncology, a Phase 3 study of andecaliximab, which is our anti-MMP-9 antibody in patients with gastric cancer is ongoing and interim futility analysis from this study will be conducted later this year. In addition, the Phase 2a study has been initiated to evaluate combinations of our BTK inhibitor, tirabrutinib, with our PI3K inhibitor, idelalisib, and our Syk inhibitor, entospletinib, in combination with obinutuzumab in patients with relapsed refractory CLL. We're also evaluating entospletinib in a Phase 2 study in acute myeloid leukemia.","In inflammation, five Phase 3 studies of filgotinib are ongoing in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. We plan to initiate a Phase 2 study with filgotinib in combination with GS-9876, a Syk inhibitor.","In summary, significant progress has been made with many of our programs. Four molecules are continuing in Phase 3, including the Descovy for PrEP, Selonsertib for NASH, filgotinib for rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and we expect to see a number of regulatory and clinical milestones in the second half of this year.","I would now like to turn over the call to John.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thanks, Norbert. I'm going to keep my remarks brief so we can get your questions. I do want to emphasize the importance of Norbert's comment a few moments ago. We've made tremendous strides with antiretroviral therapy over the past two decades. But still today every treatment option available has some compromise, be that a food requirement, the risk of side effects, tolerability, the emergence of viral resistance or a potential interaction with another medication.","Those trade-offs and compromises that people living with HIV and their healthcare providers have to make may be minimized to perhaps the greatest extent possible with B\/F\/TAF. This is why we're so encouraged by the data presented at the IAS Conference in Paris this week and by the data in patients switching from other HIV medications that will be presented at scientific meetings later this year.","I'd also like to take this time to congratulate our partner, Janssen, for the positive CHMP opinion on Symtuza, a single-tablet regimen containing darunavir, cobicistat, emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide, or TAF. When approved by the European commission, Symtuza will be the first commercially available STR containing a protease inhibitor, an important option for patients who previously had to consume two or more tablets every day.","Turning to HCV, last month the CHMP issued a positive opinion on Gilead's application for marketing authorization for Vosevi. Then just last week, the U.S. FDA approved Vosevi for the treatment of HCV genotypes 1 through 6 in patients who virus rebounded during or after treatment with an NS5A inhibitor and in patients with genotypes 1a and 3 who have been previously treated with a sofosbuvir-containing regimen. The approval is three weeks ahead of the PDUFA date and marks Gilead's fourth HCV therapy approval in three-and-a-half years.","We commenced our launch plan immediately upon notification by FDA. Bottles of Vosevi were shipped to wholesalers last week and it is now available in pharmacies. We are aware that prescriptions were written within hours of the approval and are pleased that many patients who have run out of options and are worried about the progression of their liver disease will now have another chance to be cured of their HCV infection.","We had a strong second quarter, and as you heard from Norbert, our pipeline is growing and maturing in HIV, NASH, inflammatory diseases and oncology. We are looking ahead to a number of exciting clinical milestones in the second half of this year and the continued progression of the B\/F\/TAF regulatory review in the U.S., Europe and other countries.","I want to take this opportunity to thank Gilead's 9.000 employees for the incredible focus, hard work and execution over the first half of this year.","In the interest of time. let's now open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for the question and congrats on the quarter. Got one for Kevin or Norbert. So the Genvoya launch continues to look really, really good. But I wanted to know, now that you have the bictegravir data in hand, one, how are you thinking about positioning relative to Genvoya; and two, is there enough differentiation versus dolutegravir to take share that you didn't get with Genvoya? Thanks.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hey, Geoff. Thank you for the question. I should say straightaway that not in the room today is Jim Meyers, our Executive Vice President for Commercial Operations, because actually Jim has been in Paris these last few days. He's heading back today and he certainly relayed to us the excitement around Bic\/F\/TAF. We've had several key opinion leader advisory boards and I think the data that we've presented them from the first two studies have been exceedingly well received.","Having said that, Geoff, we've made a flying start with Genvoya. I don't think we could be happier. As I said in my script, over half of our patients are now TAF-based in the U.S., and we have a range of different conversions in Europe, but somewhere like Germany, it was our first country, is now upwards of 65%. So we're thrilled with the adoption of Genvoya.","Not only that, Descovy and Odefsey, and as I think I've said in the past, the success of Bic\/F\/TAF is on the platform of the adoption of Descovy-based regimens. So we consider this a total family. We're still really excited about Bic\/F\/TAF. Nothing has changed. The data is reinforced so we got tremendous product. It's a beautiful small pill and we think it can be very strongly additive to our F\/TAF portfolio of drugs. So as far as we're concerned, we're now going to be moving to very high gear for the launch of that new regimen come 2018.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yeah, Geoff, you asked about differentiation from dolutegravir. If you look at the results from Study 1490, the two, so comparing dolutegravir F\/TAF to B\/F\/TAF, the two drugs are virologically identical. Adverse events, laboratory abnormalities are the same, the real differentiation is we have one single pill co-formulated, one co-pay, one pill. That's the big differentiation from dolutegravir.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So thanks, thanks very much. I was on mute for a second there. I guess if I could ask, you called out, I guess, the broad question here is around what you're seeing in the HCV market and sort of sustainability of the revenues that you've talked about. And related to that, could you just comment, I think you called out a couple one-time items, but you didn't disclose the size of the inventory or the size of the 1X tenants (31:31). If you'd be willing to just \u2013 if you're not willing to disclose that number, could you just give us an idea of the relative size of those? That would be helpful. Thanks.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hey, Matthew. It's Kevin. I'll kick off and then Robin can add to my comments. We're very pleased that there is this increased number of patients that have started in the first half of the year. I think naturally we were careful and sensitive in going into 2017. A cure market has surprises on the way up and it certainly surprises on the way down. So I think we took a very careful approach to what might happen in 2017. It is clear that more patients are starting than we had predicted in our guidance, and as I said in my opening remarks, we now think it's going to be in the range of 185,000 to 200,000 patients. So clearly that's very positive.","The other thing I would say is my comments on identifying HCV-infected individuals. If you think about it, as we're treating and curing patients, we want to make sure that the patients infected are coming into the system, albeit that they generally seem to be less ill than they were a few years ago. But it's important to still keep the movement of patients coming through. And as I said, we still consider this a large market, a very important market for Gilead, albeit that we still think there is a gradual trend down and where that sort of turns the corner or bottoms out, right now, still remains to be seen.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hi, Matt. And to answer the other part of your question, the specific items that we called out. So on HCV, in the U.S., we did talk about inventory. And I would say that trend is not any different than what we've typically seen in HIV. I think we'd not called them out in the past because we typically had other changes that somewhat masked them. But with a sequential change or with a sequential kind of stabilization of pricing as well as patient starts and market share, that shift in inventory is just more noticeable. But the same IMA agreements are in place for HIV exists, that the ranges for our overall inventory were maintained quarter-on-quarter.","And keep in mind, with the Epclusa launch last fall, just that ongoing volatility until you get to steady state is what we see the dynamics impacting us where we had kind of an inventory build here, given inventory adjustments the last couple of quarters. I just want to emphasize that despite the inventory change, that the real underlying driver is just what Kevin talked about in the U.S. It's really increased patient starts, and so the inventory change was just one component of the over-performance.","In EU, the other area we called out was the one-time deferred revenue recognition from a volume-based contract agreement that we had in Italy that expired. So we had been recognizing revenue a little conservative to-date, and so we had a catch-up one-time adjustment. If you take that out, the HCV revenue for Europe sequentially would been about flat.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoff Porges with Leerink Partners.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much. Two very quick questions. I apologize, but could you, Robin, could you let us know when we should anticipate the first generic Truvada in the U.S. given your agreement with Teva? At least, can we anticipate that it won't be in the next 18 months? And secondly, Norbert, I'm sure you've looked very hard at the filgotinib clinical experience to-date, and could you comment on whether you've seen any thromboembolic events? Any imbalance in such events? Or whether you believe in any way it's related to JAK kinase inhibition?","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","So specifically to the first question, Geoff, it's John Milligan. With regard to generic Truvada, we don't expect generic Truvada in the United States until 2021.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Thanks. That's very helpful.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yes, Geoff, we have looked, of course, at our database since the news was announced by Lilly and Incyte, and we have found a total of three thromboembolic events. This is, by the way, in a database of 1,900 patient years of experience. One of the events was, by the investigator said, not related to the study drug because it was recurrent. This was pulmonary embolism. One of them was unlikely, and one of them was possible.","So it's really a small number. And as you also know, thrombolic events, inflammatory conditions in general are not unusual.","But I would like to point out, we are, in our filgotinib study, I think we have de-risked the program by pursuing two doses. This is something that FDA asked us to do. We agreed. And so if there should be a difference between the two doses, we will see it.","Geoff, I would like to add another quick \u2013 this is more speculation and hypothesis. If you believe that these events that Lilly saw are drug-related, so that's of course a big question, because they saw a total of five.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Yes.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","The second is if you then believe that they have to do with high platelet numbers, this then all kind of makes sense because baricitinib makes platelets go up. Filgotinib in contrast shows a platelet decrease. So if this is real and if this is the mechanism, then we should not be seeing this. Again, this is somewhat speculative and hypothesis.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much for the two questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alethia Young with Credit Suisse.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on a very solid quarter. I guess, Kevin, I just want to dig a little bit more into the trends we're seeing in Europe. I saw that Genvoya rose up to the top position in na\u00efves, and I guess I just want to know a little bit more under the hood of what's driving the dynamics there in Europe for HIV. Thanks.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hi, Alethia. Thank you for the comments. Yeah, we're delighted with the quarter. I think it was just all round solid across regions, all our products are. I also salute Norbert for some incredible milestones on the R&D front. So we're really pleased with where we are as a company in the middle of the year.","Yes, Genvoya is now starting to exhibit across the countries the same performance that we are having in the U.S. The extreme of that is Germany. We're having very good uptake in Spain and Italy. And of course as I highlighted, France has done extraordinarily well just in four months to become the leading na\u00efve and switch product.","The other thing I should say, Alethia, is that Descovy in itself is doing very, very well in Europe. There are one or two markets that don't have the level of STRs that we have here in the United States, if you take somewhere like Germany. So Descovy itself is doing very well and we're happy to have that switch from Truvada to Descovy because it's a great platform for B\/F\/TAF in the future. So I think we're very pleased to be where we are and I only see great momentum across the European countries.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Skorney with Robert Baird.","Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. John, I know if I asked you what company you're going to buy, you'd tell me, but I think the market should keep guessing, so I'm going to ask something else. The new diagnosis rates in HCV are pretty impressive, but I wonder if you could characterize the trends you're seeing in access in the U.S. and maybe provide some characterization of what type of patients are being diagnosed. It never seemed like actual patient diagnosed volume is an issue, so are these patients that are being diagnosed or do you think that are accessible from the current payer situation, and is the payer situation improving from your point of view?","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Maybe, Brian, I could start with that. We're not seeing a great deal of change. Pretty much the patients are, if you like, settling down. They are na\u00efve to therapy, lower fibrosis scores. Generally we have about the same access that we had in terms of start of the year. So there has not been any big, fundamental changes. I think there are still a proportion of patients somewhere in the region of 20% to 25% who do get diagnosed with quite advanced disease. But on a general basis they are fitter than the established patients that were there in doctors' offices and have been sat there for a long time waiting for a new treatment. So that's kind of bad news\/good news because we do eventually believe that they will come through the system and make this a long-term market for us.","Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","I think my question was just really meant more around the new patients are \u2013 I mean, are we looking at the spike in patients, are these patients that are diagnosed who are incarcerated, or is it heterogeneous and kind of the standard? So I want to know, is the spike in new diagnosis, is it actually going to pay off or is it in a patient population that's more or less inaccessible to branded products right now?","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Brian, most of the folks who are seeking diagnosis are people who have access to very, very good medical care. This is not about incarceration. The rate of treatment of incarcerated individuals is still exceedingly low in this country, something that we're focusing on but have had very little traction on. So people who we're seeking, essentially the baby boomers who we're seeking, typically have very good healthcare or Medicare.","Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, thanks.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","And so this a very good, accessible population.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Citibank.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe we could just follow-up and ask a little bit more about what's going on in the HIV market and who is switching. Who is not switching to these new therapies in the United States? And what percentage of switch is coming from Triumeq or Tivicay regimens?","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hi, Robyn. Nice to hear your voice again. Congratulations on I think the addition to your family.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","So great to have you back. Really the results are very positive across the board. As I said, about 30% of switches come to Genvoya. When you start to break down the rest of it, it tends to be kind of a mishmash, a whole bunch of other switches. In terms of your question about how much of Genvoya comes from non-Gilead regimens, that's just over, that's 10% to 11% and that's stayed fairly constant since we launched Genvoya. So that's all additive to us. It's very positive and I think that will probably stay about where it is.","So I wouldn't say there's any particular new dynamics. The switch continues to be the biggest part of the HIV market and Genvoya is clearly leading the products in the go-to switch regimen. Overall, I think we're just absolutely delighted that physicians see the benefit of having their patients on long-term TAF-based regimens good for the suppression of HIV and obviously good for their kidneys and good for the bones.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And as a follow up, do you think there's anyone \u2013 do you have a sense yet that there's a percentage of people that you will not be able to switch? Or when do you think you'll have a good sense of maybe a part of the market that will not be switching to these new therapies? Will it take the launch of the F\/TAF for you to understand that or do you think you kind of have a sense of that right now?","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Well we do hope Genvoya is going to keep going up until we bring in the F\/TAF in 2018. Robin, there are certain patients who are just very familiar with their therapies. I dare say there's still going to be some Atripla patients, Stribild patients, Complera patients. They're just comfortable. Even after discussion with their physician, sometimes patients don't want to switch. And also don't forget, you've got a smaller proportion of patients who are on the PI regimens and sometimes physicians who feel that they perhaps might not be quite as adherent prefer them to be on a PI-based regimen. So there may not be the patients who come across.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to go back to HIV again. In some of the doublet data that was presented at IAS, there was a very small subset of patients that experienced resistance mutations, secondary to extreme nonadherence. I'm curious as to your views on this and whether you think it's a meaningful finding or just noise. Thanks.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yes, Cory, thanks for the question. It's Norbert. There's no doubt that both dolutegravir and 3TC are proven long-term tolerable and safe drugs. The question that everybody has, are the two by themselves enough to chronically suppress virus replication in a broad patient population irrespective of baseline viral load and irrespective of partial adherence. And I think the data that were presented at IAS, ACTG 5353 has put that into doubt. Even though these patients were non-adherent, the one especially that developed the 263 mutation, the fact is this is real life. These patients do exist. Not all patients are adherent all the time. And we just have to wait for long-term two-year data to really answer this question.","By the way, if you look at the detailed slides, there were actually five patients that had virological failure if you use the FDA definition of greater than 50 copies per ml at week 24, and it was at week 24 analysis. So again, we need to see more data and I know that the Phase 3 studies are ongoing, the GEMINI studies and hopefully we'll get the answer from that. But as I said, at this point I have great doubts whether that dolutegravir\/3TC is enough to cover a broad patient population.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Cory, it's Kevin here. If you get virological failure and resistance in a controlled clinical setting in a study, then I don't know what might happen in real life. It's important to say that with the large numbers of HIV patients that are treated these days, many have quite chaotic personal lives in terms of housing and the need for social care, and they are very challenged. And I think it's important that those type of patients really do get robust therapies that do our very best to avoid them getting into difficult situations of failure.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe first one for Norbert. We heard from some physicians attending IAS this week that there's a small but potentially meaningful difference in CNS studies such as sleep quality or disturbance or insomnia. How meaningful is that in the real practice? Do you think that you can make a differentiation between bictegravir and the Tivicay or Triumeq regimen?","And then secondly, maybe for Kevin, we're expecting AbbVie to obtain FDA approval probably this quarter for their once-daily one pill regimen for HCV. What's the outlook for market share and also the pricing dynamics once AbbVie enters the market with another one pill once-daily regimen for HCV? Thank you.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yes. So, Ying, in Study 1489, which was the trial mate to bictegravir B\/F\/TAF comparison, there were clearly more adverse, self-reported adverse events that had to do with sleep disturbance, nausea, et cetera, on the abacavir-containing arm. But in the second, Study 1490, the incidence was similar. So our interpretation is that what we are seeing in terms of CNS-related effects and constitutional general well being has to do with abacavir. The comparison of bictegravir to dolutegravir did not really show a difference, and I cannot at this point tell you what bictegravir does in terms of CNS side effects.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hey, Ying. It's Kevin. In answer to your question, we just don't know. We're just sort of two weeks before their FDA PDUFA date. We'll just have to cross some bridges when we see their label, we see their pricing, we see how they begin to promote the product, perhaps eventually see how they come on the market with their contracting strategies. So I think there are unknowns, and we'll just have to wait and see.","I can only really control the areas that we have with our products, and I think we feel reassured by the portfolio of HCV products. Now we have Vosevi added to that. I think we have a tremendous offering in genotype 1, 2 and 3. Epclusa, as Robin mentioned, is doing really, really well, both here and now it's coming on-stream in Europe and we'll be able to also help the small number of patients who failed other therapies with Vosevi. So I think we're in a good position, and we're certainly going to continue with our very solid and very substantial promotion of our products.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Ying, I would like to add, if you look at the data on (52:34), they had excellent clinical results in genotype 1 in treatment-na\u00efve very early disease mostly F0 and F1. Actually, 80% of the population was F0 and F1 and in treatment-na\u00efve patients. But the data in the other genotypes and also in treatment-experienced and cirrhotic patients were less good, particularly if you look at genotype 3 where they compared in eight weeks to 12 weeks to 12 weeks of sofosbuvir\/daclatasvir, the regimen that had the most virological failures was the eight weeks of the AbbVie dual followed by the 12 weeks of the AbbVie dual, and the best-performing regimen was actually sofosbuvir\/daclatasvir. So as Kevin said, we just have to really look at what the U.S. label will look like, then we will be in a better position to comment on the competitive nature.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Yee with Jefferies.","Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks. I have two R&D questions. One is on filgotinib, where you mentioned there was an interim analysis in UC in the first half of 2018. Can you just remind us a bit on that and what the importance is of that in terms of that interim? And then secondly, on FXR, you have a Phase 2 coming up soon in PBC. I wanted to understand your confidence in terms of efficacy and differentiation and what you would want to see to move forward in NASH? Thanks.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yeah, thank you, Michael. No, the interim analysis was not on filgotinib, it was on the MMP9 antibody andecaliximab. And that interim analysis is an analysis when we will have reached 30% of the endpoints, and the endpoint is death. So it's overall survival, and that will happen later this year. And we have a hazard ratio pre-specified, so it's more a futility analysis. If we don't reach a minimal hazard ratio, then we will probably discontinue the study. But if the DSMB sees that has a ratio reached, they will simply recommended to continue the study. And the second question.","Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC","Maybe I'm just reading it wrong on slide 51, and so I'll follow up with you. On the top there it says filgotinib, Phase 3 UC interim. But we'll keep going.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Okay. Yes, we'll follow up with you afterwards. I don't have slide 51. And the other question had is about FXR agonist in PBC. We just have to see what the data looks like. But as you know, or may know, we are differentiated in terms of mechanism because we rely on intestinally generated FGF19 to essentially give you the efficacy. And we think some the side effects that have been seen with the other FXR agonist may have to do with systemic FXR agonism.","It's all hypothesis and the initial data that we have would actually support it. But if we were to see this, we could have an agent that is differentiated from a safety point of view. And the other thing you may probably also know, the compound that's approved currently has pretty severe limitations with regards to hepatic impairment. I think it has to be given, is it once a week? I don't remember, but it greatly increases the concentration of OCA. So those are the two areas of differentiation.","Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Nadeau with Cowen and Company.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the beat and raise in the quarter. One question on bictegravir's data that was presented earlier this week. When GSK was asked about bictegravir this morning, they highlighted the numeric differences in virologic suppression that we're seeing in Study 1490, although those differences weren't statistically significant. I guess along those lines, one, to what to do you attribute those differences? Two, how successful do you think you'll be in convincing physicians that they are not significant, using things like the missing excluded analysis that you showed in the poster. And three, do you even expect them to be on the label?","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Sure. So, Phil, this is actually very simple. You can have virological failure. There are three categories that fall into it. Number one, you come in at the week 48 visit and you truly have above 50 copies per ml, that's one virological failure. The second is if you discontinue and the physician indicates on the discontinuation form that you've discontinued for the lack of efficacy, that's number two. And the third category is, if you have discontinued at any point in time for administrative reason and your last measurement was greater than 50.","And now look at that third category. We had a total of 11 patients on the bictegravir arm versus three on the dolutegravir arm that discontinued due to administrative reason. And out of those 11, by the way, six only showed up at the first visit. So they showed up, first visit, took the drug and then we never saw them again. And the reason was various: they moved out of the area, they couldn't be reached anymore, they were incarcerated, things like that.","So we think this is a completely a non-issue and we will have no problems at all convincing physicians that this doesn't matter. These numbers will be in the label, absolutely. This is how FDA, in all HIV drugs, in all Phase 3 data categorizes thing. But it will be categorized exactly this: virological failure due to number one; two, virological failure, discontinued due to lack of efficacy; and number three, and that's the category I want to point your attention to, discontinued for other reasons and last measurement was greater than 50.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hey, Phil, it's Kevin. Just to also add, the real \u2013 the number one headline that is most important to opinion leaders, and therefore the HIV community, is zero resistance. When we have met with our KOLs, that is where they go to first, it's zero resistance, and of course, that is unlike the situation that occurred in ACTG 5353.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yes, Phil, just another comment. You would of course expect in a large study like this that these random events would equally distribute between the two arms. Well, they didn't. As I said, there were 11 on the bictegravir arm versus three on the other arm. It's purely statistical coincidence and it has no meaning whatsoever clinically.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC","Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks for taking my question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn, Ph.D. - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just was wondering, John, if you can give us any update on your latest thoughts on business development, specifically if there have been any changes with respect to either areas of focus or stage of development. Thanks a lot.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thanks, Terence. So the quick answer is no. There hasn't been any difference in what we're thinking about. So we have been very, very active, as we always are. We have beefed up our groups, as you're aware, so that we can evaluate more different kinds of opportunities. And so we are working very hard behind the scenes here on a number of things, but I certainly can't direct you to anything specific, other than to say that we're very, very active. And when the things are right for us, we'll announce them. That's all I can say.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ian Somaiya with BMO Capital Markets.","M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks for taking my questions, and congratulations on a great quarter. Really, just a question on the PrEP opportunity. If you could just quantify for us what the opportunity is today, whether it's in patient terms or dollar terms. And as we think about the DISCOVER study, what does that trial need to show for you to effectively transition these patients from Truvada to Descovy?","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hi, Ian. It's Kevin. I'll let Norbert answer the question on the DISCOVER study. But in terms just generally, compared to the few years ago, it's quite remarkable now how people are taking on board the benefits of PrEP and obviously avoiding infection. We've seen some remarkable work here in San Francisco. We see a lot of activity in New York, Miami, and we have taken those signals and put a larger field-based team out there to try and support the education around PrEP. So we're able to visit places now like Atlanta, Washington, DC and many other urban areas. About half of our Truvada sales in the U.S. are currently coming from PrEP, and we certainly expect that to grow.","If you look at our numbers this year compared to 2016, we're about 15% higher in terms of the use of Truvada for PrEP. And the other part of this is, it's not occasional monthly use of Truvada. We're starting to see persistency at a patient level that is close to matching normal HIV use of Truvada. So we're seeing a chronicity, a regular use among PrEP-using individuals.","And the final thing I would say, Ian, is that we are seeing other parties starting to announce that, for example, retail pharmacies are beginning initiatives that their pharmacist can engage in conversations on PrEP and what PrEP is about and educate people who come into a retail pharmacy to ask about PrEP medication. So that's also I think part of the momentum and movement that's going on right now.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yeah, Ian, from a clinical point of view it's very simple. It's a non-inferiority study. We want to simply show that regarding efficacy-wise that F\/TAF is the same as Truvada along with improved renal and bone parameters. And then because it's much easier and safer to use, you don't have to monitor creatinine. You don't have to look for people that are at risk for bone effects. You don't have to measure BMD, that it's a much preferred agent to Truvada. That's essentially what we're showing. That's why it takes 5,000 patients, by the way. It's not a small study to do.","M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Right. I guess, Norbert, what I was trying to understand is, is the patient sensitivity any different? Are they more sensitive or less sensitive to the adverse event profile of TAF given that they're \u2013 obviously don't carry the infection?","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","No. Actually, Ian, so I don't have those data yet, but we answered that question when we did the PrEP studies with Truvada. There was a question that both we and the FDA had and the question was, can you take safety data from HIV-infected individuals and extrapolate the non-HIV infected, and the conclusion was you can't. So we generated data in about, I can't remember, 25,000 patients total that were not HIV infected, and that database convinced everybody that the safety is the same. There's no difference between HIV infected and non-HIV infected patients.","Operator","Our next question comes from Salim Syed with Mizuho.","Salim Syed - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. Just on, when we're thinking about the tail for hepatitis C, I don't think (65:47) these numbers in a while but correct me if I'm wrong. There's 1.4 million patients treated and there was 4 million to begin with in the U.S. and people have previously thought there was 500,000 that are uninsured and untreated. Of the 2.6 million of which that 500,000 is part of, is there any other patient population as you guys have had more time pass that's not treatable here, or reasonably treatable?","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hey, Salim. It's Kevin. We've always in the U.S. gone with figures that are about 3 million infected and about 1.5 million that are diagnosed. No, I don't think there's any sort of difference in our opinions of the market. There is a proportion of patients that is uninsured. There are a group of patients that are incarcerated. As John said earlier, we see very little treatment. We continue to have conversations with the various states around their systems of incarceration, but there doesn't seem to be much momentum about that.","We talked in the past about obviously the VA. The VA has been incredibly proactive. They've dedicated money. We are hearing, we don't have direct data, but we're hearing that it is slowing down a little bit like the general market, but they continue their efforts to outbound information and try and get people into the system. They're incredibly enthusiastic to try and heal their veterans. And there's the continuation, as John said, of the commercial markets and we certainly are doing our part to try and highlight to patients the need to be tested and that there are very comprehensive ways of curing the disease.","So I think for us to continue to do that at some point, at some point, there will be some equilibrium and that will still be a lot of patients. And with a incredible treatment that cures, payers, providers will be motivated to use therapies. So I don't think there has been any big ahas for us or particular opening of new patient groups in the past 12 months.","Salim Syed - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Carter Gould with UBS.","Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, Kevin, on the Get Tested campaign, is the expectation that screening volumes will still continue to grow meaningfully? Or should we expect that impact to plateau, and is it safe to say that program will continue unchanged when AbbVie enters the market? Thank you.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Good question. Carter. I don't know what way. We could go higher. We always feel that part of our role in the areas, in our large areas that we operate is to provide education. As a reminder, our baby boomer campaign is not aired as much as our Harvoni campaign, but I think in general terms, yes we feel that it is important to continue to highlight that baby boomers potentially who have been in a situation of risk, that they might go and ask for a test and be screened and find out their status. Let's not forget that that principle is backed by the CDC and there is Gilead and there are many other parties that support baby boomers finding out their HCV status, and if they are positive, then to take the steps forward. So yes, we feel that as the leader in HCV, it is part and parcel of the role we play.","Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And that concludes today's question-and-answer session.

My name is Stacy, and I will be your conference moderator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, February 2, 2012. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Susan Hubbard, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Susan Hubbard","Thank you, Stacy. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Gilead's Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. We issued a press release this afternoon providing earnings results for the quarter and full year 2011. This press release is available on our website as are the slides that provide much more detail around the topics covered on today's call. I'm joined today by our President and Chief Operating Officer, John Milligan, who will review the key milestones and strategic initiatives from 2011; followed by our CFO, Robin Washington, who will provide additional details on our financial results and our 2012 guidance; Kevin Young, EVP of Commercial Operations will discuss our commercial performance; and then Norbert Bischofberger, EVP of R&D, will provide an R&D update and key milestones. John Martin, Chairman and CEO, will close out the prepared remarks by outlining our strategic initiatives for the year ahead. ","As a reminder, during today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements regarding our financial outlook in addition to regulatory and product development plan. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. ","A description of these risks can be found on our latest SEC disclosure documents and recent press releases. In addition, please note we undertake no duty to update or revise them. We will also use non-GAAP financial measures to help you understand our underlying business performance. The GAAP reconciliations are provided in our press release as well as on our corporate website. ","I will now turn the call over to John Milligan.","John F. Milligan","Thank you, Susan. Thank you all for joining us today. Our team's hard work over the last several years resulted in many significant financial, commercial and R&D milestones in 2011. We saw record revenues for ATRIPLA, Truvada, AmBisome, Ranexa, Letairis and Cayston. We also achieved record market share for our combined HIV portfolio as well as our cardiopulmonary products. Robin and Kevin will review these outstanding financial and commercial results with you and then Norbert will describe some of our many R&D accomplishments. ","Single-tablet regimens are becoming the standard of care for HIV treatment, and as you know, it is Gilead's ongoing strategy to provide HIV patients with additional options for simplified regimens. During the fourth quarter, the European Commission granted approval of the Truvada rilpivirine, single-tablet regimen for the treatment of HIV. This product, marketed in the EU as Eviplera and as Complera in the U.S., constitutes our second single-tablet regimen and began launching in 2011 in the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and Austria. ","Regulatory submissions for approval were made in the U.S. and EU during 2011 for Quad, which if approved will be Gilead's third single-tablet regimen for the treatment of HIV infection. The NDA was filed less than 6 weeks after data lock. These accelerated timelines for collecting and analyzing the data and filing in both the U.S. and EU were made possible by the dedication and skill of our R&D teams. ","Just 2 weeks ago, FDA approved lower strength tablets and an oral powder formulation of Viread for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in pediatric patients from ages 2 to 12. We are pleased to provide this important therapeutic option for younger HIV patients and are working to make the pediatric formulations of Viread available in the U.S. and abroad. ","For a number of years, we've been collaborating with various organizations to explore the use of Truvada for pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP. Several studies have shown that the use of Truvada in uninfected at-risk adults can reduce HIV transmission. Based on these observations, a supplemental NDA was submitted to FDA in December for the approval of Truvada for prevention of HIV infection among uninfected high-risk adults. To get expert advice on this application, FDA is determined that an advisory committee meeting for the antiviral division will be held in the May timeframe. ","We continue to believe that there's room for significant innovation in the area of HIV and during the year announced a new collaboration with Tibotec to develop the first single-tablet regimen containing a protease inhibitor. Tibotec's PI, darunavir, has now been successfully combined into a single pill with emtricitabine and our investigational agents, cobicistat and GS-7340. And we anticipate clinical studies to begin later this year. In addition, a Phase II study was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2011 for a single-tablet regimen containing emtricitabine, elvitegravir, cobicistat and GS-7340. ","Last year, we entered into a licensing agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim, which allowed us to combine BI's patent estate and compounds on non-catalytic site inhibitors for HIV with our internal research programs. Integrase inhibitors working by this mechanism are not expected to be cross resistant to elvitegravir and we look forward to sharing with you future data on this exciting new class of HIV  inhibitors. ","On the liver disease front, 5-year data from the ongoing open label phase of our 2 Phase III clinical studies of Viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B represented at the key U.S. Liver Meeting, AASLD. These data showed that 5 years of Viread treatment did not just help further progression of fibrosis but actually resulted in improvement of liver fibrosis in 51% of patients and regression of cirrhosis in 74%. We continue to be enthusiastic about the prospects to help people with chronic HPV by developing finite duration treatment. With this goal in mind, an exclusive worldwide licensing and collaboration agreement with GlobeImmune was announced in October. This research is aimed at developing a therapeutic vaccine that will enhance \"s\" antigen conversions providing a functional cure for HPV-infected individuals. In keeping with our philosophy to develop best-in-class drugs, we acquired Pharmasset in order to bring PSI-7977 to our portfolio. We anticipate that we will be able to conduct and complete the clinical studies to allow the first approval of 7977 in combination with ribavirin by FDA during the first half of 2014. We also plan to initiate the development of alternative 7977-containing regimens, including single-tablet regimens with other candidates in our portfolio. This strategy has the potential to benefit a large number of patients and provides the opportunity for a significant revenue growth and diversification in 2014 and beyond. ","Gilead's liver disease team enrolled more than 1,400 HCV-infected patients in various clinical studies during 2011, demonstrating their capacity to work towards these accelerated timelines. ","In summary, 2011 was a very productive year for Gilead and I'm very proud of the individual and collective efforts of all our employees. I will now turn the call over to Rob as he discuss in more detail our financial results. Robin?","Robin L. Washington","Thanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As John mentioned, we made exciting advances in our products and pipeline programs, and our continued commercial execution delivered solid financial performance in spite of a challenging macroeconomic environment. For the fourth quarter, product sales were $2.1 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year. We completed the year with total product sales at the upper end of our guidance at $8.1 billion, an increase of 10% over the prior year. At $8.1 billion, we now have a worldwide business that is 6x the size we were in 2004 when we first launched Truvada in the United States. North America product sales for 2011 were close to $5 billion in total and Europe approached the notable milestone of $3 billion. Gilead generated product revenues above $200 million in 7 countries and today have commercial operational capabilities in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia with a growing presence in South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore. Our fiscal year 2011 non-GAAP product gross margin decreased slightly to 74.8% from 75.8% in fiscal year 2010 primarily due to an annual selling price adjustment for the percentage share of ATRIPLA that is paid to our partner. This adjustment occurred late in Q4. Compared to Q4 of the prior year, this selling price adjustment had an unfavorable impact of approximately 2% on our product gross margin. ","Non-GAAP R&D expenses for 2011 were $1.1 billion, approximately $19 million above the upper end of our guidance. This was primarily due to the milestone payment associated with our accelerated registrational filings for Quad in the U.S. and Europe. In addition to the investments we made in our internal programs over the course of the year, we augmented these efforts through strategic investments and acquisitions and licensing opportunities and collaborations, which in totality resulted in additional R&D expenses for the fourth quarter and full year of approximately $60 million and $100 million, respectively. ","Our 2011 non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $1.1 billion, in line with our guidance. When compared to the prior year, non-GAAP SG&A increased primarily due to expenses associated with the ongoing growth of our business, the U.S. pharmaceutical excise tax expense and bad debt provision due to slower collections in certain southern European countries. ","Turning to cash flows. For the full year 2011, we generated $3.6 billion of operating cash flow, of which approximately $1 billion was generated in the fourth quarter. Our track record of generating strong operational cash flows enabled us to raise a total of $5.9 billion in debt to partially fund our acquisition of Pharmasset while maintaining our investment-grade credit rating. ","The last financial highlight that I would like to share is our full year 2012 guidance, which is detailed on Slide 23 in the earnings call deck available on our corporate website. Please note that this guidance is inclusive of the Pharmasset acquisition, which closed in January. For full year 2012, we are projecting product sales of $8.6 billion to $8.8 billion, reflecting a 6% to 9% increase over 2011 product sales. This range includes the U.S. launch of Quad in the second half of 2012; the growth of Complera and Eviplera in the U.S. and Europe, respectively; the continued gains from our non-HIV products tempered by the ongoing economic uncertainties in Europe and the potential for a continued volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. For example, we estimate that a 10% fluctuation in rates or hedged currencies could have $150 million to $200 million impact on our product sales. Please note that the non-GAAP product gross margin and operating expense guidance provided to you include the impact of acquisition, restructuring and stock-based compensation related expenses where applicable. ","Our non-GAAP product gross margin for the full year 2012 is expected to be in the range of 73% to 75%. We expect non-GAAP R&D expenses for the full year 2012 to be in the range of $1.325 billion to $1.4 billion. This range includes the full year operating expense impact of all our recent acquisitions, including Calistoga, Arresto, Oceanside and, most recently, Pharmasset. ","We expect non-GAAP SG&A expenses for the full year 2012 to be in the range of $1.225 billion to $1.3 billion, which includes the anticipated impact of Quad launch and a higher U.S. pharmaceutical excise tax expense. Our effective tax rate for the full year 2012 is expected to be in the range of 26% to 28% due primarily to the expiration of the federal R&D tax credit and the increase in the U.S. pharmaceutical excise tax, which is nondeductible. ","As detailed on Slide 24, we are anticipating a full year 2012 diluted EPS impact of acquisition, restructuring and stock-based compensation related expenses to be in the range of $0.31 to $0.34 per share. And finally, we anticipate the net interest impact associated with the Pharmasset transaction to be approximately $230 million for 2012, which is detailed on Slide 25. ","I'll now turn the call over to Kevin to share more review regarding our 2011 commercial performance and our outlook for 2012.","Kevin B. Young","Thank you, Robin. I am very proud of the many accomplishments achieved by our commercial organization in 2011 and our results in Q4 bode well for a successful 2012. Especially encouraging were the U.S. Truvada and ATRIPLA Q4 year-on-year growth rates of 9% and 11%, respectively. These results reflect the final release of 2011 ADAP federal funds and the resultant 50% reduction in patient waitlists from that peak. HIV product revenues were unaffected by large wholesale inventory levels and non-retail purchasing was healthy yet in line with patient demand. ","The key patient drivers of HIV growth also looked very encouraging for Q3 2011, our latest data point. In the U.S., the moving annual total number of anti-retroviral-treated patient remained strong at 9% and the median CD4 count at treatment initiation hit an all-time high of 347. We have also been pleased with the uptick of Complera since its U.S. approval and launch in August of last year. Our goal of bringing the combination product of Truvada and rilpivirine to market was to provide additional options to physicians and expand the total number of HIV patients receiving a single-tablet regimen. With this in mind, I'm delighted to say that since the launch of Complera, we are seeing a 37% growth in the number of prescriptions for patients starting on a single-tablet regimen. We hope to reproduce this performance in Europe as we roll out Eviplera during 2012. To date, we have begun supplying Eviplera in the U.K., Austria and Germany. ","Over and above our exceptional performance in HIV in 2011, I'm pleased to say that we have a growing business outside our core antiviral franchise. 13% of net product revenues or over $1 billion came from AmBisome, Ranexa, Letairis and Cayston in 2011. Importantly, Letairis and Ranexa had year-on-year growth rates of 22% and 33%, respectively. As I think about 2012, the underlying drivers of HIV commercial growth continue to look robust. The scientific arguments in HIV to diagnose more patients and treat them earlier have never been stronger. Moreover, the reasons to be using single-tablet regimens are compelling both medically and practically. ","During 2012, we will continue to rollout Complera around the world and, subject to FDA approval, will bring our third single-tablet regimen to individuals in the U.S. living with HIV. We feel confident that the Quad will become an important treatment option for HIV patients initiating therapy and will ultimately be positioned as a preferred therapy in U.S. and international treatment guidelines. Like the rest of the pharmaceutical industry, we will undoubtedly continue to see some headwinds in European markets. Nevertheless, the specialist [ph] nature of Gilead products and the strength of the pharmacoeconomic arguments to treat HIV place us in a strong position for future growth. We will look for opportunities to open up new operating affiliates as we have done successfully in recent years in Austria, Switzerland and Poland where we see sustainable and profitable businesses and healthcare systems that support breakthrough medicines. ","Finally, like the rest of my colleagues, I strongly believe that the acquisition of Pharmasset is a transformational milestone for Gilead. The worldwide potential for all oral antiviral pan-genotypic HCV cure is sizable with over 12 million infected individuals in commercial markets alone. We are already in high gear preparing global launch plans that will bring GS-7977 expeditiously to patients around the world. Our established relationships with the hepatologist and gastroenterologist via Viread HPV, our knowledge of liver disease payers and policy makers and the exciting potential of leveraging our HIV resources to expand HCV-provided capacity is a galvanizing prospect. And I am confident the Gilead commercial organization will rise to the occasion. ","I will now hand the call over to Norbert Bischofberger. Norbert?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Thank you, Kevin. For HIV, in the fall of last year, we provided positive top line results from the 2 pivotal Phase III studies comparing Quad with 2 current standard-of-care regimens, ATRIPLA in Study 102 and atazanavir boosted by ritonavir with Truvada in Study 103. In both cases, at 48 weeks, Quad proved to be non-inferior to the standard-of-care regimens. The 90% response rate observed on the Quad arm in Study 103 is the highest response rate seen in any large, blinded, randomized study of HIV patients. The 48-week results for both pivotal studies were accepted for presentation at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections or CROI taking place in Seattle, March 5 through 8. Study 102 will be the subject of an oral presentation and Study 103 of a poster. ","Across all our HIV programs, there will be at least 45 presentations at CROI, highlighting the important role of Gilead products in the treatment of HIV infection. In the U.S., the NDA application for Quad has been accepted by FDA for standard review with a PDUFA date of August 27. In addition, FDA indicated that a panel will be convened in the May timeframe to provide expert advice on the application. In Europe, we anticipate that EMEA will complete their review by the end of this year. ","To further define the profile of the Quad, we have initiated 3, 48-week Phase IIIb studies to reevaluate switching of biologically suppressed patients from ATRIPLA to Quad in one study from Truvada plus a protease inhibitor to Quad and the other and from raltegravir plus Truvada to Quad in the third study. We expect data from all 3 studies to be available by late 2013. The Quad filing will be followed by regulatory filings this year for the single agent of elvitegravir and cobicistat. The filing for elvitegravir will be supported by Study 145 comparing elvitegravir to raltegravir in treatment-experienced patients. 96-week data indicating non-inferiority of the 2 arms were released in 2011. ","The cobicistat filing will be supported by study 114, a Phase III study comparing cobicistat to ritonavir, both in combination with atazanavir and Truvada. We have released top line results from this study, which also met its 48-week primary objective of non-inferiority. ","Last week, we announced the initiation of a Phase II clinical trial evaluating GS-7340 for the treatment of HIV infection in treatment-na\u00efve adults. This 150-patient Phase II study will evaluate GS-7340 as a part of a once-daily, co-formulated, single-tablet regimen that will also contain cobicistat, elvitegravir and emtricitabine and will be compared to our Quad single-tablet regimen. ","Moving to cardiovascular. Ranexa appears unique among anti-angina agents, because in addition to reducing ischemia in angina, there's evidence that it also lowers Hb1c, the biomarker for type 2 diabetes. 30% to 40% of coronary artery disease patients also have type 2 diabetes. Hence, these patients could potentially derive a dual benefit from Ranexa. In order to further define this potential benefit, we've initiated a Phase III program that includes 3 studies involving approximately 400 patients each to determine the effect of Ranexa alone or in combination with other antidiabetic therapies in lowering Hb1c and plasma glucose after 24 weeks of treatment. Confirmation of the antidiabetic effect of ranolazine in these studies could lead to a new indication of ranolazine for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. ","Another opportunity for Ranexa is its use in conjunction with percutaneous coronary intervention or PCI to prevent subsequent major adverse outcomes. A subgroup analysis of MERLIN, a 7,000-patient study of Ranexa in acute coronary syndrome indicated that Ranexa treatment resulted in a reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with a history of angina undergoing PCI. A Phase III study has started to further define the potential benefit of Ranexa post-PCI. In this trial, 2,600 patient with the history of angina undergoing PCI with incomplete revascularization will be randomized to Ranexa or placebo with the end point of major adverse cardiovascular events. ","On the oncology front, in further strengthening of R&D management, Roy Baynes has joined the Gilead team as Senior Vice President, Oncology Therapeutics. Roy joins us from Amgen where he served as Vice President, Global Development and Therapeutic Area Head for Hematology Oncology. Throughout his tenure there over the last decade, he helped the Clinical Development and Medical Affairs teams responsible for the approval and launch of numerous hematology and oncology products. ","Gilead has acquired promising oncology assets over the last couple of years and voice leadership will be important in bringing these novel candidates to market. GS-1101 went into Phase III development this quarter with studies in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In addition, patients are being involved in 3 Phase II studies of the monoclonal antibody, GS-6624. These Phase II studies are evaluating the efficacy and safety of 2 different doses of GS-6624 in myelofibrosis, pancreatic and colorectal cancers. The pancreatic and colorectal cancer studies are both randomized, blinded studies comparing 6624 versus placebo when added to the standard of care in second line metastatic disease. In addition, 6624 is also being evaluated in a Phase Ib study in IPF and in a Phase II study for liver fibrosis and HCV-infected patients. ","And finally, turning to liver disease. John, Robin and Kevin have all mentioned the important acquisition of Pharmasset. We are proceeding with the Pharmasset Phase III development plan for GS-7977 in genotype 2 and 3 patients. This program consists of 2 studies, 1 in treatment-na\u00efve patients with patent interferon ribavirin as the control arm, the second in interferon intolerant ineligible patients with placebo as the control arm. I'm pleased to report that the treatment-na\u00efve study was initiated in mid-December, and since then, we have screened 145 patients. This trial is the rate-limiting study for filing because of the 24-week duration standard-of-care arm. Due to the great interest and fast enrollment, we anticipate that these 2 Phase III studies will reach target enrollment in the United States before we will be able to activate sites in other geographies. ","As you know, results from the ELECTRON study were presented by Pharmasset at AASLD last October where GS-7977 and ribavirin for 12 weeks resulted in 10 out of 10 cures in genotype 2\/3 patients. We're awaiting data from multiple studies in genotype 1 patients specifically from the ELECTRON study, which involve genotype 1, both treatment-na\u00efve and nonresponders, as well as from the QUANTUM study, which involve genotype 1 treatment-na\u00efve patients. We received news this week that our late breaker abstract has been accepted to CROI for 2 cohorts of genotype 1 HCV-infected patients from the ELECTRON study nonresponders and treatment na\u00efve patients. In both cohorts of that study, all patients treated with GS-7977 and ribavirin achieved undetectable viral load at 4 weeks on treatment, also known as rapid biological response or RVR. ","By the time we present those results, we will have 4 weeks of Sustained Virologic Response data or SVR4 from the nonresponder patients. Many of you noticed, but it's important to reiterate that RVR reflects biological response on treatment. However, the important measure of response and the accepted Phase III endpoint is SVR12, which is the sustained virological response 12 weeks after end of treatment. SVR4 data are a reasonable proxy for SVR12 as most patients that rebound after treatment discontinuation do so in the first 4 weeks. ","We also anticipate that we will have a significant presence at the European Liver Conference taking place in Barcelona in April with over 17 submitted abstracts from our HCV effort alone. As Gilead has pioneered in HIV, we expect to bring forward next generation genotype [ph] regimens for the treatment of hepatitis C also. To that end, drug interactions will be carried out with 7977 and GS-5885 and other internal candidates, which will be followed by Phase II clinical studies. ","In closing, the investments we're making today, both in our broad and promising internal R&D efforts we have embarked upon, will continue to drive the success of our business in the future. I would now turn over the call to John Martin. John?","John C. Martin","Thank you, Norbert. As you have heard, we met a number of important milestones in 2011 that were achieved as a result of all the hard work of Gilead employees over the last several years. This momentum is continuing into 2012. For HIV, we will continue to benefit from the evolution of the U.S., European and international guidelines that support earlier diagnosis and treatment as well as the growing appreciation for the benefits provided by single-tablet regimens. In 2006, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggested HIV testing as part of routine medical care in order to decrease the incidence of new infections. This benefit has now been quantified in study HPTN 052, demonstrating that HIV treatment results in 96% reduction of HIV transmissions in serodiscordant couples. The publication of this work in the New England Journal of Medicine was recognized in December as the Breakthrough of the Year by Science Magazine. The high efficacy demonstrated in HPTN 052 has ended the debate on the value of treatment as prevention. ","In summary, we look forward to adding to the strength of our HIV business with our growing pipeline in cardiopulmonary, oncology and liver disease. As we enter our 25th year, I believe that the health of our company has never been stronger with prospects for exceptional growth for many years to come. ","At this time, we will open the call up to Q&A. Stacy?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Financial one, and then a clinical one. So for your 2012 guidance, can you let us know if you assume top line or margin impact from the Quad launch and then your currency assumptions in 2012 guidance? And then for Norbert, just a question here on strategy in genotype 1. And congrats on the data that you told us today, but what changes would you guys make in genotype 1 to the original Pharmasset strategy, registration strategy? Would you increase the number of patients? Would you increase the -- or change the comparative group? Just to help us out with that.","Robin L. Washington","Geoff, it's Robin, I'll answer the financial part of your question. Yes, we did include the Quad launch as well as the contingent uptick of Complera from a product gross margin in our overall guidance. I mean, from an operating margin standpoint, some of that is tempered by the R&D investments that we're making associated with Pharmasset and the rest of our therapeutic areas. You also asked about currency. As I mentioned in the guidance section, the FX assumption is included in that plus or minus 10%. We believe that our current revenue base is about $150 million to $200 million.","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Yes, just on the clinical side, of course, we are -- we've been thinking about the whole different number of scenarios and many of these depend on what the emerging data look like. And that will all become much clearer in the next month or 2 or 3. And the other thing is we still have to have conversations with regulatory authorities. But something I can tell you, we've been thinking about this to further accelerate the program. It's entirely conceivable that you would actually -- the studies that will get to approval would be 2 or 3 placebo-controlled studies. So you take the placebo-controlled study in genotype 2\/3 that Pharmasset has announced already at AASLD and you add to that 1 or 2 placebo-controlled studies in genotype 1 with 7977 and ribavirin. That would probably be an attractive thing for us to do. But again, of course, it depends on the data and the genotype 1 patients and secondly whether regulatory authorities would agree to that. And both of those things are being discussed internally and we have a meeting scheduled with regulatory authorities to discuss this.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I'm going to ask one really boring gross margin question and then one on HIV franchise. On the gross margins, if my math is right, it looks like you guys are actually guiding to -- I think you're non-GAAP gross margin in 2011 was about 74.5%. Your guidance is 73% to 75% for 2012. But Complera is obviously a higher-margin product and ATRIPLA is a higher-margin product. So can you help me understand why there wouldn't be more gross margin expansion? And then Merck today on their call said that Isentress has 14% patient share. But when asked about the impact of the Quad, they seem to minimize it because they said that the booster will keep people away from the Quad. Do you think you can take the 14% patient share away from Merck as low-hanging fruit in a refractory setting?","Robin L. Washington","So, Mark, I'll take the first part. So the margin to your point is higher for Complera. But Complera and the launch of the Quad, which wouldn't happen until the second half of 2012, are still relatively small relative to ATRIPLA. So while we keep some overall uptick because the variation in the mix of the single-tablet regimen doesn't start to make a huge difference until the out-years of the Quad upticks and Complera upticks. And you'll see more of that in 2013 and 2014.","Kevin B. Young","Mark, it's Kevin on HIV. We think we've got very attractive potentials for Quad. The results that was referred to by Norbert, I can tell you, the awareness of Quad is incredibly high, particularly in the U.S. where we did the majority of our 102 and 103 studies. And I just think there is such a high and growing demand now for single-tablet regimens. On Slide 36, we begged a snapshot of Synovate Q4. The IPSOS [ph] healthcare database is actually Synovate, they were bought out. And so we begged to have a very early look -- particularly for Complera. But you can see already, just in the first quarter, our Gilead single-tablet regimen share has gone up to almost 60% in the na\u00efve patients. And I think that shows you the preference for a single-tablet, so I think having our quote on the market will only help that. I do want to point out that, of course, our label will be in the na\u00efve-treatment setting as opposed to treatment-experienced patients for the Quad. But nevertheless, I think the Quad is, in my mind, going to do very, very well in HIV.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rachel McMinn with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Rachel L. McMinn - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Norbert, I just wanted to follow up on the comments you made with regards to the ELECTRON data at CROI. Is that 10 patient data sufficient to discuss the Phase III design with regulators? Or do you need additional data beyond that? I assume you do. And just as a corollary on the R&D budget, just want to get a better sense for this. Do you -- you have lots of, I assume, increased HCV expenses. Are you assuming any discontinuation from other kind of pipeline studies? Or is that something that could impact R&D numbers later after you do a portfolio review?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Yes, Rachel, so I'll answer the first question. So the data that we will have by CROI or we'll be presenting at CROI is enough to schedule the meeting with the FDA. So that's the data that we're going to send in to get a meeting date. And when the meeting is actually scheduled, which is typically 3, 4 weeks later, then we'll have more data. And that will absolutely suffice to discuss the strategy that we're going to pursue in Phase III and genotype 1 patients.","Robin L. Washington","So Rachel, it's Robin. Relative to our R&D guidance specific year of investment for us, there, to your point there, our incremental investments in liver disease, there will be some rationalization of the portfolio. But again, given the transaction's quote less than a month ago, we're still going through that process. So that's basically taking our liver disease program and their program. And we'll do some rationalization, but that won't have an impact until the latter half of the year. There's also the ongoing investment in oncology and inflammation. And you have to keep in mind that our study progressions, we have a lot more in Phase II and Phase III trials versus prior year. So not only in 2012 but also in 2013, you'll see R&D expenses a bit higher.","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Rachel, maybe to follow up on that, we started a large number of Phase II studies last year that looked at relevant questions then, they are not as relevant anymore now. So we will, of course, discontinue those studies, but it takes a while to close them out. So as Robin said, the real benefit of closing them out will not be seen in the first half of this year, more a bit later.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Roden with UBS.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Also a follow-up on hepatitis C. Nice to hear that you're going to have the SVR4 data from electronic CROI. Should we presume that we're going to see SVR12 data at another medical meeting later this year, perhaps at EASL? And similarly, are we going to see a QUANTUM data presented at EASL? Or is that simply a top line press release? Secondly, just on the financial guidance here, you referred to economic uncertainties in Europe as one of the factors you considered in product sales guidance here. So can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of budgetary constraints to access the pricing receivables so that we can sort of reflect that in our models as well?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","So, Matt, I'll answer your first question. It is our intent that, as these data mature, that we will make them public and communicate them because we have to do that. We also owe it to the investigators and the patients, that they know and that helps involvement in nonclinical studies. But we have not made a decision yet what exactly we're going to present at what meeting. It depends on really how the data evolves and what are we going to have at what point in time when the abstract deadline is due. So we'll decide that when -- on more short notice.","Robin L. Washington","Matt, just a further clarity on Europe, right, we mentioned just the ongoing uncertainties. There is an assumption of about a 2% to 3% income -- impact from overall price reductions, which is mostly just part of the ongoing process that happens over there and there was a small amount of incremental austerity measures in the latter half of 2011 where we'll see the full year impact. Relative to collection, we continue to build up our reserves. That wouldn't impact revenue, but we baked an increase in bad debt associated with southern Europe into our SG&A guidance as well. But primarily, if things continue to deteriorate, a lot could happen as well as to have them relative to the valuation of the euro. So we factored that in also.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So Norbert, just for you, 2 questions. One, I mean, the data is looking like it's going to be very good from ELECTRON, both in null and experience. So what are your -- I'm sorry, naives, what -- does that mean that you would consider doing one?  You said maybe 1 to 2 studies. Are we talking about maybe a combination naives and nulls? Or would you actually potentially split it up to a naive and a null study separately? And then if you don't mind, just secondly, just on genotype 2\/3, I mean, congrats, I mean, it looks like the U.S. sites are going to enroll the patients. Would you consider doing a study for the rest of the world and for genotype 2\/3 as well? Or is that going to be sufficient for global registration?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Yaron, so 3 comments, 3 answers to your questions. So first of all, I would like to remind you again. I know you know this, but the RVR data is necessary but not sufficient. I want to remind you, in the ELECTRON genotype 2\/3, they had 100% RVR rates with 7977 by itself but only 60% SVR rate. So we really have to wait for the SVR data, that's the meaningful thing. Then the other thing, we're just thinking about -- I mean, that this is all a dialogue internally. We get to a study in naive patients, in Phase III and genotype 1 and another study in previous treatment failures or rebound, also nonresponders, that will be kind of the treatment-na\u00efve and treatment-experienced. And then the other question, yes, absolutely, we are acutely aware of the fact that we have to do studies in other geographies. It's just the fact that these studies are going to enroll very, very quickly and they will be enrolled way before we have the first site up and running. But what we are thinking about is doing, for instance, there's another special population studies that we're going to do in parallel and those are, for instance, transplant, HIV co-infection [indiscernible] telaprevir failures, those are just 4 samples. And those we would look to focus more on outside the United States to give people, particularly in Europe, experience with the drug and some comfort to use it so that they are comfortable once it gets approved.","John F. Milligan","We don't need it for registration.","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Yes, but it's not needed for registration, so we can absolutely register the drug in the U.S. and probably also in Europe. We still have to have that conversation with European regulatory agencies with the U.S. studies.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sapna Srivastava with Goldman Sachs.","Sapna Srivastava - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I have at least 2 quick questions. One is do you have any end-of-treatment data or SVR12 individual data for patients that we may expect at CROI? Are we going to see it all together? And the second question is just what do you do with the rest of your HCV portfolio? If 7977 stayed out early, it does live up to the potential at maturity.","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Sapna, so the end-of-treatment data, we have now and they were included at the abstract, so these are the SVR, the RVR data. But we don't have any SVR data yet. And those will be presented at CROI and it will SVR4s. That's all we're going to have. But as I said in my script, SVR4s are a reasonable proxy for SVR12 because they have been at least qualitatively very predictive. And secondly, what are we going to do with the rest of our HCV portfolio? Well, 7977 and ribavirin is not going to be our last drug that we're going to get approved in hepatitis C, but we're really aiming for a pan-genotypic single-tablet all once-daily regimen. And that, I think, is much closer than we thought a year ago. And we have all the compounds internally in place so we can pursue that. The first one will obviously be 5885 or 7977. That will probably be genotype 1 specific, but we have other things coming behind it that has pan-genotypic potential.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with Wells Fargo Securities.","Brian Abrahams - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Another question on 7977 along those same lines. A kind of a commercial question, what's your sense as to the SVR rate relative to the current standard of care that you think would support a go-forward path for 7977 plus riba in the broadest genotype 1 population? And if you did opt to conduct a pivotal study with 7977 plus 5885 in this broader population, what would be some of the rate-limiting steps to getting to the point of running a pivotal study? And how far behind would that be versus the genotype 2\/3 program?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Yes, Brian, I would like to -- Kevin wants to chime in, please do. So Brian, you said, what is the -- what kind of SVR rates do we need to consider a broad genotype 1 development programs. I want to remind you, there a lot of people that are interferon-ineligible\/intolerant. And so even with a not optimal SVR rate, this would absolutely be a very successful product because -- let's just pick something, 30% SVRs. If there is no downside, you try it for 3 months, and afterwards, you may have a 30% chance of being cured. That's a huge step forward from where we are today. So that's how we're thinking about it. And the other question you had, can't remember now.","Robin L. Washington","It is what kind of combo studies.","Norbert W. Bischofberger","What's the rate in these steps, so we are currently pursuing a drug interaction study 7977, 5885 that will then be followed by a fairly small Phase II study to simply show that you can use together, the 2 together that you get reasonable SVR rates. And that will then lead to a Phase III study, and it's probably about 6 months to 8 months behind 7977 by itself.","Kevin B. Young","I wouldn't have much, Brian. We're very close now to CROI, so in a little over a month, we're going to see that data. So I think that's going to be very informative. So I wouldn't really add much to Norbert's comments.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess some expense questions. So you talked about SG&A being up in 2012. Maybe you can give us a little sense of what's behind that. Is HCV the key driver? Or maybe what programs or an education might you be adding ahead of going into hep C? And then second, maybe a little bit more color on the R&D spend.","Robin L. Washington","Sure. Robyn, it's Robin. On the SG&A side, there was a small uptick -- and I'll let Kevin go in a little bit more detail as we prepare for the Quad. But the biggest impact on SG&A is the excise tax. So in 2012, we guided to about $50 million and that's pretty much where it came in. But going forward in -- I'm sorry, for 2011. But in 2012, we expect it to be in the range of $80 million to $100 million and that's really driven by about 3 factors. One is just our overall growth as -- or our overall revenue growth in the government sector. Also, the denominator in the calculation is getting smaller, a result of a decline in the overall pool of pharmaceutical sales used in the calculation as more products go generic. And then the overall fee is increasing. So Gilead is getting a bigger component of that tax. It's a fairly significant increase. So that's one of the primary drivers, but I'll turn it over to Kevin to talk about the Quad investment that we're making.","Kevin B. Young","Yes, Robyn, it really isn't HCV. HCV is mostly in 2012 around market assessment and building our launch plans. We are increasing our investments in HIV for the U.S. for the Quad. Again, that will be very efficient. We do have a plan, I think, for a high impact launch and we're certainly not going to leave anything on the table when it comes to the launch of the Quad. I should also add that we're very carefully establishing our Asian organization. We hope by the middle of 2012 that we'll have the pricing approval for Viread for HPV in Korea. And Korea is a very substantial market for hepatitis B. Entecavir is actually the biggest product of any pharmaceutical in the Korean market and we'd like to be successful there. So we're being selective and we're being very focused, but we think they're good investments to make around the world.","Robin L. Washington","And Robyn, relative to the color around the R&D expense, as I mentioned earlier, Pharmasset is a component of it. We've pretty much taken their budget. The investment in oncology and inflammation is also increasing. And as also mentioned, it's really a function of more Phase II and III as we continue to progress our overall pipeline that's driving the increased R&D expense.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with Piper Jaffray.","M. Ian Somaiya - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","So it's really [ph] my slide, you have -- Slide 7, which gives us timelines for the HIV products, I was hoping you could maybe take a shot, Norbert, at the -- on the hepatitis C side. I think you have given us some framework for the genotype 2\/3. Can you just comment further on genotype 1 beyond the ribavirin combo and also the 5855 (sic) E?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Yes, Ian, certainly. I'm actually just looking at Slide 7 I don't think I've ever -- so more -- you want more color on which one?","Robin L. Washington","On HCV type.","Norbert W. Bischofberger","So genotype 2\/3, Ian, as we said, it's kind of on its merry way, so the first study is enrolling. And as I said, I think, in my conference call, the study was started on December 19 and really not much happened in December because of the holidays. But nevertheless, we screened, as of this morning, 145 patients. That's pretty remarkable. And that's the less attractive study of the 2. We're actually intentionally waiting with the second study so the first gets a little bit underway. So the study will enroll very quickly. It's a 6-month total study duration, 3 months frequent, 3-month follow-up. We will be able to assemble and analyze the data fairly quickly and then submit it to the FDA. And then you can kind of do the math. It's going to be a very accelerated timeframe. And genotype 1, if we get -- if the data look good, we will initiate that, at the same time, the second genotype 2\/3 study gets up and rolling. And genotype 1 will be even faster because there are more patients around. So I think it's just going to be a very rapid development.","M. Ian Somaiya - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","And the 5855 (sic) E combo?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","So we are doing a drug interaction. We'll do a Phase II, a small Phase II study, similar to what a 12-week 7977, 5885 plus, minus ribavirin, something of that sort. And once we have SVR4 data, I would feel comfortable making a decision to go to Phase III with SVR12 data emerging during that process. So we were thinking it would be maybe 6 to 8 months behind the 797 (sic)  ribavirin program.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Porges with Sanford Bernstein.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","A couple of quick questions. One, Norbert, you mentioned the 7977 monotherapy arm and the fact that there was 4 patients who relapsed in that arm at 4 weeks. Could you tell us now that you've got 12-week follow-up, how that looked? And then just, Robin, could you give us a sense of where we should be thinking about share count going by the end of the year given all the sort of capital use that you have during the year?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Yes, Geoff, so the ELECTRON, the arm with 7977 by itself, still looks the same. This is not data we have disclosed, but that's one reason why we feel SVR4 is a pretty good proxy for SVR12.","Robin L. Washington","And, Geoff, relative to your share count, as we talked about with the acquisition, we did moderate and pretty much suspend our share repurchases after October of 2011. We will do moderate share repurchases in the near term to offset option dilution primarily, but our real focus of cash in the near term is going to be on debt repayment, which we expect to be back in our target. That's at the top by mid-2013. So to your question on share count, we don't expect it necessarily to go down significantly. We were just going to try to manage the current balance as much as we can.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Wei with Jefferies.","Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I had a question on 7977 and HPV. So I guess especially now that you've seen 100% RVR rates in genotype 1, we've seen some of what Pharmasset's valuation assumptions were in their regulatory filings. What perspective can you share with us or what details are you willing to disclose on the ways in which your own valuation assumptions were similar or different from Pharmasset's?","John F. Milligan","I guess it's a combined question in there, Thomas. It's John Milligan. So a couple things. Changing a valuation at this point in time wouldn't be prudent because, of course, we don't want to know what the SVR rates are for genotype 1 or null responders. And also, I think the only thing I could say with regard to our valuation process that it was very different than the Pharmasset valuation in terms of how they saw the patient flows and the time of the patients. So we think it will be a longer timeframe to capture patients than Pharmasset had suggested in their disclosure. Also, I would say that we think there's a lot of patients that can be captured both in the United States, Europe and other territories, which could provide for very long and sustained revenue and cash flow stream for Gilead, but we haven't put out anything more than that. So that's as much as I can say.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Russo with Robert W. Baird.","Thomas J. Russo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I just had a really quick follow-up. Can you give us a little bit more color on what you have coming down the pike that's pan-genotypic","[Audio Gap] ","in addition to 7977 and also plans down the road for any combinations with those agents?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Yes, Tom, we have not disclosed this in any way, but we have a number of backup nucleosides that we, Gilead, has been working on. And of course Pharmasset had a number of other nucleosides that are further back. None of this is clinical yet so it's still preclinical, but that's what we're looking at.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","You've talked a lot about different combination and a lot of different studies on 547 and 48. I guess I was wondering, when you think about long-term maybe even for 7977's launch, have you thought about studies with shorter duration regimens or ribavirin-sparing regimens?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Yes. So Mike, absolutely. We have not only thought about it, but some of these cohorts are already ongoing to look at even shorter duration than 12 weeks to see what the response rates are there and to also look at other combination. I want to remind you, we have 2 important studies ongoing, one with BMS in combination with their NS5A inhibitor with or without ribavirin and one with Tibotec with TMC435. Both of those look at combinations of 7977 with other agents and we'll provide important information about how to use the drug ultimately. And by the way, both of those studies, the BMS study, as you can see. It also explores ribavirin-sparing because the arms, are 7977 plus the BMS NS5A, plus or minus ribavirin, so it has both 2 drugs and 3 drugs. And that's what you...","Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Can you comment when you think we could see data from that?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","No, really not because that study is conducted by BMS and they have control over the data assembly and release.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ravi Mehrotra - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A question for Kevin. Kevin, could you give us any color on the proportion of treatment naive patients versus treated patients for Complera and how that's changed over these very early phase of launch? And a second part to that question, you cited the protease inhibitor -- I'm sorry, the PI study is due, the 420 patients that you too reported on Q2, how quickly can you get that into label?","Kevin B. Young","Yes, so we can give you a little bit. And obviously, it's only 4 months of data. So it's really very, very early for Complera. If you break down where the patients are coming from for Complera, about 30% are na\u00efve and about 70% are switch. And of the switch, about 1\/3 were switches from ATRIPLA and 2\/3 were switches from other regimens. And I think you can see that's sort of gone out a little bit in the slide I referred to earlier, which is the very nice early snapshot of Q4 because you can see that actually Truvada has dropped down a little where you see Complera coming in. But obviously, when you total, both ATRIPLA and Complera, you get up to that 59%. So a little bit of a tradeoff was obviously being Truvada plus something else, but we're okay with that because we won't have patients onto the single-tablet regimens. In terms of the inclusion of the data, Norbert, how long would it be typically for us to look for some sort of label change if we submitted data?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Yes, the study is fully enrolled. I don't have the last patient's last visit here. But normally, internally, we look at 3 to 6 months to collect, analyze, write up the data, submit them and this will probably be a 6-month review efficacy supplement. So you're looking at maybe a year after completion of the 48-week end-point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen & Company.","Philip Nadeau - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Norbert, back to you. I was just wondering if you could put a finer point on a couple things you said. So first, on the FISSION trial, it sounds like in a month, you've enrolled maybe a little bit less than 1\/3 of that study. If I assume that, that enrollment is going to actually increase with time, that means that trial can actually be enrolled by the end of this quarter. It's 36-week study. So is it reasonable to expect data from that possibly year end this year or very early in 2013?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Well, so if you were -- calculation is correct, then yes, it's reasonable to expect that. The other -- I just want to point out 2 things. Actually, we haven't enrolled 145, we screened 145. There will be a certain screen failure rate, although we don't expect that to be high. The other thing is, also, there aren't a lot of the sites up and running yet. We were thinking about having a large number of sites. With only 19 sites open, in this short period of time, we have 145 screened. So enrollment will be very quick. I do not really want to predict how quick, but assume they're out. 6 months afterwards -- 9 months afterwards is the end of this study. Remember the control arm is peg\/riba 24 weeks, so it's a 9-month observation period. And after that, yes, you could submit certainly an abstract to a meeting.","Philip Nadeau - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then second, on your comments on starting the genotype 1 trial in the answers to 2 separate questions. At one point, you said even like a 30% SVR would be perhaps meaningful for patients. And then in the answer to another question, you said if the data looked good, we're going to start a genotype 1 study kind of at the same time as positron [ph]. Can we take from that basically if there's any SVRs that come out of electronic QUANTUM and genotype 1 patients, the genotype 1 study is going to start? It sounds like the bar to starting that genotype 1 trial is actually quite low. Is that fair?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Well, at one point, of course, if you get to very low numbers, you kind of you know then we wouldn't be doing it because we don't need to go there. We have 5885 and 7977 that's about 6 months afterwards. And that if 7977 and ribavirin is not enough in genotype 1 by itself, then adding 5885 would certainly greatly increase those response rates. And we then just have to gauge what is the loss and time and the risk and the expenses associated with it.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Could give us some idea what the bar is? Is it 30%, 50%, 80%? Like, what would be the go, no-go point in your mind?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","We really don't see it that way that we say, below 30%, we don't do it; above 30%, we do; with 50%, we do. We have to really look at the totality of the data. Another thing, of course, is also we would have to look at resistance. Those that don't respond, the rebounders or null responders, if there are any, well, there aren't any right now, but if there were, those people develop resistance. And if the answer is no, then you could say there was really no downside to treating somebody. The only downside practically is cost. It's safe, well-tolerated. It's only for 3 months, that overall, it's convenient. And you know why? If you win 30% response rate, that seems to be why wouldn't patient accept that as a reasonable alternative to what's currently available.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Brian Skorney with Brean Murray.","Brian Skorney - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","Just real quick couple of questions. First one, on Slide 45, on the ELECTRON cohorts, you have all of the cohorts listed as having in end of '10, but on the last Pharmasset slide set in Dr. Dean's [ph] ELECTRON presentation, there were 25 patients supposed to be enrolled in the treatment-na\u00efve cohort and the 2\/3 experienced cohort. Has this protocol changed?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","No. Actually, Brian, that -- until seeing the slide right now, that is not correct. There were 2 -- those 2 cohorts at 25 patients target enrollment. That's...","Robin L. Washington","Yes, Brian, that's actually a really good catch, we missed that.","Brian Skorney - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then the second question is, just moving on to the Quad, I wonder if you guys have any thoughts on the AdCom. I mean, it just seems that the FDA has less frequently used advisory committees or there wasn't really controversy around whether or not to approve. I just wonder, have the FDA communicated any rationale for why they're going to have an AdCom for the Quad specifically?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Yes, absolutely, Brian. We actually had a conversation with them when they informed us of their intent to do an AdCom. We said why do we need one? And they referred us to a guidance document that's available on the FDA website. And they clearly said FDA advisory committee meetings can be convened or should be convened if it's a first-in-class molecule. And the FDA felt fairly strongly that cobicistat, in particular, was something that's first-in-class, one-of-its-kind and that's why they wanted to do it. But they also communicated to us that there's no safety or efficacy concern with the Quad that will make them feel like they need an advisory committee. So it's more of a policy thing that has to do with first-in-class, one-of-its-kind molecules in cobicistat that is the one that's in the Quad.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Birchenough with BMO Capital Markets.","Jim Birchenough - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","A couple of maintenance questions. Just on the R&D spend. It seems like we get a spike every fourth quarter at least for the last couple of years. Can you remind us why that is? And should we expect the same distribution in 2012? And then just on the Quad as it's part of your guidance, are you assuming a similar launch trajectory as what we've seen for Complera? And would something better than that be upside the guidance? Or I'm just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about Quad out of the gate compared to what we've seen from Complera.","Kevin B. Young","Jim, it's Kevin. I'll take the second part first in terms of the kind of possible uptake of Quad. Just a step back, if you think about Complera, now Complera was never going to be ATRIPLA. There are just really no existing patients who has newer conversion market like we had with ATRIPLA. ATRIPLA had 80,000 patients on the components when we came out the gates. And obviously, that gave it an incredible ramp-up. We never have that -- never said we would have that with Complera. So in some ways, Complera is almost like a third agent launch. And that's why on Slide 35 I referred to our volume being above Prezista as a sort of a third agent comparator, which we're pretty pleased with. I think at this stage, I would probably peg the launch of the Quad somewhere between an ATRIPLA and a Complera. As I said earlier, there's a high expectation for Quad, very high knowledge of it and a very strong investigative base. So we believe that there is a high expectation. And I think we believe that we would get to preferred listing, a preferred ranking for Quad based on 102 and 103 data. We never expected to be a preferred regimen in treatment guidelines with Complera, but we are hopeful that that would happen fairly quickly with Quad. And obviously, that's a big market driver.","Robin L. Washington","And, Jim, to the first part of your question, the spikes that you referred to are really just driven by a milestone payments or in the case of 2011 was primarily related to some of the M&A and the collaboration activity that we did in Q4 to the tune of $60 million, is what I called out in our script. And that included the Boehringer Ingelheim agreement as well as Global Immune (sic) [GlobeImmune] and then the other piece related to the timing of the Quad filing. So again, that's what the driver was. Those aren't always predictable when you think about 2012. And the way we plan it is it's pretty much straight line, but those milestones can occur from time to time.","Operator","Our next question is our final question coming from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just to follow-up to Brian's question, I just want to be really clear. So 25 patients in the ELECTRON cohorts, but 10 -- you reported today RVR data on 10 of them. Is that correct? Or yes or no? And then just to make sure we're all clear. And then will you have data on all 25 patients at CROI, some kind of data for all 25 patients, perhaps RVR data for the ones that you don't have SVR data for?","Norbert W. Bischofberger","Yes, so Mark, to be clear, the abstract was submitted with all available RVR data, which comes from both cohorts the treatment-na\u00efve and null responders from ELECTRON. But at the time of the CROI presentation, we will only have SVR4 data on the null responders. That's the total of 10. There won't be any other SVR data, which is those patients are still just aren't as long -- as far along at that point in time. So that's what we're going to have.","Operator","Ms. Hubbard, at this point, we have run out of time for additional questions.","Susan Hubbard","Great.

Please go ahead.","Douglas Maffei","Thank you, Liz, and good afternoon, everyone.","Just after market closed today, we issued a press release with earnings results for fourth quarter and full year 2019. The press release and detailed slides are available on the Investor Relations website.","Speakers on today's call will be Daniel O'Day, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Andrew Dickinson, Chief Financial Officer; Johanna Mercier, Chief Commercial Officer; and Merdad Parsey, Chief Medical Officer. Also in the room are Christi Shaw, Chief Executive Officer of Kite; and Diana Brainard, Senior Vice President and Head of our HIV and Emerging Viruses Therapeutic Area.","Before we begin with our prepared comments, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, financial projections, and the use of capital and 2020 financial guidance, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements.

And Merdad Parsey, whom as you know, joined us as Chief Medical Officer in November, will offer a few remarks before we open up the call to questions.","We had a very strong quarter capping a solid year for Gilead. Our financial results in 2019 were driven in large part by the outstanding performance of our HIV franchise.","It's now been almost a year since I arrived at Gilead. We made key decisions and changes that have positioned us for success. Over the past decade, the Company has set a high bar, and we hope to raise that high bar over the decades to come.","Today, I'm going to focus my comments on three areas. One, our strong base business; two, the existing pipeline opportunities; and three, our new strategy to drive innovation and growth.","So, I'll begin by saying a few words about the strengths of our core business, starting with HIV where we again achieved record revenue for both the quarter and the year. Today, approximately 80% of people living with HIV, who are on therapy in the U.S. are on a Gilead-based regimen. Across the franchise, we've seen durability and sustainability of the business, which we expect to continue in 2020 and beyond. Much of the strength is being driven by Biktarvy. Today, in the U.S., approximately one in two patients who are new to therapy and patients who are switching therapy are initiating on Biktarvy. We're also very pleased with the early progress with Descovy for PrEP, the strength of the launch and the positive response we are seeing from patients and providers. Johanna will share more details shortly on that.","Looking to the future, we're focused on the potential of our capsid inhibitor as the anchor molecule for multiple long-acting HIV options. We may be able to dose as infrequently as twice a year, and we're working rapidly to progress this medicine for both HIV prevention and treatment. Rounding out the antiviral picture, we continue to see sustained revenue from our HCV business. Since the introduction of authorized generics in the U.S., we've regained market share and now hold around 60% share through Asegua and Gilead up 18 points from the beginning of last year.","Finally, as we look across our core business, I'd like to highlight the geographic expansion, and in particular China. During the fourth quarter, we had four medicines Vemlidy, Epclusa, Harvoni and Genvoya included in China's national reimbursement drug list. This is a significant accomplishment that will enable much broader access to these medicines in the region.","So, beyond our core business, our current pipeline concludes several important opportunities that I'd like to cover. We have 14 late-stage studies underway, four of which have received breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA. During the fourth quarter, we submitted a regulatory filing for filgotinib to the FDA and it's now under priority review for rheumatoid arthritis. Filgotinib is also under review in Japan and the EU. We're actively preparing for competitive launches globally, which Johanna will talk more about later. I'm encouraged about the potential of filgotinib to be best in class among the JAK inhibitors, and the strength of the gene we have in place to market the medicine following approval.","Beyond filgotinib, we are pleased with what we see in the Galapagos pipeline and believe that the partnership has the potential to drive significant future growth.","We are looking forward to the ulcerative colitis data this year, and we remain very optimistic about both our partnership with Galapagos as well as the promising inflammation pipeline we have in hand.","In cell therapy, we have a pioneering platform that is enabling us to advance new therapies with the goal of driving long-term innovation and growth. To that end, our second cell therapy treatment KTE-X19 is now under review in the U.S. and Europe as a treatment for relapsed\/refractory mantle cell lymphoma. This followed the presentation of positive data at the American Society of Hematology meeting in the fourth quarter of this year.","We also presented data at ASH showing the approximately half of patients treated with Yescarta for relapsed\/refractory large B-cell lymphoma were still alive after three years of treatment in the ZUMA-1 study, confirming Yescarta\u2019s benefit risk profile in the real world setting. These long-term data speak to the durability of the Yescarta's treatment.","Finally, in cell therapy, we look forward to sharing results from our Yescarta Phase 3 second line DLBCL trial in the second half of this year. Merdad will offer some more color on our pipeline in just a few minutes.","In addition to the programs I described that we have in hand, I introduced our new corporate strategy last month. This strategy will guide our work as we seek to drive innovation and growth over the next decade.","Over the next 10 years, we aim to introduce 10 new transformative therapies. To help us achieve that ambition we will expand our access to internal and external innovation. We've already been very active in business development with around 33 strategic partnerships and investment transaction since January 2018. We'll continue to pursue a broad range of opportunities with a clear focus on our core scientific areas of strength. Specifically, we will continue to make investments in our external pipeline including transformative partnerships such as Galapagos and small to medium-sized bolts-on acquisitions.","Andy will talk more in a few minutes about our capital allocation priorities, including today's announcement of a further increase in our dividend and an additional share repurchase authorization and our strong financial position, which gives us the opportunity to look externally as we strengthen our pipeline.","Before I hand off to Andy who we'll delve into a more detailed financial review, I'd like to say just a few words about the broadening outbreak of coronavirus. As an organization, Gilead has committed to collaborating with global health organizations to support pandemic responses, including this one. Our investigational compound, Remdesivir, has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity in animal models against the viral pathogens, MERS and SARS, which are structurally similar to the current strain of the coronavirus. However, there are no antiviral data that show activity against the strain. We're working with the government and non-government organizations and regulatory authorities to develop a strategy to provide Remdesivir to patients with coronavirus for emergency treatment in the absence of any approved treatment options and to support clinical trials to determine whether it can safely and effectively be used to treat the current strain of the coronavirus.","As a reminder, Remdesivir is an investigational agent. It is not approved anywhere globally and has not been demonstrated to be safe or effective for any use. I'm proud of our teams and the work we've done to offer expertise and resources to help patients and communities fighting coronavirus.","In closing, I'm very optimistic about where we are today and the future. Our base business is strong, durable and growing. As demonstrated by our fourth quarter numbers and year-end results that near-term pipeline provides several important opportunities with readouts expected later this year with filgotinib and Yescarta. And over the long term, we've introduced a new strategy to drive growth by growing our pipeline internally and importantly also externally through our ongoing BD activities.","On behalf of leadership team, I'd like to thank all of our employees and partners around the world for their dedication and hard work that led to the success of 2019, and whose commitment is driving our success in 2020 and beyond. I remain excited about the potential of Gilead as we enter the next chapter.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Andy.","Andrew Dickinson","Thank you, Dan.","I'm excited to take on the role of CFO, especially during this time as Gilead enters a new chapter. We're pleased to share our financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year 2019 and provide 2020 guidance today. I'll first review financials followed by comments from Johanna.","Turning to our financials. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $5.9 billion with non-GAAP earnings of $1.30 per diluted share. This compares to revenue of $5.8 billion with non-GAAP earnings of $1.44 per diluted share for the same period last year. Our non-GAAP earnings would have been $1.77 and $1.75 in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2018, respectively, excluding unfavorable cost of goods sold impacts. These impacts were primarily driven by inventory write-downs of $500 million and $410 million, respectively for slow-moving and excess raw material and work in process inventory largely due to lower long-term demand for our HCV products.","For the full year 2019, total revenues were $22.4 billion, up 1% year-over-year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings were $6.63 per share for the year, down from $6.67 per share for the full year of 2018. Excluding the unfavorable cost of goods impacts I mentioned previously, our non-GAAP earnings would have been $7.14 per share for 2019 and $7.01 per share for the prior year.","As noted in our earnings press release, our full year 2019 GAAP diluted earnings of $4.22 per share included a total unfavorable impact of $3.30 per share from the following items. First, pre-tax upfront collaboration licensing expense of $3.9 billion associated with our global research and development collaboration agreement with Galapagos; secondly, pre-tax impairment charge of $800 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily related to in-process research and development intangible assets for the treatment of indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; and pre-tax write-downs of $547 million for slow-moving and excess raw materials and work in process inventory.","The unfavorable impact was partially offset by a favorable impact of $1.94 per share due to a deferred tax benefit of $1.2 billion related to an intra-entity transfer of intangible assets and gains of $1.2 billion from equity securities held for investments.","Now, turning to our product sales. Product sales for the fourth quarter were $5.8 billion, up 5% sequentially and 2% year-over-year. For the full year, product sales were $22.1 billion, up 2% year-over-year, primarily due to the continued revenue growth of our HIV franchise, partially offset by the impact of loss of exclusivity on our cardiopulmonary franchise and market dynamics of our HCV franchise. In the U.S., product sales for the quarter were $4.5 billion, up 8% sequentially and 1% year-over-year. Demand for Biktarvy and Descovy for PrEP was the primary driver of the sequential growth. The seasonal inventory purchases also contributed approximately $290 million to the sequential performance.","In Europe, product sales for the quarter were $840 million, up 4% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. Recall that both the third quarter of 2019 and the fourth quarter of 2018 were negatively impacted by unfavorable adjustments for statutory rebates.","Turning to cell therapy. Worldwide Yescarta sales for the fourth quarter were $122 million, up 3% sequentially and 51% year-over-year. The year-over-year increase was driven by a higher number of therapies provided to patients and Kite's continued expansion in Europe.","Now, turning to expenses for the full year 2019. Non-GAAP cost of goods sold was $3.5 billion, down 1% compared to $3.6 billion in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower royalty expenses, partially offset by higher inventory write-downs. During 2019 and 2018, we recorded write-downs of $547 million and $440 million, respectively for slow-moving and excess raw materials and work in process inventories, primarily due to lower long-term demand for our HCV products.","Non-GAAP R&D expense was $3.8 billion, up 7% compared to $3.5 billion in 2018. The increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs to support cell therapy business. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $4.1 billion, up 13% compared to $3.6 billion in 2018. The increase was primarily due to higher promotional expenses related to Biktarvy and Descovy for PrEP in the U.S. and expenses associated with the expansion of our business in Japan and China.","Turning to our balance sheet. We generated $9.1 billion in cash from operations for the full year of 2019 and $2.6 billion for the quarter. We ended the year with $25.8 billion in cash and marketable debt securities. During 2019, we paid $5.6 billion in connection with our global research and development collaboration with Galapagos and our equity investments in Galapagos. In addition, we repaid $2.8 billion of debt. We paid cash dividends of $3.2 billion and we repurchased 26 million shares of stock for $1.7 billion.","Earlier today, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividends from $0.63 a share to $0.68 per share, which will be effective in the first quarter of 2020 . This is our fifth consecutive annual increase in our dividends.","In addition, our Board authorized an additional $5 billion share repurchase program in January 2020. We now have over $8 billion of share repurchase authorization available.","In 2020, our capital allocation priorities will remain unchanged. First and foremost, we will focus on investment to augment internal and external research and development, our internal research and external development pipeline. Second, we intend to grow the dividend over time, pointing out of course that any dividend is increased is subject to the approval of our Board. Finally, our commitment to repurchase share in excess of dilution from our equity compensation and at a minimum we expect to repurchase shares in 2020 on par with our 2019 share repurchases.","Turning to guidance. Our 2020 non-GAAP financial guidance is summarized on slides 23 to 26 in the earnings presentation available on our corporate website. Before I start, I'd like to highlight three things that are important for you to understand. The first change is that beginning in the first quarter, we will no longer regularly exclude stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP financial information. Stock-based compensation has always been an important part of how we reward our employees in a way that aligns their interests with those of our shareholders, and it's an important component of our compensation structure. As such, although it's not a cash expense, we believe it to be a cost that should be included when measuring our financial performance.","For comparability purposes, full year 2019 non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share would have been $10.4 billion and $6.13 per share, respectively, had stock-based compensation expense not been excluded.","Our second change is that we're modifying our guidance metrics for 2020 as we will now be providing guidance for earnings and operating income. In addition to the metrics that we've historically shared. Our guidance is aligned with how the management team and our Board evaluate our financial performance and manage our operations.","Finally, our guidance excludes the impact of any future significant business development transactions, certain development milestones, and any product option exercise fees that they're contingent on various future events, which have a high degree of uncertainty. With that background, we expect that our product sales for 2020 will be in the range of $21.8 billion to $22.2 billion. This guidance reflects robust underlying growth in our base business of approximately $800 million to $1 billion, which is expected to offset the full year impact of the loss of exclusivity for our cardiopulmonary products in 2019 and the initial entry of the generic version of Truvada in the U.S later this year.","I would also like to highlight that as we look towards Q1 of 2020, we anticipate that total product sales will decline sequentially that quarter by a percentage similar to what we've seen over the past three years, which has been as high as 12% to 14%, primarily driven by U.S. seasonal inventory patterns and buying patterns of public payers that negatively impact our payer mix. We also anticipate that our Q1 2020 product sales will decline in comparison to Q1 2019, primarily due to lower sales of our cardiopulmonary products, Ranexa for Nexon and Letairis.","As a reminder, generic versions of our Ranexa and Letairis were launched in the first quarter and second quarter of 2019, respectively. Despite this anticipated sequential decline in total product sales in Q1, I want to underscore our confidence in the health of our worldwide HIV business from which we expect year-on-year growth again in 2020.","Turning to our product gross margins. Our non-GAAP product gross margins are expected to be in the range of 86% to 87% in 2020. We expect that both non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses will increase mid single digit percentage in support of our continued growth at Biktarvy, our Descovy for PrEP launch, preparation for competitive launches of filgotinib in RA in the U.S. Japan and Europe, and continued investments in our pipeline, cell therapy and external partnerships.","Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $10.1 billion to $10.8 billion. For the full year, our non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21%. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $6.05 per share to $6.45 per share, which again, I'll remind you, no longer excludes stock-based compensation. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $5.15 to $5.55. Finally, our diluted EPS guidance includes repurchases, largely consistent with 2019.","I'll now turn the call over to Johanna.","Johanna Mercier","Thank you, Andy. And good afternoon everyone.","I'm really pleased to share the highlights of our excellent Q4 and full year commercial performance. I wanted to begin with a continued strength of our HIV franchise, which was driven by the continued uptake of Biktarvy as well as the successful early launch of Descovy for PrEP. I'll then provide an update on HCV, touch briefly on our cardiopulmonary business and finally close with a few remarks as we look ahead to the filgotinib launch.","As Dan mentioned, approximately 80% of people living with HIV who are on therapy in the U.S. are taking at least one Gilead drug as sign of a sustained and durable strength we see across the franchise. We reached another all-time high with our HIV product sales for both the full year and quarter. For 2019 HIV sales were $16.4 billion, up 12% from 2018. Global HIV sales for Q4 were $4.6 billion, up 9% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth for the franchise. U.S. HIV product sales were $3.8 billion in Q4, up 11% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by underlying prescription demand growth of 10%.","Within our prevention market, we're really pleased with the early progress of Descovy for PrEP, which launched in the U.S. in Q4 2019. Approximately 27% of individuals on PrEP are now taking Descovy, and by Q4 2020, we expect that number will have risen to anywhere between 40% and 45%.","Across the prevention market, we saw a growth of more than 20% in the number of individuals taking PrEP year-over-year. There are now more than 230,000 people taking one of our HIV prevention medicines in the U.S., and this only represents approximately 20% of those who could actually benefit from it.","Turning to the U.S. HIV treatment market, Biktarvy sales were $1.4 billion in Q4, up 23% sequentially. The market is continuing to consolidate around Biktarvy, which is the number one prescribed HIV regimen in the U.S. and as Dan noted, approximately one in two of every na\u00efve and switch patients are now initiated on Biktarvy.","In Europe, Q4 HIV product sale were $562 million, up 1% sequentially and 10% year-over-year. The year-over-year growth was driven by the continued strength of our Biktarvy launches in Europe, declining impact of generic launches and unfavorable non-recurring pricing adjustments in Q4 of the prior year. Biktarvy is now available in 29 countries in Europe and it's number one in na\u00efve and switch in Germany, France, Spain, and now Italy as well.","Turning to our HCV business. Q4 HCV sales were $630 million, down 7% sequentially and 15% year-over-year. 2019 sales were $2.9 billion for the full year, down 20%, primarily due to lower average net selling price and declining patient starts.","U.S. revenues for Q4 were $337 million, down 11% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. In the U.S., we now have approximately 60% market share with our Gilead branded and authorized generic partner products and are continuing to sustain revenue.","In Europe HCV product sales for Q4 were $151 million, up 36% sequentially and down 20% year-over-year. The sequential performance was impacted by the seasonality of product sales.","Overall, the HCV market continued to see a more predictable decline in patient starts and performed in line with our expectations.","Before turning to filgotinib, I just wanted to make a few comments on the cardiopulmonary business where we have seen generic competition enter the market early last year. As anticipated, significant volume erosion has occurred. And as of last December, we have seen 90% erosion of Ranexa and 65% erosion of Letairis, a trend that we expect to continue into this year.","So, in closing, I'm really excited to share with you a few words about the filgotinib launch. As Dan noted, our teams have now completed regulatory filings for rheumatoid arthritis in the U.S. where filgotinib is under priority review, as well as in Europe and Japan. In December, we announced a co-promotion agreement in Japan with Eisai. It's estimated that approximately 600,000 to 1 million people in Japan are living with RA, and this agreement allows us to draw on the strengths of both companies with the goal of bringing this important new medicine to those individuals.","As you're aware, despite currently available treatment options, many patients are still living with symptoms of inadequately controlled RA around the world. In fact, only one out of five patients living with RA achieve complete remission at year one, which means four to five do not. Filgotinib has a compelling and differentiated clinical profile that we believe may uniquely address the significant unmet need for patients with RA. We have highly experienced teams preparing for the launch later this year and our focus will be on the strength of our data and the compelling risk benefit profile which serves across both tested doses of this oral medicine.","I look forward to working with this great team of people to deliver on the promise of these medicines. And I'll now turn the call over to Merdad.","Merdad Parsey","Thank you, Johanna, and good afternoon, everyone.","It's been a pleasure to meet some of you over the past few weeks. I'm pleased to participate in the first earnings call at Gilead today. I'm excited to join a team to extend the Gilead story and improve the lives of patients around the world. As we implement our new corporate strategy, I'm confident we can leverage our existing pipeline and to expand with internal and external approaches.","Building on Gilead's impressive innovation in HIV, including the launch of 11 products in 17 years, our goal is to continue to transform the lives of people affected by HIV. Our next wave of HIV innovation will be driven by long-acting options for treatment and prevention. We listen to what patients want and we're committed to continuing to pursue and provide more options that meet the needs of people affected by HIV.","We believe our capsid inhibitor has the potential for a truly unique profile, offering both oral and subcutaneous dosing, the potential for self administration as well as multiple dosing frequencies and options for HIV treatment and prevention. We recently presented data from two Phase 1 studies, demonstrating potent antiviral activity and the potential dosing in role of up to every six months. We've initiated Phase 2 -- 3 studies including one of the -- one in heavily treatment experienced patients and we received breakthrough therapy designation for this use. The capsid inhibitor will be the foundation of our long-acting options and we're exploring multiple partner agents to pair with it.","As Dan said, we've set the ambitious goal of bringing 10 transformative medicines to patients over next decade. The first of these 10 transformative medicines will be filgotinib, which has a potential best-in-class profile. I've been impressed with the strength of the filgotinib data. And speaking with key opinion leaders, there's a real appreciation for the results and an excitement for the potential combination of efficacy and safety of this selective oral JAK 1 inhibitor.","Across the FINCH studies, we've seen consistently strong efficacy and demonstrated the safety profile that is highly favorable from a benefit-risk standpoint, and this is true at both doses tested. We've now filed filgotinib in three regions, the U.S., Europe and Japan, and as Johanna mentioned, we are gearing up for the launch.","Filgotinib has the potential for five new indication launches in the next four years, and we look forward to the upcoming ulcerative colitis data this year. This timing could get filgotinib one of the first labels in ulcerative colitis for a JAK inhibitor. We've also had -- I've also had the opportunity to meet the Galapagos team and discuss opportunities that are being pursued beyond filgotinib. This remarkable partnership has a potential to double our research footprint and has a number of programs that could add to our inflammation portfolio.","Turning to oncology, we have a broad portfolio today including Kite and have a total of 15 clinical stage programs. Our approach is to build transformative therapies across complementary immuno-oncology platforms including both cell therapy and non-cell therapy. We're actively pursuing and evaluating innovative programs and technologies externally to build our presence in oncology.","In total, across our current pipeline, we have 40 clinical stage programs. As Dan mentioned, of these programs, 14 are either being registered right now or in label enabling trials, and four of these programs have breakthrough therapy designation. As we pursue external opportunities, we'll continue to build around antiviral therapies, inflammation, fibrosis and immuno-oncology.","I'm excited to work with Dan and the entire Gilead team to expand on the great things that have been done to date and go further for people living with HIV and the patients we serve. This work internal and external will enable us to grow in the mid to long term. I look forward to sharing more with all of you about our progress in future calls.","Thank you very much. And now, we'll open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Yee with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Michael Yee","Hey, guys. Thanks for the question, and thanks for the color on the guidance. I guess, I just wanted to ask about your perspective on guidance for 2020, and thinking about both the revenue guidance, which is seemingly flat to downish versus \u201819 and EPS on backing out the stock option seems to be flattish to downish. Maybe you can just comment about your perspective of 2020, is that an investment year? Is there potential to be a growth year, both on revenue and EPS? And how do you think about it -- of 2020 versus, say, what you think about broadly speaking for \u201821? Thanks.","Daniel O'Day","Yes. Thanks a lot, Michael, for the question. And I would say, again, based upon the strong results coming off of 2019 that our base business, our HIV business is really robust and continues to grow. And of course we need to offset, as Andy mentioned in his comments, the full year effect of the cardiopulmonary franchise and just the beginning of the Truvada expiry. And we feel confident in our ability to be able to do that. Our guidance reflects the revenue that is essentially flat year-on-year, and of course, we'll keep you updated as we go throughout the year, based on a variety of events on the commercial side.","On the investment side, I would say, yes, absolutely, we feel that we need to invest on the commercial side to make sure that we are preparing ourselves well for the most recent launches that have gone out, and that's Biktarvy and Descovy but also well prepare ourselves for a very competitive launch for filgotinib, where you've heard us say, we really think we have a unique medicine with a best-in-class profile. And we want to make sure, as we know, there's only one chance to get a launch right. We want to make sure we're well prepared for that. Now, we have obviously looked hard at our expense base on a commercial side, reallocated resources from cardiopulmonary and are well-prepared to put our investments on the growth drivers. And as you can see in our qualitative guidance, feel we need to increase slightly from year-on-year for the SG&A guidance. Likewise, with the investments that we've made both in our internal pipeline, the expansion of life cycle programs around medicines like filgotinib and others that we need and including external innovation that we've brought in over the past two years, including 33 different collaborations and\/or acquisitions, we want to make sure, we invest appropriately in those to take them to the next decision point and decide about future investment accordingly. And we'll continue to work on that portfolio as we move forward. Andy, do you have some other things you want to add to that.","Andrew Dickinson","Yes. Thank you. And, Michael, thanks for the question. I would just add two things. Again, as many of you\u2019ve heard, our primary focus is on building a predictable, sustainable top-line growth profile that you would expect to see of companies like Gilead, so. And that at times requires investment. It has in the history of Gilead, as you go back to the Pharmasset acquisition and the investments that were made following that and it will going forward. So, that is our primary focus, as you know.","And then, I'd also add that we also felt that it was important to provide additional transparency and accuracy in measuring our financial performance. And that's why you're seeing additional guidance that helps give you a fuller picture of how we see the business for the coming year. And I think the guidance speaks for itself, and Dan's points were right on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Brian Abrahams","Thanks so much for taking my question. As you look across your mid stage portfolio and to new corporate strategy, I was wondering, if you could elaborate a little bit more on the areas of most interest to build out or to wind down. Where does Gilead's team stand today to most optimally take advantage of external opportunities? And how do you guys balance potential versus risk as you look at investing in assets both internally and externally? Thanks.","Daniel O'Day","Great. Thanks a lot, Brian. I'll start, and then I'll ask Merdad to comment on the portfolio because one of the big efforts that we have underway is with Merdad coming to the organization, his breadth of experience in building world-class portfolios. That's exactly what he's involved in right now, and really leveraging the strengths accordingly, across the portfolio. So, I'd say a couple of things, Brian.","I think, as you know, we've kind of elevated the full disclosure and openness on our portfolio. We started that at JP Morgan. You can expect us to continue to be very transparent about the portfolio, the decisions we take and we make. But, I think, just the very fact that we have 40 clinical stage programs, 14 of which are in registrational trials is something that I think may be underappreciated as we -- from the outside.","Now, you asked about, what are the things that are most interesting? I'm going to let Merdad give that as well. But I remind you that our strength in viral diseases will continue to be invested in and that's the discussion around capsid, and really, truly providing kind of next generation therapies that we think patients and customers, -- well, we know patients and customers are asking for out there.","Having said that, I think, the extension of our inflammatory disease portfolio with the Galapagos transaction is something that excites me. I think, there's lots of potential shots on goals there. There's ways to think about between Gilead and Galapagos, building combination approaches in the future. And I think, we've really got a strength in inflammatory diseases that is building. Fibrotic diseases is something that we have a depth of expertise in. And we understand the challenges associated with that disease state. And so, as Merdad builds the portfolio, I think he'll come in, we have to make sure that we're putting the right level of investment in there that makes sense for the big unmet medical need, but also the risk associated with some of the natures of those diseases.","And then, finally, there's been significant effort, long before Merdad or I joined on oncology. Of course, the Kite acquisition provides was the immediate step up and knowledge and knowhow and a breadth of portfolio there. But the non-Merdad portfolio is something that's really built up over the past couple of years, both internally and through our collaborative. We know it's early and we know that we're going to have to continue to pursue those programs and build on it. ","So, that's my two cents. And Merdad, you have a deeper and kind of a refresh view cause you've just entered not too long ago. So, it'd be good to hear your reaction.","Merdad Parsey","Yes. And I won't belabor what Dan said. I think, he hit on the main things, which is sort of making sure, the capsid molecule looks really interesting. And I think we're pretty excited about that one. And building a partner for that -- for both treatment and prevention is going to be an important goal of ours. And then, in inflammation, getting the filgo launch, right. And then, supplementing, filgo in our -- filgotinib in our pipeline is going to be an important task for us to focus on as well to build around the inflammation portfolio and to enable broader reach as we develop there.","And then, oncology. I think, that's an area where we are going to spend time building out, looking for opportunities, especially in immuno-oncology and working with our colleagues at Kite to make sure that we're finding the right balance and bringing the non-cell therapy portfolio upto complement the cell based therapy.","I think more qualitatively, maybe I'd say, I think what you're hearing is this idea about focus for us, making sure that we're really thoughtful about where we focus and where we build our expertise so that we can build a portfolio around those areas of focus as you've heard me and Dan lay out. And also that we find a balance to address your other question around risk, to find balance around how we approach the overall portfolio. So, that we have a mix in there, some high risk, high reward programs, balanced with some other programs that are less risky and have a more higher likelihood of success.","And so, we are going to approach the portfolio that way and broadly across the entire portfolio inclusive of oncology inflammation, fibrosis and HIV.","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Geoff Meacham","Johanna, I wanted to ask you a couple on HIV. So, the Descovy and PrEP targets, what gets you there to 40%, 45% and how are you dealing so far with generics to grab share. And then, when you look at the Biktarvy franchise, obviously pretty dominating share there. But what populations have you seen of late that are going to continue to add to the switch dynamic? I mean, I guess the question is how many of the switches that you've seen thus far in the U.S. are kind of laggards and maybe where they're coming from? Thank you very much. ","Johanna Mercier","So, maybe, I'll hit your Descovy question first and then go to Biktarvy. So, we exited the year about 27% with Descovy and what we're seeing is really nice uptake. But if you recall, there's a real fragmented market in the prevention market versus the treatment market. In the treatment market, you have 3,000, 4,000 prescribers. In the prevention market, it's much larger than that, like five, tenfold. And so therefore it's really -- how do we get there is making sure we focus on the higher volume, which is the same folks that actually are prescribing and prevention are also prescribing in the treatment -- HIV treatment world. And those are physicians that truly understand the benefits of going from a TDF agent to task with all the boat and renal safety that comes with it. And so, we've actually seen that share of that segment increase very rapidly.","We also have another big piece of the pie that is about 20%, 25% of the volume that are folks that have never prescribed an HIV treatment. And so, these are folks that we are visiting and obviously using different means of communication to make sure they're educated around the fact of the benefits for a tap agent like Descovy. And so, what we're seeing is that increase month-to-month, and we're very pleased with where we are today, after only three months of launch. Having said that, we believe that's going to continue with some challenges potentially on the payer side. And that's how we get to the 40%, 45%, towards the end of the year in light of the fact that Truvada is losing its patent later this year in October. And so, some payers are already planning ahead a little bit on that one. And so, we're working with them very closely to make sure that patients get the best, most appropriate compound for them. And so, I guess, we're -- we believe that that's where we're going to adapt about 40%, 45% of conversion by October of this year. So, that's the Descovy story.","From a Biktarvy standpoint, I think what you were saying, good quarter, and I think, I would say it's an excellent quarter for Biktarvy, if I do think of it myself. I'm very proud of the team on that front. And it's been obviously very active, very competitive in the market space as you well know. The Biktarvy is really being used for with the majority of patients, and that's really the profile of Biktarvy and what it brings to the table in light of the combination of convenience, tolerability, the high barrier to antiviral resistance. And so that kind of what Biktarvy has to offer. What I would say is, as you think about all the ending the epidemic initiatives, that's where the rapid start with Biktarvy is becoming a really increasingly point of differentiation and very important one for physicians. And I think that's really helping the Biktarvy growth as well as, as you move forward. So, the fact that, one out of two patients are actually starting on Biktarvy, whether that's a na\u00efve patient or a switch patient, that is really where you're seeing how the market is consolidating around Biktarvy. And we believe that will just continue, not only in 2020 but beyond that just because of what Biktarvy has to offer for patients. Hopefully that answered your question, Geoff.","Geoff Meacham","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges with SVBLeerink. Your line is now open. ","Geoffrey Porges","Thank you very much. I appreciate the question. I have to ask one about Remdesivir, which is, have there been any other anecdotal reports or responses other than the one that was in the journal, over the weekend? And do you have manufacturing capacity that you could scale up quickly? And then, I just wondered if Merdad could talk a little bit about fibrotic disease. You're obviously still involved in NASH, but there are a lot of other fibrotic diseases. And I just wondered if your ambition span all fibrotic diseases, or still pretty much confined to NASH. Sorry about the double up.","Daniel O'Day","That's all right. Thanks for the question. On Remdesivir, we have not had any other anecdotal reports to date. And so, we'll obviously keep an eye on that very closely and see how that progresses. In terms of manufacturing, our team has really been working night and day, it's been very impressive to watch this team over the past couple of weeks really ramp up to the extent that we can. Our capacity is going up every day. We're looking at all the options we have expecting to be prepared for what may come.","Obviously we are waiting for data, both in vitro and then in people to ensure that the drug actually works. And it's important just for everyone to keep that in mind that this is still investigational and we are still waiting for more data to know. But at risk, we are investing pretty heavily to make sure that we're prepared as best as we can.","In terms of fibrotic disease, we think of it fairly broadly, but I guess from my perspective, when I think about fibrotic disease, to your point, we -- NASH, as you know, we've had programs in diabetic, kidney disease, we have a program idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis right now. And those are biologically related. And one of the things that we are always have in our mind is to think about where to apply a particular mechanism, which disease to apply particular mechanism. And so, what I would say is that as we see the readouts on the IPF study as they come forward, as we have the discussions with the agency about the NASH program and as we see novel molecules that come through, we'll do those in a gated way. Fibrosis is a challenging area, and we don't underestimate how difficult that's going to be.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Matthew Harrison","I was hoping you could address what you see as the opportunity in China. You obviously mentioned that fervently and then pointed out some of your HCV medicines are approved there. But I don't think you've talked about how big you think that could be or how much a contributor you think that could be over the next couple of years? Thanks. ","Daniel O'Day","Thanks, Matt. We\u2019ll have Johanna address that. Thanks.","Johanna Mercier","Yes. So, in China, we're excited about the fact that this is really our first opportunity with reimbursed compounds. So, I think, Dan mentioned which ones. But just to highlight, from a hepatitis C stand point, it's Harvoni and Epclusa. And then, only other product is with a tender process in China and the only other product approved is [indiscernible], reimbursed, I should say. And so, I mean, of course, this is more of a volume opportunity than anything else. And this is one that we believe many patients are in need. And we have a real opportunity to help those patients. That's in hepatitis C. In hepatitis B, vemlidy also got reimbursement, which of course as you know, hepatitis B is biggest market from a patient standpoint, it\u2019s also in China. And then last one is Genvoya and HIV, which HIV is going to be the first time that actually products will get reimbursed in China, in HIV the class. And so, we believe that's also one that we're cautiously optimistic that more patients can really get that treatment that they need.","So, we are cautiously optimistic about our China business opportunity. You can appreciate that with everything going on right now in China, the focus is not on some of these new products that got reimbursement. The focus is really on the people and what's going on with the coronavirus. And so, we do think that might be a little bit delayed in 2020 as we see kind of that play out. But I do think from a longer term standpoint, this is how we should be thinking about China and the opportunity moving forward, because of the patient pool that is so predominant in the specific disease areas that we offer potential solutions for patients.","Daniel O'Day","I think that's great, Matthew. The only thing I would say, Johanna\u2019s captured it really well. But, we kind of put this into the durable base part of our strategic story. And I think, that's because it is a volume game. I think, there is real opportunity here obviously for patients in China but also for our business, but it helps us kind of stabilize and navigate that durable base over the course of the years to come. And it's important for patients and also for our business to build that in. And then, we have the inflection points on top of that with Yescarta business with filgotinib with a variety of things that are in our hands right now and a larger portfolio to inflect for the -- to provide our confidence in the mid-to-long term growth. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Umer Raffat","Hi. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Perhaps first one for Johanna. Johanna, I know you worked -- in your prior role, you headed a commercial organization which was best in class in oncology and a very established organization in primary care with the Eliquis. And my question to you is, as you look at Gilead where it stands today, how prepared is the organization to compete with AbbVie and Pfizer, two companies very well entrenched in the -- with their JAKs respectively? I'm just trying to understand, the level of organizational preparedness, especially in light of which I think is probably something like $200 million plus or minus the year-over-year incremental SG&A expense possibly heading into the filgotinib launch.","And one for Merdad. I know, the filgotinib UC trial selection one's due any day. I also understand that there's inadequate responders to Entyvio in there. So, those patients in particular, what percentage is that of the trial? And do you expect filgotinib to be active in Entyvio non-responders. Thank you.","Johanna Mercier","So maybe I'll kick it off, Umer, with your first part of your question. So, specific to filgotinib, I think that you're right. Obviously, we are very well aware that it's going to be a very competitive environment. There's no doubt about that. But, I think we're being really smart about it. And what I mean by that is because I think what we're thinking about is making sure we're going to bring focus to the table. So, we\u2019re going to be -- we are very clear about where we want to play, and where we play, we win. And that's about commercial excellence and medical excellence, to be honest with you. Because medical and commercial are going to need to partner very closely and we are already around the clinical data and the profile of this compound, and how that really needs to be at the center of everything we do with filgotinib.","I would also say that, if I take other disease areas where we had similar competitive dynamics and similar competitors to be honest, we've done actually quite well in that space. And HCV is a great example of that where we've regained share. Now, we're at 60% share in HCV across the marketplace, which I do think shows others including internally and externally that we can be very comparative when we need to be. And I think that's exactly what you're going to see with filgotinib.","We are preparing the teams. We are making sure that we are hiring the right people, with the right level of experiences to making sure that we are absolutely ready for an expected launch later this year. And, I think that I'm really excited about it, to be honest with you. I think, the team has really come up as a line, and I think we've brought in some really good external talent that we already had some very good internal talent as well. And building the two together, I think we'll make for a very successful launch moving forward.","Merdad Parsey","Maybe I'll start by clarifying the timing because I think you may have given my team a heart attack. I don't think it's any day now. I think we've got it to a little bit later in the first half of the year. So, please be patient with us. We will get it out there as quickly as we can.","In terms of the Entyvio non-responders, I won't know the precise proportion until after we see the demography of the study afterwards, after the trial is done. So, I'm not going to -- I\u2019ll be speculating as to sort of where we land on that. So, I'm going to beg your patients on that one as well. But, in terms of expectations of response, I think if you look at this population, as you know, they cycle through a variety of medications. And while the response rate, when they cycle to the next medication, isn't usually as robust as a na\u00efve patient, there are good -- there's good evidence that going from let's say Entyvio to a TNF inhibitor or vice versa, you have -- you still have a good proportion of patients who respond in that. So, I think our expectations are fairly realistic about what the response -- that we'll have responders in there to filgotinib.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JP Morgan. Your line is now open. ","Cory Kasimov","I wanted to ask you on the corporate strategy front with -- well, everyone's pretty clearly waiting for the Company to engage in more substantial business development, but how much of a sense of urgency do you have on this front, given kind of the new management team all coming together now? And how successful do you think Gilead can be without outside help, basically relying on the first two pillars of your strategy?","Daniel O'Day","Yes. Thanks, Cory. I'll give a start and if Andy wants to add as well. So look, I think, first of all, I believe we're coming at this from a position of strength, a position of strength now that we have a complete management team with depth of experience. Of course, we're still building experience in some of our new therapeutic areas. But, we have now a team that is accomplished, that understands what good looks like, that understands how to take appropriate risks and that's relatively recent that we have this team together like this. So, it allows us, if you like, when we look at external opportunities in our areas of expertise, which is not unimportant because we've really decided to focus there. I think, it allows us to move fast. And we know that moving fast is important, and being first to the table at the right time, some cases, that's more risk, some cases that\u2019s the less risk, depending on the nature of what we're looking at. But, I think we're well prepared to be able to pivot to be first at the table or close to first at table and to make things happen.","So, we have a solid pipeline, but we have a sense of urgency of course around building this. And I think we've been clear about the areas we intend to build in. We will also be disciplined. We're not going to -- we're going to take appropriate risks, but I think risks that will help us build the shape of the portfolio, very much like Merdad mentioned before. And we'll take that into account too. So, it's not just about an individual target or assets, it's also about how that fits into the complementary nature of that therapeutic area and, or other therapeutic areas. And that's where we'll pivot and move with. But rest assured, our sense of urgency around this is high, but so is our expertise I would say as well.","Andy, do you want to add to that?","Andrew Dickinson","The only thing I would add, I agree that there is a sense of urgency. We'll be disciplined. I\u2019d say, to some extent, Cory that that best proxy is just looking at the past couple of years. I mean, we've outperformed commercially the last two years. We've given very clear guidance for 2020. Obviously, we will work incredibly hard to outperform again. We see opportunities, things that we can potentially do better. We would like to find external assets to supplement our pipeline, but we also feel that the durability of our existing business and our existing pipeline are both underappreciated.","So to answer your second question on, can we compete without doing large business development deals? Absolutely. I mean, and we think that we can continue to build a sustainable business. Would we like to supplement it with outside assets, especially to build our late stage pipeline? Yes. And we are actively working on that. But, to reiterate what Dan said, we're going to be thoughtful and disciplined in how we do it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Citi. Your line is now open.","Mohit Bansal","Thanks for taking my question. And if you could talk a little bit about the market opportunity with the capsid inhibitor, especially in heavily treated patients? Should we think about this as an incremental opportunity, or you think the portion of it could be from existing Gilead products? Thank you.","Johanna Mercier","So, I think, I can touch on it from a commercial standpoint and then maybe pass it over to Diana to touch a little bit more on its clinical profile and its offerings. From a commercial standpoint, we're thinking about the caspid in two ways. One, in prevention and the other one in treatment. Obviously, we think there's probably an opportunity we'll see to see if there's monotherapy and prevention and potentially obviously, we're looking for combination in the treatment. And Diana can touch on that a little bit more.","In prevention, I do think with Descovy right now in prevention and the launch of what's going on, we do think that\u2019s probably going to be something that could be very interesting for patients, if you think about that marketplace and thinking potentially after six months. And that's really what patients are looking for to have something every six months. This could be something very interesting and exciting for patients. And that would be with the timing that we're thinking about for this compound is assuming all plays out, then it could be actually more of a switch in the prevention market from Descovy to the capsid inhibitor.","Having said that in treatment that could look very different. And I do think that\u2019s potentially a market expansion because it would really be, if we can find a combination that would really work in the treatment setting, I do think that would offer a long-acting that patients actually really want. And that's the biggest piece of the puzzle. What we're trying to do is making sure that we match up what the patients are telling us with our clinical development plan. And what I mean by that is as we've done so much market research with our patient pool, what they're telling us is yes, weekly oral would be interesting and potentially something that they might be interested over a daily compound, but it's not for everyone. And then, when you go from weekly oral to potentially what else would they want, would they rather an injectable to subcu, subcu wins out, if they'd rather three months in six months, six months wins out. And so, that's really where we have focused our clinical development team to make sure that we're addressing the needs of patients. And maybe with that, I'll turn it over to Diana.","Diana Brainard","We recognize the bar is very high because Biktarvy has really set the standard. But, we also know that within the U.S., for example only 85% of people with HIV are in treatment. And if we want to end the epidemic, we have to do better. And the capsid inhibitor is going to be one of those tools. And we really see it, as Johanna was saying, as a market expander. Because one of the reasons that those people aren't in treatment is that the treatments right now are not amenable to their lifestyles. And so, a long-acting is a way to make the umbrella a little bit larger. It's a complement to Biktarvy and what we have already.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alethia Young with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.","Alethia Young","I just wanted to ask maybe perhaps Dan and Merdad about the NASH and hep B space. I mean, I know it's one that's been pretty tough in the clinical side, but obviously there's a lot of leverage to your business, since you have the sales force in place. So, I guess, I'm just trying to figure out where are you guys going to think about that going forward over the next 12 months? Thanks. ","Merdad Parsey","For NASH, I think, we definitely are working hard on the results from the ATLAS trial. And we'll be talking with the regulators and looking to see what the path forward is. As you said\u2026","Daniel O'Day","The data will be published at EASL.","Merdad Parsey","EASL, right, exactly. So, in April we'll show the data to everyone in April at EASL. And we have plans for a sort of midyear discussion with the agency to sort of see if there's a path forward and what that might look like and make a decision based on those discussions. Just a reminder that we've been studying more F3 and F4 patients, the more severe patients than most of the other competition has where they're looking at the milder patient populations, the F1s to F3s --F2s and F3s, sorry, primarily. So, it does pose some unique challenges. So, we will continue to work there.","And I think that -- I would say the same thing for HBV, right? I think it's -- HBV is a bit different in that. It is a core part of our business. We have therapies, we have a sales force, to your point on that. We're continuing to be committed to that space and working there. Our focus is on a cure. We have ongoing work with a number of programs to try to hit our move from where we are today in treatment to moving towards a cure. That's going to be a challenging road, but we're committed to it and continue to work there.","Daniel O'Day","Yes. I think, I couldn\u2019t agree more with Merdad\u2019s view. The only thing I would maybe add to that, Alethia, is just to say, particularly in hep B we understand that at the end of the day this is going to take partnerships. So, we have to decide, what do we do internally, what do we do with partners. Care is significantly more difficult than treatment in this area. And so, I think that gets back into some of the comments that both Merdad and I had around how much do we invest in ourselves, how much do we do with partnerships, what percentage of our total investment goes into these very, very important unmet medical needs and making sure that we also invest appropriately in other areas that we know have even greater realization potential that also have big unmet medical needs. So, that balance will continue to play out. The reality is we have very good expertise in both these diseases. And I think we'll be able to make good decisions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Salim Syed with Mizuho. Your line is now open. ","Salim Syed","Thanks so much guys for taking my question. And I appreciate all the color on the guidance, Andy. Just one for me on sort of the long-term picture here. And I\u2019m not asking for long-term guidance. Maybe this is for Dan or Andy. Obviously, you guys provided a lot of color. Johanna, you mentioned Biktarvy, majority of patients through 2033. You guys seem relatively excited about what you have currently in the pipeline with filgotinib et cetera. But with consensus as you modeled at $22 billion, sort of flattish for the next few years, do you need M&A to grow your top-line or do you think you can grow your top line without any additional M&A? Thanks so much.","Daniel O'Day","Yes. Thanks, Salim. I\u2019ll certainly have others comment here as well. But look, I think, as we've tried to build the story and as I've come to investigate the story and some of the other colleagues around the table, I think the first answer to your question is how durable is our base business. Because I think that has a very different -- depending on how durable you feel it is, that has a very different perspective on our confidence around the mid to long term growth. So, I think, and we've talked quite a bit about this, we feel very confident with the durability of our base business. And this is different, by the way, compared to a lot of companies in the industry. Yes, we have, as you know, from our guidance we\u2019re issuing today, we've got some patent expiry to deal with this year and some patent expiry to deal with next year in terms of Truvada. But then, as you look out in terms of time, we feel well-prepared for the Descovy patent expiry in \u201825, \u201826. And we basically then have a very durable franchise out until 2033. So that's the first part of the answer into the story.","Then we do feel that we have growth engines internally and that's exactly why we've tried to highlight them a bit more, give you exposure to them, be transparent about it, but also be very clear about where those inflection points are, things that we have in our hands today. And of course, some of the obvious ones, we have on the plate with things like ulcerative colitis, potentially reading out this year, second line DLBCL, capsid inhibitor coming next year, but we didn't talk about a variety of things that are coming to the Galapagos pipeline that also have optionality for us, if you like. And that's, osteoarthritis, the Phase 2 will come true this year. And then we'll have an IPF interim next year. So, there are a variety of things in our hands, including other collaborations. I'm not speaking out here today that are in Phase 1 or label enabling Phase 2s that are going to read out. And we're giving you all the exposure to the pipeline and portfolio.","So, can we grow based upon what we have in house? Yes. I'm confident we can. And I also believe that we're going to supplement that and de-risk that over time. And we're going to continue to do it in a way that you've seen us do that with proper partnerships and proper M&A transactions to get to a portfolio strength that's even more obvious to everybody and even more reliable. And that's going to take some time to build that and to grow it. But, we're firmly committed to do that and we have the resources to be able to do it. I mean, that's what I would say, Andy. Would you\u2026","Andrew Dickinson","No. I think that\u2019s perfect. I don\u2019t have anything else to add.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen and Company. Your line now open.","Phil Nadeau","One question for Andy, the 2020 guidance, just kind of maybe three moving parts that weren't mentioned on slide 25. and I was just curious to get your thoughts on whether these will materially impact revenue in 2020. So, the positive side first is filgotinib, any expectations for filgotinib revenue contemplated in your guidance? Then, maybe as potential headwinds in HIV, the nucleotide sparing regimens are launching, any expectation for those to gain share through the course of the year? And on HCV, price has been deteriorating over the last couple of years, any expectations for further declines in price, again, contemplated in the guidance? Thank you. ","Andy Dickinson","Yes. At a high level, and Johanna may want to comment on the HIV headwinds. In filgo, there's limited contribution in 2020, as you'd expect, given the projected launch date. So, there is potential upside there, if that develops. We think it's been a lot of time in the HIV market. So, as you might expect, our expectations for the competitive dynamic in the HIV market are built into our guidance. And then, in the HCV space, we do expect there to be continued price pressure in the HCV space. If you see from third quarter to the fourth quarter, if you look at our slides, the number of patients that were treated actually went up. Nonetheless, revenues are down, given kind of the dynamic in that space.","So, obviously, it's a smaller -- speaking HCV, it's a smaller piece of our business. But, we -- our guidance assumes continued decrease in that business over time, but it's still an important business for us. It generates a lot of cash flow. And on a percentage basis, although the increase is the same on a dollar basis, it's less and less year-over-year, and at some point, it may stabilize. But, that's how I would think about it, still at a high level. I don't know, Johanna, if you want to add, anything to that.","Johanna Mercier","Yes. No, I'm totally aligned with what you said. I would just add from HCV standpoint, the only thing I would add to that is, it's just so much more predictable today than it was. And so -- and the declines are much, much softer. And so, what you're going to see is still continued price erosion across U.S. and Europe, and the patient starts are a little bit less every single quarter. But having said that, it's nothing like what we've seen in the past. So, I think much more predictable marketplace for us.","In HIV, I think we have had some of those, I guess headwinds, as you say, from a competitors standpoint, mid last year, I guess, or so when competition came into the marketplace. And we have been able to manage that extremely well and very limited impact to Biktarvy and its growth trajectory. And so, we believe the same will continue throughout 2020.","Daniel O'Day","I think, that's the end of our call today.

As you know, Norbert made the decision earlier this year to step down from his position as Chief Scientific Officer. I've worked along Norbert for 27 years. And on behalf of the entire Gilead organization, I would like to express my profound thanks to him for his many, many contributions.","In terms of succession, Gilead is fortunate to have strong leaders across our R&D organization who will build on the tremendous success that we have had for over three decades. I look forward to the leadership of John in his new role as Chief Scientific Officer and Head of R&D and Andrew in his new role as Chief Medical Officer, as we continue our work to invent and develop new products for patients in need.","Turning to the business and results of the quarter, we continued to see strong growth in our HIV business, driven by broad acceptance and uptake of our Descovy-based regimens. We are confident that this franchise will remain a key growth driver for the company moving forward.","One of the products contributing to the growth is our latest Descovy-based single-tablet regimen, Biktarvy, formerly referred to as BIC\/F\/TAF, which was approved in February by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of HIV. In March, Biktarvy was added to the U.S. DHHS guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents living with HIV as one of the recommended initial regimens. Last week, we announced that the CHMP has adopted a positive opinion on the Marketing Authorization Application for Biktarvy in the EU. We expect approval in the third quarter of this year.","Biktarvy represents Gilead's sixth single-tablet regimen and, with the approval of Symtuza in the EU by our partner, Janssen, the fourth containing Descovy backbone. Symtuza is currently under FDA review in the U.S.","Biktarvy is a combination of an unboosted integrase inhibitor and the well-established backbone Descovy. Its small size, minimal drug interactions, and established renal and bone safety profile make Biktarvy an important treatment option for most HIV patients. This is particularly true for an aging HIV population, which is at increased risk for AIDS-related morbidities.","In February at CROI, the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, one of the most important meetings for HIV research, we had the opportunity to share our progress on the work we are doing to bring innovative therapies to people living with HIV. Gilead's compounds were featured in 21 abstracts and data presentations, including promising preclinical results from our HIV cure research program. These data show that the combination of two investigational agents, GS-9620, a toll-like receptor 7 agonist, and PGT-121, a broadly neutralizing antibody that binds to the HIV envelope, induced viral remission in the absence of antiviral therapy in HIV-infected monkeys and support clinical investigation of such combination strategies.","Investigators also presented Phase 3 data in patients switching from a regimen containing abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine to Biktarvy, and data from a multi-national Phase 3 study of Biktarvy in women, a group that is often underrepresented in clinical trials. Data from these studies further demonstrate that Biktarvy may be appropriate for a wide range of people living with HIV. The data presented at CROI represent encouraging progress and demonstrate our continued leadership in driving innovation in HIV therapy.","Moving to liver disease, our team recently attended the International Liver Congress in Paris, where there was a lot of emerging data around NASH and hepatitis B. The particular focus on NASH was very much like what we saw with the early breakthroughs in hepatitis C before the disease took center stage at the conference. John will share more specifics about EASL and the data presented there in a few minutes.","In oncology, we're encouraged by the response from the healthcare provider and patient communities to the life-saving potential for Yescarta in people with aggressive large B-cell lymphoma who have run out of options. We are seeing an increase in patient enrollment, as clinical experience with Yescarta steadily grows and additional authorized cancer centers with expanded geographic reach come online. We have now completed the authorization of 40 cancer centers and are on track to have enough centers certified to treat 80% of Yescarta-eligible patients in the United States by the middle of the year.","The future is incredibly bright for cellular therapy, and we're excited to be at the forefront of the field pursuing a variety of approaches to develop the next generation of cellular therapy in blood cancers and solid tumors.","As I look ahead to the remainder of 2018, we will continue to advance scientific innovation, including progressing our robust pipeline, which has the potential to transform the treatment of NASH, inflammatory diseases, and certain cancers.","In addition, we will look for business development opportunities that add to our pipeline and capabilities across our therapeutic areas, diversify our portfolio, and increase future opportunities for growth. For example, earlier in the quarter, we announced an agreement with Sangamo on gene editing to create next-generation cellular therapies. And just yesterday, we announced another with Verily to better understand the immune system of patients in our clinical studies with filgotinib. John McHutchison will provide more details on these collaborations. I'm confident that our innovation and hard work will deliver on our goals developing new treatments for people living with some of the world's most serious diseases.","And finally, tomorrow we will publish our 2017 Year in Review that highlights our scientific advancements, sustainability initiatives, community support programs, and our continued efforts to improve public health globally. I'm proud of the work that's being led by our employees and extend my many thanks to them for all of the ways they are making a difference around the world.","I will now turn the call over to John, who will provide additional updates on our R&D efforts. John?","John G. McHutchison - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thank you, John. I am honored to have the opportunity to lead our R&D organization, which has been at the forefront of scientific innovation for more than 30 years. Under Norbert's leadership, Gilead has brought forward 25 innovative treatments that have improved the lives of millions of people with serious diseases around the world. I am confident that our team will build on these remarkable accomplishments. I'd like to spend the next few minutes detailing our recent progress in liver diseases, inflammation, and cell therapy.","Beginning with liver disease, we continue to make excellent progress in NASH, where our efforts are focused on treating patients with the most serious forms of the disease, those with advanced fibrosis, who are at the highest risk to progress to end-stage liver disease, liver cancer, and ultimately the need for liver transplantation.","As we recently announced, STELLAR 3 and STELLAR 4, our two ongoing Phase 3 trials, completed enrollment ahead of schedule. Both studies are evaluating selonsertib, our S1 inhibitor, in patients with F3 and F4 stages of fibrosis. We now expect data from both Phase 3 studies in the first half of 2019. If the data support the safety and is statistically significant and clinically meaningful effect on fibrosis, we could file for regulatory approval towards the end of 2019.","In addition, we are exploring combination therapy approaches with compounds with distinctly different mechanisms of action. In animal models of NASH, combination approaches have proven safe and have led to greater anti-fibrotic responses compared to monotherapy.","As John mentioned, at the International Liver Congress in Paris last month, there was a growing interest and focus on NASH. We had the opportunity to present promising early results from a proof-of-concept study exploring both single agents and combinations of selonsertib with Gilead's ACC inhibitor, GS-0976, or our FXR agonist, GS-9674, in patients with NASH. Now the primary objective of this study was to determine the safety of the combination therapy. Based on the 12-week study, our combination therapies were well tolerated, and they offered additional benefits for improving NASH by reducing liver fat content, liver cell injury, and other markers of fibrosis. This is also the first study to show that GS-9674 alone had activity in patients with NASH.","Based on these encouraging data and supported by the pre-clinical results, Gilead has initiated a larger 350-patient Phase 2b study of combinations of selonsertib, GS-0976, and GS-9674 in patients with advanced fibrosis due to NASH. The treatment duration will be 48 weeks, with liver biopsies before and at the end of the treatment period.","Another goal of our NASH program is to identify accurate non-invasive tests that will hopefully allow healthcare providers to identify those in need of treatment. At the recent Liver Congress, we presented data using two different machine-learning methods on our earlier NASH studies. The results indicate that non-invasive tests can predict with a high degree of specificity and sensitivity the risk of clinical disease progression and, separately, improvement in liver histology. We will continue to investigate non-invasive tests, with the goal of replacing liver biopsies for the diagnosis of NASH and for patient management.","Moving to inflammation, I'm pleased to share that our three Phase 3 studies of filgotinib, our JAK-1 specific inhibitor in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, FINCH 1, FINCH 2, and FINCH 3, are now fully enrolled. These studies are evaluating the efficacy and safety of filgotinib in biologic-inadequate responder patients, methotrexate inadequate-responder patients, and treatment-naive patients respectively. We expect the FINCH 2 data will be available in the second half of this year, and FINCH 1 and FINCH 3 data will be available in the first half of 2019.","Filgotinib is also being investigated in two other Phase 3 studies in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis that will enroll more than 2,500 patients and also in a number of smaller Phase 2 studies in psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, cutaneous lupus, Sjogren's syndrome, and uveitis. We expect to have data available from some of those Phase 2 studies during this year.","Also yesterday, as John said, we announced an important scientific collaboration with Verily, the life sciences unit owned by Google's parent company, Alphabet, to accelerate our understanding of three common and serious inflammatory diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and lupus-related diseases. Most patients with these immunologically driven diseases don't experience deep or long-lasting remissions with currently available therapies. There's clearly a need.","Through this partnership, we will use Verily's ImmunoScape platform to interrogate the molecular characteristics of these immune-related diseases by segmenting each patient's individual leukocytes into more than two dozen component immune cell subsets. And utilizing epigenetic and transcriptomic assays, we believe this technology could allow us to identify particular groups of patients that respond to specific therapies and also to potentially identify new drug discovery targets.","Moving to cell therapy, we anticipate that the CHMP will adopt an opinion for Yescarta in the second quarter. And if positive, approval would follow likely in the third quarter of this year. Given the innovative nature of CAR T therapy, the European Medicines Agency is evaluating the application under standard review to allow them sufficient time to review that data that we submitted with the application.","Also in cell therapy, we continue to enroll patients in ZUMA-7, a Phase 3 randomized study comparing Yescarta to the standard of care, which is salvage chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation in the second-line treatment of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [DLBCL]. ZUMA-7 is also the first global randomized Phase 3 Study of a CAR T therapy and will enroll 350 patients across 50 sites in North America and Europe.","There remains a significant unmet medical need for patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL after first-line therapy. Salvage chemotherapy followed by transplantation cures only approximately 10% to 20% of these patients. If the ZUMA-7 trial provides positive data in this setting, Yescarta has the potential to become an alternative option earlier in the course of the disease, thereby expanding the therapeutic potential of cell therapy for patients living with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.","We are also excited about our partnership with Sangamo Therapeutics, which was announced in February. This agreement will allow our researchers access to Sangamo's zinc finger nucleases gene-editing technology, which we believe will lead to the development of an allogeneic T-cell therapy that could be manufactured using the cells of healthy donors. The gene-editing approach would reduce or eliminate some of the complications currently seen in allogeneic stem cell transplants such as rejection and graft-versus-host disease. Allogeneic therapies would also enable us to manufacture CAR T therapies that could be used universally, providing people, particularly those who are very, very ill, to access treatment much more quickly.","Combining gene editing with the synthetic biology tools we acquired with Cell Design Laboratories last year will also help us to develop treatments that can more precisely target hematological malignancies and solid tumors and may prove safer, more effective, and easier to manufacture.","We have achieved a great deal across our R&D organization this quarter, and I am confident we will continue to make significant progress throughout the remainder of the year.","In closing, I am excited to lead the talented Gilead R&D team going forward. I'm also looking forward to partnering with Andrew Cheng in his new role, and of course, with all my R&D colleagues. There has never been a more interesting time in science and medicine, with extraordinary new discoveries on an almost weekly basis. It will be our job here to leverage those advances and develop more effective and targeted therapies for patients with serious medical needs.","I'll now turn the call over to Robin.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to share our financial results for the first quarter of 2018.","Total revenues for the first quarter were $5.1 billion, with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.48. This compares to revenues of $6.5 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.23 for the same period last year.","Starting with HIV and HBV, product sales for the first quarter were $3.3 billion, up 2% year over year and down 10% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by the continued uptake of our Descovy-based regimens, partially offset by the entry of generics and greater U.S. inventory drawdown than in the prior-year period. Sequentially, the decline was due to U.S. sub-wholesaler inventory, reflective of the seasonal pattern from the fourth quarter to the first quarter and the availability of generic versions of TDF in the U.S., which impacted our HBV revenue.","Our U.S. HIV business remains robust, led by the continued uptake of Descovy-based regimens. On a year-over-year basis, U.S. HIV product sales grew 8% and total prescriptions for Descovy-based and Truvada-containing regimens grew 12%, consistent with growth seen in each of the preceding four quarters.","As John mentioned, Biktarvy, our newest single-tablet regimen for HIV, was approved in the U.S. in February, and we are encouraged by the initial uptake among prescribers. It's very early days, but launch to date Biktarvy is tracking very well against our expectations. With this trajectory, we anticipate over time Biktarvy will become the number one single-tablet regimen for treatment-naive and switch patients, a distinction currently held by Genvoya.","Approximately 80% of Biktarvy's prescriptions came from switches, of which approximately one-third came from Genvoya and two-thirds from other regimens, including approximately 20% from regimens that contain dolutegravir, confirming Biktarvy's broad utility across patient types.","Similar to the launch of Genvoya, access to Biktarvy has been strong, with the vast majority of state ADAPs and Medicaid programs now covering Biktarvy, with coverage in additional state programs expected this quarter.","Truvada for PrEP continued to grow, with approximately 167,000 individuals taking Truvada for this indication in Q1.","In Europe, sales of Descovy-based regimens comprise more than half of our HIV product revenues and continue to grow, primarily driven by strong uptake in important markets such as France and Italy. Genvoya remained the number one regimen for naive and switch patients across the EU5 collectively for the fourth consecutive quarter, reflective of the strong physician and patient preference for Descovy-based regimens.","Turning to HCV, product sales for the first quarter were $1 billion, down 59% year over year and down 30% sequentially. Consistent with our expectations, in Q1 we observed a downward pricing and market share trend across the major geographies as a result of a more competitive environment. Price has now largely stabilized, and we expect market share to stabilize by midyear. In addition, patient starts have become more predictable, and we expect a slow and steady decline moving forward. We continue to see the HCV market as durable. And albeit a smaller component of our revenues going forward, there are still many patients that remain to be treated.","Our cardiovascular products, Ranexa and Letairis, generated $399 million in the first quarter. As a reminder, the patent for ambrisentan in the U.S. will expire in July this year.","And finally, sales of Yescarta were $40 million in the first full quarter since approval in October. As John mentioned earlier, we are making great progress in training and certifying additional centers. In terms of access in the U.S., we are seeing the payer mix play out as expected, with approximately two-thirds of Yescarta patients covered by commercial and fee-for-service plans and approximately one-quarter of patients covered by Medicare. There is broad coverage of Yescarta-eligible patients with commercial insurance. It's encouraging to see the strong execution by our commercial, medical affairs and manufacturing teams, the positive feedback from centers, and the growing awareness of Yescarta in the hematology and patient communities.","Now turning to expenses, non-GAAP R&D expenses were $814 million for the first quarter, down 8% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to our purchase of a Priority Review voucher in the prior year. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $884 million for the first full quarter, up 10% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to costs associated with our newest product launches, including Biktarvy and Yescarta, geographic expansion, and increased expenses to support the growth of our business following the acquisition of Kite.","Moving to the balance sheet, during the first quarter we generated cash flows from operations of $2.3 billion and ended the quarter with $32.1 billion in cash and investments. We repaid $4.5 billion of term loans borrowed in connection with our acquisition of Kite, paid cash dividends of $753 million, and repurchased 13 million shares of stock for $1 billion. The amount of shares repurchased was aligned to our stock compensation awards, which are largely granted in the first quarter and reflects a one-time impact to repurchases related to unvested equity assumed from the Kite transaction. While our cash flows will remain strong for the remainder of the year, we anticipate a sequential decrease in Q2 2018 due to anticipated tax-related payments.","The year is progressing consistent with our expectations, and we are reiterating our full-year guidance, which can be found on slide 47 in the earnings results presentation.","Our confidence in the future is supported by a strong and growing HIV business, led by the launch of Biktarvy in the U.S., increasing momentum in our cell therapy business, and potential opportunities in emerging R&D areas of NASH and inflammation.","I would like to conclude by thanking our nearly 10,000 employees for their commitment to excellence and hard work that is well represented in the results this quarter.","Let's now open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Geoffrey Porges of Leerink. Your line is now open.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you very much, and I appreciate the question. John McHutchison, congratulations on all the responsibilities. Maybe we could start off with a commercial question. More seriously on the R&D side, could you give us the latest disclosure on the PE and DVT events you've seen so far in the RA program for filgotinib?","And then perhaps you could talk a little bit more generally about what areas you're particularly excited about in your new position that you think the company has the opportunity to invest in more aggressively. Thanks.","John G. McHutchison - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thank you, Geoff, for the kind words and for the question. So regarding the first part of your question, the thromboembolic event rates with baracitinib, the most recent data that we have shown was a presentation at ACR late last year by Mark Genovese, which is an oral presentation. Now this is just from the DARWIN 1, 2, and 3 extension studies, where we have about 1,700 patient years of exposure, but that rate was very low, only one patient in that presentation who had both a DVT and a PE. So the rate actually in that presentation was 0.06 per 100 patient years. But, Geoff, so far we've got thousands of patients in Phase 3. We've got a relatively small data set in terms of exposure, but that's what we have said so far. We continue to collect all of that information.","The other point to raise about this was the discussion recently at the Advisory Committee and whether this is slightly or partly related to JAK-2. As you know, filgotinib is very selective for JAK-1. And in terms of JAK-2 specificity, we don't have that at all. So we don't see any changes in hemoglobin. When we see positive changes in hemoglobin, we don't see any increase in platelets. In fact, we see a small decrease in platelets. Whether or not that's related to thromboembolic phenomena, we don't know.","In terms of what we're excited about in R&D, you know me, Geoff. I'm always excited about everything. But the opportunity to make huge progress in cell therapy, not just with Yescarta, which has enormous potential, but the future of cell therapy going forward. Investing in research as we have, to come forward with next-generation products is really exciting for the organization to lead that entire field. And we will continue to lead that, and I will ensure that, as will Andrew and others in the organization as well.","Additionally, I think we have a lot of opportunities in NASH. The ability to have a drug approved for an antifibrotic endpoint in liver disease has never been done before, and we clearly want to do that, and there's a lot of patients out there with NASH. And then I believe our fledgling programs that are now developing in full force in inflammation, with filgotinib in multiple diseases are becoming differentiated, exciting, and heading in the right direction, particularly with things such as the Verily collaboration. So that's a long answer. I'm sorry, Geoff.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for the question. So the HIV franchise is really key to Gilead getting back to a growth company, so I was hoping you guys could give a bit more detail on the underlying demand trends in the U.S. and Europe, just independent of inventory fluctuations. I guess I'm trying to reconcile the 2% growth with maintaining guidance in the positive commentary. Thanks so much.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","So I'm going to let Andrew start with just giving you really the underlying details around the Biktarvy launch, and then I'll jump in with some of the revenue areas.","Andrew Cheng - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Geoff, it's Andrew. So I just want to touch on and reiterate some of the things that Robin has mentioned during the call in her prepared remarks, primarily that when we look at Biktarvy, we see 80% of Biktarvy scripts come from switches. Of those switches, a third are from Genvoya and about 20% come from dolutegravir-based regimens, both Tivicay and Triumeq.","When we see the switches as well as the naive patients' trajectory overall, they're right on target for what we predicted prior to the launch and really are in line for where we think Biktarvy will ultimately end up as the top switch as well as naive drug in HIV, and a position that's currently occupied by Genvoya.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","And, Geoff, I'd add to that that keep in mind that the launch of Biktarvy, we basically got six weeks of revenue currently in the quarter. So while a partial quarter, we also had about half of it was related to inventory. But underlying, to your point, we're really excited with the overall launch of Biktarvy and the success to date. The launch trajectory is looking very close to Genvoya. And over time, we expect it to overtake Genvoya, as I mentioned, as the number one STR for naive and switch patients over time.","I think if you then turn and think about just Europe beyond Biktarvy, we're also seeing, as I mentioned, over 50% of our HIV sales came from Descovy-based products in Europe, and that's exceeding in advance of the fact that generics are widely available.","So to the point I made on the call and John made, we're really excited with the opportunity for HIV to be a growth business. That's inclusive of PrEP as well, but we're excited where we are for the year and for the opportunity to have this business be a growth trajectory for us beyond 2018.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Yee of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for the question as well, a two-part question. On HIV, can you just perhaps quantify how much inventory impacted the results? I think people are quite a bit concerned on the HIV numbers, so maybe just help us out there relative to consensus, $100 million \u2013 $200 million, or more of inventory.","And on hep C, there was a miss there, and I guess people are concerned about that relative to your competition. So maybe just talk to that because you're reiterating the guidance. Thanks so much.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Sure. So, Michael, let me start with HIV inventory. The drawdown in inventory was primarily from our HIV products. But as I mentioned, if you look at underlying U.S. prescription growth overall, it was 12% year over year. And as I mentioned, 50% of our HIV revenues in Europe were comprised of Descovy-containing regimens. So while we haven't quantified the dollar magnitude, the drawdown was larger than what we have seen in past quarters. And typically, if you go back, the last eight quarters we've had that Q4 to Q1 dynamic relative to inventory, so it is seasonal.","There were two key events this quarter that made that inventory decline greater than expected. One was the availability of generic versions of TDFs, so therefore wholesalers weren't carrying Viread anymore. And then two, the anticipation of the Biktarvy approval, so lower stocking of both TAF and TDF-containing regimens. Keep in mind if you look at year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter growth, the availability of generic versions of TDF in the U.S. impacted our HBV business.","Overall, as we think about our big three wholesalers, we were in line relative to our inventory agreements. I'll remind you that we don't have agreements in place for the sub-wholesalers. But again, just emphasizing that overall, our underlying HIV growth remains strong but we have the typical seasonal inventory, driven by the two events that I just mentioned.","Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","The second part was on HCV.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","So to turn to your second question on HCV, which the question...","Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","The competitive environment.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yes, the competitive environment, I would say if you step back and think about where we are relative to our guidance and our expectations, we reiterated guidance. It is pretty much playing out in line with our expectations. We talked about the fact in my comments that the U.S. pricing has largely stabilized, and we expect market share to stabilize by midyear.","I would say, Michael, that the ex-U.S. competition has intensified, but I'd also say that competition was a more intense environment prior to the launch of a competitor and remains to be. So we do believe that overall hep C is a long and durable market. We'll continue to compete very aggressively with our competitor. But in summary, our expectations for 2018 are intact, and we believe our revenue reflects the guidance that we provided at the beginning of the year.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Abrahams of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Brian Abrahams - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, thanks for taking my question and my congrats to Norbert on all your accomplishments and to Andrew and John on your new roles and responsibilities. A question on Yescarta, as we try to gauge avenues of continued growth there this year and beyond, can you maybe help us understand the proportion of centers that are operating at high throughput and perhaps how far along in infrastructure establishment those additional centers that you expect will be authorized are going to be relative to those already online? And then I guess I'm also just curious on revenue recognition there relative to reimbursement, how we should be thinking about that. Thanks.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","So I'll start, Brian. I would say you're right. It's early days, so we're not going to get into throughput discussions or specifically what we're seeing at every center. We're really pleased with our full first quarter revenue. We've talked about this being a very measured launch, with our focus being this year on getting centers authorized and being sure that their experience with Yescarta meets the expectation of the centers and the patients. So I mentioned we have 40 centers authorized, and we expect by midyear that we'll have coverage for 80% of the eligible Yescarta patients as we continue to ramp up centers.","Relative to revenue recognition, no overall concerns there, we're seeing good reimbursement overall for both commercial as well as Medicare patients. So we're really comfortable where we are with the launch to date.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, good afternoon. Thanks for the question. I guess one, with HCV price stabilizing, I wonder if you'd just give us some idea of where that stabilized relative to some of the prior comments you've made around what the average price was across the regimens.","And then if I can ask a separate question for John McHutchison, related to the UC program for filgotinib, I believe you have a futility analysis to move from Phase 2 to Phase 3. Could you just talk a little bit about what the bar is and what the hurdle is to move into the Phase 3 program and how you're thinking about that? Thanks.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","So I'll start, Matthew. I think the main change that you saw in Q1 in that step-down, as we talked about on our February call, was related to Medicare in the U.S. So as we mentioned this call and the prior, we expected that step-down with the price adjustment as we move to the new contractual arrangements at the beginning of the year.","John G. McHutchison - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","And, Matthew, it's John McHutchison. The second part of the question was about the futility interim analysis for the selection of filgotinib in ulcerative colitis Phase 3 study. Just to remind you, the reason we did this futility analysis is we hadn't studied filgotinib in ulcerative colitis in Phase 2. We had in Crohn's disease in the FITZROY study and we have obviously had data in rheumatoid arthritis, but we had to have an interim analysis in the ulcerative colitis study to make sure that we were on track.","That analysis is planned, without getting into all of the details, coming up shortly this year. It's based on the week 10 induction timepoint and the endoscopic response and improvements in endoscopic response in the two groups of patients that are enrolled in the trial, those that are naive and those that are biologic non-responders. So I'll leave it at that, I think, to answer the question, and we'll see how it goes.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Citi. Your line is now open.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, guys, thank you for taking the question, so just one quick question on HCV. You did not reiterate HCV guidance, so I was just curious whether or not that's reiterated as well.","And then on Yescarta, I'm just trying to understand a little bit about what you're seeing in the real world on safety, given that you'll be facing some competition. Are you seeing safety in line with your clinical trial work or side effects that are not as common? Thanks.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","So, Robyn, I'll take the first question regarding guidance. We didn't give specific HCV guidance. But again, if you take a look at our revenues and you look at the components that we provided in our guidance overview last quarter, we're pretty much in line and at the high end of that guidance overall with $1 billion-plus in global HCV revenues. And we did reiterate our total guidance, which is how we guided this year on total net product revenue. Relative to safety on Yescarta, John, do you want to?","John G. McHutchison - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Robyn, it's John McHutchison. Hello. So I've been talking to some of the team members in Santa Monica over the last couple of days. And in general, there's nothing untoward that's been observed to my knowledge as well outside of the clinical trial.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Umer Raffat of Evercore. Your line is now open.","Regina Grebla - Evercore Group LLC","Hi, this is Regina Grebla on for Umer. Thank you for taking our questions. So first, many investors think that you're in an earnings trough this year. Do you think that you're in an earnings trough? And NASH is emerging as an important catalyst in your pipeline. We saw some data from Allergen at EASL where patients and their placebo arms seesawed between fibrosis stages. We do recognize that the Allergen study enrolled earlier fibrosis stage patients than F3. But how much of a risk do you think this could be in your Phase 3 program? Thank you.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hi, Regina, so I'll start off. As I mentioned on the call, I think we're off to a great start. We've reiterated guidance, and the year is progressing in line with our expectations. We do believe that 2018 is a trough year for us on which we can grow. We'll have seasonality fluctuations from quarter to quarter, but we're very confident, hence, reiterated our overall guidance for the year and expect to be able to grow off of our 2018 base going forward.","John G. McHutchison - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hi, Regina. It's John McHutchison. In terms of the second part of your question relating to variability in placebo response rates, it is an issue with liver biopsy, where we know there's a 30% variability if you have two pathologists read the same liver biopsy. And I think some of the presentations you referred to at AASLD might be partly reflecting that. So it's an imperfect tool at best but what we have in terms of drug approvals for NASH patients.","We have had the fortunate opportunity of being able to address this. Our previous simtuzumab trial enrolled many hundreds of patients. Now the drug didn't work, unfortunately, but we have a lot of patients with two liver biopsies a long time apart, so we are very, very confident of what we expect to see in F3 and F4 patients in terms of the placebo response rate, in terms of the fibrosis improvement score of one point with no worsening of NASH. So we have that number, and that is what we've used to calculate our power and our sample size in our STELLAR 3 and STELLAR 4 programs.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Phil Nadeau of Cowen. Your line is now open.","Philip Nadeau - Cowen & Company","Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question, two follow-up questions on the commercial side. So first on HCV, just to maybe ask Robyn's question in a different way, on slide 35 of the slide deck you handed out on the last call, you did give a range for 2018 expected HCV sales of $3.5 billion to $4 billion, even if that wasn't formal guidance. And you said that the decrease versus the $9.1 billion from 2017 would be due to about a $1 billion hit from total market patient starts and a $4.3 billion to $4.6 billion hit from the competitive environment. So if you're going to redo that slide today given what you've seen in Q1, would those numbers still hold? Would you still expect the same hit from market starts, competitive environment leading to the same 2018 range?","And then just briefly on Biktarvy, I know you said that the access was good. We've heard from physician consultants that insurers are requiring prior auths and other methods early in the launch of HIV products. What are you seeing in terms of prior auths from insurance plans for Biktarvy? Thanks.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hi, Phil. So I'll take the first part and then turn it over to Andrew for Biktarvy. Looking at the slide that you referred to, and again I'll reiterate our HCV revenues for the quarter were $1 billion. So if I think about what we talked about, the reason for the step-down, one being price, because we did the new contracting in Q1, that would fall under competitive environment as well as thinking about share. The combination of those two make up the competitive environment. Starts, we talked about them being a slow and steady decline. So yes, I believe this slide is intact and it's included in our overall reiteration of our guidance for the full year of $20 billion to $21 billion.","Andrew Cheng - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","So, Phil, it's Andrew. So we'll switch gears, and you were asking about prior authorizations with Biktarvy. I think as you're well aware that when any new product launches that there is some degree of prior authorization as they start to review the product. However, as John mentioned on his initial remarks of the call, on March 27, the DHHS guidelines placed Biktarvy in the top tier of its recommended initial regimens list. Since that time, we've received some feedback that the amount of prior authorizations has really decreased and has become less of an impediment. And taken together, that helps put us to and reiterate what Robin said earlier on the call that we have every expectation that Biktarvy will match and then exceed Genvoya when it comes to number one position for both naive and switch patients.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi, thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering maybe, John McHutchison, if you can discuss the importance of first-mover advantage for Yescarta in DLBCL versus any potential modest benefit that a future competitor might have on CRS. I'm just wondering how you think about that.","And then maybe one for Robin, just HIV pricing in Europe, have you guys seen any change in the pricing dynamics on the branded side given the entry of generics? Thanks a lot.","John G. McHutchison - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hey, Terence. It's John McHutchison. Hello, thank you for the question. I think the first-mover advantage is important. We have the relationships. We have the experience now in the community, particularly in the U.S., which will obviously extend elsewhere. So I think it's an important advantage, as it has been for us in other diseases, including HIV and hepatitis C, where we were fortunate to be first as well. So that's a brief and general answer, but I think it is important.","Andrew Cheng - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Terence, it's Andrew. So I'll touch on the impact in Europe and what we've seen. Generics for Viread, TDF, are available in Europe, and we have seen some impact on certain pricings in certain countries. However, I think it's important to recognize that over 50% of our European revenues come from TAF-based products. And you can see, as we mentioned on our last call, that in certain countries, the conversion rate from TDF to TAF products like Germany exceeds 70%. So I think when one thinks about the impact, we've already made that switchover for a number of countries, and that impact is somewhat muted.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","And, Terence, to follow on to that, we priced Genvoya at parity with Stribild. So our ability to get early access in those markets where we've launched has been helped, and it's helped that overall transition that Andrew just referred to, with greater than 50% being Descovy regimens overall.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. It's on Yescarta, and I'm wondering. Is the $40 million in sales in Q1 pretty evenly distributed across your 40 authorized centers, or is it more concentrated in a handful of them? And then just in general terms, should we be thinking about patient capacity per center as something that also gradually evolves over time? Thanks.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hi, Cory. It's Robin. I'd say again, it's early days relative to our centers being certified and getting launched to really get at a throughput per center or any of those type of metrics. And I'd also say that because this is such a specialized treatment, we've selected centers that we think can be successful. We're helping them through that. Yes, some of the earlier centers we're seeing higher volumes, as you would anticipate. But I think the volume is not just determined by saying you're now certified. It's just determined by the hospital and their resources and looking at the other various treatments, et cetera, and other capacity centers that any hospital has to manage.","So it's going to be harder, particularly in this therapeutic area, to provide the level of detail and granularity or at this stage, details by center. The $40 million was very robust for us. We're happy with the results today. And as I mentioned, this is going to be a controlled, measured launch for us, and we're going to continue in that process and provide you updates on that as much as we can.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Alethia Young of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question and congrats to John and Andrew. This is more one on the commercial standpoint, just big-picture. So Biktarvy has taken roughly 80% switch from Genvoya. I just wanted to think about broadly. Should we think Genvoya continues to grow, or does it inflect and then Biktarvy picks up where Genvoya left off, or is it just a case that the 80% Biktarvy switch most likely may moderate a little bit, so that trend may not be as pronounced? Thanks.","Andrew Cheng - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","So, Alethia, let me just clarify something in your call, just to recognize that when we think about Biktarvy scripts, 80% come from switches. About a third of those come from Genvoya. So I think when we think about it, a third from Genvoya, then about 20% from dolutegravir-based regimens, either Tivicay or Triumeq, and then the remainder of the switches come from a mix of different regimens.","So when we think about it overall, I think we're very happy with the mix. And given our robust development plan where two of the four studies were based on switch, one from Triumeq and one from protease inhibitor-based regimens, we expect that mix actually to be the same going forward, about an 80:20 switch given the overall dynamics.","Now there's certainly going to be some degree of variability from quarter to quarter into the proportion that's Genvoya versus dolutegravir-based regimens. But certainly, we're very comfortable with where we are and expect that the overall growth of Biktarvy to continue, as we mentioned earlier.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Salim Syed of Mizuho. Your line is now open.","Salim Syed - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Hi, guys, thanks for taking the question, just one on Yescarta. Could you just maybe comment on what sort of education you guys are doing with the medical community for the non-CAR T oncology docs, and if these docs are actually referring patients to the CAR T centers after which line of therapy in general? Thank you.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hi, Salim. It's John Milligan. I just wanted to \u2013 it's actually a very timely question. So as you know, we've been out in the community detailing Zydelig, and we've just recently taken those representatives, our therapeutic specialists, and put them through specific CAR T training so that they can start to have a conversation with doctors and the communities about what CAR T is, what kinds of patients are eligible for CAR T, and can help them with referrals. I don't know specific referrals, but certainly encouraging doctors to refer those patients who would be eligible to specialists who then can handle those cases. So we are starting an educational campaign in the community that really kicked off this week.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from Ying Huang of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, thanks for taking my questions, the first one I have related to the data you presented at EASL. So if you look at the MRI-PDFF data, it seems that the asthma inhibitor does not appear to be very potent compared to the ACC inhibitor or even FXR. So I was just wondering based on that, how much confidence do you have on the ultimate success of the Phase 3 trials for asthma in STELLAR 3 and 4 trials?","And then maybe, Robin, can you elaborate a little bit on the ex-U.S. dynamics for HCV? Because it appears that AbbVie has enjoyed very much success in launching Mavyret in ex-U.S. based on the numbers reported. I was wondering how you see that evolving in the next few quarters, whether you can gain back share from AbbVie or not? Thank you.","John G. McHutchison - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hello, Ying, it's John McHutchison to answer the first part of your question. The observation you made and noted in our EASL presentation that selonsertib has less of an effect on steatosis in the liver than our ACC inhibitor that inhibits de novo lipogenesis is exactly what we wanted to see and expected to see because of the mechanism of action. Selonsertib doesn't have a primary anti-lipo toxicity effect. It's an anti-ASK, and it works on hepatic stellate cells as well. So that's what we expected to see.","In terms of the second part of your question, does that give us more or less confidence in terms of our Phase 3 STELLAR programs, I think you need to take the context of what we presented at EASL in a 12-week study and think about it in the overall context.","What we did in all of these programs is we did single-agent small studies first to show that each drug was effective, which we've done for all of our three drugs. Then we did a small combination study to see if there was combination safety. That's what we presented at EASL. We did, however, also present some of the parameters that you've been talking about. But our goal was always, once we had combination safety, to then be able to kick off a definitive larger study with a longer duration of therapy to determine which of those drugs is safer, which is what we're doing.","To get back to the selonsertib question, we decided to do a Phase 3 STELLAR selonsertib study based on a previous study that we presented last year that was 24 weeks in duration, that had two liver biopsies, that showed a dose-dependent effect on the regression of fibrosis, and an inverse relationship to the development of cirrhosis. We also showed that the target phospho-p38 is up-regulated in MAPK patients, and it's also blocked or inhibited or down-regulated by the drug. So everything is heading in the right direction.","And I think what's happening here is people are taking this small 12-week experiment that was due and looking at combination safety out of context. When we started our STELLAR Phase 3 program, it was based on a larger Phase 2 study, two biopsies six months apart, that showed a definitive effect on fibrosis. So we are in good shape. I'm excited about the results. We've enrolled them ahead of schedule, and we look forward to getting the results early next year.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thanks, John. And I think, Ying, your other question was related to ex-U.S. HCV sales. So let me start by saying I think that's always been a much more competitive environment compared to the U.S. But OUS sales if we compare what we did relative to our competitor includes a wide variety of geographies, including Europe, Japan, and Asia. And I would say the market share is very different from country to country.","I think it is fair to say that we've seen our competitors do very well in Japan, for example, with some of the prior DAA failures and some warehousing there. But there are other countries where we're doing well and we're going to pick our opportunities to focus on. While we know this is a competitive market, we feel we have the field force and necessary folks in place to be competitive. And as mentioned, I think we're on track. And relative to where we expected us to be, we see things playing out very close to that. As I also said, we expect our share to stabilize by midyear, so I think we'll be able to provide more insight around share going forward during the next call.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Carter Gould of UBS. Your line is now open.","Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks, guys, for taking the question. I was looking to get some clarity on the regulatory strategy for filgotinib and if investors should expect you to file I guess following that the FINCH 1 and FINCH 3 data become available. Or will you look to wait for maybe one of the GI-focused indications to have that Phase 3 data in hand as well? Thank you.","John G. McHutchison - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","So, Carter, it's John McHutchison. Thank you for the question. So as I said today in my prepared notes that we now are in the fortunate position to have all FINCH 3 trials enrolled for both methotrexate-naive and inadequate responders in our biologic non-responders. So we can file if the data supports it, of course. We can file for RA with all of those three studies, and they are in a different timeline from the inflammatory bowel disease study, so we would not wait for the inflammatory bowel disease studies.","Operator","Thank you, and that concludes our question-and-answer session for today.

My name is Erika and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. ","I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Patrick O'Brien ","Thank you, Erika, and good afternoon, everyone. We issued a press release this afternoon providing earnings results for the third quarter, which is available on our website where you can also find detailed slides that support today's call. ","For our prepared remarks and Q&A, I'm joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, John Martin; our President and Chief Operating Officer, John Milligan; our Executive Vice President of Research and Development, Norbert Bischofberger; our Executive Vice President of Commercial Operations, Kevin Young; and our Chief Financial Officer, Robin Washington.","Before we begin with our formal remarks, we want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including plans and expectations with respect to our product candidates, financial projections, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in our latest SEC disclosure documents and recent press releases. In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.","We will also be using non-GAAP financial measures to help you understand our underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in our press release as well as on our website. ","I would now like to turn the call over to Robin Washington.","Robin Washington","Thanks Patrick and thank you all for joining us. Earlier today, we reported solid third quarter 2013 results. Our non-GAAP EPS was $0.52 per share compared to $0.50 per share of the same period last year. Worldwide product sales exceeded $2.7 billion, up 15% over the same quarter last year and 2% sequentially, driven largely by the continued uptick of our single tablet regimen in both the U.S. and EU.","Turning to operating expenses, year-over-year non-GAAP R&D expenses were up $105 million, which is mainly attributable to the increased investments in phase 2 and 3 programs in oncology and phase 3 program in HIV. Non-GAAP SG&A spending was up about $90 million as we continued to expand our infrastructure to support the anticipated launch of Sofosbuvir.","Finally, I would like to update you on our full year 2013 financial guidance, which is summarized on Slide 10 in the earnings presentation available on our corporate website. We are increasing our non-GAAP net product revenue guidance for full year 2013 to $10.3 billion to $10.4 billion, which represents a $200 million increase from the top end of our previous guidance range. ","Our operating expense and tax rate guidance are also changing as follows: R&D expense guidance will increase to $1.95 billion to $2 billion; SG&A expense guidance will decrease to $1.5 billion to $1.55 billion. Tax guidance is now 26% to 27%. All other aspects of our guidance for 2013 remain unchanged.","In closing, our year-to-date 2013 financial performance is on track and we look forward to a strong fiscal year close.","I\u2019ll now hand the call over Kevin.","Kevin Young","Thank you, Robin. Breaking down the third quarter results, I would first like to concentrate on United States. Total U.S. sales for the quarter were an impressive $1.7 billion, a growth of 20% over the third quarter of 2012. Both antiviral and cardiopulmonary franchises posted robust year-over-year increases of 19% and 27%, respectively.","Looking in more detail at HIV, it is important to first report that there was little effect of either inventory or ADAP purchase. Inventory for our big three wholesalers increased slightly, but stayed around the mid-point of our contractual range. ADAP purchasing was solid during the third quarter but lighter in the second quarter of 2013.","It is difficult to predict the picture for the remaining quarters of federal fiscal year, but we do know now that the base and emergency funds for 2013 have been fully delivered to each state program.","The third quarter of 2013 marks two years since the launch of Complera and one year since the launch of Stribild. The adoption of both these new single tablet regimens continues to be very encouraging.","Stribild is now the number one regimen in na\u00efve HIV patients. The number one regimen in patients who are switched and more prescriptions have been written for Stribild during its first year of launch than for any other HIV product since Atripla was introduced in 2006.","The performance of Complera is no less impressive. Complera is the number two regimen in na\u00efve HIV patients and number two regimen in patients who are switched and the number two regimen in all HIV treated patients.","What is especially interesting is to see how the third agent landscape is rapidly changing as a result of inscription of Gilead\u2019s new STRs. The NNRTI class has significantly reduced in share but it\u2019s the leading third agent category.","Integrate inhibitor class has grown sharply and is now the second largest third agent category. Finally, the protease inhibitors have dropped both in share and position being the smallest of the third agents.","Turning to Europe, we were also very pleased with the third quarter year-over-year sales growth of 7% excluding foreign exchange. The continued strength of Eviplera is reassuring and the very early signs from Stribild are encouraging.","Eviplera sales rose by over 400% year-on-year driven by the fact that it was the first full quarter for all big five markets. We are particularly encouraged by the rapid uptick of Eviplera in Spain, a traditionally strong NNRTI market. In just two quarters since launch, Eviplera is the most prescribed regimen in na\u00efve HIV patients.","Stribild is now commercially available in seven European countries but only two major markets, the U.K. and Germany. In the U.K., Stribild is the first ever prescription product to gain pricing approval to the new NHS England system and we now look forward to healthy uptick in the coming months.","Stribild performance in Germany has got off to a very fast start with prescriptions running at double the pace of Eviplera at a similar time point in launch. 70% of na\u00efve HIV patients in Germany are already treated with Stribild.","In summary, today\u2019s business performed exceptionally well in the third quarter. I\u2019d now like to focus my remaining comments on our new opportunities hepatitis C and oncology.","On our quarterly costs I have kept abreast of the commercial build outs for HCV in the U.S. and Europe. I am pleased to report that for both regions we are now putting the finishing touches in place for Sofosbuvir launch. In the U.S. we have a dedicated sales team of approximately 150 HCV therapeutic specialists who are in territory and going through the final phases of training. On the approval of Sofosbuvir this team will discuss our FDA approved label with hepatologists, gastroenterologists and a proportion of infectious disease specialists. Our HIV team will play no part in the launch of Sofosbuvir and will concentrate solely on supporting our important HIV single tablet regimens. Wrapped around our HCV sales team will be a complete supporting infrastructure of medical scientists, national account managers and nurse educators. We feel confident that subject to FDA approval we have the right resources and the right people to provide strong educational support for Sofosbuvir.","Our product distribution model will essentially be similar to that of HIV yet with a bigger network of specialty pharmacists. We anticipate that Sofosbuvir purchases in December will be largely for opening and entry of our wholesaler level. And that prescribing pull through will only really start in the new year especially for the GT-1 patient requiring pegylated Interferon.","In Europe we anticipate Sofosbuvir European Commission approval in the first quarter 2014. We will then roll out our launches according to pricing and reimbursement timelines. Like the U.S. by the end of 2013 we will have finished hiring and training our field sales teams in Germany, the UK, Austria, Nordics and France. France is an especially important market to highlight because of its history of HCV infection and subsequent high diagnosis rate. We have already put in place a so-called French ATU early access program in order to provide Sofosbuvir to high need pre and post HCV liver transplant patients.","Overall we feel that our commercial launch plans are where they should be to bring Sofosbuvir responsibly to specialists and their patients upon regulatory approval.","Finally, a very brief mention of oncology. We will gear up our sales and marketing efforts for Idelalisib commensurate with projected regulatory timelines. In the U.S. we will build the stand alone sales team by mid 2014. Our approach in Europe will be slightly different where we will look to involve the Ambezon [ph] sales team. A team that already has an excellent reputation with the hospital hematologist.","In closing as I hope you sense it is a very busy yet exciting time at Gilead as we roll out the next stages of commercial growth. I will now turn the call over to Norbert.","Norbert Bischofberger","","Thank you, Kevin. I am pleased with the rapid progress across all our R&D programs and the high level of productivity. A large number of development programs are mounting advance from IND through Phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical development. ","First an update on oncology. In September an NDA was submitted to ACA for Idelalisib for the treatment of double-refractory INHL. This application was supported by data from Study-10109, a single arm open label Phase 2 study of 125 patients who were refractory to both rituximab and alkylating agent chemotherapy. In this study Idelalisib achieved an overall response rate of 54% with a median duration of response of 11.9 months. The most common adverse event was diarrhea, transaminase elevations and neutropenia. The final analysis of this study will be presented at an upcoming conference.","In October Study-116 of Ielealisib was stopped early following a recommendation by an independent data and safety monitoring board. Study-116 is a randomized double drawing placebo controlled study in patients with previously treated recurrent CLL who require treatment but were not fit to receive cytotoxic therapy based on clinically important cormobidities. 80% of the patients were greater than 65 years of age and 44% had the 17p deletion or TP53 mutation.","220 patients were randomized one to one to rituximab plus idelalisib versus rituximab plus placebo. After reviewing data from a predefined interim analysis and independent data and safety monitoring board recommend that stopping to study early due to overwhelming evidence of efficacy together with appropriate considerations of safety.","Data from study 116 will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming scientific conference also. The data from this interim analysis of study 116 in CLL together with the data from study 119 in iNHL is included in the European market revitalization application which was filed just yesterday.","In the U.S., we have initiated discussions with FDA regarding a regulatory filing in CLL, either as a separate NDA or as a submission to the existing NDA. An extended access program of idelalisib for patient with the current CLL requiring treatment but who are not fit for chemotherapy as planned.","In addition, full Phase 3 studies in relapsed refractory iNHL and CLL patients are currently involving. The Phase 3 program evaluating momelotinib, our JAK1\/2 inhibitor myelofibrosis will be initiated into fourth quarter of 2013.","We are planning two randomized studies of momelotinib for registration. The first is an active control head-to-head study versus ruxolitinib in newly diagnosed patients requiring therapy. The second study is in patients who have failed ruxolitinib therapy because of its bone marrow suppression effects and will compare momelotinib with best available therapy. This study will start in the first quarter of 2014.","In addition to the rapid progress with idelalisib, Phase 2 studies are underway for GS-9820, a backup PI3K delta inhibitor and for GS-9973, our Syk inhibitor both along and in combination with Idelalisib in various piece of malignancies. A Phase 2 study of simtuzumab in pancreatic cancer was fully enrolled and studies in colorectal cancer and myelofibrosis are continuing to enroll. GS-5745, an entire MMP9 antibody is under evaluation on Phase 1\/2 studies in pancreatic and gastric cancers. We are looking forward to sharing the emerging data of all oncology studies as they become available.","Now turning to HIV. In October, Tybost which is also known as cobicistat received European Commission approval and elvitegravir received a positive CHMP opinion and we expect the European Commission accrual by the end of this year. In the U.S., a complete response letter was issued by FDA on cobicistat and elvitegravir in April and the resubmission is planned for the first half of 2014.","The two Phase 3 studies evaluating TAF, Gilead\u2019s novel prodrug of tenofovir are expected to be fully enrolled this month. These studies are identically designed evaluating Stribild to a single tablet regimen of elvitegravir, COBI, FTC and TAF abbreviated as ECF TAF in over 800 patients in each study in treating na\u00efve HIV infected patients. The primary endpoint in this study is at 48 weeks and we would expect that data available in the fourth quarter of 2014.","ECF TAF will also be evaluated in two additional Phase 3 studies. We\u2019ll study 117 in patients who are failing on their current regimen and who has not previously been treated with an integrase inhibitor and in study 119 in fully suppressed patients who are taking a multitablet b.i.d. regimen and who have previously failed at PI or NNRTI regimen. Both of these studies are currently ongoing. Along with E\/C\/F\/TAF, we plan to also submit a marketing authorization application for F TAF, which will be supported by a single bioequivalence study. The two phase 3 studies evaluating TAF has a single agent for the treatment of chronic hepatitis [indiscernible] negative patients are currently ongoing. ","And finally, as all of you are aware, we had a successful FDA advisory committee last week. The panel [ph] voted unanimously in favor of approval of sofosbuvir with ribavirin for the treatment of genotype 2 and 3 hepatitis C infected patients and approval of [indiscernible] course of sofosbuvir pegylated interferon with ribavirin for the treatment of genotype 1 and 4 hepatitis C infected patients. ","In addition, the majority of panel members were in favor of broadening the indication to improve genotype 1 treatment experienced patient in the label. [indiscernible] the use of sofosbuvir plus ribavirin in the pre-transplant setting quotations with ACC. At the advisory committee meeting, new data were presented from the VALENCE study which indicated that treatment-na\u00efve and treatment experience genotype 3 hepatitis C infected patient was so faster by providing with 24 weeks with SVR rate of 84%. ","We are naturally excited about bringing sofosbuvir to the market and we feel like panel members commented that this is a historic moment, for which every employee at Gilead is proud of. We look forward to working with FDA to complete the review of the sofosbuvir NDA and ultimately launch the product. ","Meanwhile the clinical development program of the sofosbuvir [indiscernible] dose combination is also proceeding rapidly. Three phase 3 studies IN-1, IN-2 and IN-3 explore the utility of the fixed dose combination both treatment, na\u00efve treatment experience genotype 1 hepatitis C infected patients, with and without ribavirin, therefore treatment durations of eight, 12 and 24 weeks, we anticipate having data from these studies that we have about towards the end of this year and into early next year as we are on track for NDA, MAA filings in the second quarter of 2014.","The development of sofosbuvir in combination with ribavirin for genotype 2 infected patients in Japan is progressing. The single-arm phase 3 study with 12 weeks treatment duration was fully enrolled in September and we are on track to submit the marketing application in Japan towards the middle of 2014. This is a significant opportunity as genotype 2 infected patients in Japan constitute over 25% of the total and sofosbuvir and ribavirin will be the first on oral interferon free option for these patients. ","In addition, the phase 3 program after fixed dose combination of sofosbuvir\/ledipasvir with and without ribavirin genotype 1 hepatitis C infected patients was initiated in September 2013 that we anticipate this study to be fully enrolled by the end of this year. This two-arm study in three [indiscernible] genotype 1 infected both treatment, na\u00efve treatment experienced patients, randomized to a 12-week course of the fixed dose combination with and without ribavirin.","Finally, the potentially pan-genotypic interferon and ribavirin free regimen, the combination of sofosbuvir [indiscernible] GS-5816 is advancing to phase 2 development, two studies in treatment na\u00efve and treatment experienced patients in various genotypes are fully enrolled, and depending on the emerging data, we should be in a position to initiate phase 3 studies in the second half of 2014.","More information on our programs will be presented at the annual AASLD meeting which will commence this week in Washington DC. Over 50 abstracts were submitted on Gilead's various liver disease programs and importantly, new data will be presented on the safety and efficacy of sofosbuvir,","Ribavirin in HIV core affected patient and in the post liver transplant setting.","In summary, very rapid progress has been made across all our therapeutic areas in all other programs. Our pipeline provides us with numerous opportunities with continued growth, both short-term and longer-term. We want to take this opportunity to thank all of our employees for their continued hard work and dedication.","So with that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.","Geoff Meacham - J.P. Morgan","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just on Hep C, looking at your market research, you guys have obviously done a lot of work ahead of the sofosbuvir launch. So, I want to know on the epidemiology side, what would you say are the biggest gaining factors that convert patients from diagnosed to the treated bucket? And then just a related question, when you think about the filing of sofosbuvir plus ledipasvir, what\u2019s the current thinking on which of the ION studies will go into that filing I know time is over yet? Thanks, guys.","Kevin Young","Hi, Geoff. It\u2019s Kevin. Thanks for the question. The one bucket that we are still working up and I think we are getting closed, but we are still sort of road testing is what we term as patients under treated cares. So those are patients who are diagnosed, are under the management so to say a hepatologist, astroenterologist or an infectious disease specialist. That bucket tends to move around a bit a lot more than what do a typical bucket of patients in HIV because patients are treated and obviously are cured. Some patients are treated and not cured and stay with these specialists and some are treated and drift if you like backing to that 1.7 of diagnosed but leave the specialist.","So, one of the reasons that we want to double check that number and wait a little while until we have a few more quarters is just to get back as collect as we can. We do think there is a good number of patients that are currently under care that we can access fairly quickly with the sales force that we put in place at the launch of sofosbuvir. Some of those are treatment-experienced and they are probably in most obvious bucket of patients and it was nice to see the remarks of the FDA advisory panel around the possibility of getting a label for the treatment experienced.","And some of them are treatment na\u00efve. So we do think, first and foremost, our focus will be with the specialist treated for the patients that they currently have in their practices that I know they would be recalling to go on sofosbuvir.","John Martin","Geoff, going through the other question, all three studies will go in the NDA. We feel they are all important. As you may remember, ION-1 is treatment-na\u00efve, ION-2 is treatment-experienced and ION-3 explores an eight week course of therapy, both with and without ribavirin.","We are fairly convinced that we will be able to repeat the Phase 2 results, which would mean that even the eight weeks duration will give you high response rates and that will be important information drives into legal. The rate limiting study by the way in my view is the 24-week arms of ION-1, as that will become available sometime early in 2014 as that determines the past to the NDA.","Geoff Meacham - J.P. Morgan","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI.","Mark Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group","","Thanks a lot guys. First I would just like to say congratulations to Kevin for a phenomenal launch of the next generation HIV drugs, some of those slides are really amazing, so good job. I know everyone has [indiscernible] but pretty cool stuff. I was just wondering on the slide you have that shows the 1.7 million patients in the U.S. that are diagnosed with hep-C, if you could let us know perhaps, how many of those you estimate are incarcerated and how many are in the VA and when you give guidance next year will the sales guidance include hep-C when you give that in January? Thank you.","Kevin Young","","Hey Mark, well first of all that was very decent of you to thank everybody here for our uptake of single tablet in HIV. I am lucky to work with some great people so they are doing a fine job and we got some nice data behind those products. In terms of the number of patients or people should I say, because I think it is more people with HCV. It is quoted that about 4% of the VA population, that is about 225,000 people, veterans, have hepatitis-C and I would say Mark that is probably a higher priority for us, the VA population than corrections. We have very good relationships with the VA and we feel that their model of accessing patients at the launch of Sofosbuvir as a single agent, it is probably easier and more straight forward than it is in the correctional setting. ","In the correctional setting I honestly don\u2019t know off the top of my head the total number of people that go through the correctional setting but the CDC have quoted that 35% of the prison population, up to 35%, has hepatitis-C. We will be addressing the correctional setting, as you know we do have a team for HIV today that address that population. But I have to say I do think it will be the Interferon-free regimen that will do better in the correctional setting. I don\u2019t think Interferon has ever done particularly well in the correctional setting because of the obvious side effects. So I think it is going to be Sofosbuvir lidisobir [ph] that will be an effective regimen for corrections.","Robin Washington","","Hi Mark, this is Robin, to answer your second question, it is hard at this point in time to give guidance about our guidance. We are hard at work on preparing for a successful launch so \u2013 I see that we are undecided yet relative to what granularity we give around guidance by product particularly in product launches at this point.","Mark Schoenebaum \u2013 ISI Group","Okay thanks.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Porges with Sanford Berstein.","Geoffrey Porges \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","","Hi, Kevin just to followup on the ACV question, could you talk us to -- clearly when everyone\u2019s signaled there\u2019s potentially a huge demand for particularly the ribavirin sofosbuvir based regimens and also single tablet regimes later, what are you hearing from payers both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. about how they are going to triage patients and what if any restrictions might be imposed, is it going to be enough to just show up to a physician in France and say I have got HCV, treat me, or to a physician in the U.S. and say I would like treatment, or is there going to be some triaging of patients depending upon fibrosis or anything else. That would be helpful for us to understand and thanks.","Kevin Young","","Thanks for the question Geoff. That is a really broad question, let me try and go through a sequence here. Let me deal with the U.S. first. We have had a lot of discussion with U.S. payers. They certainly have HCV on their radar but I am encouraged from our conversations that they will reimburse well for Sofosbuvir and of course the broader the label the better. Again I was encouraged with the tone of the advisory committee that we could come out after our further discussions with a good broad label and that would help us with U.S. players. There will always be a prior authorization that a patient has to go through and the physician in the office have to go through before starting an HCV treatment. But generally is a check that the drug is being used on label. So we think that will be fairly straightforward and most of the hepatologist and gastroenterologist who currently prescribe an HCV are used to that step. So I think we are encouraged that we will have a very good coverage in United States.","In Europe, of course, it\u2019s a country by country pricing and reimbursements process. Depends on the country, the earlier markets, typically the U.K. and Germany, the later markets of the southern European markets.","We do think that in certain categories and I really highlight the liver transplant area that we may get some exceptional coverage between the European Commission approval and the normal timelines of pricing and reimbursement, and that\u2019s true just because of the absolute unmet need. We also hope that the pricing -- the normal pricing and reimbursement process will go a little bit quicker for a drug as innovative as Sofosbuvir.","Basically early next year we will be submitting our dossiers to bodies like NICE, AMNOG, the transparency committee in France, so we are all geared up and we think we have some good data that really shows exceptional cost benefit for Sofosbuvir. So, a long answer but I hope that gives you some sort of color.","Geoffrey Porges \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rachel McMinn with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Rachel McMinn - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Yeah. I guess also had a question for Kevin but one for Norbert as well. I just, for genotype 2 and 3 patients in the U.S., maybe you can just give us a little bit more sense, a lot of genotype 1 patients will wait for the fixed oral dosage pill but genotype 3 there was -- 2 and 3 there is a lot of visibility perhaps that maybe, they would be less inclined to wait, but I just wanted to get your thoughts on how to think about that population for 2014?","And then, Norbert, on 5816, do you actually have some on treatment or SVR results now and I just wanted to take your temperature on that program. Thanks.","Kevin Young","Hi, Rachel. It\u2019s Kevin. We do think that the 2s and 3s will be taken up pretty quickly. If you look at the table on slide 28, you have got about 20% of the U.S. population is, of HCV population in genotype 2 and 3. So we think that\u2019s the most obvious patient category because you haven\u2019t got Interferon.","I think in terms of how a treating position will move through those 2 and 3 patients. Of course, it will be the ones with advanced liver disease or perhaps that even failed previously on an Interferon-based therapy. But, it is, I think, the obvious group of patients to be getting on and treating right from launch.","Norbert Bischofberger","Yeah. So Rachel with regards to clinical data we do have some emerging data, so that the toughest test for 5816 in genotype 3 that is simply based on neurology data. We do have some emerging data in the treatment na\u00efve genotype 3 population that looks promising but what we have to wait for and that\u2019s the rate in the established genotype 3 treatment experience we will get those data sometime in the February, March timeframe of next year. So only then would we really make the decision to go into a more advanced Phase 3 program, if we take the genotype 3 treatment experienced population.","Rachel McMinn - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi. Please proceed.","Yaron Werber - Citi","Yeah. Hi and I got to tell you also really congratulations and if you look where you were two years ago and where you are now. I mean, it\u2019s absolutely incredible, so congrats on a really terrific job, really everything, hep C, HIV and oncology. So, I have two questions and both of them are obviously you would imagine hep C? First one just, one of things, you guys asked for is sofosbuvir label that is very broad. That covers the treatment of hepatitis C with other oral \u2013 other drugs broadly. And I just wanted to get your sense as to \u2013 it looks like FDA was very supportive overall but then really necessarily comment that they sort of made some remarks. What\u2019s your thoughts on the ability to get that label?","And then secondly, when \u2013 in 5816, you\u2019re actually going an eight-week arm now for genotype 3. So it sounds like you guys have a lot of confidence in genotype 3. So I am just trying to get a sense what do you know on ledipasvir and sofosbuvir. It sounds like you already know something about 5816 but what do you know about ledipasvir, sofosbuvir?","Norbert Bischofberger","The first question you asked about the change that we get that broad label that was described in the Anti-Viral Advisory Committee Meeting at the beginning and I am not sure whether you listened to the day before to the tenofovir [ph] deliberations, Jeff Murry made a comment along the lines they said, they don\u2019t want to do that right now. They have been surprised in the past about different regimen having different response rates. They would like to get some more experience to figure out which specific combination works and which ones should you rather stay away from. So they indicated they will not table at this point to give us a broad indication to just see with other agents. [indiscernible] dossier that we have not either really in-depth conversation with the FDA about this. That will happen now as the advisory committee meeting is over. ","And the other question was \u2013 what we do know about 5816 is that it works in genotype 3 treatment na\u00efve patients. As I said, we need a genotype 3 treatment experienced and then as you very astutely observe, the alternative \u2013 study to look at eight weeks of therapy. And again, it would be the same thought process that we initiate the phase 3 program, we might actually do the phase 3 program 8-weeks treatment in genotype \u2013 in all genotypes treatment na\u00efve and maybe 12 weeks of treatment in treatment experienced. But again it all depends on how the phase 2 data emerge. At least we will be in a position next year to make an informed and intelligent decision as to what the phase 3 program is going to look like based on these two data.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with Wells Fargo.","Brian Abrahams \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","So it sounds like 12-weeks for genotypes 1 and 2 and 24 weeks for genotypes 3, were the durations that the panelists in the FDA are leaning towards based on all the data? Now that there is a little bit more concrete, I am just wondering, how does that shape your pricing strategy in terms of balancing the three genotypes next year and also anticipating the overall combo coming on in 2015?","Kevin Young","Hey Brian, it\u2019s Kevin. Thanks again for the nice words. We are very close now, Brian, only six weeks to PDUFA date. So not lock away, and so we set our price at launch. So I can\u2019t go into really great detail today. The one comment I would make is that there is only 9% of the U.S. population \u2013 HCV population that are GT3. So whilst those patients look like they are going to be given a label for 12-24 weeks and you can say well, it\u2019s not going to have profound effects on your pricing strategy. There is not only small number of patients there. ","So I wouldn\u2019t say that the advisory committee has had a major influence on our continued thinking and finalization of our pricing. So I hope that\u2019s helpful.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Roden with UBS.","Matthew Roden \u2013 UBS Securities","And Kevin, these data points on hep C are great. I guess I just wanted to ask a little bit more \u2013 if you could speak a little bit more about the methodology here. Is it fair to say that you wouldn\u2019t have put these numbers out if there wasn\u2019t a fairly high level conviction in these estimates. And then just drilling down on that a little bit more, do you have a sense of what the proportion is among the diagnosed, who have evidence of advanced liver disease? It seems to me that those would be the more urgent need to treat patients that might be tackled more in the near term than long term? Thanks.","John Martin","Yeah, just to give a little bit background of how we are trying to develop this math. We\u2019re going down the road of the patient database like we\u2019ve done with Synovate. Synovate became Ipsos. Ipsos is the people that we are working with once again. It takes a long time to develop robust samples.","I have to tell you that whilst we are getting more confident with hepatitis C, the sampling is far lower both in terms of the physician universe as well as the number of charts that we get through for HIV. We have 10 years of developing that database and we\u2019re really on sort of year one of getting this off the ground at Gilead.","So, I think we\u2019re getting more confidence. As I said earlier, one of the reasons that we\u2019re still not sharing fully that bucket that sits with the specialist, so the patients that are diagnosed that sit with specialist treaters is that we just want one or two more quarters to make sure that it is reproducible, but I think we are getting more comfortable.","In terms of treatment-experienced, I think there is something in the range of about 80 to 100,000 patients that are treatment experienced today and they sit between that 1.7 -- they sit within the 1.7 diagnosed, but somewhat lower number that the sort of lower end of the spectrum, about 80,000 and probably in and around the specialist office. So that\u2019s our directional sense today.","Matthew Roden \u2013 UBS Securities","Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets","Hey, thanks. Congrats as well. Question on Slide 31, I thought that was quite interesting with your break out of the distribution channels. Do you have any sense of the size, relative size of the buckets there, particularly VA and prisons and how price sensitive those buckets maybe, do you have to get contracts there, how does that really work in the relative size amongst those four? Thanks.","Kevin Young","Hi, Michael. It\u2019s Kevin, great question. By far the majority of sofosbuvir will go through the first two blocks there, specialty pharmacy. Specialty pharmacy play an important role and have done since the launch of the PIs in supporting the hepatologists and gastroenterologists. So the majority will go through specialty pharmacy and through other retail change like the large retailers, Walgreens, CVS. So by far, they are bigger, much smaller level will be VA and prisons.","Typically with some like the VA, we do go through a contracting process for supply. We feel that we\u2019ve got a very strong value proposition with sofosbuvir. And we would be looking to have a very constructive conversation once we bring it for listing on their National Formulary. So we think, we can maintain close to our retail pricing that will be in the first two buckets.","The one obvious thing that\u2019s different with sofosbuvir than HIV is obviously that we don\u2019t have the large ADAP buckets that has lower pricing that we have in the HIV world. So our expectation is that very little, if any, will move through the ADAP channel for hepatitis C.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets","But do you think VA\u2019s like 5% or 10 % or bigger than that?","Kevin Young","I think it\u2019s in that ballpark, the one you quoted at 5% to 10%. It\u2019s quite small.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Okay. Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, first, just a follow-up, so for Ion [ph] 3 eight weeks will you have that data, do you have it in-house and will you have that data before you launch, do you know how to price the drug, and how are you thinking about releasing it? Would you release it with the full Ion [ph] data set, and then just to clarify 5816, you talked about how you might think about developing it for genotype 3s and maybe shortening duration of therapy for these other patients, but how do you view it for genotype 1s, is it more of a life cycle management with better safety without riva, how are you thinking about it.","","Norbert Bischofberger","","Well so Robyn you asked about availability of data from Ion [ph] 3, we don\u2019t have those data now but as soon as we have the SVR 12 so the regulatory end point we intend to do our price release on that which would give you top line results. That data will go into the NDA filing unless it\u2019s completely negative which I would find hard to believe because we have done the Phase 2 study as you know. The second question of how we view 5816, it really I think everything else its hoped the profile holds up with continued clinical development and in Phase 3 the fixed dose combination of Sofosbuvir and 5816 would really replace the fixed dose combinations of Sofosbuvir and ledipasvir. It would be the pan-genotypic, interferon-free ribavirin-free single pill for everybody where you don\u2019t have to worry about which genotype and what history and what resistance mutation we have. That is how we are looking at the 5815 Sofosbuvir fixed dose combination. ","By the way that is also the reason why we are testing it specifically in the fairly large Phase 3 study in genotype 3 with experienced patients. We have absolutely no concerns that it works in genotype 1, that is a given but the question we have with genotype 3 treatment experience. If it passes that test then I think we have a [indiscernible] Interferon ribavirin free maybe eight weeks but certainly 12 weeks treatment duration regimen for everybody.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank","Great thanks, and just to clarify the question on Ion was really more about eight weeks, you have eight weeks in-house and will you have the eight week data before you launch the product.","Norbert Bischofberger","","So Robyn the way we do this operation, we don\u2019t look internally look at data after they become available. Once everybody has the last patient last visit which is obviously the twelve week duration [indiscernible] time when we actually would clean up the data base [indiscernible] and the [indiscernible] and that has not happened yet.","John Milligan","","Hey Robyn, its John Milligan. I think the confusion here is what do you mean by the product. I assume you mean will we have the eight weeks data in house before we launch Sofosbuvir and the answer is we will not so we will be extrapolating. We are going to be extrapolating from the Phase 2 data as a way to gauge what the pricing will be as we launch Sofosbuvir assuming that we will have a similar outcome from Phase 2.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank","Got it, great, that is very clear. Thank you so much.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen & Company. Please proceed.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Company","","Thanks for taking my question. One, Norbert, for you, we are obviously going to see ION 1, 2 and 3 over the next several months. Our sense of expectations for those data are that they are going to marginally replicate what we saw on Phase 2, so in treatment na\u00efve patients SVR rates of at least 90 %, possibly approaching 100% and in treatment experienced patients SVR rates at probably 80% or higher, do those expectations jive with you yourself are expecting or is there anything about the treatment designs, the trial designs here, the patient populations that we should keep in mind as we await these data sets that kind of modulate what SVR rates we should anticipate.","Norbert Bischofberger","","So Phil you are exactly right that is our internal expectation that we would replicate the Phase 2 data. There is no reason to believe why we wouldn\u2019t. It is larger patient numbers. You know you always lose a few more if you have more [indiscernible] and maybe a few more lost to followup but I am very convinced with a 90% or higher response rate. And you know what I said before about the eight week study in Lonestar, even though the numbers were not large, about 25, what they absolutely do is they validate and give you a lot of confidence in the 12 week results. That is why we are very confident that we saw 95% or 100% response rates with eight weeks of treatment in Phase 2. That\u2019s why I\u2019m confident towards the 95% to 100% response rate in Phase 3 with 12 weeks treatment duration.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Company","Okay. And then, just one last question on treatment duration, I believe, I still think there's going to be a study out of, I think it's the NIH that's looking at a six-week regimen where the data were intriguing. Can you talk about the data and how you put that in context, when you look towards moving, even beyond the next generation of regimens? Is this something that you will begin to push the duration down to six weeks?","Norbert Bischofberger","So Brian, this is our thinking. So as you know, we have continuously reduced treatment duration, we were actually surprised ourselves. It went from 24 weeks to 12 weeks, to eight weeks. And there's a presentation at the ASO that talks about six-weeks and what that presentation would indicate that six weeks with two drugs is not enough.","So we're now asking the next question, if you add a third drug to a six-week sofosbuvir\/ledipasvir, will the response rate again go up to 90% to 100%. That's kind of the experiment that you will hear about that data at ASO. And if that is indeed the case then we have to a make a decision internally, if that's something we want to pursue because you always have to challenge another drug. It's always more complicated.","There is always more drug interactions. There may be more safety issues, and what you gain is maybe two weeks of treatment duration. Maybe Kevin, wants to comment on it too.","Kevin Young","Yes. Just to chip in with a commercial angle here. I think if you move from three months to two months, that's clearly a step change and an advantage. I think going from eight weeks to six weeks doesn't really give you that much more and two months. If it turns out that way, is a very nice set, sort of regimen to deliver to a patient. I don't think carving off an extra two weeks is that big a differentiator when it comes to the commercial profile of the products?","Norbert Bischofberger","Brian, having that said, that's something we are still debating internally. So we haven't really come to a final conclusion yet.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Company","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Skorney with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.","Brian Skorney - Robert W. Baird","Hi. Good afternoon guys. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. Really two quick ones, first just in terms of the ION-2 dataset, my understanding is open label. I\u2019m just wondering are you guys blinded to the data as it is coming in because theoretically you probably have at least the SVRs for the 12 weeks at this point. And also would you release the 12-week data when it was in hand or would you wait for the full 12 and 24 weeks?","Norbert Bischofberger","Yes. So Brian, we actually internally do not locate the emerging data. We wait for the whole study to be done because you have to be really careful with Phase 3 and what we will never do is by looking at the data you could always be accused or viewed as influencing the ongoing conduct of the study. And if you were to make available SVR4 data from the 12 week ARM that would undoubtedly influence the 24 weeks ARM in the studies and you don\u2019t want to do that. So we internally will wait for the whole study to be done. The last patient after last visit and then we look at the data.","Brian Skorney - Robert W. Baird","Got you. And just really quick on oncology, I noticed you have GS-9820 a next gen delta PI3 kinase inhibitor, I was just wondering, if you could kind of highlight the differentiation between idelalisib and 9820 in terms of what you think this might a better version of that? I know some of the competition, are developing a PI3K delta inhibitors, talk about potentially circumventing the DLTs in particular are levered off. Do you think that's the target?","Norbert Bischofberger","","Yes. Brian, really good question. That\u2019s exactly it. We\u2019re looking at 9820 or something that has the same efficacy characteristic as idelalisib without the liver toxicity because liver toxicity we belief is compound specific. It does not mechanism or anything else related and so by making different analogs, we have convinced we can come up with PI3K delta inhibitor that don\u2019t have DLTs elevation and only clinical data we haven\u2019t dose enough patients yet with indicators that we have to this day not seen [indiscernible] elevations with 9820.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Howard Liang with Leerink Swann.","Howard Liang - Leerink Swann","Regarding the liver transplant opportunity, do you see Sofosbuvir use in pre-transplant HCV patient outside HCV, and in post transplantation? And a related, Kevin mentioned there might be exceptional coverage in the EU for liver transplant prior to reimbursement, can you explain how that works?","Kevin Young","I think if your question for U.S. is, do you have expectation of extensive uptick for liver transplant patient with HCV who is on the wait list then, we think there are probably in the US between 5000 and 6000 patients on the wait list for a transplant. We think yes \u2013 we think those patients are very obese patients to be treated, you need to clear they are HCV pre the transplant. So it will be subject to approval in our label, it will be on obese patient group for us. We know the specialists hepatologists who support the transplant program, we know a lot of the transplant surgeons as well. So we would direct some very specialists educational efforts to this group of patients.","Mentioning these scenes that are available in Europe, I did mention a good example in my script. And that\u2019s called the French ETU translated that really means temporary authorization for use. It\u2019s something that is granted by the French regulatory authorities. I think it\u2019s a very noble thing where they will cover and allow the prescribing of pharmaceutical pre-European approval where there is profound unmet need. And so we have started to supply Sofosbuvir under that designation in France that was about \u2013 it started about a week ago, and that\u2019s called pre and post liver transplant setting. So that\u2019s a good example.","It varies from country to country but there are schemes not quite expensive as the French ETU but there are special categories that allow for getting the drug out there, typically after the European Commission approval, but before pricing and reimbursement where normally for pharmaceutical there would be no uptick at all.","Norbert Bischofberger","Howard, I would like to add, as you saw at the advisory committee meeting that the FDA is currently thinking of limiting the indication to the actual population studied which was HCC patients that fit the Milan criteria but you might also look at the ASLD abstract, we have a very exciting presentation on post liver transplant where we actually saw very respectable SVR rates, the fact [ph] that I have learned. So whatever label we end up with we will soon after approval file a SNDA and you get those additional data in the Milan [ph] broadened indication. ","HCC patients that are on the transplant list that fit the criteria about one in five of the transplant. So it\u2019s not insignificant but it could be larger.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nick Abbott with BMO Capital Markets.","Nick Abbott - BMO Capital Markets","I would like to follow up on that theme of pricing in genotype question [ph]. First, can you tell me what the breakdown of genotype is with HCC? And secondly, knowing that fibrosis in HCC is higher for genotype 3 than genotypes in your data genotype 3 prevalence in EU Big 5 \u2013 for the Big 5 20% to 40%. Do you have pharmacoeconomic dossiers for EU detail, HCC risk per genotype, which presumably presumably helps adjust higher price for genotype 3 in the longer duration? Thanks.","John Martin","So, Nick, you are right. We got some interesting country effects in Europe, where a lot more a genotype 3. Good example is the U.K., where some of the populations that were, immigrant populations either first generation or second generation and a large population in and around London have genotype 3.","We\u2019ve done pharmacoeconomic analysis on all our patient populations, both in na\u00efve setting and the advanced erotic settings. So there will be all part of the dossiers that we will be supplying to the pricing and reimbursement bodies, particularly na\u00efve and AMNOG\/IQWiG in Germany.","So we feel that we\u2019ve just like Norbert\u2019s done in treating a broad array of HCV populations. We felt it necessary to do the same from the pharmacoeconomic point of view, so again, hopefully supporting a good broad array of patients.","Again, I would just say, Nick, we are quite close to the launch of the product. Here, I am hopefully, first quarter in Europe, so I just hold back on any further comments on pricing.","Operator","Okay. Mr. O'Brien, we have time for one more question. Your question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs","Hi. Thanks for taking me in here. Just two for me. I was just wondering in terms of the diagnosis rate, peak diagnosis rate that we might think about in the U.S. I was wondering France and Japan maybe are suitable proxies as we look at some of the data you guys have?","And then, Robin, I was wondering on capital allocation, if you can give us any update in terms of what you guys are thinking, now you brought leverage ratio down and we are approaching end of the year? Thanks a lot.","Kevin Young","Hi, Terence. This is Kevin. Great question. I don\u2019t think that the U.S. will get to the level of France or the really high level of Japan. I certainly think it would take quite some years to get there. I think what really triggered the situation, first and foremost in Japan and then, fairly similarly in France was of course there was a lot of publicity, there was a lot of, I would say, it goes as far as saying sort of scandal around the infection of individuals through blood transfusion.","So I think it became very political and it force government to go on the front foot in terms of proactive measures in terms of screening of patients. So that\u2019s why you see very, very high levels in Japan and above 50% actually in France.","So they were so politicized. They were so high profile. The population it was on -- in newspapers, on television and I think that drove that very high diagnosis rate. We feel that -- we feel it certainly can go higher in the U.S. I am not sure whether it will ever get to the level certainly Japan.","Robin Washington","And Terence to your second question, I mean, overall, our capital framework remains the same. We are focused on ensuring that we have the financial flexibility to invest in the business may come necessary M&A decisions and return value to shareholders. As you can see, we did start our share repurchases back this quarter and expect that to continue to accelerate in Q4 and beyond in 2014.","John Martin","Well, thank you, [Erica], and thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead and the team. We look forward to providing you with updates on future progress and earnings. We will look forward to calling some of you back after the call and thanks again.","Operator","Thank you for your participation on today\u2019s conference. This concludes the presentation. Everyone may now disconnect and have a great day."],"10247":["Gilead Sciences, Inc.

My name is Jonathan and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Sung Lee, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Sung Lee","Thank you, Jonathan, and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market closed today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the first quarter 2019. The press release and detailed slides are available on the Investor Relations section of the Gilead website.","The speakers on today's call today will be; Daniel O'Day, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Laura Hamill, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Commercial Operations; and John McHutchison, Chief Scientific Officer and Head of Research and Development.","Before we begin with our prepared comments, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, financial projections and the use of capital, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements.","A description of these risks can be found in our latest SEC disclosure documents and recent press releases. In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release as well as on the Gilead website.","I will now turn the call over to Dan.","Daniel O'Day","Thank you, Sung, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm really pleased to join all of you today for my first earnings call at Gilead. Rob and Laura and John will take you through the key highlights of the quarter, but I'd like to share and start by sharing some of the perspectives that I gained since arriving here in March.","As many of you know when I made the decision to join Gilead, I was drawn to the potential that I saw to build on the legacy of transforming care for people with serious illnesses in a company that has a deep commitment to patients and science. I now had a chance to see the extent of that potential up close.","Let me share some of what I've observed, the areas that I focused on up until now and a few thoughts on what you can expect next. The first thing, I'll say is that it's been really exciting to see the scientific strength from the perspective of being inside the company. I've taken part in a series of deep dives into the R&D programs in each of our therapeutic areas. This includes spending time at KITE to dig into our work in cell therapy.","I'm excited about the progress that we're making in inflammation and with the results of FINCH 1 and FINCH 3 are the studies that were announced at the end of March. John will walk you through the detailed study results later in this call, but I just want to express my enthusiasm for this work, as we mobilized the organization for the launch of filgotinib, a medicine that will be a significant step forward for patients with rheumatoid arthritis.","Inflammation is one of the three emerging areas for us and we anticipate that filgotinib will be an important future growth driver. As I deepen my understanding of Gilead's therapeutic areas, I've had the pleasure of participating in two scientific congresses, beginning with CROI or at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections. And here I had the opportunity to watch as we shared the promising results from the DISCOVER study of Descovy for PrEP.","More recently I attended the International Liver Congress in Vienna where we presented data from across our liver disease programs and had the chance at both of these conferences to meet with key thought leaders and get their perspectives on our R&D programs.","During my first two months, I've also begun to get to know our shareholders and to understand their perspectives. These conversations have helped me understand the external view of Gilead and this feedback will help inform the decisions then I make to shape the organization and position Gilead for the future. As I've settled into my new role, I've been greatly impressed with the people at Gilead and the extent of talent across the organization.","I spent a lot of time talking to groups and individuals and it's great to meet so many really smart passionate and thoughtful people. So when I close my portion of the call by sharing with you a little bit about what you can expect from me and when. In terms of immediate priorities, broadly speaking, I'm looking first to three key areas: Number one, strengthening the pipeline, both internal programs and corporate development opportunities. Number two, is ensuring optimal commercial delivery both on our current medicines and those that were getting ready to launch. And number three the organizational piece ensuring that we have the right people in the right roles and that they are well equipped for success.","I want to make sure we tap into the talent at all levels of the company. In my early days one area of pressing need has been working to better understand the work we're doing at KITE, identifying what it needs for short- and long-term success in cell therapy. I wanted to take some swift decisions here. And at the end of March we announced internally that KITE would become a separate business unit. We've initiated a search for a CEO of KITE. And once appointed that individual reports to me and will have full accountability for all aspects of cell therapy.","I believe that providing KITE with this degree of autonomy will foster agility, innovation and entrepreneurialism. Cell therapy is a critical piece of the puzzle with regards to the long-term future of oncology and a critical element of Gilead's long-term strategy helping us to build on a legacy of transformational medicines. Between now and the end of the year, I will also have a series of meetings with the leadership team and the Board to shape our long-term strategy and vision for the future of Gilead.","I anticipate that later this year I'll be in a position to begin sharing more with all of you. Finally, I'd like to thank all the people who have contributed to the excellent progress my colleagues will outline today, Gilead's 11,000 employees, our partners, the scientific community and the patients who take part in our clinical trials. I'm excited to see what we can achieve together in the months and years ahead. Before I turn the call over to Robin, I would like to acknowledge the news we shared earlier this week regarding her retirement from her role as CFO. Over the past two months, I've come to know Robin as an exceptional and talented leader. This is a transition that I know she has contemplated for some time and while I had hoped to have the opportunity to work with her for longer she has my full support.","I'm grateful to Robin for agreeing to stay at Gilead through March 1, 2020 to see us through the completion of the reporting of the company's 2019 financial results. Thank you, Robin for your leadership through this period and over the past 11 years.","I'll now turn the call over to you.","Robin Washington","Thank you, Dan, and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased to share our financial results for the first quarter of 2019. Total revenues for the first quarter were $5.3 billion with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.76. This compares to revenues of $5.1 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.48 for the same period last year.","Turning to product sales. Product sales for the first quarter were $5.2 billion, up 4% year-over-year and down 8% sequentially. This is the first quarter in the past three years where the company has posted year-over-year growth and it reinforces our belief that the company can grow product sales year-over-year on a full year basis.","In the U.S., product sales for the first quarter were $3.8 billion, up 8% year-over-year and down 15% sequentially. The sequential decline was primarily due to the anticipated inventory drawdown associated with our HIV products reflective of the seasonal inventory pattern from the fourth quarter to the first quarter.","As expected, our HIV payer mix moved more toward public payers, which also contributed to the sequential decline. Combined inventory and payer mix contributed an estimated $400 million to the sequential decline.","Turning to Europe. Product sales for the first quarter were $882 million, down 12% year-over-year and up 8% sequentially. Sequentially, the increase was due to an unfavorable accounting adjustment related to statutory revenue callback reserves recorded in Q4.","Without these Q4 adjustments product sales would have been flat. On a year-over-year basis, the decline was driven by lower HCV sales due to lower patient starts and competitive dynamics and the broader availability of generic HIV products in 2019.","Now turning to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $871 million for the first quarter, up 7% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to higher investments to support our cell therapy programs. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $962 million for the first quarter, up 9% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to higher promotional expenses in the U.S. and expenses associated with expansion of Gilead's products in Europe and Japan.","Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the first quarter was 16.7% compared to 22.8% in the same period last year due to a $0.09 per share favorable tax settlement. Note that this settlement was reflected in the full year 2019 non-GAAP effective tax rate guidance of 20% to 21% as previously provided.","Moving to the balance sheet. During the first quarter, we generated $1.4 billion in cash from operations and ended the quarter with $30.1 billion in cash and investments. We repaid $750 million of debt borrowed in connection with our acquisition of KITE. We paid cash dividends of $817 million and we repurchased 12 million shares of stock for $834 million.","As a reminder, the majority of our stock compensation awards are issued in the first quarter. 2019 is progressing consistent with our expectations as we enter the second quarter of our fiscal year and we are reiterating our full year guidance, which can be found on slide 18 in the earnings results presentation.","As we mentioned in the previous earnings call, our SG&A guidance included funding to support commercial launch activities for NASH. Given the results of stellar Phase III studies, SG&A funding for these activities will not be utilized in 2019. We do believe there may be opportunities to enhance launch readiness for filgotinib that we are monitoring.","As such we will revisit SG&A and our other guidance assumptions midyear and provide you with an update during our Q2 call. We remain committed to vigilant expense management and ensuring that we retain industry-leading operating margins.","I will now turn the call over to Laura.","Laura Hamill","Thank you, Robin. Good afternoon everyone. I will provide an update on our commercial performance during the first quarter and share highlights from markets around the world. Beginning with HIV. We continue to see double-digit revenue growth on a year-over-year basis led by uptake of our Descovy-based regimen and growing use of Truvada for PrEP.","In the U.S. HIV revenue was $2.8 billion in the first quarter, up 19% year-over-year and down 17% quarter-over-quarter. As Robin noted, the sequential change reflects the anticipated inventory drawdown and payer mix in the first quarter. This trend is a typical pattern that we see between Q1 and the preceding Q4.","Underlying prescription demand remains robust growing 12% year-over-year. We continue to see excellent adoption of Biktarvy. It is become the top-selling product in the U.S. and generated $739 million in revenue. It remains the number one prescribed regimen in both treatment-na\u00efve and switch patients. Approximately 80% of Biktarvy's U.S. prescriptions come from switches, with about 25% coming from Genvoya and 25% coming from dolutegravir-based regimens. Overall, Descovy-based regimens continue to gain share and now account for approximately 80% of Gilead's total U.S. treatment prescription volume.","In Europe, total HIV revenue was $569 million in the first quarter, down 7% year-over-year and up 11% quarter-over-quarter. The year-over-year decline was driven by the broad availability of generic versions of Truvada across the EU. The decline however is moderating, as we continue to see rapid uptake of our Descovy-based products, which now account for almost 80% of our total HIV revenue in Europe in the first quarter.","Biktarvy is now available in Germany, France and Spain. We anticipate launching in the U.K. and Italy mid-year. We are encouraged by the strong uptake of Biktarvy across all markets where we have launched. In 2018, we launched Biktarvy in Germany in June and France in November. In both markets, Biktarvy has quickly become the number one regimen for na\u00efve and switch patients.","As you will recall, in Japan, we acquired rights to certain products from our HIV franchise from our marketing partner Japan Tobacco at the beginning of the year. We subsequently received approval for Biktarvy in March and launched earlier this quarter.","Now moving to prevention. Use of Truvada for PrEP continues to grow in the United States. As we work to educate at-risk individuals and treating physicians, we estimate more than 200,000 people were taking Truvada for PrEP at the end of Q1. These estimates reflect an external industry-wide restatement from IQVIA, a source that we use to quantify Truvada for PrEP use.","On a like-for-like basis, we saw 28% year-over-year growth. We were also very pleased to see the outstanding results from the DISCOVER trial presented at CROI. If approved we believe Descovy for PrEP will bring a meaningful benefit to at-risk individuals where we have been seeing increase in persistency of use.","Now turning to HCV. U.S. product sales for the first quarter were $393 million, down 33% year-over-year and down 4% quarter-over-quarter. The year-over-year U.S. decline was primarily driven to competitive dynamics, including an alignment of the Medicare and commercial pricing at the start of 2019 and lower patient starts.","Sequentially revenue in Q1 were positively impacted by the timing of Department of Corrections order, which was originally anticipated later in the year. Over the full year, HCV revenue expectations for 2019 remain unchanged. Revenue for our HCV generics sold by our separate subsidiary at Asegua Therapeutics is in line with our expectations.","Sales in the first quarter included some wholesaler inventory stocking. Asegua is continuing negotiations with payers and as we previously communicated we anticipate Asegua launch will continue to gain momentum in the second half of 2019.","In Europe, HCV product sales for the first quarter were $203 million, down 25% from the prior year, due to declining patient starts and 8% quarter-over-quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily due to Q4 accounting adjustment that Robin mentioned earlier.","We are continuing to see favorable share trends, particularly with Epclusa in France, Spain and U.K. We launched Epclusa in Japan in late February and we believe this has the potential to bring meaningful benefit to patients with HCV.","Now turning to Yescarta. The commercial performance continues to meet our expectations of a steady adoption. Worldwide sales were $93 million during the first quarter, up 90% quarter-over-quarter. Since launch more than 1,500 patients have been treated with Yescarta, including patients for commercial market and clinical trials. This is an important milestone for our cell therapy business.","In the U.S., hospitals continue to learn how to operationalize CAR T therapy and physician awareness of Yescarta's data continues to improve. Our efforts remain focused on educating providers about the profile of Yescarta, working with centers on operational setup and engaging with community oncologists to identify patients for whom Yescarta is appropriate. We're beginning to see benefits of all of these efforts.","Additionally, we continue to engage with Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, and other stakeholders, as we work to improve Medicare reimbursement and access. Last week, CMS released the 2020 proposed rule for Medicare inpatient perspective payment, which contains an increase and the new technology add-on payment.","The proposal is currently open for public comment through the end of June. This is a positive step. And while we believe more needs to be done, we are very encouraged by the progress. In Europe, we are focused on getting site certified. It's early days for Yescarta in Europe, but we have already achieved reimbursement in countries such as Germany, France and U.K. Across Europe, we are continuing to build awareness about the therapy.","Finally, I'd like to acknowledge the strong closing performance of our cardiopulmonary team, as we lost exclusivity for Ranexa and Letairis. Letairis and Ranexa revenue totaled $352 million for the quarter. As expected, we saw generic versions of Ranexa enter the market during the quarter, leading to a drop in revenue.","We anticipated generic competition for Letairis during the second quarter, as FDA approved the single-shared REMS in March. The year is off to a great start. I'd like to thank the teams around the world for their incredible effort. With a continued focus on our expanding portfolio of products we are making wonderful progress.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to John.","John McHutchison ","Thank you Laura, and thank you everyone for joining us today. Let me start by saying that this has been another important quarter for the R&D part of our organization, and I remain excited about our ongoing program. So far this year, we have had five Phase 3 registrational clinical trials readout. I will spend some time discussing these studies and then cover other progress we are making across our pipeline.","In March, we announced additional positive results from our FINCH program in rheumatoid arthritis. FINCH 1 and FINCH 3 Phase 3 studies of our selective JAK1 inhibitor filgotinib in adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis each met their respective primary endpoint. Taken together with the FINCH 2 data reported last year, the three FINCH datasets support the potential of filgotinib as an important treatment option across the broad range of patient populations with rheumatoid arthritis.","FINCH 3 evaluated filgotinib in combination with methotrexate and as monotherapy in methotrexate-na\u00efve patients. Filgotinib is generally well tolerated and met the study's primary endpoint in terms of the proportion of patients achieving an ACR20 response at week 24 of treatment.","In addition, the proportion of patients achieving the primary endpoint was significantly higher for filgotinib 200 milligrams plus methotrexate and filgotinib 100 milligrams plus methotrexate compared with methotrexate alone. Key secondary endpoint, specifically ACR50 and ACR70 or deeper responses and clinical remission rates at week 24 were also significantly higher with filgotinib plus methotrexate compared with patients receiving methotrexate alone.","Now the FINCH 1 trial evaluated filgotinib compared to adalimumab or placebo on a stable background dose of methotrexate in patients with the prior inadequate response to methotrexate. The safety profile of filgotinib was also consistent with previously reported results. And the study also achieved its primary endpoint for both doses of filgotinib in terms of the proportion of patients achieving an ACR20 response compared to placebo at week 12.","Similar to results seen through at our FINCH program, FINCH 1 ACR50 and ACR70 deeper responses were also significantly greater for filgotinib compared with placebo at week 12 for both doses. Across the three FINCH trials, we have therefore observed, deep, consistent similar to or -- responses similar to or higher than other JAK inhibitors and other approved biologic agents.","Given the high proportion of patients achieving remission or control of their disease, these responses are encouraging, and the safety profile associated with JAK1 specificity continues to be differentiated. Based on these data, we will progress the filgotinib rheumatoid arthritis indication filing for regulatory approval in Europe in the second half of this year.","As you know the MANTA study was requested by the FDA. Now that we have the Phase 3 data in hand from three FINCH studies, we have initiated a request to have further interactions with the FDA. Following those discussions, we will be able to provide greater clarity on a filing time line in the U.S.","Now turning to HIV. We are pleased with the results from our DISCOVER trial a Phase 3 randomized double-blind study of more than 5,000 people, evaluating whether once-daily Descovy is as safe and effective as once-daily Truvada at reducing the risk of HIV infection, when used as PrEP or pre-exposure prophylaxis. In a late breakup, oral abstract presented at CROI in Seattle earlier this year, the trial demonstrated that Descovy is non-inferior to Truvada in terms of preventing new HIV infections, with additional statistically significant advantages with respect to bone and renal safety.","So based on these data last month we submitted a supplemental NDA to the FDA for Descovy for the PrEP indication as an potential important new option to prevent HIV infection. If approved, we believe this will help contribute to achieving national and global HIV prevention goals. We submitted a priority review voucher with the filing, and we would anticipate approval in the fourth quarter of 2019.","Moving to liver disease and our broader NASH development program. In the last two months, we released top line results from the STELLAR-3 and STELLAR-4 programs the two Phase 3 studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of our investigational F1 inhibitor selonsertib in patients with reaching fibrosis Stage F3 due to NASH and Stage F4 or compensated cirrhosis due to NASH. Both studies did not meet their primary endpoint at week 48 of a greater than or equal to one stage histologic improvement in fibrosis without worsening of NASH.","Although, this is not the outcome we were hoping for, these were important studies to conduct. There's a significant unmet need for patients with advanced fibrosis in this disease. NASH is also a complex biological disease with multiple drivers of the disease and we believe the combination therapy will likely be necessary to effectively treat most of these patients.","To that end, the ATLAS trial a Phase 2 study evaluating combinations of our investigational compounds in patients with NASH and advanced fibrosis is expected to read out in the fourth quarter of this year. At the International Liver Congress in Vienna last month, we had more than 35 abstracts across NASH viral hepatitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. In particular, we presented new data supporting our efforts to develop combination therapies targeting different aspects of NASH, to evaluate the utility of non-invasive test for the identification of patients living with the disease, and to advance our overall understanding of the complexities and the burden of NASH.","Lastly as it relates to our NASH program I would like to highlight two recent agreements that will also augment our effort. A few weeks ago we announced our intent to enter into clinical collaboration with Novo Nordisk to evaluate the utility of combining their approved GLP-1 drug semaglutide with both our FXR agonists cilofexor and our ACC inhibiter firsocostat for the treatment of patients with NASH.","We also announced the strategic collaboration with insitro to discover and develop therapies for patients with NASH. As part of that three-year collaboration, we will leverage insitro's prior proprietary platform which applies machine learning, human genetics, and functional genomics to create disease models for NASH and discover relevant drug targets that have an influence on clinical progression and regression of the disease.","We, therefore, have a broad, deep, and strong pipeline in NASH combining both internal program and multiple external collaborations to advance therapies and we remain committed to developing effective combination therapies for patients with the disease.","Now, finally, let's shift gears to cell therapy and the momentum we're seeing there in advancing the next generation of medicine. We're gearing up for ASCO, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the annual meeting in Chicago in a few weeks. I'm excited by the abstracts we will present.","Our anticipated data updates include a presentation of the preliminary result of earlier steroid use with axi-cel in patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma. This study is part of a broader clinical effort to optimize the safety and efficacy profile of Yescarta by evaluating various combination approaches, reaching chemotherapy, and revised safety management practices.","I'm also pleased to share that we plan to announce top line results of ZUMA-2 our registrational trial of KTE-X19 cell therapy in patients with relapsed\/refractory mantle cell lymphoma.","Pending positive results, we expect to file the U.S. regulatory approval of KTE-X19 in patients with relapse\/refractory mantle cell lymphoma for this indication by the end of 2019. This would represent the first regulatory submission for X19.","As a reminder KTE-X19 employs the same engineered T cell construct as Yescarta with a slightly modified manufacturing process to address the specific characteristics of mantle cell lymphoma acute lymphoblastic leukemia and other diseases where there's a large burden of circulating tumor cells. KTE-X19 was granted breakthrough designation by the FDA. So, the application would be considered for expedited review.","Overall, our commitment to cell therapy is simple. We continue to try to reach more patients in need with Yescarta and to try and optimize the safety and efficacy of the treatment.","More broadly we are focused on creating a path to cure with subsequent generation products that enhance the efficacy and safety of cell therapy for hematological malignancies and ultimately solid tumors. We are also advancing allogeneic cell therapies which would offer significant benefits to patients making time to treat quicker and also more convenient.","As I look across our R&D organization in quoting both our earlier and later-stage pipeline, I'm excited about the momentum we have established. In closing, I would like to thank our R&D organization and all of our employees around the world for the hard work and commitment to translate into most important scientific discoveries into the best treatments for patients.","So, let's now open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Geoffrey Meacham from Barclays. Your question please.","Geoffrey Meacham","Hey guys, thanks for the question and Dan welcome to your first Gilead call.","Daniel O'Day","Thanks Geoff.","Geoffrey Meacham","So, I know you just finished the listing 2, but at this point how much of a strategic priority would you say the NASH portfolio or the hep B portfolio is? And if the answer is high, how aggressive you think you want to be on the BD front to add assets to these two categories? Thanks very much.","Daniel O'Day","Yes great. Thanks Geoff. It gives me a chance to maybe just characterize what I've seen so far. So, I've obviously seen as all of you have the incredible depth of strength in HIV and in HCV and more broadly from HCV into liver diseases where obviously NASH and hep B are paramount.","At the same time, I've had a chance to see the broader portfolio in inflammation with filgotinib at the lead of a comprehensive life cycle management program as well as some very interesting partnerships and earlier-stage molecules in inflammation.","And likewise in oncology, of course, with the cell therapy being in a leadership position and all the life cycle managements that go around cell therapy, but also the interesting partnerships around both the biologics and small molecule oncology program. So -- still early days of digging into that, but I've been impressed by the breadth, I would say of the portfolio and the partnerships and some of the recent BD activities.","Now specifically related to NASH and hep B, I would say that, what I've come to understand about NASH is the significant unmet medical need and growing unmet medical need I would say. And although, the results in the first quarter this year didn't turn out as we had expected, it's very clear that this disease -- needs scientific advancements. It's a heterogeneous disease. There are challenges with diagnosis. And at the same time, Gilead's experts in liver disease make it an area of continued interest for us and I'm particularly interested in the fact that a disease like this with the challenges associated with it may very well require combination therapies. And of course, we'll have some readouts and our combination approaches in the second half of this year, and you heard already from John some of the partnerships that we're entering to in that front.","Hep B, similarly I mean, obviously, we have a treatment for hep B today, which we will continue to focus on. But the opportunity to continue to try to advance the science in hep B particularly around moving towards a cure is something that I've been impressed by to see the different scientific approaches that the scientists here at Gilead are looking at. So bottom-line Geoff is that I think that NASH and hep B as areas of liver and with the expertise of Gilead are areas we need to continue to explore both internally and through partnerships as a part of a broader portfolio of approaches across different therapeutic areas.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams from RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please.","Brian Abrahams","Hi. Thanks very much for taking my question. On filgotinib. Coming out of FINCH 1 and 3 where do you see the most differentiation for that product versus currently available in late-stage -- therapies in late-stage JAK1 inhibitors? And obviously you're waiting FDA feedback, but I'm curious your willingness to file prior to completion of the MANTA study. I guess, how do you weigh speed to market for that product in a competitive space versus having to potentially optimize label right of the pad at the launch? Thanks.","John McHutchison ","Thanks, Brian. It's John here. Multi-part question. But look we are -- let me just step back a bit and think time -- summarize what we think about the entire data set. We have the full data package now from a Phase III clinical trial. We have over 3.5 \u2013 3,200 patients. Look we've shown in terms of characterization and although it's hard to do head-to-head comparisons across drugs, across studies of course. What we have seen in our FINCH program consistent with our Phase II program is deep efficacy responses in broad patient population. And if you're a practicing rheumatologist that's what's most important to you. You're not getting to ACR20 you're getting strong ACR50 and strong ACR70 responses -- remission responses low disease activity. And all the FINCH trial shows those deep responses when you characterize them by those characteristics.","Look each of the studies achieved all of their primary endpoints, and they showed improvement in functional status. And where we explored it we showed that we could slow the rate of structural damage on the X-ray files. So these are all important additional advantages of the drug or what we showed in that clinical programs So we'll go to -- as I said today on the earnings call we have the full data package. We're impressed by the risk benefit. We think it's relevant to patients and rheumatologists.","We'll be able to file in Europe in the second half of this year, and we'll go and have a discussion now with the FDA. We've requested that meeting where we'll sit down and talk with them about what we have in terms of data from the MANTA studies what we have in terms of our Phase III registrational programs and what we should do. And the time the time lines around that will play out during that meeting. But look I think it's important to us and Dan has brought this with his fresh eyes on the program recently is that there is some degree of urgency for us to get this drug approved as quickly as we can and obviously in collaboration with the regulators across the world.","A \u2013 Daniel O'Day","No, I would just -- thank you John. I would just add Brian that I think it's, yes I've been impressed by the profile of the product through all three FINCH studies and the consistency and the outcome and the results on both the efficacy and safety side. And knowing that rheumatoid arthritis patients are waiting for highly efficacious medicines that also have good safety and tolerability profiles. I think, we're looking forward to the totality now the discussion with the FDA. So we put the request for the meeting. We expect to have that meeting by midyear and we'll be looking forward to getting back to you on kind of the next steps. But we remain bullish on this and looking forward to bringing this as soon as possible to patients around the world and in the U.S.","John McHutchison","And of course, if I could add -- thank you, Dan but the safety -- I forgot to mention --unfortunately, the safety profile. We actually had a press release about this because we thought it was important as well. And again, it's impossible to make cross-drug cross-trial comparisons, but the safety profile we're seeing with this JAK1-specific inhibitor leads us to believe we have an additional benefit for patients as well. We're seeing low rates of infections, low rates of discontinuation, herpes zoster, thromboembolic events, cardiovascular events and so forth. So we also believe that that's an important advantage for the patients as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges from SVB Leerink. Your question please. Mr. Porges, you might have your phone on mute?","Geoffrey Porges","Thank you very much. Sorry, about that. Robin, it might be premature to say congratulations. I know you're around through the end of the year, but at the very least just wondering if you could help him with some Gmail settings. My storage is getting a little filled up.","Robin Washington ","I will work on that in 2020, Geoff.","Geoffrey Porges","I'm sure you could take care of that. But seriously Dan, I wonder if you could comment and perhaps Robin could weigh in on this as well about capital allocation. You effectively returned 100% of your cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks this quarter. And obviously that's not really sustainable. But Dan, could you talk about how you feel about dividends versus buybacks? And whether you will be willing to make any firm commitment to a certain proportion of cash flow being returned to investors versus other items? Thanks.","A \u2013 Daniel O'Day","Sure Geoff. And I know that Robin want to weigh on this as well but let me just say a couple of things. As you noted in my priorities, my top three priorities obviously focusing on the pipeline and understanding it both from a internal Gilead perspective and also what's on the outside horizon is my top priority as you can imagine.","And therefore, I'm really pleased to get my deep dives into the R&D organization, but equally I should mention this. I spent a good amount of time with our corporate development organization and I think it's working really hand in glove with our research colleagues to identify and scan the external environments. And you can see the level of activity we've had now over the past year or so 1.5 years lots of partnerships and things that are going to supplement that portfolio, so back to the capital allocation. I consider it really to be in the following order in terms of priority. And the first one is where we can find opportunities to supplement our portfolio through M&A or partnerships that's priority number one because we think that's in the best interest of the long-term journey of shareholders in the company.","Secondly then I would say obviously we want to keep an attractive dividend policy. And I think that's been shown by the past behavior that I've seen coming into Gilead. And then thirdly, smartly looking at share repurchases when those make sense. So I'm very clear that those are the orders of priority to create value for shareholders in my experience and also been reinforced on my journey into Gilead. Robin, what do you think about storage capacity? No he's talking about capital allocation?","A \u2013 Robin Washington","Yes. I mean I think as we continued to discuss externally for you Dan and I'm going to -- I think we're very aligned in terms of our priorities Dan. I think you articulated that very well. We've been fairly consistent with continuing to focus on our dividend as being the primary shareholder return vehicle and we expect that to continue. And we believe ultimately that's very important to our shareholders. And share repurchases we've leveraged as you said where appropriate. So I think we continue to be aligned Geoff.","You're right we have unnecessarily published a specific level of cash flow returns but I think if you look over the multiple year period, we've returned about 50% of free cash flows to shareholders in the forms of dividends as well as share repurchase and that vary year by year as we made the necessary investments to grow the company. We believe we have a financial flexibility to retain the dividend and make the investments at the end and the rest of the leadership team sees as appropriate to grow and strengthen the pipeline as Dan outlined.","A \u2013 Daniel O'Day","And Geoff I would just say in my listening to you -- I've been listening to many of you on the phone here and beyond. And I think broadly speaking there was quite a bit of alignment between capital allocation policy. So hopefully we're also meeting your needs as well as the company needs which should go hand in hand. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from Jeffries. Your question please.","Q \u2013 Michael Yee","Hey, thank you. I wanted to ask question to Dan. You listed pipeline enhancement as a top priority. Maybe just speak a little bit more to that in terms of how you're thinking about prioritizing parts of the pipeline. I mean at Roche which obviously you had a long time at. You didn't really do any deals about $8 billion but maybe just talk about how you think about what may be different here at Gilead and maybe the appetite for M&A? How you're looking at the environment out there here at Gilead? Thanks so much.","A \u2013 Daniel O'Day","Yes, thanks Michael for the question. I mean maybe just to expand a little bit from the previous question, I would say that as usual I think priority number one is to -- is that our M&A activity is led by science at the end of the day. And therefore, one focuses on so many expertise that we have within the company and that would obviously be in the areas of now oncology with the acquisition of KITE and the growing portfolio, we have here liver diseases inflammation and HIV.","Not to suggest that we want to be opportunistic on something that has an interesting scientific profile and a high unmet medical need where we think we could bring out a transformational difference. So I want you to know we're scanning the entirety of the environment and we're science-led. But obviously I think overall, you're generally better positioned to identify the opportunities where you have expertise in-house. And I think that was true in my previous company and its also seems to be true from what I've seen here at Gilead as well.","And I think again -- I think as we all know, I think -- and it's been true here when I've looked at the Gilead activity over the past couple of years. Here the vast majority of the opportunities are kind of an early stage or a mid-stage. And I think the opportunity create value exists quite a bit in those areas, particularly when you can find something earlier or more exciting because of the relevance of your science.","But having said that we also acknowledge that we need to look our late-stage portfolio and pipeline and strengthen that. And I think there's two different ways to do that. One is to look accelerating internal programs which I know John and the team are constantly looking at and I've been interested in speaking more about that, so there's maybe opportunities to take some risk and to accelerate things and to expedite things to applying resources.","And the other thing is of course to bring interesting life stage assets in. So overall, I think the vast majority of the work that Gilead has done and arguably they've been quite successful with their late-stage acquisition approach over the course of their 30-year history. I mean, we'll be looking for opportunities like that, as well of course, to fulfill the pipeline with a keen sense on the science. And I think bolt-on type acquisitions are continued to be in my opinion the highest likelihood and the way that we'll be proceeding. John, I don't know if you want to add anything from your \u2013 thoughts of your?","John McHutchison","I completely agree, Dan. I think we've always had the philosophy and the success with being led by the science. We feel much comfortable in making those decisions when we have the expertise internally as you articulated. And we are opportunistic and prepared to take risks when we feel the science and the opportunity and the need exists.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carter Gould from UBS. Your question please.","Carter Gould","Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe to follow-up Dan on your comments around the KITE organizational structure and separating that as a own business unit. Maybe talk about what drove the decision? What you hope that will achieve? And maybe any sort of consequences for future BD focused on cell therapy? Thank you.","Daniel O'Day","Absolutely, Carter. Yes I think the bottom line is that, I've been very encouraged by what I've seen at KITE, since I've come in and how the Gilead colleagues have approached to their entry into oncology in a very significant way. I think the concept of moving towards a new platform a new technology in this space as an entry point into oncology having come from a background of deep oncology experience and understanding the depth of a competitive environment is an intriguing way to go. So, to really go for a future-oriented technology I think makes a lot of sense.","And then to supplement that, with interesting partnerships like the one that John and his team have done in bispecific antibodies for instance with Agenus and\/or some of the interesting small molecule work that's going on here within the walls of Gilead. So first and foremost, I think one needs to consider the early, but interesting oncology work that's going on here at Gilead. And then, with that context we said \u2013 I said, as I've looked out in discussions with the leadership team that KITE itself in cell therapy oncology is in a ultra-competitive area. I think we have a leadership position, but I think we need to maintain that leadership position. And for the reasons of focus, we decided to create KITE as an independent business unit that will wake up and go to sleep every day thinking about how to be leaders in oncology cell therapy.","Now that's not to suggest that, they won't work with the rest of the organization to complement as we know specifically in oncology the combination approach and the multi-science approach is absolutely the way to go. But we need to make sure we secure that leadership in cell therapy, while we complement it with combination approaches in immuno-oncology or targeted therapies or other mechanisms. So that's the context.","Let's make sure, we win in cell therapy and leverage the remaining parts of the Gilead focus on oncology to win in the broader oncology market as well. So \u2013 and it's with that lens that, I took the decision to create a separate business unit to focus that, and now in the process of recruiting a CEO that will \u2013 reporting to me that will work very closely with the leadership team for success in oncology.","Now on the BD side, they've been very active as you know since the KITE acquisition, a very active M&A and partnership work within cell therapy, which I think is fundamental and essential, because the science is occurring of course within KITE and cell therapy, but all around this as well. So I have been impressed with the landscape analysis that the BD team has done here with the research and development team at KITE and at Gilead.","And I think we're really well positioned to continue to scan that environment and to complement it, with the appropriate pieces of the puzzle that we need to continue to write the next chapter in cell therapy history. And as John, articulated, its advances and hematologic malignancies, it's moving to solid tumors and it's also getting ready for the future of science, the allogeneic form as well, which has risks, but I think lots of opportunities as well. So, very comprehensive approach on the BD side and that will continue. John any perspective?","John McHutchison","Completely agree, Dan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.","Ying Huang","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe for Daniel. Is there anything you actually want to change in the Gilead organization after two months in the job? And then maybe another one for John McHutchison quickly. You decided to have a collaboration with Novo Nordisk in NASH. How does it compare to the other mechanisms of actions in the market today or on the development today if you look at semaglutide data in NASH? Thank you.","Daniel O'Day","Thanks, Ying. And look let me first say that, I've been incredibly welcomed and very impressed with coming into Gilead. So I think I probably know more of what I don't want to change than what I do want to change after two months in the role. And that is the focus on science. I've been really impressed by the science and the motivation and intelligence of the colleagues at Gilead. I think both the level of expertise that is here in many different areas as well as the intrinsic motivation of our employees is something that I've been deeply, deeply impressed by.","So, in terms of what to change, as I said before, I'm still in the process of evaluating the organization looking at pipeline, looking at commercial execution, looking at the organizational structure and people. And I think you would agree with me that, two months is really short period of time to evaluate that which is why I said there are certain things that I'm acting quickly on and won't hesitate to like the KITE decision and there are other things I think I need to learn a little bit more and understand. But it will be an evolution, not a revolution, and it will be based upon good observations, good discussions with the leadership teams in terms of how we progress here, so stay tuned on that.","And I think, we as a leadership team and a leadership community here at Gilead with the Board, and we continue to have our outside ears open to investors and to thought leaders and to what our patient needs are. We'll continue the evolution of the company, and I'll be articulating better what my priorities are as I go into the later part of this year, and we'll certainly inform you as I go. So, thank you for the question. And John, will you?","John McHutchison","Yes. We know that Novo Nordisk, Ying, that's a compelling mechanism of action. Novo Nordisk is clearly a leader in the pharmaceutical development of products for patients with diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Mechanism of action is not necessarily directly related to NASH, but it has many of the effects you would want to see in patients with NASH.","And additionally and importantly, as well as all those other metabolic benefits in terms of glucose control influence secretion and so forth, as a weight loss component to this drug and a significant weight loss component. And that weight loss component, we think is very compelling for us to explore with our other mechanisms of action that are really focusing on different and separate drivers of NASH at the Genesis.","So we believe it's a very exciting and a very important collaboration. Novo Nordisk brings a lot of people and a lot of depth of knowledge about metabolic syndrome to the table, whilst we bring a lot of expertise in liver disease. So it's a wonderful collaboration that we're just starting, and looking forward to. So we will combine a semaglutide without FXR agonists and our ACC drugs as well, and that will be the initial clinical collaboration.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore. Your question, please.","Umer Raffat ","Hi. Thank you so much for taking my question, and welcome again Dan, for your first Gilead call. I wanted to keep it fairly high level today. I'll maybe just ask Dan. Do you see Gilead as growing top line into 2020s? And also, what are the biggest risks and the biggest opportunities that you see at Gilead currently?","Daniel O\u2019Day","Thanks a lot Umer for the warm welcome again. I really appreciate, and look forward to working with all of you, and obviously articulating my views and visions for the company as I go. It is definitely premature to talk about sales in 2020 at this stage. In fact, in the first two months, I've really been focusing, as you know, on pipeline and understanding our current commercial delivery.","We will over the coming months of course, in the natural process of thing start to digest the progress that we have for this year, the opportunities we have for next year and put those into some ideas of a plan. So I think it's a bit too premature for that. What I can assure you is that we'll give you a sense for that much later in the year.","At this stage, I mean, maybe just to add a little additional color to that from the way that I see the business today. I see the strengths in HIV clearly as a real foundation of course of Gilead and a strong and growing business. Laura mentioned the progress in Biktarvy. Both Laura and John talked about the really good data on the Descovy and the opportunity there with the DISCOVER trial.","So, I do see good strength in the HIV business. I see the opportunity that HCV is much more predictable at this stage and a much smaller part of the overall revenue turnover at Gilead. And then I see the future opportunities, such as filgotinib and others that we'll be discussing with all of you as upside to that relatively stable base. And the question that I need to digest with the team is to understand how and when those opportunities will be hitting, and I just want to give you a little bit more color as to how I see the business and I think the opportunity.","So what are the risks and opportunities, again, I need a bit more time than two months to come back to you with a comprehensive list. I think I've given you a bit of an idea in the call here today. I do think that there are tremendous opportunities in the early mid-stage pipeline, and I think we also have a real opportunity with filgotinib. I mean this is a profile of a product in a space that needs -- the patients and physicians need more treatment options, and they're looking for treatment options that are highly efficacious that are safe and that are convenient.","And so, I think I've been working with organization with the leadership team to really think about how can we accelerate some of the plans around filgotinib, how do we get ready for entering this very competitive space. And obviously with all of these launches comes both risks and opportunities, but I do think that we have a very good profile product on which to build one of our next legs successfully the whole leg of inflammation accordingly.","Likewise, I think we should mention in that same statement around the overall business picture, the ongoing success of Yescarta, the ability to think about moving into other diseases and hematologic malignancies, lots of readouts on Yescarta, just reviewing with John just before the call.","There's a lot of interesting readouts that will come in the coming year, two years, three years that I think will help us understand the utility of cell therapy both with and without combination approaches in oncology. So I'll give you an even more complete view of the business Umer, later this year from my perspective, but those are some of my early insights into what I've seen so far.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau from Cowen and Company. Your question please.","Phil Nadeau","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Robin let me add my congratulations on the announcement of your retirement. Dan, a question for you actually on HIV just to focus their. Gilead's clearly been a leader in HIV treatment for almost two decades. But arguably you fall behind in the development of nucleotide-sparing regimens and long-acting regimens, so you brought fresh eyes to looking at your HIV portfolio. How do you see the treatment of HIV evolving over the next five to 10 years? And do you feel like Gilead's HIV pipeline has all the programs that it needs to stay competitive over that period?","Daniel O\u2019Day","Thanks, Phil and I welcome John and Laura to feed in on this as well, but I'll give you my top line take first. And that is that there's no doubt that Gilead is the leader in HIV has been for a long time and to your point, so we need to make sure that we continue to have the most significant next advance for patients and that's certainly been the case for TAF.","From TAF the regimens and to the Descovy regimens, and now of course with the PrEP data and certainly there's lots more that we can do in improving the patient experience in HIV including long acting as you mentioned and other approaches.","So I think there's a very comprehensive life cycle plan around this and I think that thinking this got into this in terms of making sure that the next generation programs like a long acting are something that are going to be well received by the patients that are convenient easy to take and really allow for if you like the next best advance from a daily oral medicine, which is let's face it the highly convenient to begin with.","So I think they really scrutinize the target profile well and I think the science that's growing on here is well-positioned to continue to take the next meaningful advances for patients into the future.","But I would ask John if you want to feed in on this, great?","John McHutchison","Sure. Thanks, Phil. Phil we have led the field of HIV therapeutic development for over a decade. And one of the critical components of that approach and our success has been no resistance. And that has been achieved with effective three drug regimens.","So, for example, with all the Biktarvy studies as you know we have no resistance through week 96, which is a critical advantage for anybody. You can't afford to increase the fragility of a regimen by decreasing or diminishing or cutting out one of the components, and theoretically or not theoretically increasing the risk of resistance. So that's very important.","Now two drug regimens with adherence is potentially not so important such as an effective long-acting regimen is actually one of our critical programs internally. And we believe that our ultimate goal with the long-acting regimen should be a subcutaneous at-home small volume, non-painful injection that's probably got two components to it, but it won't have that adherence issue to it and we'd like to be giving it every three months. That would be a great advance for patients as well.","And in terms of our other activities in HIV, we have many cure programs as you know. We also have programs for those most in need in terms of the highly resistant groups of patients and then of course we have all of our PrEP programs as we discussed on the call today.","So we are very much laser-focused on maintaining our leadership position scientifically and for patients with HIV and preventing HIV by all of these initiatives. So I think the issue of two versus three drug regimens has to be put in context of the decades of history of this disease and where the long-acting ultimate goal should be.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Your question please.","Cory Kasimov","Hey, good afternoon guys, and thank you for taking my question. I also have one on HIV, but more from a near-term commercial standpoint. So basically curious how you're thinking about potential pricing pressures within the category over the near to medium-term from both potential U.S. health care reform as well as competitors entering the space at substantial discounts to Gilead's regimens? Thanks.","Laura Hamill","Thanks for the question. This is Laura. So let me start off with the pricing pressures in the U.S. health care and I assume you're talking about is maybe the protected class with the Medicare population. So let me just address that.","We've been actively engaged in a discussion around the protected class and this is the Part D benefit for the senior population. And all along I think what's most important for the senior population is to ensure that they have access to safe and effective medicines that are appropriate for the guidelines.","We really want to make sure that there is no prior authorization that impedes rapid treatment and renewal of the long-term treatment for patients. And I think that there's been a significant groundswell across the community of advocacy of people positioned that really believe that it's important for the Medicare population to have access to the HIV regiments that they need and to maintain a protected class. So that's specific to the Medicare population.","As it relates to the commercial population, I would say that we're very pleased with the amazing coverage that we've been able to achieve with Biktarvy. Over 90% of the plans have Biktarvy rapidly available. You can see that in the numbers and what we just said in terms of treatment-na\u00efve and switch patient. How quickly patients are moving to Biktarvy and obviously 80% of our overall prescription is coming from a Descovy base backbone. So we don't feel significant pressure on the commercial side as it relates to coverage and access.","As it relates to the overall growth that we see as I mentioned, we had a 12% prescription growth year-over-year. And we've continued to maintain double-digit growth for the last couple of years. So, I'm very, very pleased with that. And then finally you asked about the competition and pricing pressure.","So I think we've always tried to make sure we bring innovation into the market. And I believe there are -- for Gilead it's been the 11 products in 17 years. We've always been mindful of the pricing in the market to make sure that our innovation gets rapid access and people can access these new brands.","And if we look at new entrants, I believe that their pricing is relative to the branded pricing of the component. So for example Truvada is really the branded price of the two drugs. And I believe Biktarvy has been also priced very competitively within the Descovy base backbone. So we feel very comfortable with our pricing.","A \u2013 Robin Washington","Yeah. Cory I'd just add also. Remember that for Gilead our franchise has really been driven by volume right. Pricing has been frozen in the public market, since I've been here. So, we don't get real upside relative to pricing particularly in the U.S. and as you know ex-U.S. it's all pricing decreases.","So, I'm totally in agreement with everything Laura, provided in terms of our focus legislatively and competitively. But it's just -- underlying price has never been a key factor when you take a look at our HIV revenues.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question for today comes from the line of Ronny Gal from Bernstein, your question please?","Q \u2013 Ronny Gal","Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. And thanks for filling me in. Two there if I can. One, about HCV, I noticed the agreements you just had in the U.K. and the one you had in Louisiana. Can you just explain to us from a financial perspective, how you're thinking about this?","There's some implied discount in those contracts. But obviously you're getting access to other patients you wouldn't otherwise. So can you just tell us how you're thinking about this as a strategy? And then, coming back to this issue of HIV pricing I hear you about not raising prices.","But Robin, I think you mentioned that with this shift of patients, to government programs you're actually seeing a bit of a net decline. And if we look at the revenue reported and divided by IMS scripts, we are seeing kind of like modest declines year-over-year in your price point.","Should that be the baseline assumption going forward? Essentially more people going on those programs. You guys not raising prices. And that's in effect we should see a net price decrease a little bit per year the way the market is looking right now?","A \u2013 Robin Washington","Yeah, Ronny I'll take that -- the second part of your question. What I was referring to was just a shift relative to when public buyers purchase right. And that's about payer mix right? And typically in Q1 as even the ADAP cycle, we do see that downward shift driven by payer mix.","The biggest overall driver of our sequential decline this past quarter however was not pricing at all, it was inventory right. So I just want to clarify that and happy to follow up after the call on that component. Laura, do you want to address the Louisiana and \u2026","A \u2013 Laura Hamill","The U.K., Yeah, yeah.","A \u2013 Robin Washington","\u2026the Washington markets?","A \u2013 Laura Hamill","Yes. So -- and you -- I think you also mentioned U.K. if I heard you correctly. I thought it was U.K. and maybe Louisiana and Washington was it all 3?","Q \u2013 Ronny Gal","Yes.","A \u2013 Laura Hamill","Yeah okay. So let me talk about the U.K. and then I'll also talk about Louisiana. So, really our goal is to make sure that we work with governments the best we can whether it's federal or state or country to be able to provide the appropriate access for patients. And we believe HCV is a huge value to the health care system.","So as it relates to Louisiana. This is particular to the needs of that government. And really if you think about what we're trying to accomplish with Louisiana they wanted to be able to treat a number of patients. But their annual budget is a certain amount every year.","So if you think about five years you have certain amount every year. But the need actually is to treat more people earlier on. So really the discussion that we\u2019re in with Louisiana is how do we, basically smooth that out so you don't have a big peak and then a trough.","From a payment perspective, we can be flexible to try to work within the needs of the budgets and be able to give people access. From the U.K. perspective, we're partnering with the U.K. as it relates to really an elimination project in the U.K. and they're actually a number of governments around the world that Gilead participates in arrangements such as this and really that's the focus.","There's a price, and then we're also working to make sure that we find patients, and get them properly diagnosed and treated. And then finally, the last thing that I wanted to mention, which kind of plays into all of this as you all know is the launch of the AG by our subsidiary Asegua.","And, I think that was another opportunity or strategy that was deployed by Gilead to make sure we were servicing the needs of the managed Medicaid market. So, we have the flexibility between the Gilead portfolio, of Sovaldi Harvoni and Epclusa. That is made available in the commercial market. And of course Asegua is also available in the commercial markets.","But specifically to address the needs of managed -- the managed Medicaid market we have offered up this opportunity to be able to address their particular needs. So hopefully that addresses your question.","A \u2013 Robin Washington","Perfect. So, Ronny I also wanted to go back to the other component that HIV line also includes prevention right so flat. So to your point there is that impact on the average price per patient. Because it's not the STR you're looking at the Descovy component of that right so that would also impact average price per patient as PrEP users -- PrEP usage continues to go up as well.","Operator","Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only-mode and as a reminder this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Patrick O'Brien","Thank you, Sam. Good afternoon, everyone. We issued a press release this afternoon providing earnings results for the second quarter, which is available on our Web site where you can also find detailed slides that support today's call.","For our prepared remarks and Q&A, I am joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, John Martin; our President and Chief Operating Officer, John Milligan; our Executive Vice President of Research & Development, Norbert Bischofberger; our Executive Vice President of Commercial Operations, Paul Carter; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Robin Washington.","Before we begin our formal remarks, we want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including plans and expectations, with respect to our product candidates and financial projections, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in our latest SEC disclosure documents and recent press releases.","In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. We will also be using non-GAAP financial measures to help you understand our underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in our press release as well as on our Web site.","I would now like to turn the call over to John Martin.","John Martin","Thank you, Patrick, and thank you all for joining us today. I am pleased with our progress and would like to highlight a number of key milestones achieved during the quarter. Just today the U.S. Food & Drug Administration approved Zydelig for the treatment of three B-cell malignancies, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, follicular B-cell lymphoma and small lymphocytic lymphoma. Zydelig is the first in our new class oral medicines that targets PI3K delta and we are pleased to provide this additional treatment option for patients.","Moving to hepatitis C, the rapid adoption of Sovaldi reflects wide spread recognition across the medical community as the benefits of this break through products can brings two patients suffering from hepatitis C. Since approval more than 70,000 patients in United States and 10,000 patients in the EU have been treated with Sovaldi containing regimens. Sovaldi offers higher cure rates with shortened treatment duration at a cost that is comparable to that of alternative treatment options and for many patients who have failed treatment with older regimens Sovaldi provides a new possibility for a cure.","Gilead has generated and is continuing to generate clinical data that support the scientific and medical evidence for treating hepatitis C as many stages of the disease. In fact across all our hepatitis C clinical studies over 6,000 patients have been treated and cured to-date.","In Japan our new drug application has been submitted to Japan\u2019s pharmaceutical and medical devices agency for approval of sofosbuvir in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of genotype 2 infected patients. In the Phase 3 study supporting this application, 97% of patients, dose for 12 weeks with sofosbuvir ribavirin achieving an SVR12, this filing represents Gilead\u2019s first drug application in Japan and they have approved Sofosbuvir would be the first product to be launched and marketed by Gilead in that country.","Our innovation and investment in improving the treatment for hepatitis C continues with the single tablet regimen of ledipasvir\/sofosbuvir for patients infected with genotype 1 hepatitis C virus. FDA has assigned a PDUFA date of October 10th and the European Union approval is expected to come later in this year.","In Japan the ledipasvir\/sofosbuvir marketing authorization application will be filed in the fourth quarter of this year. This application will be supported by results of a Phase 3 clinical trial conducted in Japan in which genotype 1 infected patients were treated with ledipasvir\/sofosbuvir with or without ribavirin for 12 weeks. 22% of the patients have cirrhosis. Overall the SVR12 rate was 99% and the cohort that received ledipasvir\/sofosbuvir without ribavirin the SVR rate was 100%.","Ensuring patient access to Sovaldi and all our medicines has been and will continue to be a top priority for Gilead. And we have been actively engaging with payors compelling the benefits of Sovaldi. In addition, we are committed to making Sovaldi available to patients in developed countries and have recently entered agreement with Egypt a country that has the highest presence of hepatitis C in the world.","In HIV, the single-tablet regimen abbreviated ECF TAF is being evaluated in a number of studies including treatment experienced patients, patients on stable therapy switch ECF TAF, patients with mild-to-moderate renal impairment as well as adolescents.","Data from our two Phase 3 studies compared to ECF TAF to Stribild in treatment na\u00efve patients should become available in the third quarter of this year. We anticipate filing for U.S. and European marketing authorization of ECF TAF in the first quarter of 2015 for the treatment -- for the use in treatment naive, treatment experienced and renally impaired patients. TAF as a single agent is also being studied in chronic hepatitis B infection. Two studies in 1250 patients are 30% enrolled, one study is e-antigen positive and the other an e-antigen data of hepatitis B infected patients. We expect to complete enrollment of these studies around the end of this year.","We have significant activities ongoing across other therapeutic areas as well. A number of studies of Simtuzumab, our investigation of monoclonal antibody to organic LOXL2 protein are ongoing in a variety of fibrotic diseases and solid tumors. The Phase 2 study and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis is fully enrolled and data are expected in the middle of 2015. We also look forward to providing updates for the Simtuzumab studies in pancreatic and colorectal cancer and myelofibrosis before the end of the year.","GS-9620, a TLR-7 agonist has been evaluated in our Phase 2 study as a potential cure for hepatitis B in with the first patients have been screened at the beginning of July. GS-5745, a MMP9 monoclonal antibody inhibitor is firmly in Phase 1 and has been explored in Ulcerative Colitis and solid tumors. The synergistic activity of Ranolazine in combination with dronedarone an Atrial Fibrillation and the activity of GS-6615 and long QT-3 syndrome were presented recently at the annual Heart Rhythm Society meeting.","While I am only highlighting a few of our R&D accomplishments for this year I\u2019m very pleased with our high level of innovation and productivity I would like the thank the more than 6,000 employees at Gilead and our collaborators and partners around the world for their dedication and immeasurable contributions for the Company. Their work and commitment have enabled us to achieve a number of milestones across different therapeutic areas of the business. And importantly continue to bring life changing therapies to patients and communities of need.","I would now like to turn the call over to Paul.","Paul Carter","","Thanks John and good afternoon everyone. In the second quarter of 2014 our worldwide total net product revenue increased to $6.4 billion representing growth of a 141% over the second quarter last year. U.S. sales exceeded $4.8 billion and European sales exceeded 1.3 billion. This performance has been driven mainly by healthy demand in our HIV business and the uptake and stability which had sales totaling $3.5 billion. Of that number $3 billion represent U.S. sales with most of the rest of the remaining revenues coming from France and Germany. Patients are now being treated with Sovaldi in 34 countries worldwide and that number will continue to increase as further regulatory approvals and reimbursements are achieved.","Beginning with the U.S. and HIV, prescription volume continued to grow on our HIV products. Nine out of 10 patients new to treatment were prescribed to Gilead medicine, with seven out of 10 receiving one of Gilead\u2019s TRUVADA-based single-tablet regimens. Of these Stribild continued to be the leading HIV regimen for patients who are beginning therapy, capturing three out of 10 stops. Prescription growth of Gilead\u2019s TRUVADA-based single-tablet regimens including Stribild, Complera and Atripla is 13% year-over-year. I\u2019m pleased to report that Stribild prescriptions alone grew 19% in quarter two over quarter one this year and Stribild is now approaching a $1 billion annual run rate in the U.S.","ADAP purchasing in the U.S. was in line with expectations and historical norms and we did not see any unusual movements in wholesaler inventory levels.","Moving to U.S. hepatitis C performance, Sovaldi sales of $3 billion showed strong patient demand and rapid adoption by physicians. We estimate that approximately 70,000 patients have now prescribed Sovaldi in U.S. since launch. The prescribing of Sovaldi in the U.S. has been driven mainly by hepatologists and gastroenterologists, but internal medicine specialists and primary care physicians, many of whom also treat HIV patients have also prescribed the treatment. Approximately 70% of the physicians visited by our therapeutic specialists have prescribed Sovaldi to-date.","We are seeing signs that physicians have begun delaying treatment for some patients also known as warehousing in anticipation of the approval of the single-tablet regimen of the differences across the derivatives. The initial patients who started a Sovaldi-based treatment in the U.S. became aware they were cured late in the second quarter. Based on prescription data and our cure rates in Sovaldi clinical trials we estimate that around 9,000 individuals have been cured to-date and that number will continue to accelerate as the year goes on.","Of the patients treated so far we believe that around 80% are new to therapy. The genotype distribution of patients that receive treatment is approximately representative of the U.S. HCV population with around 60% usage in genotype 1, 25% in genotype 2, 10% in genotype 3 and 5% in genotypes 4, 5 and 6 combined. We have noticed the reporting of an increased use of the interferon free regimen used in the Phase 2 Cosmos study comprised of Sovaldi with simeprevir and we estimate that during quarter two 70% of Sovaldi usage was in interferon free regimens including Cosmos.","On the payor front most commercial Medicare policy and state Medicaid plans take a full six months to review new drugs and we\u2019re working with these plans to facilitate patient accessibility to Sovaldi. As anticipated we saw a slight shift in the payor mix in quarter two due to more patients from the BA and other non-retail coming on to treatment. As we exited the second quarter the overwhelming majority of state Medicaid all covering Sovaldi roughly half of them with a prior utilization to label and the other half with restrictions around fibrosis scores. Only three states are not covering Sovaldi pending completion of their review or the establishments of prior utilization criteria.","In the U.S. we have one of the most comprehensive patient assistance programs in the industry to help ensure cost is not a barrier for patients. The components of that program include providing coupons to bring the co-pay down to as low as $5 per month and paying the entire cost for the eligible uninsured. We also provide financial support to an independent non-profit organization offering assistance to patients who cannot cover their out of pocket medication costs.","Turning to Europe we are very pleased with our strong HIV performance again underscoring our confidence in the benefits of TRUVADA-based single-tablet regimens. Gilead single-tablet regimens have grown over 20% in volume year-over-year in the big five EU markets. Of these Eviplera is the most prescribed regimen for treatment naive HIV patients and also continues to extend its lead over Atripla as the most commonly switched to regimen.","Despite the availability of generic fibrates in Europe 70% of switches out of Atripla in quarter two went to Eviplera which since the beginning of the year has been actively promoted to switch in most countries where approved. This again demonstrates the value of TRUVADA-based single-tablet regimens. In fact we have seen little impact to our business from generic fibrates so far.","By the end of the second quarter we have sales from Stribild in 19 countries across Europe including all five EU big five markets. Stribild is now the second most prescribed regimen for switches after Eviplera, gaining most of these switches from previous protease inhibitor or raltegravir containing regimen.","Moving to Hepatitis C, we estimate approximately 10,000 patients have now received treatment with Sovaldi in Europe, where sales were $400 million in quarter two. The vast majority of these patients are in France and Germany. While Sovaldi has regulatory approval in the EU the full pricing and reimbursement process varies by country, with some countries completing the process more quickly than others. Negotiations are ongoing in the majority of EU markets, indeed we have filed health economic dossiers with all the major reimbursement agencies and we\u2019re following the processes that lead to final price and reimbursement approval.","In France Sovaldi was given high marks in a recent government health technology assessment in which it was recognized as demonstrating a high level of innovation and is recommended to reimbursement consistent with Sovaldi\u2019s label. While we are going through the rest of the pricing process with the French Ministry of Health we continue to make Sovaldi available to patients in the pre and post liver transplant setting and also for patients with advanced liver disease who failed other hepatitis C treatments or are interferon intolerant. This is in line with the temporary authorization for use or ATU score and is used for widening and full reimbursement is established.","In Germany just last week the government AMNOG process completed its review of Sovaldi, also recognizing the additional benefit that it brings to patients. The AMNOG process will continue over the next month. In the UK the National Institute for Clinical Excellence or NICE has requested additional consultation before a final recommendation on reimbursement can be made. We are confident that upon the completion of the process NICE will be able to make a positive formal recommendation that acknowledges both the clinical and health economic benefits that Sovaldi can bring to the broader UK population. In the meantime the National Health Service in England has approved funding for approximately 500 people recognizing the urgent need to sicker patient. It is also worth noting that Sovaldi has pre-received a positive HTA review in Scotland and this has been accepted by the Scottish Medicines Consortium on the behalf of NHS Scotland. ","In Australia Sovaldi was recently approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration or TGA and discussions for pricing and reimbursements are ongoing. Outside North America and Europe we continue to expand our geographic footprint, the build out of our Gilead organization in Japan is going according to plan, in anticipation of the approval of sofosbuvir in early 2015 and the single-tablet regimen of the difference we\u2019re supposed to get later in 2015. In closing I\u2019m excited to share that earlier today as John mentioned the FDA granted approval of Zydelig for use in three B-cell malignancies.","Our U.S. commercial team has been prepared for this day and will immediately begin to promote Zydelig. We\u2019re very excited to have our first commercial product on oncology. The approvals in Europe are pending and our teams there will be ready for commercial launch consistent with the anticipated regulatory and reimbursement timelines.","I\u2019d now like to turn over the call to Robin.","Robin Washington","","Thanks Paul and good afternoon everyone. Total revenues for the second quarter were 6.5 billion, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $2.36. As Paul covered the key commercial drivers and performance for the quarter, I would like to briefly discuss Q2 inventory dynamics for our core business and our recent Sovaldi product launch. As mentioned during our Q1 earnings call, we experienced an inventory draw down in the first quarter for our HIV and cardio pulmonary products following strong wholesaler and sub-wholesaler purchases in December 2013 in anticipation of January 1st price increases. During the second quarter inventory levels remained at the low-end of the range as we did not see a rebuild of inventory within the channel.","Turning to Sovaldi, we estimate the vast majority of U.S. sales for the second quarter were related to demand. Inventory across the supply chain for Sovaldi were at levels necessary to support demand during the quarter. And while the provisions for the inventory management agreements for Sovaldi with the big three wholesalers do not start until September; inventory levels were already within the range of those provisions as of the end of the quarter. As anticipated we have started to see some patient warehousing in advance of ledipasvir\/sofosbuvir approval. If this warehousing continues it may have a downstream impact to Sovaldi inventory held in the distribution channel.","Turning to expenses, non-GAAP R&D expenses were up 54 million year-over-year reflecting increases in headcount to support clinical study activities, geographic expansion and marketed product support in addition to infrastructure costs related to expansion of our R&D activities. On a sequential basis, non-GAAP R&D expenses decreased 16 million to 542 million in the second quarter primarily as a result of the ramp down of Sovaldi and ledipasvir\/sofosbuvir Phase 3 studies.","During the second half of 2014 we expect non-GAAP R&D expense to increase relative to first half 2014 levels to support expansion of studies in HCV, HIV, inflammation and respiratory therapeutic areas. Non-GAAP SG&A spending was up 193 million year-over-year to support Sovaldi sales, ongoing geographic expansion and the anticipated approvals of our HCV fixed dose combination and idelalisib.","On a sequential basis, non-GAAP SG&A increased by approximately 70 million driven primarily by the support of Sovaldi\u2019s launch. We expect continued and incremental investments in these areas in the second half of 2014. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter decreased to 14.6% primarily due to increased sales of Sovaldi and a cumulative touch up adjustment of 3.6 percentage points to the first quarter tax rate to reduce the year-to-date non-GAAP effective tax rate to 18.2%. We have included a reconciliation of this change on Slide 40 in the earnings deck.","The first half revenue performance resulted in another strong quarter of cash flow from operations of 4.2 billion. This reflects strong collections in the current quarter and a larger than normal component of Q1 collections given the ramp of Q1 Sovaldi sales. As committed we increased our level of shareholder return this quarter by repurchasing 15.2 million shares, utilizing 1.2 billion in cash. As of June 30, we had 1.7 billion remaining on our 5 billion repurchase authorization from January 2011, which we will complete in the third quarter prior to its escalation in September 2014.","In addition in May 2014, our Board approved an additional 5 billion in purchase authorization. During the quarter we repaid the remainder of outstanding May 2014 convertible notes as outlined on Slide 56. In first third quarter the warrants related to the May 2014 convertible debt will expire which if settled in cash will result in cash utilization of approximately 3.1 billion to 3.7 billion.","Finally, we are updating full year 2014 guidance which is outlined on Slide 43, to include HCV revenues for 2014. We expect Gilead total net product sales to be in the range of 21 billion to 23 billion. I would like to caution you that it is very difficult to accurately predict revenues from HCV products, which are now included in our total net product sales. As a result, the following factors specific to HCV products could cause our net product revenues to be higher or lower than projected.","These factors include the ledipasvir\/sofosbuvir single-tablet regimen not being approved by the PDUFA date of October 10, 2014. The level and speed of market acceptance of the STR, the pricing and rate of reimbursement for the STR, the amount of patient warehousing and wholesaler inventory decreases prior to approval of the STR which could negatively impact sales of Sovaldi. And finally the launch timing and market acceptance of competitive drugs already on the market or scheduled to enter the market later this year.","Turning to expense guidance, our non-GAAP product gross margin is expected to be in the range of 85% to 88%. We\u2019re increasing our non-GAAP R&D expenses to be in the range of 2.3 billion to 2.4 billion as we continue to invest in our pipeline. We\u2019re increasing our non-GAAP SG&A expenses to also be in the range of 2.3 billion to 2.4 billion, which assumes the continued build out and expansion of our commercial infrastructure in Europe and Asia to support HCV product launches and increased marketing and sales efforts related to the launch of our first oncology product.","For the full year, our non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 17.5% to 20.5%. As Congress has not extended the federal R&D tax credit for 2014, we have excluded the credit from our guidance. If the R&D tax credit is extended in 2014, we would expect an additional 0.4% reduction in our annual effective tax rate.","We\u2019re anticipating the full year diluted EPS impact of acquisition-related restructuring and stock-based compensation expenses to be in the range of $0.63 to $0.66 per share. This range includes the full year effect of the amortization of end process R&D related to Sovaldi.","Thank you and we look forward to updating you on our progress during our next call. We would now like to open the call for questions, operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, we will be taking a maximum of one question per person at a time. If you have further questions you are welcome to rejoin the queue. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Geoff Meacham - JPMorgan","","So the cost benefits of Sovaldi seems pretty straight forward but there is still are a lot of public comments. So my question is there any color you can give us on the progress you\u2019re making in Washington or private payors in this front? And then very related, what can be done to more rapidly increase and have budgets in the space for Medicaid patients and also across Europe? Thanks.","John Milligan","Geoff its John Milligan. Yes that\u2019s a complicated question that you gave us there. So a number of things are being done of course, we have had a number of healthcare economic outcome research programs that we\u2019ve commissioned and have published. We\u2019re talking about the revalue of Sovaldi. There is clearly a lively debate within the press. There is a lively debate within the payer community and of course the interest of Washington on this. It is just now really that we\u2019re starting to see some of the benefits of Sovaldi and we\u2019ve been talking about this during the script, the fact that we can estimate that over 9,000 patients have now being cured in our commercial programs, that we\u2019ve cured over 6,000 patients across a wide range of disease stage in HCV and our hepatitis clinical trial programs. And we\u2019re starting to see some of these benefits. So this is the leading edge of benefit that you will see and that will clearly accelerate as we get into later in the years, more and more patients will have reach that important time point of 12 weeks past of their treatment periods.","So I think there\u2019ll be a positive momentum and a positive series of stories coming out of that which will be quite helpful. Of course the discussions with the payors center around the volumes that they are seeing. I don\u2019t think anybody disagrees with the fact that Sovaldi is a remarkable drug, it\u2019s been called an outlier in some segments, I agree with it. It\u2019s an outlier, because we\u2019re curing people of horrible disease in a very rapid timeframe and that\u2019s a very unusual thing for payors to think about. So we have noticed some positive movement of some payors indicated that they have budget in the second half of this year for this product, that is not been universal but we\u2019re in discussions with them and talking about Sovaldi use and importantly the next generation product ledipasvir, sofosbuvir coming forward.","Interestingly, if you picked up on Paul\u2019s script, we\u2019ve noticed that the interferon regimens are becoming increasingly important. I think it is important that a high percentage of patients to be getting Sovaldi plus simeprevir indicating that all regimens are being approved by the payors and are considered important part of the way to treat these diseases going forward. As it\u2019s a long answer to your long question. And the final part with regard to things like the Senate we of course are complying with their request for information and look forward to the opportunities to discuss the value of Sovaldi with members of the senatorial staff."," ","Operator","Thank you, our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges of Bernstein; your line is now open.","Geoffrey Porges - Bernstein","","Thank you very much and congratulations again also on a remarkable quarter. Just a question on timing so, you mentioned the October 10 PDUFA dates for the fixed dose combination and that\u2019s a eight months review cycle from filing and it has been given breakthrough status. So, is there anything going on in your interactions with the agency that suggest that might be expanded and just related question if Paul, could comment on TAF and Stribild another new combination just a little bit about, what you are seeing in the market in terms of the appetite for replacing the existing combinations with the TAF formulation?","Norbert Bischofberger","","Hi Jeff, it\u2019s Norbert; I will take your first question. The renew of ledipasvir\/sofosbuvir is moving ahead nicely. We\u2019ve had all the unusual questions from agency about clinical CMC, we have had clinical inspections that are done manufacturing and certain at this point, it\u2019s all moving ahead nicely but it would be too much to speculate about the approval date. All we really know for certain is that PDUFA date is October 10.","John Martin","","And Jeff, on your question about TAF clearly this drug is not approved yet and we haven\u2019t completed our clinical trials and data really will instruct this on how this is going to play out? I think it\u2019s worth mentioning though that single-tablet regimen are way ahead in our opinion and we hope very much that the data coming out of the tough trials will underscore the importance of get out single-tablet regimen.","Operator","","Thank you, our next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum of ISI Group. Your line is now open.","Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group","","Hello, thank you very much for taking my question, I appreciated. I just wanted to ask about the progress maybe this question is for Norbert or John but the progress for your triplet regimen. Obviously Merck\u2019s doing a trials four week dated at the end of the year and there\u2019s a possibility they could shorten the duration with the triple regimen down to four weeks. And I know that you have explored triplet regimens in the past, a little update as to where you guys are with that if needed, how quickly you could move forward if to react to the Merck data if indeed it hits the high bar and it looks pretty good? Thank you.","Norbert Bischofberger","","Mark, its Norbert. Very quickly to remind you, we actually disclosed data from a NIH study which was in early month this quarter and there we show that you can indeed take six weeks of three drugs, so in that case protease inhibitor 9451 (ph) ledipasvir\/sofosuvir and you get a 100% cure rates. Of course in operating new dose data before we quite a while before we presented it so we have undertaken now to look at eight weeks in Sovaldi patients, we are looking at six weeks in Sovaldi patients, we are looking at four weeks in naive patients both takes three drugs and four drugs, you will see some of these data that are emerging hopefully at ASLD.","It\u2019s been we see that at certain regimen as the profile that we hope that it has to happen remember the hurdle bar has gone way up below 95% I don\u2019t think we will consider anything taken forward into Phase 3. We can then move fairly very quickly into phase 3 with whatever regimen we decide we want to do that the experiment on.","Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group","Thanks, very helpful.","Operator","","Thank you, our next question comes from Brian Abrahams of Wells Fargo; your line is now open.","Brian Abrahams - Wells Fargo","","Hi, thanks very much for taking my question. I guess following up on Mark\u2019s question, can you maybe clarify what regimens you are going to view at you are looking at with the three and four DAA combos from four to eight weeks that you just mentioned Norbert, I mean, are there other ways beyond those triplet regimens that you could potentially maintain your per patient hep C revenues should others add on and get down to four weeks? Thanks.","John Martin","","Yeah hi, Brian. So, we have ledipasvir\/sofosbuvir reports that\u2019s under review that\u2019s genotype 1, initial approval, we have 5816 sofosbuvir combination that it\u2019s going into phase 3 and you will see some then very soon in the second half on clean trials then we have HIV a genotype 1 specific protease inhibitor 9451 and right we have a genotype 1 specific NS5B non-nucleus side inhibitor 9669. In addition, we are now moving very soon into Phase II, with a expansion of the protease inhibitor. So again to summarize all of this we are aiming for a genotypic regimen that either can be three drugs and it\u2019s probably going to be sofosbuvir with 5816 and the expansion of the big protease inhibitor. And we just have to establish the minimum treatment duration and we are conscious that we want to be the treatment duration not only for treatment na\u00efve non-cirrhotic patients to be shorter but also more difficult to treat treatment experience and cirrhotic patients to apply the same concept. And again we hope if everything goes well we will go into a larger Phase 2 study in the second half of this year or if we so choose, we could use 9451 and go directly into Phase 3. That all depends on what the emerging data looks like.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Roden of UBS. Your line is now open.","Matthew Roden - UBS Securities","","Great, thanks very much for taking question and congrats on the real nice launch here. So on the guidance where you\u2019ve included Sovaldi for the first time so you beat on HIV and you beat on hep C so far I think that I want to enter from the delta and sales guidance would imply straight line hep C sales in 3Q and 4Q despite current trends in the upcoming single to launch. So what I\u2019m trying to understand is, is this just a conservative and given the uncertainties Robin that you mentioned or is there specific reason we wouldn\u2019t see an uptake in the sales with the single pill?","And the just related real quick for Paul, in the hep C launch, is it possible for you to breakout the portion of patients for fibrotic and cirrhotic relative level of confidence that the less urgently sick patients will ultimately be treated down the line.","Robin Washington","","Hi Matt, its Robin I will take the first part of the question. I think the variables that we discussed are the one I mentioned and it came from lower to high range. I would remind to keep in mind than unlike HIV which is kind of care in HCV, we cure patients. So it\u2019s not necessarily as linear. But all the things that I talked about patient warehousing movement in inventory levels, the approval date, payor discussions all of these could price some variability in the range provided.","John Martin","","Okay. And just add the comments on the fibrosis scores, this data is inaccurate I would say, but our best estimate is it around 40% of patients are F3, S4, 60% patients treated to date are zero to F3. We don\u2019t have data on the cirrhotic level. But I did mention earlier that 80% of the patients treated are new to treatment, so consequently 20% are experienced patients and with the sicker ones.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets ","","Thanks. A quick question initially there was a lot of focus around you getting numbers around how many patients in U.S. were under care by an expert and I notice the numbers gone up a little bit to 93,000. Presumably that could be busted through over the next few years based on your trajectory. So just want to understand how you\u2019re thinking about opening up that 700,000 or so I guess 1.4 million to get to the point diagnosis number. So we can think about just beyond the next couple of years. And then simultaneously Europe a similar thinking but presumably much low price so when you think out maybe with long-term, what percent of U.S. sales do you think in Europe or U.S. could be?","John Martin","","With regard to the number of patients diagnosed and we are seeing certainly and your probably right about this as well a lot of doctors now reaching out the patients to have previously been diagnosed but have not been under care in the last 12 months. So that\u2019s why you see that numbers shift. The learning patients know that new options are available and better options are coming so there has been an increase in the number patients seeking care.","So I think that\u2019s been an important dynamic that we're witnessing, just really the beginning of this as we\u2019re launching Sovaldi and as this is now become available in certain plans and certain stage. ","We are confident that the increased cure rates it is treatment and the very important regimens that act more broadly across different types of patients will encourage patients to go get tested and bringing the care as well. So we think two thing will happen, one we\u2019ll test the higher percentage of people increasing the diagnose number and those patients who diagnosed will eventually seek care. I have to say the controversy Sovaldi is a constant daily reminder the patients it gives a very important new option available for them as well and I have to think that\u2019s been helpful as well. So we have a high degree of confidence in the future that more and more people now seeking care from the herpetologist as they have those options available.","Norbert Bischofberger","","Paul, you want to take the second part?","Paul Carter","","I don\u2019t remember what it was?","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets","Your percent of sales for U.S. ","Paul Carter","","I think that\u2019s really hard question Michael. It\u2019s going to be a different timing its reality because the countries in Europe are going to be slow to reimburse and improve the product. But I think the prevalence in Europe is just marginally below the U.S. So I think in volume terms the numbers could end up being very similar, the price point in Europe, it\u2019s going to be slightly less than Europe the ASP probably. So I think we can figure out -- the numbers are going to be fairly similar, some of the US probably slightly bigger than Europe in the end. It\u2019s spread over on the timeframe.","Operator","","Thank you, our next question comes from Phil Nadeau of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Company","","Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. I do have one on reimbursement. Could you give us some sense for the portion of people who are currently being denied coverage for Sovaldi? And how many people need for example to have their fibrosis status determined before they do get coverage. And then relatively what\u2019s your most recent thinking on the pricing for the combo pill, I think in the past you said Sovaldi contributes the most, the highest percentage of value to the pills, is that still your position, any updated thoughts would be appreciated, thanks.","Paul Carter","","I think I will have to come back to you on the fibrosis scores though, I don\u2019t know the answer to that. This is Paul by the way. I was thinking about the fixed dose combination pricing, we haven\u2019t come to a conclusion yet but I do think philosophically we feel the majority of the value in the fixed dose combination is within Sovaldi. ","Norbert Bischofberger","","So your question about reimbursement and denial of care, I mean we do have a significant number of patients who are getting some form of help from Gilead especially through patient assistance programs we do know that prior authorizations are being used in most of the plans, especially the Medicaid plans with a sense to slow down the rate of patients coming in to care and then we also know that this is now delaying putting patients on treatment, waiting for the fixed dose combination. So, it\u2019s a difficult thing to say who\u2019s being denied versus who\u2019s being delayed waiting for the all oral regimens to come on the market. It is difficult and I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll have a better answer for you anytime in the future either.","Operator","","Thank you, our next question comes from Yaron Werber of Citi; your line is now opened.","Yaron Werber - Citi ","","Right, thanks for taking my question, so I\u2019m sort of maybe a little bit of a follow on, on Phil\u2019s question and it\u2019s sort of in two parts. One, can you think of, I\u2019m just trying to get a sense; this is a unique situation where we\u2019re talking about an approved drug with a broad label and potential coverage denial. I mean, is that something that you can recall in the past even from a legal standpoint, are payers allowed to reject coverage? And then secondly, just a little bit from the Federal Trade Commission perspective. If you price the fixed dose combo in the way that\u2019s competitive and then Sovaldi plus another drug is materially more expensive, is that an issue from a federal trade given that you\u2019re going to be owning the market, thank you.","John Martin","","Yaron, your first question is kind of a broad one, has this ever happened in the industry and I don\u2019t know that I can speak to that, I certainly can\u2019t think of any situations that are similar to this. Although this drug is different than other drugs you know in many ways we were in the HIV field we were limiting the patients who are coming -- via guidelines not specifically through FDA labeling, so there were consideration there that we\u2019re not part of the FDA label and that\u2019s the one that comes to mind. Obviously we\u2019ve broadened those guidelines over time as the medicines got better and doctors got more comfortable putting patients on a higher and higher CD4 count and I think that\u2019s probably most analogous. But again since it\u2019s the care market we know you can make rational choices about who should come onto care today knowing that eventually you\u2019ll be able to get to all the patients, even though that may take many-many years to do so and will naturally take many-many years. I think the second part of your question was about pricing and so simply, we can\u2019t comment on pricing, our thoughts around pricing for an unapproved product and so I can\u2019t really comment and won\u2019t speculate on the outcomes that may happen with regard to that.","Operator","","Thank you, our next question comes from Ian Somaiya of Nomura Security; your line is now open.","Ian Somaiya - Nomura Security","","Thanks, I\u2019m going to follow the trend and maybe ask one question two parts, completely unrelated. Just on maybe switching topics a little bit, maybe starting off with NASH and maybe Norbert if you could provide us a update on the, what you feel on the regulatory requirements to get a drug approved for NASH in the US and Europe, and then just on pricing, following up on an earlier question, I know the thought seems to be that Sovaldi should be driving most or is providing most of the benefit so it should engender most of the pricing power, how do you balance that with a payer environment US and Europe which is basically reimbursing two drugs unless you are on Sovaldi which affects very similarly. ","Norbert Bischofberger","","So Ian quickly the approvable end point and I\u2019m simply telling you about the conversations we\u2019ve had with FDA as little as six months ago, US FDA felt that histology even for accelerated approval is not an approvable end point, they wanted to have some clinical evidence of efficacy and after a lot of conversations and forth involving experts, FDA agreed that changes in hepatic Venus pressure gradient at 48 weeks they would accept as a clinical end point and that\u2019s the study we\u2019re doing right now. Our study in NASH with people with cirrhosis actually uses hepatic Venus pressure gradient that week 48 as the end point, and that will of course -- we have to have a NASH study in bridging fibrosis patients and in those patients it will be histology. But the histology would be kind of the link between the two studies so that ultimately the end point must be hepatic Venus pressure gradient. Ian having that said FDA could change their mind, so I am simply telling you what we were told six months ago.","John Milligan","And your second question about pricing, this is John Milligan. These are always complicated things to think about in terms of the value that a product brings. The types of patients that would be appropriate for and the appropriate level of pricing based on that. And so due to things that we have to take into consideration as well as the external environment we\u2019re in and the competitive nature of future residents when we think about pricing. All those will factor into what the ultimate pricing decision will be on a fixed dose combination.","So I obviously can\u2019t tell you more than that because these things can\u2019t be talked about until after approvability, but these are the various factors that we used to think about that at ultimate price.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ravi Mehrotra of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Ravi Mehrotra - Credit Suisse","","Obviously you guys are taking cash generation. So you\u2019ll like to pull some capital allocation policy you previously talked about dividends. Are you any nearer to that? And concomitant to that, any philosophical change you are thinking how you accelerate your pipeline breadth, given your need arguably for higher future revenues given your higher current base.","Robin Washington","","Ravi I\u2019ll take the first part, I mean I think overall our capital structure practices remains similar to what we\u2019ve communicated in the past. We\u2019re committed to effectively leveraging our strong cash flow. And we\u2019re disciplined in thinking about it relative to the investments in growing our pipeline selective M&A as well as returning capital to shareholders.","The vehicle that we used to date our share repurchases with the increased level of cash flows and the repayment of debt we expect to continue to use share repurchases over and beyond the 1.7 billion year to date. We announced as we did on call that we will repurchase another 1.7 billion this quarter. And as you know we have a larger 5 billion repurchase program outstanding. So at this point should we still believe that that\u2019s the best vehicle for us to use, and it\u2019s consistent with our belief that we feel our shares are currently under value.","We continue to have discussions with management about using other vehicles. So we could in the future think about a dividend in addition to share repurchases.","John Milligan","Just income highlight the second part of your question about the accelerated amount of cash generation change thinking about bringing in our pipeline. Really the cash generation isn\u2019t material to our thinking this way. We have a lot of good things in the pipeline, as John Martin mentioned. He was only able to highlight a few of the many exciting things that are going on in our pipeline. We never had so many things going forward as we do today and we feel very, very confident in the pipeline that we have today. So our focus will be on selective deals in order to augment our pipeline in certain key areas. But with all the things going on so well, we fell that there isn\u2019t a strong need to do anything more than that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank","","Just to switch actually on HIV. So it looks like this drive build, your new patient share is going up and we\u2019ve done some math from the metrics you provided, looks like the amount of patients were switching of the current drug to sort of stable. So I just wanted to check and see if the math is right, that patients on current drugs switch is sort of stable? And then how do you see that influencing that switch market? And so you have any sense of how quickly that could occur over time?","John Milligan","I\u2019ll take this question. So single tablet regimen growth Robyn both in the U.S. and in Europe continues a nice steady trajectory upwards. We\u2019re seeing some switches out of the fab ring (ph) contained products within our single-tablet regimen. So patients are switching out of Atripla to some extent that is fairly slow and the majority, the vast majority of those switches out of Atripla are coming to either Stribild or Complera in the US or Eviplera in Europe. So we are pretty comfortable with that and pleased the way things are going.","Your question on TAF is really too early stage because the data coming out of the Phase 3 studies will be highly instructive as to the feature of our single tablet regimen treatment going forward.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank","As a follow up, our math says about 6% of people have switched and that has a sort of unstable over the last few quarters. Do you have any sense of how high that could go? Or is that important or not important to you?","John Milligan","It\u2019s very stable, I can\u2019t confirm the number you just quoted but I think it\u2019s ahead of low single digit levels and we are comfortable with that.","Operator","","Thank you, our next question comes from Joshua Schimmer of Piper Jaffray; your line is now open.","Josh Schimmer - Piper Jaffray","","Thanks for taking my questions. Prior to the Sovaldi launch, you indicated you\u2019re actively preparing payors for its impact, can you comment on how effective that\u2019s been today, where as you think you may have been able to improve their preparedness for next during beyond and to what extent do you think that may help curtail some of the constants during the compliance we read about in the press on price? Thanks.","John Milligan","","Hey Josh, it\u2019s John Milligan. So we did talk to payers about the impact I think they frankly thought they were going to see something was much more like a vertex launch for Incivek and so they were surprised that the knowledge is a product launch at such a high rate but also that will continue to grow where it is popped out very quickly with Incivek which is of course going to happen and a drug that is a high touch point for physicians with lots of labor necessary and long duration of treatment. So, I think that is simply didn\u2019t understand technically what happens if we only treat patients for 12 weeks and so they clearly understands a dynamic much better now, they understand also that the demand for all oral regimen is very high so the interest is high and I hope that will be preparing for this but it\u2019s hard for me to know exactly what they are going to do and how they are going to think about something like our all oral picks those combination which is coming out later this year.","Josh Schimmer - Piper Jaffray","Do you believe that\u2019s been a prime driver for kind of pricing noise concerns and complaints we have heard this year and will that a bet next year\u2019s result?","John Milligan","","Well, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s been the prime driver it\u2019s better to speak to the payors individual to have been saying these things and to me I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to have abatement next year or not I do know that has the value story growth I think that will be a greater appreciation that affect these patients have been appeared a lot of ancillary problems that they had will simplified and we believe that over time the healthcare system will save a lot of money by these patients being healthy again.","Josh Schimmer - Piper Jaffray","Okay, thank you.","Operator","","Thank you, our next question comes from Howard Liang of Leerink. Your line is now open.","Howard Liang - Leerink","","Thanks very much. Regarding the three phase 2 trials that read out in the fourth quarter for Simtuzumab in pancreatic, colorectal and myelofibrosis, what would you be looking for if you move forward and if can you talk about how important these oncology indications are for the amount of seven indications that you have at your testing for Simtuzumab?","Norbert Bischofberger","","We look into two solid tumor studies of course the end point is PFS and we will be looking for a convincing difference of PFS on the active arms versus the placebo and how convincing I can\u2019t tell you. Also both of them are have two doses of Simtuzumab 200 and 700 milligram. IV every two weeks and what would nice disease some dose response anybody something that would convince us to spend the money and time and resources going to phase 3 and as you may also know the end point in the myelofibrosis study is histology so again, we will be looking at something that just convince us that its worthwhile to put these drugs into further development.","How important these things are, I would say very important I mean I always said with Simtuzumab it\u2019s high risk because it\u2019s a novel target and as you know the lot of drugs against novel targets had never gone anywhere but if it works, this could be the really really useful drug for solid tumors. So, we are looking forward to learning more about the phase 2 data and that should happen in the October the second half of this year.","Howard Liang - Leerink","Thanks very much.","Operator","","Thank you, our next question comes from Brian Skorney of Robert W Baird. Your line is now open.","Brian Skorney - Robert W Baird","","Hey, good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess I\u2019m thinking a lot about the shortening duration of hep C therapy and I wondered if you can just comment strategically what options you have with Sovaldi in terms of pricing and access should data justify a four-week regimen through two company combination where Sovaldi is one of the agents I\u2019m thinking in particular of Bristol-Myers forward study if that does show four weeks of ISVR, in their scenario were next year in a price competitive way, you would see potentially a 50% reduction in the overall price per patient if Sovaldi remains at the same price. So, I guess if you could give any color on other options to change Sovaldi\u2019s pricing as a result of that?","John Martin ","","Brian, again we are not going to speculate on any pricing or regimens in the future that have been tested, we have a lot of options within our own regimens and we will undoubtedly options with the combinations of regimens in the future as there is the potential to get down to shorter and shorter durations certainly we have already shown that six weeks is possible at their own combinations until there maybe others that can get better as well. But I don\u2019t want to I\u2019m not going to publicly speculate about what we might not do with regard the pricing in the future we\u2019ll just have to see how these things play out and we\u2019ll make decisions accordingly in the future.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Matthew Harrison - Morgan Stanley","","Thanks for taking the question. I just want to ask change the topic and ask about idea less, obviously you got approval today on both indications I just wanted ask one obviously coming much earlier than you expected and if that change so how do you think about the launch and then also what you think about the impact as the black box is relative requirement of the EMS. Thanks.","Norbert Bischofberger","","Matthew thanks for asking about that. Idelalisib it first this comes up with great news for us it\u2019s our first oncology product and we\u2019re all proud and happy about it, a goodness of price the one that it came sooner because we always new FDA was working towards this we have breakthrough status on one of the indications and the other make a comment about the black box from the clinical point of view. So first all Idelalisib is a highly effective drug for certain patients and we believe a lot of patients were benefiting from it actually in our clinical studies looking at some of the statistics eight out of 10 have benefit.","Secondly, you have to realize the data sets that we submitted to FDA both for the NHL, the two NHL and the CLL indications were relatively small. And to study one month fix with 110 patients on one arm and the total of the SLL and FL patients in the NHL study was about a 100.","So we\u2019re left with a relatively small data set. And the data is the data. These events were observed, we did have fatalities. This is in patient population that is otherwise old age mostly very sick that takes other medications and we together with FDA felt that it was appropriate to include conservative warnings in the prescribing information. I also like to remind you we have a total of five additional clinical studies ongoing, two in CLL which in the month or two should be volume rolled, two in NHL both for relapse and one in front line therapy CLL to a five additional clinical studies and from these studies, this was inform us further about the safety profile of Idelalisib and as the data merged we may update the legal.","Paul, do you want to add anything?","Paul Carter","","I just like to add that our commercial scene has been preparing for Idelalisib launch a quite a well now. We have a fully recruited team with recruited some very high kind of the people from companies that have high levels oncology experience while they seem trained they are in field and they are promoting the product as of today, we\u2019re really very excited about it.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Thomas Wei of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Company","","Thanks. A question on top with data coming up in the third quarter I wanted to get your perspective on why you think is a clinically meaningful improvement on either the bone side or the renal side when comparing a TAF versus a regimen. Thanks.","John Martin","","Thomas, we obviously thought a lot about this and so if you look at the totality of the VF data I think we can comfortably and confidently say that the BMD effects overall are not clinically relevant. We can also say that with the exception of a few patients that this continues also small degree of decrease in creatinine clearance does not have any clinically significant effects. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see this in the Phase 3 study Thomas but I think what we will see will be what we saw regular Phase 2 study that there will much less or no decrease in BMD, there will be much less or no decrease in creatinine clearance but I think with the clinical relevant is from the renal impairment study.","We have a study about 290 patients where we are testing the easier ECF TAF rate down to creatinine clearance of 30. And that would be a really important point if you could see there is no renal effect in laboratory while there is no BMD effect, moreover you don\u2019t have to dose or dose interval just down to creatinine clearance of 30 and if the regulatory authority accept this we also don\u2019t have to do regular creatinine checks. So I think it would be a very safe much more -- physicians and patients would feel more comfortable with this and then we would be ahead, if we didn\u2019t have these laboratory abnormalities.","Operator","","Thank you. And at this time we have time for one last question. Our final question comes from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs ","","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Maybe just follow up on that TAF can you quantify for us the percentage of patients with HIV that have renal impairment and then also maybe stratify by age now the HIV patient cohort that maybe would be at highest risk for having fracture or low BMD given their age, and then the second part of the question is, I noticed during your remarks you said you\u2019ve seen a minimal impact from generics Incivek in Europe right now on market share, but what about pricing, any impact there either now or maybe in the future, thank you.","John Martin","","Yes so, Terrence just quickly from a -- you know I can\u2019t give you specific numbers but qualitatively of course you know that the HIV population in the US and in other parts of the world is aging. With increasing age creatine or renal function declines and this will be just more convenient and safe for use of the drug if you have borderline creatinine clearance of 60 or 50 you will not worry about any adverse, renal adverse events to be happening with TAF whereas [indiscernible] as you know has to be dosed in a well adjusted when you come down to creatinine clearance of 50 or 70 in case of Stribild.","Paul Carter","","Yes, and maybe I can just comment on the pricing question to Steve in Europe, so, the product that is affected is Atripla and we price Atripla on a one plus one basis. What we have seen is the branded prices, Sustiva has followed down to some extent the generic price of generic efavirenz, nevertheless the price of Atripla we managed to keep above slight that one plus one level and that recognizes the value of the single tablet regimen, and as I said also earlier where patients are switching out of Atripla for CNS reasons associated with efavirenz, most of those switches are coming to Gilead products notable 70% in quarter 2 went to Eviplera.","John Martin ","","Thank you, Sam and thank you all for joining us today, we appreciate your continued interest in Gilead and the team here looks forward to providing you with updates on our future progress.","Operator","","Thank you sir, ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference, this does conclude today\u2019s program, you may all disconnect.

My name is Karen, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Sung Lee, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thank you, Karen; and good afternoon, everyone. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the third quarter 2017. The press release and detailed slides are available on the Investor Relations section on the Gilead website.","The speakers on today's call will be John Milligan, President and Chief Executive Officer; Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Meyers, Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations. Also in the room with us for the Q&A session are Kevin Young, Chief Operating Officer; Norbert Bischofberger, Executive Vice President of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer; and Alessandro Riva, Executive Vice President, Oncology Therapeutics.","Before we begin with our prepared comments, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, financial projections and the use of capital, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements.","A description of these risks can be found in the latest SEC disclosure documents and recent press releases.

The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release, as well as on the Gilead website.","I will now turn the call over to John.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thank you, Sung. It's been an incredibly busy and exciting few months here at Gilead. In late August, we announced the planned acquisition of Kite. About five weeks later, we completed the transaction and Kite and Gilead began operating as one company. Only 15 days after close, we received FDA approval for Yescarta, the first CAR-T therapy approved for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy. Kite and Gilead employees are now working together to prepare for the first patients to enter Yescarta treatment.","Consistent with the requirement of the Yescarta REMS program, the Kite team has begun collaborating with academic cancer centers to finalize training and complete certification. The first 13 centers are expected to be approved in about two weeks and each center will be able to accept patients for Yescarta treatment as soon as the approval is received.","As those of you who followed Kite know, this will be a controlled launch to ensure patient safety. CAR-T therapy is complicated and can sometimes be associated with severe side effects. Even though the medical community has been learning over the course of the clinical trials how to more effectively manage adverse events, proper training and preparation for health care teams in oncology and transplantation centers is essential to help ensure the best outcome for CAR-T patients.","Yescarta is a transformational therapy for patients who have run out of options and who are waiting for new treatments that may help them with their fight against cancer. And we greatly appreciate the partnership and leadership of FDA to approve Yescarta ahead of the PDUFA date, helping ensure it reaches patients as quickly as possible. Historically, only 7% of patients with refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma achieve a complete response, and patients on average shift six months when treated with the current standard of care. Yescarta serves the population who largely run out options and is essential to expedite access for those patients.","The approval of the Yescarta is supported by data from the ZUMA-1 pivotal trial. In this study, 72% of patients treated with a single infusion of Yescarta responded to therapy, including 51% of patients who had a complete response and the median duration of response had not yet been reached after median follow-up of 7.9 months.","Data from patients enrolled in the ZUMA-1 study who've had a minimum 12 months of follow-up will be presented at the American Society of Hematology meeting in December. Also at ASH, results will be presented from ZUMA-3, a Phase 1\/2 study in adult patients with refractory or relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Once the drug is approved, the work continues, of course. There are a number of studies of the Yescarta and other lymphomas in earlier lines of therapy that are planned or ongoing.","Additionally, clinical studies of CD-19 CAR-Ts, or modified T-cell receptor T-cells are planned or ongoing in B-cell malignancies, leukemias, or solid tumors. Beyond these studies, Gilead and Kite will continue to invest in research and development in order to bring forward future generations of CAR-Ts and TCRs with a goal of increasing short and long-term complete response rates and improving safety.","Gilead along with our new employees at Kite is proud to be part of the advancement of an innovative cellular therapy that is bringing hope and benefit to patients. I would like to take a moment to commend and congratulate Arie Belldegrun and the Kite team for what they have accomplished. CAR-T is among the most significant breakthroughs in cancer treatment in decades. And I look forward to sharing more about our progress in the coming months.","Moving to other therapeutic areas, we continue to make significant progress with our liver disease pipeline. Last week researchers presented more than 40 abstracts, featuring a Gilead product or investigational compound at the Liver Meeting in Washington, D.C. including data on HCV, HBV, or NASH.","During the late breaking abstract session, important Phase 2 data results for GS-0976, our investigational ACC inhibitor, were presented in patients with NASH. The data demonstrated that GS-0976 led to significant reductions in measures of liver fat and certain biomarkers of liver fibrosis compared to placebo. This is the first randomized placebo-controlled Phase 2 study of an ACC inhibitor in NASH. The study suggests that GS-0976 has a potential to play an important role in treating patients with the disease.","We're also conducting Phase 2 combination studies of GS-0976 with Gilead's ASK-1 inhibitor, selonsertib, and the selective non-steroidal FXR agonist, GS-9674 in patients with NASH. Depending on the outcomes of these trials, we may initiate larger Phase 2 combination studies next year.","Also at the Liver Meeting, researchers presented new data that demonstrate high cure rates in difficult to treat patients with Gilead's hepatitis C treatments and improved long-term bone and renal safety among patients with hepatitis B who are treated with Vemlidy, adding to the body of evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of Gilead's viral hepatitis therapies in diverse patient populations.","In September, we announced that Sovaldi received approval in China. The first approval for a product that Gilead will launch directly in that country. Approximately, 10 million people are estimated to be living with HCV in China, highlighting a tremendous need, the regulatory filings for Harvoni and Epclusa are planned in the near future.","We have begun hiring a team to support the launch of Sovaldi and future products with a focus on medical education and market access. Gilead's products serve important unmet needs in China, and in addition to the HCV products, we have filed the MAA for Vemlidy for HBV, and filings are planned for a number of our HIV products.","As you'll hear from Jim in a few minutes, our TAF-based regimens are performing extremely well. In August, we announced that bictegravir, FTC\/TAF, also known as B\/F\/TAF, our investigational fixed-dose combination of the integrase strand transfer inhibitor bictegravir and the Descovy background was accepted by FDA with prior review with a PDUFA date of February 12, 2018.","Reviews also are underway in Europe with regulatory action expected toward the middle of next year. Data from two Phase 3 studies of B\/F\/TAF, demonstrating non-inferiority to dolutegravir-based triple-therapy regimens were presented at the International AIDS Society Conference in Paris in July. Earlier this month, we presented Phase 3 data on B\/F\/TAF, demonstrating non-inferiority when switching from a boosted Protease inhibitor-based regimen. These data suggest that B\/F\/TAF may be appropriate for a broad range of people living within HIV.","In conclusion, we're confident in the underlying strength of Gilead's business, driven by the successful execution of key product launches and advancement of various programs in HIV, liver disease, and now, cellar therapy, all of which positions us well for long-term success.","I will now turn the call over to Robin, who will review our financial performance for the quarter.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thanks, John; and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to share our financial results for the third quarter of 2017. Total revenues for the third quarter were $6.5 billion with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.27. This compares to revenues of $7.5 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.75 for the same period last year.","Product sales for the third quarter were $6.4 billion, down 14% year-over-year and down 9% sequentially. As expected, we continue to see the impact of lower HCV patient start and the beginning effects of increased competition on our HCV franchise in the third quarter. The declines in HCV revenue were partially offset by the strong uptake of our HIV portfolio, resulting in increased non-HCV revenues.","Turning to the U.S. Product sales for the third quarter were $4.5 billion, down 10% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. HCV product sales were $1.4 billion, down 31% year-over-year and 26% sequentially. The declines were primarily driven by lower patient starts and the effects of increased competition.","Non-HCV product sales were $3.1 billion, up 4% year-over-year, and 2% sequentially, driven primarily by higher demand for our TAF-based regimens. As a reminder, our prior-year third quarter revenues benefited from a favorable adjustment of $332 million to rebate reserve primarily related to our TDF-based regimens. Excluding this adjustment, our non-HCV revenues grew 16% year-over-year.","Turning to Europe. Product sales for the third quarter were $1.2 billion, down 15% year-over-year and 14% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to competitive dynamics in HCV and the loss of exclusivity for Viread and Truvada as was expected. The sequential decline was primarily due to the recognition of deferred revenue in the second quarter related to an HCV contract as well as lower total HCV market patient starts.","Now, turning to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $745 million for the third quarter, down 24% compared to the same period last year due primarily to the 2016 impact of a $200 million milestone expense associated with Nimbus. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses for the third quarter were $806 million compared to $780 million in the prior year.","Moving to the balance sheet. During the third quarter, we generated cash flows from operations of $2.7 billion and ended the quarter with $41.4 billion in cash and investments, inclusive of $3 billion in cash raised for the Kite acquisition via a debt issuance of senior unsecured notes. In October, we raised an additional $6 billion in term loans to fund a portion of the acquisition. We paid cash dividends of $682 million and repurchased 2 million shares of stock for $153 million in the third quarter.","Our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged and we will continue to prioritize the use of capital for investing in the long-term growth of our business.","Finally, I would like to update our full-year 2017 guidance provided to you on July 26 and summarize on slide 21 in the earnings results presentation available on our corporate website.","We are increasing the lower end of our previous range of net product sales guidance. We now expect net product sales to be between $24.5 billion to $25.5 billion. Non-HCV net product sales are expected to be in the range of $16 billion to $16.5 billion. HCV net product sales are expected to be in the range of $8.5 billion to $9 billion. We are decreasing the range for product gross margin to 86% to 87%.","R&D expense is expected to be in the range of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion. SG&A expense is expected to be in the range of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion. We are decreasing the range for the effective tax rate to 25% to 27%. This guidance is subject to a number of uncertainties which are highlighted on slide 21 in the earnings results presentation, including the accuracy of our estimates for HCV patient starts for the remainder of 2017, and lower-than-expected market share and greater price erosion in HIV as the result of the introduction of generic versions of TDF and the fixed-dose combination of FTC\/TDF outside the U.S.","I will now turn the call over to Jim to discuss Gilead's commercial performance during the quarter.","James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","All right. Well, thank you, Robin; and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to provide an update on our commercial performance for the third quarter, starting with HIV. In the U.S., our HIV and HBV franchise delivered another very strong quarter, with revenues of $2.7 billion. TAF-based regimens now account for 56% of Gilead's total HIV prescription volume, up from 39% as we entered 2017. This rapid migration to TAF-based regimens reflects widespread physician acceptance of the Descovy backbone. Genvoya has been the most prescribed therapy across all categories, treatment-na\u00efve, switch and total treated patients since the third quarter of 2016.","In addition, Descovy is on track to surpass both Atripla and Truvada to become the second most successful HIV product launch in U.S. history behind only Genvoya.","We continue to see strong uptake of Truvada for PrEP. As we exited the third quarter, there were approximately 145,000 people in the U.S. taking Truvada for this indication, representing a five-fold increase since January 2015.","Even with this accelerated growth, however, the CDC estimates that there are still approximately 40,000 people infected each year. We have seen the impact of the use of Truvada for PrEP along with other prevention efforts on reducing new infections in certain communities in the U.S. And in hopes of building on this success in other regions, Gilead launched two new targeted media campaigns during the quarter aimed at educating people in at-risk populations who currently have low awareness of HIV prevention and PrEP.","Turning to Europe, total HIV and HBV revenues were $716 million in the third quarter, down 2% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. The quarter-on-quarter decrease was driven by the entries of generic TDF and TDF\/FTC. Like in the U.S., strong uptake of our TAF-based regimens continues throughout Europe. Genvoya is the most prescribed therapy for both treatment-na\u00efve and switch patients across the top five European markets. Physician and patient preference for TAF-based regimens remains strong, resulting in a 25% sequential quarterly revenue growth for the TAF portfolio.","In early launch markets like Germany, TAF-based regimens already account for more than 75% of Gilead's total HIV prescription volume. In France, Europe's largest HIV market, twice as many patients are switching to Genvoya as to any other regimen. And finally, in Italy, the uptake of both Descovy and Genvoya over the first four months of launch exceeded that of any prior HIV launch in the country.","Turning to Hep C. Total HCV revenues in the U.S. were $1.4 billion in the third quarter, down 31% year-over-year and down 26% sequentially. The quarter-on-quarter decrease was driven by declining HCV patient starts and the impact of increased competition. 39,000 patients began treatment on a Gilead regimen during the quarter, down 9% from the prior quarter, continuing the gradual decline in HCV patient starts that we've seen since the beginning of 2017.","In July, we launched Odefsey. The first single tablet regimen approved for the retreatment of adults with chronic HCV, fulfilling the unmet need for an effective regimen for patients who could not be cured with other therapies. For this small group of patients, Odefsey provides an important new treatment option.","Turning to Europe. We continue to see strong uptake of Epclusa, which is now the leading HCV regimen across the major European markets. We are also pleased to report that the European Commission granted marketing authorization for Odefsey in July with reimbursement already achieved in Germany. And reimbursement is on track in other countries as payers acknowledge the unmet medical need.","Overall, Gilead HCV patient starts in Europe were approximately 21,000 for the quarter. Over the course of 2017, we have observed lower patient starts in some of our early launch markets, partially offset by the impact of broader patient access in countries like Italy and France. And earlier this month, Spain and Switzerland granted access \u2013 expanded access by removing fibrosis score restrictions.","Before moving away from HCV, I wanted to say a few words about the impact of new competition.","As we have noted in the past, revenues in the HCV market are driven by four variables. Patient starts, net pricing, market share, and treatment duration. While patient starts have exceeded our expectations in 2017, the arrival of new competition has further eroded Gilead's market share and net pricing, which is now similar across genotypes. Some of those changes can be seen in our third quarter results. But the impact on pricing and market share will be more fully reflected beginning in the fourth quarter.","Importantly, we have worked with payers to ensure the position in patient access to Harvoni and Epclusa in 2018 will remain similar to what we saw in 2017. We believe that Gilead has the most comprehensive offering of treatments for patients with all types of HCV; importantly, backed by real-world cure rates comparable to clinical trial results.","I'd like to close on the topic John began with. And that is last week's U.S. approval of Yescarta, which came in full six weeks ahead of the PDUFA day. Upon approval, we immediately began work to certify 16 leading cancer centers in 13 states to administer Yescarta. Given the exciting promise of CAR-T therapy and patient need, our new colleagues are actively working to train more than 20 additional institutions with an eventual target of 70 to 90 centers across the U.S.","As we embark on this revolutionary new approach to treating cancer, our colleagues at Kite are working extensively with payers and institutions to educate them on CAR-T and Yescarta as well as collaborating with other key stakeholders to ensure understanding of the therapy's value and how to navigate the implementation and reimbursement processes.","In keeping with our long-standing commitment to help make Gilead therapies accessible to patients in need, we are pleased to have Kite Connect in place. This is a program developed by the Kite team that is customized to meet the unique needs of seriously ill cancer patients. We look forward to updating you on the progress with the Yescarta launch in the coming months.","In closing, I would like to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their commitment and dedication. For the Gilead employees who continue to work hard to ensure patients have access to our life-saving medications and for our new colleagues at Kite who have been able to bring a breakthrough cancer treatment to patients with no other options.","I would now like to open the call for your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Afternoon, and thanks for the question. Just to follow on some of the recent comments in your prepared remarks on Hep C. You guys have had some success last quarter and recently growing new starts. What's been this trend of late, especially now with the new product in the market from AbbVie. And I know you don't want to go into too much detail, but maybe speak generally to the length of commercial and public contracts just thinking of the dynamics looking into next year and beyond. Thank you.","James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Sure. I think there were a couple of questions in here. Maybe I'll deal with the contracts, which you mentioned. So what happened really is what typically is a 12-month contractual cycle that we're used to, really became a 15-month contractual cycle just largely based upon the timing of the launch of the new competition. So everything that we're working through right now in terms of finalizing the contractual process are contracts that will go through the balance of 2018.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hey, Geoff, it's Kevin Young here. Let me add a little bit on the starts. The starts overall were down for the total HCV market down 51,000 for this quarter, the third quarter versus 53,000. And there was also some change as you would expect because there is a new entrant in our market share. There was a tiny bit of pricing effect, but as Jim pointed out, that pricing and share effect will have a bigger impact in the fourth quarter and then rolling into 2018.","I have to say I think we're still in a really strong position, as Jim pointed out for 2018. We have really preserved the availability in our commercial payers and Part D for 2018 to use our options for Hepatitis C. So that's what we were really asked to do by our hepatologists and I think it gives them the option to use the best-in-class therapies, whatever the genotype. So whilst we are seeing changes from competition, and that is somewhat inevitable, we still believe we're in a strong position with regards to our portfolio.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with Jefferies.","Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC","Thanks for the question. Following along in Hep C, realizing that this is an issue, I think, people want to see stabilize out. How are you thinking about the dynamics you mentioned as you go into 2018? And the step-down you could see in fourth quarter and then going into 2018? In other words, where do you think patient starts and market share start to stabilize out? Do you think you'll see that by the first half of 2018? How are you thinking about that so investors can get confident about the flattening out.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hi, Mike. It's Robin. I'll take that. As you know, we updated guidance for 2017, but \u2013 and we're not going to use this call to really start to talk about 2018. I will go back to the overall factors that Jim mentioned. Clearly, looking at patient starts, net pricing, share and treatment duration. To Jim's earlier comments, clearly pricing and contracting, we'll continue to work through and complete by the end of the year. But the impact of those other variables are things that we'll work into as we provide guidance to you for 2018 next February.","Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC","Okay.","(28:04)","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Let me just add a little bit to Robin's comments. I think I've said on the last call that in terms of patient volume, it was looking like between 185,000 and about 200,000. We would sense that it's tracking to the kind of higher end of that in terms of patient starts. What happens next year, as Robin says, remains to be seen. The numbers that we have for Europe that we've put in our original guidance seem to be pretty solid and so do Japan. So the rates of treatment is still going on out there.","Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Let me just ask it this way then. If there's a new competitor coming on, but the contracts are basically stabilized, do you think the large step-down or drop is basically going to be seen this quarter and then should stabilize after? And in other words, we're going to see the drop here coming up and then, that's really the big change here.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yeah. Michael, I would say that I think that in the fourth quarter you'll see more fully the impact of new competition on both price and share. We're not through with the contracting process. So again, I think that to Robin's point, we will issue guidance. We'll have a more complete picture of what 2018 looks like as we get closer to there. I can just tell you that again, we hope to \u2013 we believe strongly we'll be able to maintain access for physicians and patients in 2018 similar to what we had in 2017. We have been able to maintain parity and preferred access with the major payers at least in the Medicare and commercial books of business with those that we've worked with so far.","Again, we also have maintained parity access in the VA. Where we will continue to remain disadvantaged is in the Medicaid segment, particularly the Medicaid Managed Care segment. But again, in those scenarios, we're mainly seeing Mavyret replace Zepatier. But in the areas where we got the majority of our business and had the greatest access, we will remain either at parity and preferred access, and we are very confident in our ability, when all of this shakes out, to continue to remain market leader from a share perspective.","Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Appreciate that.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets.","Brian Abrahams - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys, thanks very much for taking my question. Maybe shifting gears away from Hep C. You recently present data for GS-0976 at the AASLD Conference. Was wondering if you could maybe give us a little bit more details in terms of your view of the benefit risk there and manageability of some of the lipid changes. Where this mechanism could potentially fit into the paradigm relative to the other therapies in your portfolio? And the next steps of that asset? Thanks.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yeah, Brian. It's Norbert. So thanks for that question. Yeah, we presented data \u2013 12 weeks data by the way. We couldn't do a longer study, because we didn't have the supporting talks, (31:28) talks done. That's done now, of course. And the data showed that there was a good reduction in liver fat as measured by MRI. There were also certain markers of fibrosis \u2013 biomarkers of fibrosis were down. Not all of them, but it looked then there was a dose response. So it was a very nicely behaved compound. And as John said in his prepared remarks, we will almost certainly start combination studies sometime next year.","Now, you mentioned one side effect that we did see that was clearly drug-related was triglyceride elevations. Now two comments to that. First of all, out of the 16, the large majority, 12, occurred in patients that already started with high triglycerides of 250 or higher. Secondly, some of these triglyceride elevations were reduced to a lesser grade with continued dosing. So it seems to be an immediate effect. We think actually, by the way, mechanistic, it's a redistribution effect. You shut down lipid synthesis and then the triglycerides come by releasing VLDL from the liver. That's one hypothesis that we have. In the future, how we're going to manage this is, first of all, with statins or fish oil, and number two, by excluding those patients that have high triglycerides at baseline.","We think this is manageable. As I said, either with con-meds or with choosing the patients carefully, and over time, the triglycerides may go down to normal levels. Again, we don't have data right now beyond 12 weeks. We will see that in the next study.","Brian Abrahams - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks, Norbert.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Geoff Porges with Leerink.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much. Norbert, I'll follow up with another question for you. It's concerning filgotinib, and I'm just wondering if you could give us a sense of the approximate cumulative exposure to the drug. And what number of VT events you've seen? I know the studies are blinded, but presumably you've been notified and you're watching for these events. And then perhaps you could comment on whether you think that there is a class signal here or molecule-specific signals, or no signal.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yeah, Geoff. Thanks for the question. So the one study that's published where they looked at background venothrombolic events in RA points to a number of six per 1,000 patient years. So it's very rare, but it does occur in inflammatory conditions. Now, if you look across all the studies that have been published with JAK inhibitors, there's a pretty good variation. And while I don't \u2013 and by the way, we also believe that there is insufficient evidence that any of these JAK inhibitors that it's drug related. The numbers are just too small.","So we (34:46) 1,300 patient years' experience with filgotinib across all our clinical studies. And I don't want to tell you the number that we have in terms of these events. It's very small. But if you look at the rate per patient year exposures, we're at the very low end of what other companies have seen and what has been reported in the literature.","And the last thing I would like to add, Geoff, if you believe that these events are drug-related and if you believe that the mechanism has to do with JAK2 inhibition \u2013 and as I think I mentioned last time, there's a paper published that looked at a JAK2 knockout mouse, and those mice had higher platelet levels. So it's entirely possible that somehow the venous \u2013 the thromboembolic events have to do with high platelet levels, then we should not have that effect, because number one, filgotinib doesn't inhibit JAK2. And number two, we actually see platelets going down in our studies. So this is the extent of my wisdom that I have on this subject.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks, Norbert. I appreciate it.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Okay, Geoff. You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks very much for taking the question. If I could ask something on Yescarta. I guess I was looking for some of your insight about some of the dynamics that could influence the launch. And I guess two that come to mind for me are, one, can you talk a little bit about how the drug's going be paid for? Obviously, DRGs don't cover the total cost, especially for Medicare patients, and so how you think the financial impact to hospitals will play into the use.","And then, second, maybe you could comment on the impact of the other sort of clinical trials that are going on at these centers, which I'm sure are in high demand and how you think that could impact the launch. Thanks.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Sure. Well, I'll take the first part and then maybe some combination \u2013 yeah, Alessandro on the second. But let me step back for a minute and just remind that the payer mix for \u2013 we believe, and I think we feel fairly confident about this \u2013 will be about 50% to 60% commercial; the rest, largely Medicare; a little bit of Medicaid. And remember, within Medicare, there's a portion that is DRG-related and a portion that isn't. All the discussions the Kite folks have had with payers to this point, both government and private payers have indicated that they believe that they will cover Yescarta beginning an approval while they update the medical policies and so forth.","Now, there's a difference between covering and reimbursement obviously. And reimbursement levels will vary by payer segment and also by the contractual agreements that exist between hospital and payers, which are independent of anything that we're involved with. We do believe that over time that Medicare DRG segments will probably at most grow to approximate about a third of the payer mix. They won't be close to that in the first year or so because, again, most of these centers are PPS exempt, meaning that they are not reimbursed based on DRGs and it's more about fee-for-service and more like a commercial-type reimbursement. Even with that, these hospitals are well adept at using non-CAR-T DRGs until they actually have a CAR-T-specific DRG.","And I think it's important to remember that what we're dealing with right now is not new. Every hospital-based product launched in the last 20 years has done so without a DRG at launch. So it's not like they're having to figure this out for the first time. So there's experienced people in these cancer centers that do this for stem cell transplants, that do this for every product, hospital base that they've had come in.","And last thing I'll say and then turn it to Alessandro is just, one of the prerequisites of these cancer centers being certified to administer CAR-T was a determination that reimbursement would be sufficient to make this financially feasible for them based on their payer mix. So we don't \u2013 obviously, we would love to have, and we will have, in a couple of years the CAR-T-specific DRG. We have NATAP and things we can do in the interim. But this is not novel ground and hospitals are very adept at using other DRGs and other codes to get sufficient reimbursement.","Alessandro Riva - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yes. This is Alessandro. I'll elaborate that the dynamics, I think, will also change dramatically, because we are dealing with the lifesaving treatment. And we expect that Yescarta will become the standard-of-care for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma after oral therapy. So it is a transformative therapy. And we think that the community, the physician, and the payers will work together towards making sure that the Yescarta is available to patients.","So we have done the clinical trials in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in around 15 centers mainly focusing in United States of America. Now we are expanding to most centers in the U.S. and also in Europe. In terms of not only diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, but also our pivotal trials in other B-cell malignancies. So we are very confident that we will have the support from the community, from the regulators to implement this trial. And we'll work together to make sure that we serve both the patient needs that are in relapsed-refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, for whom Yescarta is indicated, and, of course, for patients that will be eligible for our clinical trials.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hey, Matthew. It's Kevin. There's always a worry with the start of a new kind of market about will there be commercial patients versus clinical trials. I remember in the early days of RA that was always a worry. But my experience is that there's always a demand with high need patients, as Alessandro said, for treatment from an FDA-approved product. And as Alessandro says, Kite have by far the biggest clinical trial base upon which to introduce Yescarta. So with 40 some centers that have actually had clinical experience that's a really strong base for the commercial introduction.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Perfect. Very helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen and Company.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I did want to drill down on the HCV pricing a bit more with a two-part question. The first is, does Gilead itself understand how the average revenue per patient will change quarter-over-quarter in Q4? Or is it somewhat of a fluid situation where you yourselves aren't entirely sure yet how price would change? Second, I was wondering if you could \u2013 if you do have somewhat of an understanding, could you give us some sense of a magnitude of the quarter-over-quarter change in average revenue per patient in Q4 over Q3? Is it like 5%, 10%? Whatever you can tell us would be appreciated.","James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yes, no, I would say it's \u2013 again, as we mentioned, we're still in the process right now. We've made a lot of good progress, but it's not complete. So we're not in a position to speak about that right now. But, again, what we can signal to you is that pricing in general is similar across genotypes and it has gravitated down towards 8-weak genotypes one pricing. And, again, you'll see that more fully reflected in the fourth quarter although as they said, the process of 2018 contracting is not fully complete during this quarter.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hey, Phil, for this quarter, quarter three versus quarter two, it was by far driven by patient starts and share. It was a 4-point difference going from 80% to 76%. It was just a tad, it was just a little of pricing. But, as Jim says, that will become a bigger effect in Q4.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC","That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Alethia Young with Credit Suisse.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. It's probably for you, Norbert. Just wanted you to talk a little bit about the interim PSA (43:58) readout in GS-9674. Just will we get efficacy general thoughts, and then, also, Norbert, just after some of the discussion in the community around FXRs with Ocaliva, I guess, I just wanted to get your general thoughts on some of the tolerability around liver and lipids and different things. Thanks.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Alethia, this question was about FXR or the ACC in it, or both?","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","FXR.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","The GS-9674. FXR.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah, GS-9674.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","FXR? Okay. No, so you will see \u2013 so we have a Phase 2 study kind of ending. We should have data fairly soon. That's going to be a 24-week study, by the way. And you will see data then presented probably at EASL. We haven't really decided yet where we're going to go with those. But what we have seen, it's well-thought. There's no effect; it's well tolerated. We think \u2013 I think we have disclosed that it releases FGF19, that has been published.","So the only question is, is the GI-generated FGF19 that then goes to deliver, is that enough to have the same efficacy as, for instance, in FXR agonist that actually gets physically to deliver. That's the question we haven't answered yet. That will come with the Phase 2 study. So we hope we'll have some data on that.","But FXR, clearly, it's a proven mechanism with OCA. The FLINT study was published a few years ago in NEJM. Again, the OCA has some drawbacks. And we think with a gut-restricted FXR agonist that we have, we could probably potentially solve some of those downsides.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Citi.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thank you. I just want to follow up on one of the comments you made about, right, the hospitals that you're training believe that they're reimbursement \u2013 there's a valuable reimbursement environment for CAR-T. I just have a question around that. So, I guess, the first is like are you incorporating any value-based pricing at these four pairs? Is that incorporated at all so we know how to model the price per patient?","And the second is, tell me more about what that means for the hospital? Does that mean that they're going to be very comfortable, trying CAR-T and not worrying about reimbursement? Or do you think they'll still want to treat patients more fully just to get more comfortable with the reimbursement environment? Thanks.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Sure, Robyn. Thank you. Just touching on value-based pricing at first, we are in ongoing and active discussions with really all commercial and government payers, including CMS. And I can convey to you there are varying degrees of interest and ability to execute value-based contracts. It truly does vary by payer. You may be aware there's a lot of operational complexities to this in addition to just government price barriers to implementing this across all payer segments. But we have communicated our openness to considering solutions \u2013 any and all solutions to improve patient access regardless of what they may be. It may end up not being value-based pricing, it could be something different. But we're very open to it.","There's a reason why to our knowledge, we don't \u2013 at least, historically, we haven't seen value-based pricing in oncology. It's not the easiest to execute under current regulations. But we're open to that. I think that remember what I said that a lot \u2013 part of the certification process and the vetting process at these hospitals is, these are hospitals that are very used to having to do the same thing with stem cell transplants; understanding who's a commercial patient, who's a Medicare patient; where am I going to get reimbursed at this level; where am I going to get reimbursed at that level. So they really are conducting the same type of calculus here. And one of the reasons why they end up coming onboard is they feel they can make this work for them.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yeah. I think, Robyn, just for modeling purposes, I would just take out $3.73 (48:25) as the price per patient. I think that's probably a good way to think about it for you.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. That's actually really helpful. That's what I needed. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for take the question. I was just wondering following the launch of bictegravir next year, obviously, in addition to the share capture from some other regimens. Just wondering if you'd expect to see a meaningful step-up in the rate of conversion to TAF from your Viread regimens here? Or do you expect that the rate would actually continue as we've seen over the last few years? Thanks.","James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yes. Maybe just a first comment, anyone jump in. It would be hard to see a more rapid conversion to TAF than we've seen in the two years since the \u2013 really less than two years since the launch of Genvoya. As we said, we're at 56%. We would anticipate that by considering the mid-February PDUFA date for B\/F\/TAF that we could be around two-third. So that has exceeded our expectations. So there will be a \u2013 again, by 2020, we anticipate that the only folks still remaining on TDF will largely be Truvada for PrEP at that point. So there will already have been a significant conversion to TAF even before B\/F\/TAF launches.","What we \u2013 obviously, we see TAF as really the culmination, the first regimen really without trade-offs. And what we think we're going to see at that point and what I believe we'll see is a lot of conversion of not only business that isn't TAF yet, but business that is already TAF on to B\/F\/TAF. Particularly, we have seen an uptick recently in the last quarter or so in patients starting on Descovy plus dolutegravir.","And what physicians tell us is, is that in a lot of cases, this is in preparation for what they expect to do in the first quarter of next year. It's very logical to them and to us, but more importantly to them, switch opportunity for them, to obviously get them on a single pill. So I'm not that surprised we're seeing an uptick in that and I think that bodes very well for B\/F\/TAF.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yeah, Terence, I would just give a shout-out for how well our colleagues in Europe are doing. As Jim says, that's Genvoya. Terrific that already 75% of our HIV business in Germany's already across TAF-based regimens, but it's also Descovy, as Jim makes a great point. If you look at the uptick and we've supplied you with some slides, you look at the uptick in Italy, Descovy is going terrifically. And that's a great platform for B\/F\/TAF. So we couldn't be happier about how we're doing this year with our HIV portfolio.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So now that you relatively quickly wrapped up the Kite deal, I'm curious where your mindset is at this point regarding potential additional M&A. And if you do have an appetite for it, what types of assets would be of greatest interest to you now that you have a new commercial product and platform in the fold. Thanks.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hey, Cory. It's John Milligan. Thanks for the question. So a couple things to say. The Kite acquisition was done very rapidly, and, of course, we are spending a lot of time now figuring out how to best work with our colleagues at Kite. I can say that they had \u2013 and we are quite interested in bringing in technology that will enhance our ability to move CAR-T forward to the next generations of CAR-T. As we had mentioned on the call when we acquired Kite, when we announced the acquisition, that we see this as a platform that will require continuous innovation. And so we are quite active in bringing in technologies, which will help us move this CAR-T forward.","Having said that, it's also true that M&A is going to be an ongoing activity at Gilead, where we will be in a constant state of evaluation of opportunities to bring in revenues or technologies that we think will help enhance our portfolio and our top line for the future. So I can tell you we're very, very active. I'm not going give you hints as to what we might be looking at. But I can say the group that we've put together is very, very good. And we are constantly evaluating stuff internally and with our board. So I would expect us to continue to be quite active in the coming years.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Peters with Deutsche Bank.","Andrew Peters - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks for taking my questions. One more on the new patient start side. I guess I just wanted to drill into the third quarter a bit more. If we look at first quarter to second quarter, it was kind of more flattish on the new patient start side and then we saw kind of a bit of a dip now. Just wanted to understand if there's any kind of seasonality within that new patient start component, or is it really just more consistently that fewer patients are actually starting therapy? And on the seasonality side, if you look historically, say, to last year, how has the fourth quarter performed relative to prior quarters? Thank you.","James R. Meyers - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yeah. I'll start. This is Jim. I would say I agree, it looks like it was a larger drop in the third quarter relative to earlier quarters. Obviously, what helped us in the beginning of the year was the fact that we had the midyear launch of Epclusa, and that had obviously some carryover into the early part of the year.","The other thing I'd say \u2013 and again, I don't mean to get into the weeds here, but I will just say that when you actually normalize this year based upon holidays and trading days, which a lot of the IMS and other companies will do for you, but don't routinely do, we've pretty much seen a fairly steady 2% month-on-month decline in patient starts basically since the start of the year. Again, there's different numbers of days and holidays in each area. So in reality, it's been less of a drop just from the second to the third quarter and more consistent and steady decline.","The reason we were saying very correctly that we saw higher levels of starts than we thought was we actually started at a higher point than we thought. So there was more starts in the first half of the year than we thought. But the general trend of patient starts declining relatively consistently throughout the year has really been in place since January. And we don't expect that to change in the fourth quarter.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Andrew, typically, Europe is more seasonally sort of orientated. We did see France and Spain come down a little bit in the third quarter, although nicely, Italy was quite strong, because there's a lot bigger opening now there is general access across all genotypes to HCV therapy, and there's a lot of untreated patients there. Typically, fourth quarter is as good if not a little bit stronger than third quarter in Europe. I don't think there's really much seasonality, as Jim points out, between third and fourth quarter in the U.S.","Andrew Peters - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you for the additional color.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore.","Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI","Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking my question. I actually wanted to drill down on Hep C a little more. And I just want to make sure I'm thinking about this correctly because these numbers sounded \u2013 I just want to make sure I've locked them in. So the high end of 2017 guidance for your Hep C implies that the fourth quarter will have a run rate of somewhere between $4 billion and $5.4 billion. So am I doing the math right there? And is that the starting number we should think about as we head into 2018?","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Umer, again, we can't jump ahead and start to give you kind of numbers for 2018. As Jim said, we're finalizing all of our contracts. And there are the three variables: patient starts, which still continues to be a big variable, there is the pricing and there is the share. The one thing that's now come off the table really is duration, because the use of Harvoni, use of Epclusa is pretty standardized now. So that's not really a variable. Yes, you can do the maths of taking away our first three quarters from the guidance that Robin took you through. But we really don't wish to go any further than where we are with, I think, a 2017 that we delivered on our original guidance in hepatitis C and have done superbly with over-exceeding our HIV guidance. But we'll get to 2018 when we get to 2018.","Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Katherine Xu with William Blair.","Yu Katherine Xu - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon. I'm just wondering about the HCV China business that you guys could potentially drum up there, considering 10 million people infected, although I have the number of 43 million. Let's just say 10% of them could potentially pay out of pocket, that could be a third of the U.S. market. So that could be quite substantial. I wonder what's your overall thoughts on that market.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Well, Katherine, you're making me nervous here. I think it'll be \u2013 I think a staged launch in China. What's remarkable is in the last 12 months how the China FDA have changed their regulations and, particularly for products that we've got in the viral area, are very, very motivated to see these products come to market. We will have a relatively small organization in China. That's quite deliberate. We want to really do the right thing and be highly compliant and bring our therapies very responsibly to the Chinese market.","We've known the Chinese opinion leaders for a long time, even though we haven't actually had an office in China. So that gave us the confidence and the platform upon which to start to put in our organization. We have a very seasoned General Manager.","It will be, as you say, a private market launch to begin with. We have missed the national listings, which are now closed for the coming year, but in 2018, we will be trying to bridge from the private market into provincial reimbursement and when the next round of national authorization opens, then we will try to get Sovaldi, Harvoni, and Epclusa and Vemlidy, for that matter, because HBV is a very prevalent disease in China onto national listings.","So we want to walk before we can run. But there's no doubt that our antivirals are much needed for the infection rates in China.","Operator","Thank you. And we have time for one more question. Our final question for today comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have one for Genvoya, on slide 29 last month, we see a dip in TRx. Am I reading the teal leaf too much? Or there's something behind dip or just one blip in the market? And then secondly on HCV, if I take your high end of the guidance for this year, $9 billion, I get to about $1.36 billion in 4Q. So that's still 40% drop from 3Q. Do you think that's mostly because of the U.S. market dynamics or also you're seeing a drop-off in Europe and the other countries as well for HCV? Thank you.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yes. Maybe start with Genvoya, no, we are not seeing anything. There's month-to-month fluctuations just based on \u2013 I wouldn't call it seasonality, but just the number of holidays and so forth. But there is \u2013 the uptake of Genvoya has not shown any attenuation at all and couldn't be going stronger. Again, as we said, 56% we expect to get to about two-thirds by the time of the launch of the B\/F\/TAF in terms of the presented TAF. So no worries there.","The second question was just in terms of the drop-off in the fourth quarter. Again, that's the first quarter on Hep C where will see the \u2013 more fully, the impact of both the dynamics we spoke about in pricing, where it is now consistent across genotypes and has come down more towards genotype one eight-week levels. And again, also, more of the impact of share. So both of those things were reflected in that. And again, that's reflective of the updated guidance that was provided earlier in this call.","Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","And, Ying, we will see some competitive effects running into Europe that will be a country-by-country. I have to say that Epclusa is doing really, really well in Europe, and is the number 1 Hepatitis C product, that's being used across all genotypes in the European market. So we believe we've got a very able competitor to the new market entrant in Epclusa.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","And just to reiterate, again, maybe it didn't play out exactly from the four different dynamics that drive revenue as we thought. Patient starts were higher. Price and share, at least, later in the year, were lower. But 2017 HCV revenue will fall within the original guidance that was issued last February. So we feel very good about that.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Sung Lee for any closing remarks.","Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thank you, Karen, and thank you all for joining us today.

Please go ahead.","Patrick O\u2019Brien","Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. We issued a press release this afternoon providing earnings results for the fourth quarter, which is available on our website where you can also find detailed slides that support today's call.","For our prepared remarks and Q&A, I'm joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, John Martin; our President and Chief Operating Officer, John Milligan; our Executive Vice President of Research and Development, Norbert Bischofberger; our Executive Vice President of Commercial Operations, Kevin Young; and our Chief Financial Officer, Robin Washington.","Before we begin our formal remarks, we want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including plans and expectations, with respect to our product candidates and financial projections, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. ","A description of these risks can be found in our latest SEC disclosure documents and recent press releases. In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement made during this call.","We will also be using non-GAAP financial measures to help you understand our underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in our press release as well as on our website.","I would now like to turn the call over to John Martin.","John Martin","Thanks, Patrick, and thank you all for joining us today. 2013 was a very productive year on multiple fronts. Aided by strong scientific data and excellent commercial support, our marketed products achieved record product sales of $10.8 billion, an increase of 15% year over year. And Kevin will further elaborate on our commercial performance.","The research and development organization was also extremely productive, executing on a record number of clinical studies across all therapeutic areas, as well as submitting marketing authorization applications in both hepatitis C and oncology.","The central fourth quarter highlight was that the U.S. FDA approved Sovaldi, a once-daily oral nucleotide analogue for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B as a component of a combination antiviral regimen. This was followed in January by European Commission approval, and Sovaldi has been launched in the U.K., Germany, and France.","In December, top line data from three Phase III studies on the the the ledipasvir\/sofosbuvir fixed-dose combination for release. These studies, ION1, ION2, and ION3, evaluate if the fixed-dose in genotype 1 affected cirrhotic and noncirrhotic, treatment na\u00efve and treatment experienced patients, both with and without ribavirin for a duration of 8, 12, or 24 weeks. The response rates in the 8- and 12-week arms evaluating the once-daily combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir without ribavirin ranged from 93.6% to 97.75.","Based on these exciting data, the FDA and the European Marketing Authorization [unintelligible] application will be filed this quarter. FDA previously assigned breakthrough designation to this combination, and the European Medicines Agency, EMA, has accepted Gilead\u2019s request for accelerated assessment, a destination that is granted to new therapies and medicines of major public health interest. Accelerated assessment could shorten the EMA\u2019s review time of ledipasvir\/sofosbuvir by two months. ","Turning now to HIV, we received European Commission Approvals for Stribild Tybost, a pharmacokinetic enhancer that boosts blood levels of certain HIV medicines, and Vitekta, an integrase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV 1 infection in adults.","Last quarter, enrollment was completed in two Phase III studies for the single tablet regimen of elvitegravir\/cobicistat\/emtricitabine and TAF, abbreviated ECF TAF, in treatment na\u00efve patients. These studies will [unintelligible] in the fourth quarter of 2014.","In addition, this tablet is being evaluated in a number of other studies, including treatment experienced patients, patients switched to ECF TAF, patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, as well as adolescents. We currently anticipate filing this broad package for U.S. and European approval of ECF TAF in the first quarter of 2015 for na\u00efve, experienced, and switching indications. ","In September an NDA was submitted for idelalisib, a targeted oral inhibitor of PI3K delta for the treatment of relapsed refractory iNHL. This application was assigned a standard review with a PDUFA date of September 11. This was followed in September by the filing of a second NDA with the FDA for CLL. The FDA granted idelalisib a breakthrough therapy destination for relapsed CLL patients. ","This designation was based on data from a prespecified interim analysis performed by an external data monitoring committee showing a highly statistically significant effect on the primary endpoint of progression free survival. Just yesterday, we were informed that FDA has granted this application priority review with a PDUFA date of August 6, 2014. European MAA filings for idelalisib and iNHL and CLL were submitted in October. ","Overall, 2013 was a very exciting year with significant milestones achieved across the entire organization, for which I\u2019d like to thank all our employees for their dedication and hard work. As we look ahead, 2014 will also be a busy year with numerous upcoming milestones. In liver disease, we expect to file our first-ever regulatory submissions in Japan for sofosbuvir plus ribavirin in genotype 2 infected patients and ledipasvir\/sofosbuvir fixed dose combination in genotype 1 infected patients.","We anticipate having numerous presentations on liver disease programs at EASL in April, in London, including data on the ledipasvir\/sofosbuvir Phase III studies. We also anticipate the first product approval and launch in oncology for idelalisib in iNHL and CLL. In addition, we have a record number of clinical studies ongoing and planned across all therapeutic areas, as our pipeline continues to expand. ","As you know, Kevin Young has announced his plans to retire and transition to a senior advisor role. For the past nine years, Kevin has successfully led our global commercial organization during a time of significant change, complexity, and extraordinary growth. ","Those who\u2019ve had the opportunity to work with Kevin have seen firsthand his passion and commitment to Gilead and to our employees and the value he places on doing what\u2019s right and in the best interests of patients. His leadership and drive will be missed. Please join me in thanking Kevin for his many contributions and wishing him well in the next chapter of his life. ","As always, we look forward to sharing our progress with you as the year progresses. I would now like to turn the call over to Kevin Young.","Kevin Young","Thank you, John. Good afternoon, everyone. 2013 was an outstanding year for Gilead Sciences. Total worldwide net product revenues closed in on the $11 billion mark. Antiviral sales exceeded $9 billion. We also believe for the first time Complera, Stribild, and Letairis achieved sales of over $500 million. And, our cardiopulmonary franchise topped $1 billion in 2013.","Looking to more detail around fourth quarter results, I would first like to concentrate on the U.S. Total U.S. sales for the quarter were a record $1.94 billion, a growth of 29% over the fourth quarter of 2012. Antiviral and cardiopulmonary franchises posted very impressive year over year growth of 31% and 23% respectively. Excluding Sovaldi sales, the antiviral franchise grew 20% year on year. ","In HIV, underlying demand in the quarter was very healthy, thanks to the growth of our new single tablet regimens, Stribild and Complera. Over and above this reassuring picture, revenue did exceed demand by about $130 million to $150 million, due to an increase in year-end inventory levels.","I\u2019d like to break down the inventory increase into its component parts. First, we had a repeat of what we saw a year ago in Q4 2012, where there was a significant amount of strategic purchasing by small wholesalers and large retail chains in advance of January price increases.","Second, inventory at the big three wholesalers finished above established ranges due to the timing of year-end. Normalization of inventory will likely take place during Q1 2014, and thus could have some impact on quarterly results.","As I mentioned earlier, we continue to see strong uptake of Stribild and Complera. Seven of 10 na\u00efve HIV patients start on Gilead STR, and as of the third quarter 2013, Stribild was the largest STR, with 3 of 10 [stops]. Stribild is also the number one HIV therapy in HIV patients who switch regimens, and as you know, Stribild is now a DHHS preferred regimen, an important endorsement that strengthens its profile further.","The performance or Complera was almost as impressive as Stribild. Sales in the U.S. alone exceeded $500 million for the year. It remains the number two regimen in na\u00efve HIV patients, the number two regimen in patients who are switched, and the number two in all HIV treated patients.","One important change to the Complera label came in December, with a broadening beyond the na\u00efve setting to include patients who are biologically suppressed on stable PI continuing regimens.","Turning to Europe, we are very pleased with the fourth quarter year over year sales growth of 9% excluding foreign exchange. Eviplera has for the first time become the most prescribed regimen for na\u00efve HIV patients, and continues to expand its lead over Atripla as the most switched to regimen in the big 5 EU markets.","Eviplera is now a preferred regimen in the EACS guidelines and all five major EU national guidelines. Furthermore, in December, European regulatory authorities extended the Eviplera label, removing the limitations of use in treatment na\u00efve patients.","We are also very excited about the early uptick of Stribild, where we have launched in 14 countries across Europe. Performance in the U.K. and Germany is roughly double that of Eviplera at the same timepoint. A recent change in the British HIV guidelines designated Stribild as the preferred regimen. This coincided with NHS England reimbursement.","We now have over 60 centers in the U.K. ordering Stribild, including all major London HIV clinics. And just a month ago, Stribild was launched in Spain, the second largest European HIV market. We hope to have reimbursement in France by the end of the first quarter and Italy by midyear.","Turning to hepatitis C, as John alluded to earlier, this is a transformational moment for HCV patients who have lived with this disease for many years and have so few options for a cure. Even though it is early days, we are extremely pleased with the U.S. launch of Sovaldi. Sales in December totaled $136 million. ","A little over half of these are attributable to the initial [unintelligible] inventory supplied to the big three wholesalers, which approached nearly $70 million. We also received a one-off order for $15 million for a clinical trial. The balance of the revenue, approximately $50 million, was driven by patient demand. ","Sovaldi prescribing has been broad-based, both across physician groups and patient genotypes. Hepatologists, gastroenterologists, IMs, and infectious disease specialists have all begun using Sovaldi. Our U.S. field forces, therapeutic specialists, medical scientists, and national account managers were sized, resourced, and trained to attain broad market coverage. And as we sense from prelaunch research, physicians who have stopped using the protease inhibitors, plus pegylated interferon, reengaged in HCV treatment using Sovaldi.","Our first qualitative snapshot survey [unintelligible] at the beginning of the year has given us a feel for the type of patient receiving Sovaldi. The genotype distribution is very much in line with the U.S. HCV population, with approximately 70% usage in genotype 1. By far the most popular treatment regimen for the genotype 1 patient is as you would expect, the NEUTRINO approach of Sovaldi in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin for 12 weeks. We also see that some GT1 patients have been given a combination of Sovaldi plus simeprevir. ","On the payer front, it typically takes between 3 and 6 months for a full formulary listing. However, almost without exception, prescriptions are being approved by commercial plans. The typical tiering of an innovative new specialist drug is being applied to Sovaldi, namely [CF3], with a prior authorization.","We expect the same type of timelines for coverage across the various federal payer segments and encouragingly, we have already seen some uptake by state Medicaid plans as well as DOD Tricare.","Our U.S. patient assistance program for Sovaldi, Support Path, has been very active since launch. This program helps patients navigate benefits coverage, as well as provide assistance where allowed with copays and foundation grants. We anticipate that 30% to 50% of commercial patients will utilize our copay assistance program.","Outside the U.S., we were very pleased with the European Commission approval of Sovaldi on Friday, January 17. Bottles of Sovaldi began shipping immediately on Monday morning, and we have so far fulfilled orders in the U.K., Germany, France, Austria, Sweden, and Finland. Full pricing will not be completed in some countries for up to a year. Health economic dossiers have now been filed with all major reimbursement agencies, and we are very hopeful that Sovaldi will be given high ratings to support rapid public coverage.","On an interim basis, we are exploring special national mechanisms that allow purchase and prescribing in defined [unintelligible] populations. As a reminder, we began selling in France in October, under an approved temporary authorization for use, or ATU program, in patients pre- and post-liver transplant and patients with advanced liver disease who have failed other HCV treatments. Sales under this program for 2013 were $3 million.","Finally, I\u2019d like to briefly mention our [unintelligible] activities. We have begun to build out our sales and marketing organization for idelalisib in line with projected regulatory timelines. In the U.S., we have hired all of our regional managers and will have the therapeutic specialist team in place and trained by the middle of the year. All individuals have strong backgrounds in oncology and hematology. A very similar process will be followed in Europe, with particular emphasis on Germany, France, and the U.K.","In closing, I have never seen Gilead so strong and so ready to face the challenges and capture the opportunities of the new year. I will now turn the call over to Robin.","Robin Washington ","Thanks, Kevin, and good afternoon everyone. Earlier today, we were pleased to report strong fourth quarter and full year 2013 results that were in line with our revised guidance. Our strong commercial execution across all therapeutic areas resulted in fourth quarter total revenues of over $3 billion, up 21% year over year and 12% sequentially.","As previously mentioned, strong wholesaler and subwholesaler purchases in anticipation of January 1 price increases may result in an inventory drawdown by wholesalers and subwholesalers in the first quarter of 2014, similar to the first quarter of 2013.","Fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.55 per share, compared to $0.50 a share the same period last year. Turning to the balance sheet, during 2013, we achieved our target net debt to EBITDA of 1.5x, and we resumed the repurchases under our share repurchase program, which were $582 million for the full year.","Focused efforts on collections and increased government funding to hospitals in southern Europe allowed us to reduce our European DSO to levels not seen in over two years. Finally, I would like to cover our full year 2014 non-GAAP financial guidance, summarized on slide 45 in the earnings presentation available on our corporate website.","We expect product sales from our core business, excluding Sovaldi, to be in the range of $11.3 billion to $11.5 billion, an increase of 6% to 8% over 2013. This range is due to anticipated price decreases in certain European territories and the impact of generic [unintelligible] now available in Canada and Europe.","Our non-GAAP product gross margin is expected to be in the range of 75% to 77%. We expect our non-GAAP R&D expenses to be in the range of $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion as we continue to invest in our product pipeline. ","And we expect our non-GAAP SG&A expenses to be in the range of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion, which assumes the continued buildout and expansion of our commercial infrastructure in Europe and Asia to support Sovaldi and increased marketing and sales efforts related to the launch of our first oncology product, idelalisib, in the U.S. and Europe.","For the full year, our non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 28% to 29%. As Congress has not extended the federal R&D tax credit for 2014, we have excluded the credit from our guidance. Please note that last year\u2019s effective tax rate included an R&D tax credit for 2013 and the retroactive impact for 2012 in the first quarter.","We are anticipating the full year diluted EPS impact of acquisition related restructuring and stock based compensation expenses to be in the range of $0.63 to $0.66 per share. This range includes the full year effect of the amortization of in-process R&D related to Sovaldi.","At this point, full year sales of Sovaldi are difficult to estimate and are not included in net product sales guidance. With that said, we are conscious of the potential magnitude of Sovaldi\u2019s impact on certain areas of our guidance and wanted to provide you with the following metrics. ","In 2014 only, we estimate that our non-GAAP product gross margin will increase by approximately 0.75% to 1% for every $1 billion of Sovaldi sales and our non-GAAP effective tax rate will decrease by approximately 0.75% to 1% for every $1 billion in Sovaldi sales. ","In closing, we are pleased with our 2013 accomplishments across the organization. Based on the groundwork we have laid, we believe 2014 will be another outstanding year for Gilead and look forward to sharing updates on our progress and future successes with you.","We would now like to open the call for questions. Operator? ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Your first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan.","Geoff Meacham - JPMorgan ","Kevin, I want to get your early marketing experience with Sovaldi in the U.S. beyond your earlier comments, just with respect to treatment experience versus na\u00efve, and then genotype 3 use, and if you\u2019ve heard of any secondary warehousing occurring in the U.S. And maybe the sum total of this, if you can contrast that with what you\u2019ve seen in France, just given your longer experience there too.","Kevin Young","In terms of the U.S., I referred to some market research that we did in January. Going back to the launch, we did expect that people might hold off in the genotype 1 because of the Christmas period. In this research, it does seem now that the use of Sovaldi is very much reflecting the spectrum of patients that you have in the U.S. So about 70% in genotype 1. ","We have seen some use in genotype 2 and 3. Three was about 12% in this very small survey. Genotype 2 was about 17%. Again, I must stress this is very low numbers. It was a survey done in people who were beginning to use Sovaldi. So it\u2019s very representative, and I think that\u2019s very reassuring that we\u2019re seeing that.","Our sense is that physicians are calling in their advanced patients, because of course they need to be treated, so our sense is that they\u2019re sort of clearing patients that they may have had waiting, and that may well continue during the first quarter. ","In terms of France, our prescribing right now is according to the definition of the temporary authorization for use, the ATU. Because what happened in January is that the French government said that the ATU parameters must now still apply until there is full reimbursement of the product in France. ","So we\u2019ve had extremely good response. As soon as we switched to the use of our public Sovaldi, we had an immediate order from the public hospitals around Paris. Nineteen of our top 20 centers in France have prescribed Sovaldi. But the majority of the patients treated have been the [F3s] and the [F4s]. And that\u2019s not surprising, because patients with advanced disease, with no alternative, are as per the ATU guidance. So that\u2019s probably not surprising. And I\u2019ll just throw in this one, that in Germany kind of like the U.S., our sense is that it\u2019s sort of prescribing according to the distribution of genotypes. ","We\u2019re not aware at all of any sort or form of secondary warehousing of patients. Right now I think physicians, whether it be the U.S. or Europe, are totally energized about the availability of Sovaldi. So no sense whatsoever that they may be holding back patients for all-oral.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.","Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group ","I was just wondering how you\u2019re preparing for the 2029 Sovaldi patent cliff. [laughter] Just kidding. Can I just expand on that last question? I know that you\u2019re not giving Sovaldi guidance this year. Obviously I respect that, and get why, because of all the unknowns. But it was interesting, in your response to Jeff\u2019s question, that you haven\u2019t seen any secondary warehousing. Is it your current expectation that we\u2019re not likely to see a decline in U.S. demand for Sovaldi any time before the combination pill G1 launch, presumably in Q4, if you\u2019re willing? And then just a clarification on the tax rate, that\u2019s $1 billion of sales no matter where they occur geographically, correct, that would have the impact on tax rate and gross margin? ","Kevin Young ","It really is still incredibly early days. We\u2019ve only just got through our first full month, and what we call the first [unintelligible] month of launch, clearly the holiday period. So I think it\u2019s so difficult to say what\u2019s going to happen in the transition period between Sovaldi and Sovaldi ledipasvir. ","First, we don\u2019t know what ultimately the timelines are going to be for launch of our new single tablets. So I just don\u2019t think we know, and I think we need to get through the first quarter into the second quarter, of course, to know what might be the timelines for launch, before we can have any feel for that. So I really don\u2019t have any of the color. ","I would just reemphasize that the energy is extremely high, and that\u2019s not just in the major liver disease centers. We\u2019re getting good response from the gastroenterologists. We\u2019re having prescribing from internal medicine physicians, and we\u2019re seeing a little prescribing from the infectious disease physicians. ","Robin Washington ","And the second part of your question was, I believe, the guidance we provided around whether the impact on our tax rate applied to global Sovaldi sales. The answer is it does, and please remember that as we guided, that only relates to 2014.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets ","My question is on your end user customers. What percentage do you think are private pay versus Medicaid versus other buckets? And the follow-on to that is sort of when does the VA come on in prisons? What kind of customers are you seeing now and going through the first half of the year, etc.?","Kevin Young ","By far the vast majority is the private pay right now. We are actually having some initial formulary listing from state Medicaids like New Jersey\/New York, which is quite encouraging. We shouldn\u2019t forget that all Medicaids have often some form of interim coverage just like the private plans. So we\u2019re going to be exploring all of those across the country. We\u2019ve had a couple of [unintelligible] cover and list Sovaldi. That\u2019s not with any additional discounts, that\u2019s purely the Medicaid pricing. But I have to say that the majority of patients right now are coming from the private managed care sector.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams of Wells Fargo. ","Brian Abrahams - Wells Fargo","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing into the first quarter. And obviously the prescription data clearly is showing an uptick. You talked about early January being sort of the real launch, where you\u2019re going to retail more aggressively and engage with payers. So sort of wondering what kind of follow through you\u2019re seeing, and also what the impact of the recent AASLD guidelines might be on treatment patterns, treatment practice, and uptake patterns.","Kevin Young ","It\u2019s so hard, Brian. It\u2019s so early. It is obvious that the major liver centers are treating the sicker patients. I mean, that\u2019s not only intuitive but it\u2019s common sense that you\u2019d want to be trying to cure patients who are really, really advanced. And the hepatologists knew about this drug. The hepatology centers take the sicker patients. So they have patients lined up. We even know some centers that were even checking on the insurance qualifications of those patients so they could very quickly receive drug.","I think it\u2019s important, though, to say that we\u2019ve got a lot of people to talk to about Sovaldi, particularly in the GI community, that really weren\u2019t that familiar with the protease inhibitors and weren\u2019t warehousing patients. And we\u2019re introducing, I think, a very novel therapy, and they\u2019re very interested in this, and as I mentioned, I think we\u2019re getting people to reengage and think about treating HCV, whereas in past years they certainly asking for the patient to wait. ","The AASLD guidelines are very, very positive. I couldn\u2019t tell you that I\u2019ve seen an actual specific impact, but as an umbrella endorsement of Sovaldi and indeed to stop using the prior therapies is very strong. ","I\u2019d also like to mention that we have seen, after only 10 days after approval, a very similar change in Germany, and we do know that the opinion leaders in the U.K. are considering some form of consensus guidelines with the introduction of Sovaldi. So very positive.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Porges with Sanford Bernstein.","Geoffrey Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein ","Unfortunately, my question is about the SG&A guidance, which is a significant step up, I think, from certainly what we were expecting, but also a big step up from 2013. I\u2019m just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that guidance, specifically does it fully account for the expense for the launch of idelalisib, the fixed dose combination, and whatever else you might incur? And is there any contingency in the SG&A that would go up if you sell more Sovaldi over the year? And equally, looking ahead, is this the big step here in SG&A given the late stage pipeline, or should we anticipate similar increases in the next couple of years?","Robin Washington ","I\u2019m going to somewhat go in a little different order. Relative to the contingency, I think we really stepped back and looked at SG&A to be all-encompassing. So irrespective of the size of sales, I think we\u2019ve got that all included relative to the guidance that we\u2019ve given you. ","In terms of the overall component, it does include all the sales and marketing expenses for the Sovaldi launch in the U.S., Europe, Canada, and Australia. Keep in mind this isn\u2019t only for the ramp that continues in some of those countries, but it\u2019s a full year effect of the ramp that we had in 2013.","It does also include the buildout, as Kevin talked about in the script, for a launch of idelalisib in both the U.S. and the EU. And it also includes a ramp for new markets, most specifically Japan, but there\u2019s also a small amount of money in there for some other emerging markets that we are considering in 2014.","So that\u2019s the biggest component, over 50% of the increase. If you think about just our traditional SG&A, external legal is increasing significantly as we have to continue to defend our patents. The excise tax is retroactive, so it does not include Sovaldi sales, because it\u2019s based on 2013 revenues, but there is a significant step up in that, as you saw in our slide deck, with guidance of about $150 million to $170 million for that as well. ","And I think just given the overall growth of the company, I mean, we\u2019ve increased employees a thousand fold this past year, so there are some just overall increases relative to our infrastructure and SG&A that we had to consider given our growth.","Kevin Young","I\u2019d just add that, as a reminder, Japan, we\u2019re going to launch as Gilead, so we\u2019re going to be starting a full [unintelligible] course, and that will take place in the second half of the year, ready for a first half 2015 launch. So that is a new component for us at Gilead.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rachel McMinn with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Rachel McMinn - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","Just to follow up on the HCV copay, and taxes, I guess I\u2019m a little bit confused if 30% to 50% of your Sovaldi patients are going to be utilizing the copay assistance program, how does that not impact SG&A? Or how are you thinking about that? And then Robin, I was intrigued by your comment about the tax improvement only applying to 2014. Can you give us a better sense of what are the dynamics in 2015 and beyond that would make that number higher or lower as we think about our models?","Robin Washington ","Relative to the copay, as I said, to the extent that that copay program or the support launch, as Kevin described, it is inclusive of those copays in SG&A guidance. So it\u2019s sales, it\u2019s marketing, and it\u2019s any type of programs that we would put in place. There are also specific foundation grants that we\u2019ve given to help with patients getting access to Sovaldi. You saw an increase in Q4 and some of that continues into 2014. ","So relative to the tax rate, I\u2019ve said all along that commercialization of Sovaldi worldwide would lower our tax rate, and that\u2019s based on where the patient population of Sovaldi is. More ex-U.S. will overall allow us to continue to reduce that rate. And we also did some supply chain restructuring that allowed us to take advantage of that tax rate reduction even sooner.","We don\u2019t give long term tax rate guidance, but I\u2019d expect to see the tax rate overall to continue to decline as the level of Sovaldi revenue continues to increase.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Roden with UBS.","Matt Roden - UBS ","First of all, in terms of demand in the fourth quarter, can you tell me if I\u2019m doing the math right, that if you add $136 million on the quarter, $15 million was a one-timer, $70 million was inventory, so does that mean that demand is roughly $50 million? Is that the right way to think about it? ","And then related, I get a lot of questions on the sustainability of the hep C market. I was just wondering if you could talk about, to the extent that you can, how you model hep C over the longer term. You said you see this as a relatively long-lived opportunity, and that\u2019s a point of view that we\u2019ve seen shared by other management teams as well. ","Just want to get your sense for the key swing factors in your model that are most impactful to sustained demand, whether it\u2019s diagnosis and linkage to care, capacity to treat, need to treat, geographic expansion, etc. And then lastly, and related, how you see [unintelligible] market wide pricing over the long term in the market. ","Kevin Young ","Your math is about right. Bear in mind that the $70 million that we put out there, we felt was appropriate for the December period and the type of usage. I think it\u2019s important to point out that as we go into January, February, and first quarter, that actual purchase will be for demand, but will be ticking up inventory levels. You know, major wholesalers start to adjust their inventory levels according to demand. So we\u2019ll see as we go into first\/second quarter that the actual purchase will be reflective of both dynamics. But your $50 million number, we think, is about right.","In terms of sustainability, we\u2019ve said, I think, on a number of occasions at Gilead, that we see this as a long term opportunity for the company and for our products in hepatitis C. Yes, people are clearly waiting for Sovaldi, there will be, undoubtedly, physicians and hospitals excited about having an all-oral. But we\u2019re going to be doing a lot as we come out of 2014 to 2015 around patient education, particularly for the patients who are currently diagnosed but are really not doing anything about their disease. ","And I think you\u2019re going to see, as we move through 2014, some very innovative advertising from Gilead that will start to raise awareness that there are good alternatives now for hepatitis C, and you should be seeking a conversation with your physician.","And then you mentioned the geographic rollout, we think there are great opportunities in Europe. Undoubtedly, that\u2019s led by France, but we see initial excitement and quite significant early uptake in Germany. And then we\u2019ll have some European markets come on later. We do think this drug is really appropriate for the elderly, treatment experienced and treatment intolerant Japanese patients. ","And then we\u2019ve got a great team here who\u2019ve got a lot of experience in other countries like Latin America, Brazil, where actually we\u2019re putting some of our own people in there for the first time, and we think that\u2019s going to be helpful for the more difficult and challenging pricing and reimbursement [unintelligible] you have in these countries. ","But I think on all of those levels, we have a longer life cycle for our hepatitis C products than perhaps people are giving credit for.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber of Citi.","Yaron Werber - Citi ","Robin, you mentioned, or I think Kevin mentioned, that prior authorizations are one of the tier 3 requirements. But this is essentially a first line product, recommended to be a first line product, so I\u2019m just confused a little bit about the requirement for prior authorizations. What can they possibly require? ","And then secondly, just for Kevin, help us think, how do we think about that EUR56,000 price under ATU? Historically, that\u2019s been a good benchmark, but how to think about the European pricing. Is that how we should think about it now that it\u2019s approved?","Kevin Young ","I probably should take the first question as well. Right now, because managed care are using kind of an interim coverage, you get this tier 3 plus a prior authorization. When they go for full formulary listing, it could well move to tier 2. But there will always be a prior authorization. Every hepatitis C drug has had a PA, and I think we absolutely believe that, whether it\u2019s Sovaldi or Sovaldi ledipasvir, or [unintelligible], for that matter, a PA will always be there. ","And it\u2019s really just a checkpoint that the drug is being used according to the label. It is no further restriction than that. So it\u2019s just that the right type of patient, the right genotype, according to the label, is being prescribed by a physician.","Let me transition to European pricing. So you mentioned the French ATU price. So you are correct, that\u2019s EUR56,000, or by today\u2019s FX, about $76,000. And I\u2019ve said before that that\u2019s really a very individual price point, because it\u2019s a very restricted use in patients that really have no alternatives, whether they are HCV or HCV with a liver transplant.","I would like to talk a little bit about the rest of the pricing for Europe. We have now listed our price in the U.K. The price in the U.K. is almost UK35,000, so that\u2019s about $57,000. And I think, as a benchmark for the majority of Europe, that would be a good price point for you going forward. So I\u2019ll say that again. About UK35,000, this is the 12-week course of treatment, or about $57,000.","And I also mentioned the German pricing. The German pricing is almost EUR49,000, or $66,000. So Germany typically is a little bit higher. And my final comment on European pricing is just to say that these are significant differences to the telaprevir pricing. And the [unintelligible] that we\u2019ve taken for Sovaldi, we believe, is very justified according to cost effectiveness data, and the premium is very comparable to the premium that we took on Sovaldi versus the original price of telaprevir in the United States.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Skorney of R.W. Baird. "," ","Brian Skorney - Robert W. Baird ","I know we\u2019ve talked a little bit about the potential competition we\u2019re going to see in the full AbbVie Phase III results right now. And I\u2019m just wondering if we could kind of get some top level thoughts on how you see competition emerging between you guys. Would you favor a position where AbbVie can have some reasonable market share without getting into a price competition? Or do you think given the benefits of sofosbuvir and your regimen that it\u2019s a moot point and that at any price you think the regimen\u2019s just so much better that it will all just stand on its own?","Kevin Young ","I\u2019ll answer, and then maybe Norbert has one or two on the scientific front. I think what you are referring to is, my apologies, somewhat artificial. I don\u2019t think Gilead thinks that way. I don\u2019t think really any pharmaceutical company in terms of somehow being super clever about segmentation and one company gets one part and one company gets another. We present the profile of Sovaldi. We obviously present according to the label, and all of the data within the label, and I think ultimately the physician and the payer make the choice. ","We believe that the Sovaldi data and the Sovaldi ledipasvir data is very, very strong, and our profile will give it a preeminent physician, not only in the minds of the physicians, but in the minds of the payer. So you know, I think the market ultimately makes decisions and ultimately prescribes and uptakes the product according to the scientific profile. And we certainly, as you heard from John Martin, without ribavirin for our combination, have a very, very strong profile in genotype 1. ","Norbert Bischofberger","And Brian, just to add to that, if you do comparisons of any study, you will come to the conclusion that ribavirin really doesn\u2019t make any difference anywhere, in any of our arms, in any of our subpopulations. So our recommendation, and of course this has to be reviewed and agreed on by regulators, will be that anybody, whether treatment na\u00efve and [unintelligible], and will get eight weeks of the fixed dose combination that [unintelligible], and everybody else will get 12 weeks. So it\u2019s a very simple algorithm, and there\u2019s nothing else required, no response to any therapy, etc.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya from Nomura Securities. ","Ian Somaiya - Nomura Securities","Just one for Robin. As it relates to your gross margin guidance, if we think about this maybe a little bit differently down the road, just let me know if this is an appropriate way to think about the gross margins. As [unintelligible] goes generic in 2017, should these corporate gross margins go back to a level prior to the [unintelligible] launch of ribavirin in the mid-eighties, and then we layer on top of that a roughly 100 basis point improvement in margins for every $1 billion in [ATV] sales? Is that a good way to think about it?","And then just a slightly different question, maybe for Norbert, is there any more clinical work, do you think, that needs to be done to differentiate your hepatitis C combination versus, not versus AbbVie, where we think the comparisons are sort of obvious, but versus some of the newer competitors? Maybe Merck is an example. ","Robin Washington ","To answer the first part of your question, you are speaking about it directionally the right way, but recall that our arrangement with BMS is that once efavirenz goes generic that there is a step down royalty that we\u2019ll need to pay to BMS. So it won\u2019t happen immediately upon going generic.","Also, keep in mind, if you think about our core business, excluding Sovaldi, as we continue to have more usage of Stribild and Complera\/Eviplera, that will also have overall product gross margin impact. Hence you saw even in our guidance for 2014 we saw some of that shift start to occur. On top of that is the incremental product gross margin impact related to Sovaldi that we\u2019d expect to see as that product becomes a larger component of our revenue stream.","Norbert Bischofberger","Thanks for asking an R&D question. I thought I was going to escape this call without having been asked one single question. So thank you very much. As you know, we have now succeeded with our ledipasvir\/sofosbuvir fixed dose combination to actually incredibly shorten treatment duration to 8 weeks and 12 weeks and Sovaldi treatment experience with response rates that go up to 95% or higher. ","But we\u2019re not stopping there. This is, of course, for genotype 1. We have another fixed dose combination in development, 5816 combined with sofosbuvir. You will see some of those early data at EASL, and we\u2019re still waiting for the treatment experienced cirrhotic genotype 3 cohort to make a decision or to feel really comfortable going into Phase III.","And then finally, as you know, we have efforts underway to shorten the treatment duration even further, to six weeks, by adding a third drug. So you know, all of those things are ongoing, and I think we will be competitive with our, you know, you can\u2019t really do much more than having one single pill, once daily. Very safe, very well tolerated tablet, given for eight weeks and achieving response rates of 95%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau of Cowen & Company.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Company ","Kevin, maybe if I could direct one last question to you that\u2019s on payers kind of more broadly than just what you\u2019re seeing today. There\u2019s been a lot of news in the press this morning about payers restricting access, either pressure and price through formulary placement, or exclusion, or maybe putting up some sort of barriers before patients can have therapy, like [unintelligible] or something like that. Can you discuss your discussions with payers? Do you think at some point they\u2019ll push back on Sovaldi as sales get too big? And do you think they even have a general appreciation of how big Sovaldi sales could be this year, next year, in order to prepare? ","Kevin Young ","I think there\u2019s a great awareness. I think we always knew that when we did our research, even a year ago, with payers. Hepatitis C was very high on their radar, as it is with oncology products and RA products and some others. I think if you present value to them - and we shouldn\u2019t forget, we are presenting a cure - it\u2019s very compelling. And we\u2019re curing somebody in 12 weeks, as Norbert said, in eight weeks in the future, and I think that is a very compelling proposition.","You know, already into the launch of Sovaldi, we have had some plans come to us who are traditionally quite difficult to get listings. In fact, we\u2019ve had one of them place orders outside their formulary. So I always come back to the area which is it\u2019s the profile of the product. The need in the patient is very clear, and we\u2019ve got a well tolerated, highly effective cure that physicians and patients want. The payer will always look at this and we\u2019ll have discussions with the payer. But I think this is transformational medicine, and the payer will have a role, but I think the adoption of HCV products is here for a long time to come.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Sonnier with William Blair. ","John Sonnier - William Blair","You spoke a bit to the broad market access approach of your HCV commercial organization, and as the launch gains steam, I suspect that becomes increasingly relevant. But I\u2019m curious, in the early stages, to get your perspective on what attitudes are towards screening among the different specialties. And as screening starts, I think we\u2019ll get a better picture of true prevalence. And I guess the parallel question is how confident are you that the current U.S. epidemiology is actually correct?","Kevin Young ","I don\u2019t think managed care and the payer are thinking too much about the movement in U.S. guidelines on the Baby Boomers. And to be honest with you, John, right now our concentration of efforts at Gilead is very much presenting the products. But as we get into 2014, and I referred earlier to some new educational campaigns that we want to have by the middle of the year, we\u2019re certainly going to be addressing the diagnosed population, that 1.7 million - that\u2019s the first area, I think, that could be mobilized - and then move into the larger 4 million population.","We have seen some state activities. There\u2019s been a lot of change in New York, that a test must be offered to a Baby Boomer when they present in a clinical setting. We are aware that that\u2019s been discussed also in Florida. We\u2019ll certainly be using our government affairs organization to continue that around the country.","I think it\u2019s always the case around screening that you need the products to treat the disease once it\u2019s been identified. And now we have that with Sovaldi, and it will become even stronger with our combination, and that encourages people. So I think we\u2019re going to see more of that. I think ourselves and competitors will be raising the awareness more and more. So I do think there is a great deal of potential in this market. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Schimmer with Piper Jaffray.","Josh Schimmer - Piper Jaffray ","Essentially a bit of an extension off of Phil\u2019s question. Since we seem to be in uncharted territory for the launch we\u2019re seeing with Sovaldi, are there any theoretical caps or limits regarding the speed or extent of uptake of a new multimillion dollar franchise in the U.S. or a point at which various payer systems strain under the pressures of the added costs? And if so, where might those limits or caps be?","Kevin Young ","Wow, that is an incredible question, Josh. I think you\u2019re right. We just don\u2019t quite know yet. I think those caps and possibly sort of bumpers might be more prevalent in Europe. It does take European governments more time to expand budgets. So it may well be more prevalent there. But we have seen increases, even as a result of the protease inhibitors, in some markets like Spain and Italy. But I think, because it\u2019s national health funding across Europe, that might be more brought into more question.","I think we just don\u2019t know, and this drug is really very special, and very transformative. So this is not extending life by a few months, this is probably one of the greatest breakthroughs to cure people and get rid of a very serious virus. So I think time will tell.","Operator","Mr. O\u2019Brien, we have time for one final question, and it comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs ","Just two quick ones for me. The first is I noticed you had some new data in your slides on the number of patients in the U.S. and Europe under care. I was wondering specifically on the U.S. number, if that includes or excludes the patients in the VA, so that about 200,000? And then on the capital allocation side, Robin, maybe you could just provide us with your perspective on the share repurchases in 2014 and anything beyond that.","Kevin Young ","Yes, it does include the VA population. So again, I just want to say that these are estimates. We\u2019re using the company Ipsos. That\u2019s the company that we\u2019ve used for a long time on HIV. But the sampling is much smaller than we currently have in HIV. You know, in HIV it took us about 10 years to get the type of sophistication from the Ipsos data. It\u2019s going to take us a few years to get more accuracy with hepatitis C. So I would just put a caveat and perhaps a [unintelligible] warning around this data, but it\u2019s the best we\u2019ve got. I think it\u2019s representative of where the U.S. today, and you\u2019ll see that we\u2019ve also included that number for the European big five markets as well.","Robin Washington ","Relative to capital allocation, in the earnings deck, on slide 61, we kind of outlined our share repurchase by quarter for 2013. In Q4, we kind of went back to our goal of offsetting dilution, and you can expect that to continue in 2014. Relative to long term capital structure, I\u2019d say we remain fairly consistent: [unintelligible] our pipeline, looking at various assets that may make sense and then returning cash to shareholders. Right now via share repurchases, but as we said, we may consider other vehicles over time. But other than that, I\u2019d say it\u2019s business as usual as to how we\u2019re thinking about utilization of cash [unintelligible].","Operator","This concludes the question and answer portion of our call. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. O\u2019Brien for closing remarks.","Patrick O\u2019Brien","Thank you, operator, and thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Gilead and the team here look forward to providing updates on future progress. Thanks again. "],"10109":["Gilead Sciences, Inc.

My name is Candice and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time all participants are in a listen only mode and as a reminder this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Sung Lee, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thank you, Candice, and good afternoon everyone. Just aftermarket close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. The press release and detailed slides are available on the Investor Relations section of the Gilead website.","The speakers on today's call will be John Milligan, President and Chief Executive Officer; Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Norbert Bischofberger, Executive Vice President of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer. Also in the room with us for the Q&A session is Andrew Chang, Executive Vice President, Clinical Research and Development Operations.","Before we begin with our prepared comments, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, including plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, financial projections, and the use of capital, all which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the latest SEC disclosure documents and recent press releases. In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.","Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release as well as on the Gilead website.","I will now turn the call over to Robin.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thank you, Sung, and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased to share our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 and provide 2018 guidance. I'll first review the financial results and commercial highlights for the quarter. Norbert will discuss progress made in R&D, and John will make a few closing comments.","2017 was marked by operational excellence across the business. During the year, we raised net product revenue guidance as we observed strong performances across our HIV and cardiopulmonary franchises. We continued to execute on and maximize the opportunity in HCV in a changing competitive landscape. We made two strategic acquisitions, Kite and Cell Design Labs, positioning us as an industry leader in cell therapy.","Furthermore, we launched two new products, Yescarta, the first cell therapy approved for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma, and Vosevi, an important option for HCV patients who could not be cured with other therapies.","Turning to the financials. For the fourth quarter 2017, total revenues were $5.9 billion with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.78. For the full year 2017, total revenues were $26.1 billion with non-GAAP diluted earnings of $8.84 per share. Product sales for the fourth quarter were $5.8 billion and $25.7 billion for the full year. HIV and HBV product sales for the full year 2017 were $14.2 billion compared to $12.9 billion in 2016. The increase was primarily due to the strong uptake of our TAF-based regimens which now account for 62% of Gilead's total HIV prescription volume in the U.S.","At the end of 2017, Genvoya remained the most prescribed HIV therapy for treatment naive and switch patients in the U.S. and across the top five European markets. Genvoya represents the most successful HIV launch in the U.S. and is the first HIV product to reach $3 billion in annual sales.","In Europe, sales of our TAF-based regimens continue to grow, while generic TDF and TDF\/FTC are available in several countries. Truvada for PrEP has remained a growth driver for Gilead. At the end of last year, approximately 153,000 people in the U.S. were taking Truvada for this indication, representing a greater than fivefold increase since January 2015. HCV product sales were $9.1 billion compared to $14.8 billion in 2016. The arrival of new competition, along with fewer patient starts, contributed to the year-over-year decline.","As we have noted in the past, HCV revenues are driven by four variables: patient starts, net pricing, market share and treatment duration. Treatment duration has stabilized as a variable, and pricing of all regimens has gravitated towards the eight-week regimen price. We anticipate both pricing and market share to stabilize by mid 2018 with more predictable but slightly declining patient starts moving forward.","Finally, other product sales were $2.3 billion compared to $2.2 billion in 2016. This represents the outstanding performance of the cardiovascular franchise. Ranexa and Letairis together generated $1.6 billion in revenue in 2017. As a reminder, the patent for ambrisentan in the U.S. will expire in July of 2018.","Turning to expenses for the full year 2017. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $3.3 billion, and SG&A expenses were $3.4 billion, both of which were in line with expectations. With the recent enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or tax reform, we recorded a provisional estimated GAAP charge of $5.5 billion or $4.16 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017. This will be payable over the next eight years and has been excluded from our non-GAAP results for the fourth quarter and full year.","Tax reform will have a positive impact on Gilead's earnings by lowering our global effective tax rate and increasing our financial flexibility as a result of our ability to repatriate our ex-U.S. cash over time. While the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act does not fundamentally change our capital allocation priorities, it does enable Gilead to invest in sustainable long-term value-creating opportunities, which include investing in R&D, expanding U.S.-based manufacturing, and creating additional jobs in the U.S.","Moving to our balance sheet. Our business continues to deliver strong operating cash flows. We generated $11.9 billion in cash from operations for the full year 2017 and ended the year with $36.7 billion in cash and investments. In conjunction with the Kite acquisition, we issued $3 billion senior unsecured notes and $6 billion term loan facilities, of which we repaid $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter 2017.","For the full year, we paid cash dividends of $2.7 billion and repurchased 13 million shares of stock for $954 million. Earlier today, we announced a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.52 to $0.57 per share, which will become effective in the first quarter of 2018. This increase underscores the confidence of the board and management in the strength of the business and future cash flows.","Our capital allocation priorities going forward include; investment in research and development along with M&A and partnerships to augment our pipeline, delevering our capital structure, continued growth of our dividend over time and share repurchases to maintain our current share count.","Finally, I would like to cover our full-year 2018 non-GAAP financial guidance, summarized on slides 33 through 37 in the earnings presentation available on our corporate website. Net product sales are expected to be in the range of $20 billion to $21 billion. Further details on our HCV sales and loss of exclusivity of ambrisentan, tenofovir DF and FTC in Europe can be found on slides 34 through 36.","Our guidance is subject to a number of uncertainties including the accuracy of our assumptions about HCV market share; the accuracy of our estimates for HCV patient starts in 2018; unanticipated pricing pressures from payers and competitors in the HCV market; lower than expected market share and greater price erosion resulting from the sale of generic versions of TDF; the fixed-dose combination of FTC\/TDF; and the fixed-dose combination of FTC\/TDF\/efavirenz outside the U.S.; slower than anticipated growth in our HIV franchise; a greater than expected adoption of generic versions of ambrisentan for PAH in the U.S.; a larger than anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments such as PHS, FSS, Medicaid and the VA; as well as volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.","Non-GAAP product gross margins are expected to be in the range of 85% to 87%. We expect our non-GAAP R&D expenses to be in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion. We also expect our non-GAAP SG&A expenses to be in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion.","For the full year, our non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 21% to 23%, which reflects the effect of the recently enacted U.S. tax reform. We anticipate the full-year diluted EPS impact of acquisition-related stock-based compensation and other expenses to be in the range of $1.41 to $1.51 per share.","As we begin 2018, we remain committed to being an operationally and financially efficient organization that generates high operating margins.","I will now turn the call over to Norbert.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thank you, Robin. As I look across our numerous research and development programs, I'm excited about the potential we have to advance treatments for a variety of diseases where significant unmet medical need exists. I will spend the next few minutes detailing our progress in HIV, liver disease, inflammation and oncology and discuss some of the key milestones we anticipate in 2018.","Beginning with HIV, we anticipate U.S. FDA approval of BIC\/F\/TAF, our latest once-daily single-tablet regimen for the treatment of HIV infection in adults with PDUFA action date this coming Monday, February 12. The new drug application is supported by data from four ongoing Phase 3 studies in a total of 2,400 people, studies 1489 and 1490 in treatment-na\u00efve HIV-infected adults and studies 1844 and 1878 in virally suppressed adults.","BIC\/F\/TAF met its primary objective of non-inferiority at 48 weeks across all four studies and no participants failed BIC\/F\/TAF for treatment-emergent virological resistance. Additional clinical trials of BIC\/F\/TAF are ongoing, including a dedicated study in women as well as a study in adolescents living with HIV. We plan to present data from these studies at scientific conferences in 2018.","We continue to invest in research for next generation HIV therapies including long-acting injectables for preventional treatment, therapies for treatment-resistant patients and approaches that could potentially cure HIV. We have filed an IND for our long-acting capsid inhibitor and plan to initiate clinical testing this quarter.","With regards to HIV prevention research, we expect to have data from the DISCOVER study next year. This Phase 3 trial, randomized patients will receive Truvada or Descovy to evaluate whether Descovy is safe and effective at reducing the risk of HIV infection when used as pre-exposure prophylaxis.","Moving to NASH, there are two ongoing Phase 3 trials, STELLAR 3 and STELLAR 4, evaluating selonsertib, our ASK1 inhibitor, in patients with F3 bridging fibrosis and F4 cirrhosis. Patients with an F4 fibrosis cohort are at highest risk of clinical adverse events and therefore represent the group with the greatest unmet medical need. STELLAR 4 is now fully enrolled, and STELLAR 3 will be fully enrolled in the next few months. Data will be available in 2019, and if positive, will form the basis for our regulatory filings.","Additionally, we're conducting small Phase 2 combination studies of selonsertib with Gilead's ACC inhibitor, GS-0976, and the selective non-steroidal FXR agonist GS-9674 in patients with NASH. Phase 2 data of GS-0976 in monotherapy presented at the Liver Meeting in October showed significant reduction in measures of liver fat and certain biomarkers of liver fibrosis compared to placebo.","Data from these combination studies will be presented at the European Association for the Study of the Liver Annual Meeting in April, and we are in the process of initiating a larger Phase 2 combination study this year.","We also made great progress in inflammation. Five Phase 3 studies of filgotinib are ongoing in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Three studies, FINCH 1, 2 and 3, are being conducted in rheumatoid arthritis. The FINCH 2 study is fully enrolled, and we anticipate data from this study in the second half of 2018. FINCH 2 compared filgotinib to placebo each added to conventional disease-modifying antiarrhythmic drugs, or DMARDs, in patients who have had inadequate response to biologics.","Other studies in rheumatoid arthritis include FINCH 1, a 52-week randomized study comparing filgotinib plus methotrexate to adalimumab plus methotrexate to methotrexate alone in patients who have had inadequate response to methotrexate. And FINCH 3, a 52-week randomized study comparing filgotinib alone to methotrexate alone to the combination of filgotinib plus methotrexate in methotrexate-naive patients. We anticipate the FINCH 1 and FINCH 3 studies to be fully enrolled later this year.","Filgotinib is also being investigated in five additional Phase 2 studies in other inflammatory diseases, namely psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, lupus, Sjogren's syndrome, and uveitis and we should have data available from some of these studies later this year.","In addition just last month, we filed an IND on an internally developed small molecule with a novel mechanism of action for inflammatory conditions, and we will initiate clinical development in the coming months.","Moving to oncology, a randomized controlled Phase 3 study of andecaliximab, our anti-MMP9 antibody in combination with modified FOLFOX6 in gastric cancer is ongoing, and entering futility analysis for this study was conducted by an independent data monitoring committee in the second half of 2017, and the DMC recommended that the study continue.","Additionally, we're conducting a Phase 2 study in gastric cancer of andecaliximab in combination with nivolumab versus nivolumab alone. This study will be completed this quarter, and we plan to present the data at a future scientific conference.","In cell therapy, long term data from our pivotal ZUMA-1 study of Yescarta in patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma were presented at the American Hematology Society Meeting and published concurrently in the New England Journal of Medicine in December. In this updated analysis, with a minimum follow up of one year and a median follow up of 15.4 months after a single infusion of Yescarta, 42% of the patients continued to respond to therapy with 40% continuing to have a complete response. We anticipate having two-year data from the ZUMA-1 study later this year.","Additional studies are underway including ZUMA-7, a Phase 3 randomized study comparing Yescarta to the standard of care in second-line treatment of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Data are expected in 2020.","Also underway is ZUMA-6, a Phase 1\/2 combination study of Yescarta with atezolizumab, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, and a Phase 1 study of a KITE-585, a CAR T-cell therapy engineered to target B-cell maturation antigen in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.","Phase 1 results from the ZUMA-3 study of KTE-C19 in 24 adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia were also presented at ASH. KTE-C19 is the same anti-CD19 CAR T construct as Axi-cel, but is manufactured through a slightly different process. With a minimum of eight weeks of follow up, 17 of the 24 participants will receive the single infusion of KTE-C19, achieved complete remission in 21 of the 24 participants at no detectable disease.","I hope I've conveyed my excitement about the pipeline programs we have across Gilead's therapeutic areas. In summary, pending the results of ongoing studies that will read out in 2018 and 2019, we could be in a position to file as many as four NDAs or BLAs next year.","I would now like to turn over the call to John. John?","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thanks, Norbert. I'd like to make a few comments about the year that has just ended and where we will focus in 2018. As Robin mentioned, Yescarta was approved by the FDA in October of 2017. We are greatly encouraged by an initial response we have seen from the healthcare and patient communities in recognition of the life-saving potential for people with aggressive large B-cell lymphomas who have run out of options. We have authorized 28 cancer centers to date, and each center is now certified to administer Yescarta to patients.","Given the promise of Yescarta and the significant patient need, we are actively working on training and certifying additional centers on the risk, evaluation and mitigation strategy and the Kite Connect process. By mid-2018, we anticipate there will be enough centers certified to treat 80% of Yescarta-eligible patients.","We're very excited about the present opportunity with Yescarta, and as Norbert mentioned, we are enrolling clinical studies to expand the label to earlier lines of therapy and exploring combination therapy with other in immuno-oncology agents.","We are also working to improve CAR T therapies and are acquiring next generation technology in the belief that we will be able to develop cellular therapies that can achieve greater responses, lessen side effects and increase the types of malignancies that can be treated.","For example, the acquisition of Cell Design Labs gives us access to proprietary technology platforms that will augment and accelerate these efforts, along with the dedicated research team who, in collaboration with the Kite team, will help us drive next generation CAR T therapies into the clinic more quickly. The future is incredibly bright for cellular therapy and we are very excited to be at the forefront of the field.","Over the past three decades, Gilead's relentless scientific pursuit of better HIV treatments has led to a range of options to help address the diverse needs of people living with HIV. Once approved, BIC\/F\/TAF will offer people an important new single-tablet regimen option, both to those newly diagnosed with HIV and those who may desire or need to switch from their current multi-tablet regimen or single-tablet regimen. BIC\/F\/TAF represents Gilead's sixth single-tablet regimen, and with the approval of Symtuza in the EU by our partner, Janssen, the fourth containing TAF.","With the approval of BIC\/F\/TAF, there will be TAF-containing single-table regimens available for patients containing each of the major third agents, including unboosted and boosted integrase inhibitors, a boosted protease inhibitor and an NNRTI. We are deeply committed to continuing to innovate in the field of HIV treatment, particularly for the population of people who have been living with HIV for a long time and whose treatment needs have changed as they have aged.","The advancement of clinical trials for selonsertib and filgotinib has positioned Gilead as a leader in NASH and inflammatory diseases. In NASH, the rapid enrollment of patients has put Gilead in the lead in the development of treatments for patients with the most severe form of the disease. If selonsertib clinical studies read out positively in early 2019, Gilead will then be in a position to launch the first therapy for NASH in 2020.","We continue to be enthusiastic about filgotinib. In the ongoing Phase 3 studies, we are looking to see if the potential safety and efficacy advantages of a selective JAK1 inhibitor seen in pre-clinical and early clinical studies are borne out in these trials. In addition, Gilead's exploring five additional indications beyond rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.","As we enter 2018, we see that the market dynamics in HCV are stabilizing. Since the launch of sofosbuvir in 2013, we've seen multiple competitors come to market and we've launched three of our own new HCV therapies. With the launch of each new product \u2013 the launch of each new product was disruptive, leading to lower prices and shortened treatment duration, both highly beneficial to patients and payers.","Going forward, we don't see any new HCV product launches disrupting the market. This leaves two remaining variables, the number of patients to start therapy each year and market share versus our competitors. As Robin mentioned, we've set patient starts to continue to decline, although more slowly than in the past, and market share versus our competitors is expected to stabilize by the middle of this year.","Given these changes, Gilead's HCV revenue should be a more predictable, albeit smaller, piece of our financial story. By removing most of the overhang of declining HCV revenues going forward, we can focus on the positive financial trends driven by the continued uptake of TAF-containing regimens and short-term and long-term growth through Yescarta, selonsertib and filgotinib.","We've been open about our desire to increase our pipeline through acquisitions and partnerships with other companies, as we continue to actively seek new therapeutic advancements and technologies. We have both the financial strength and internal capability to aggressively pursue opportunities when we see them.","I am more excited than ever about the future of Gilead as we extend our efforts to help new groups of people with difficult diseases. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their dedication and service. It's because of your belief in our mission that we're able to reach millions of people with our life-saving medicines.","Thank you for your time today, and let's now open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Afternoon, guys. Thanks for the question and all the detail. So, John, when I look at hep C trends which could trough this year and they're offset by a positive impact from HIV, Yescarta and the pipeline, it looks like you guys could get back to growth exiting this year and maybe even going into 2019. How important is that to Gilead overall or do you view these franchises and moving parts more independently? Thanks.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Thanks, Geoff. Thanks for the questions. So of course we view all our franchises independently, but taken as a whole, that makes Gilead. And so we do think that it's important that we're able to stabilize HCV revenues and it's important that we be able to talk about the company with the future dynamics that I think will drive us. We're clearly very excited about TAF-based regimens. We're very eager to get Bictegravir F\/TAF launched. That will be another positive momentum going forward. As Norbert mentioned, we could file up to four NDA and BLAs going forward.","So I think after years of having to be defensive about HCV revenues declining, it's very nice to be on the other side of that and talk about the positive trends going forward and we hope that that will dominate the conversation throughout the year much as it did at the beginning of the year, beginning with JPMorgan.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Yee of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Thanks for the question. Good afternoon. Appreciate those comments as well. Following along that, I guess when you think about the slope of your revenues this year and your commentary about stabilization, thinking about the decline of hep C in the first half of the year and revenue growth with your other products, do you think that you would trough out this year and that you'd see yourself as a growing product franchise by the end of this year?","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hi, Michael. This is Robin. I mean, yes, I mean as John mentioned and I mentioned, we do see the HCV market dynamics stabilizing and removing that overhang. We do think that with our new HIV FTR launch of bictegravir \u2013 (29:42) BIC\/F\/TAF, as well as our other franchise, that we do overall see ourselves as a growth story. Even if you look at page 34 in our guidance, you can see overall our HCV franchise is expected to grow. And that's growth along with the LOE ex-U.S., as well as to taken to account our other franchise with Letairis. We're still showing overall growth in those core franchises over and above hepatitis C.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Abrahams of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Brian Abrahams - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Thanks very much for taking my question. In the CAR T space, obviously we've seen some consolidation lately. I'm just curious coming out of the CDL acquisition now, where should we look for your focus of investments going forward in technology enhancements that are going to be the most important for long-term competitive positioning, enhancement of delivery and expansion into additional populations from here? Thanks.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yes. Hi, Brian. It's John. So just a couple of comments on where we're going to go next. Without giving you any specifics, we have been fairly open in our conversations that we do think that there are additional technologies we want to use to enhance the capabilities we have, including gene editing technology. That's something we've talked about previously.","Obviously, there are several areas where we want to try to figure out where we could be more effective. One is increasing the number of targets that we can go at, so we're looking at additional targets. We are looking at ways that we can perhaps move from autologous to allogeneic or sort of universal donor CAR T. So that's technology that Kite was working on, and that we will continue to work on. Gene editing plays into that in some areas.","And then of course, anything that we could use to try to lessen the side effects of CAR T would be important to us. So we're looking at technologies, thoughts on how we could have perhaps a lower cytokine release syndrome, perhaps decrease the neurotoxicity associated with this. So all of these things are important to us, and we're very, very actively looking at these technologies right now.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Citi. Your line is now open.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So, if I remember correctly, back when you used to launch your HIV products, it would take a long time to get on the guidelines and it's a guideline-driven market, and then with Genvoya, that was extremely different. So do you have any sense with BIC\/F\/TAF whether or not we could see that hitting the guidelines sooner than expected, and what motivated the guidelines to change so quickly with Genvoya? Thanks.","Andrew Cheng - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hi, Robyn. It's Andrew Cheng speaking. So I think you're right. When we look back at the time that Genvoya was put on the DHHS guidelines in less than two weeks after approval, I think as it's difficult to surmise what drove them to do that. But one can take a look at the clinical profile and the differentiation versus TDF-based regimens that we saw in our registrational package, and that may have played a role in that.","In terms of the role of BIC\/F\/TAF and one thinks going forward, I think continuing what we've seen already with TAF-based regimens and how they've impacted HIV treatment throughout the United States, it seems reasonable that these will be adopted in the guidelines. Now the timeliness of which are, as you're driving at, are difficult to say. I think that we don't want to overcommit in terms of \u2013 they have a process in place and we look forward to working with them to get the BIC\/F\/TAF on the guidelines as soon as possible.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Go ahead, Norbert.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","I would like to reiterate what Andrew said. It used to take a long time many years ago, but in the case of Genvoya, it took exactly two weeks. So it's not true anymore that it takes a long time for it to get on the guidelines.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yes. It is a more dynamic process, and of course we also benefit that F\/TAF are viewed very favorably within the guidelines, and so that is a big help for us as we launch BIC\/F\/TAF.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges of Leerink. Your line is now open.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much, and I'll just ask a couple related questions below the line if I may, Robin. Your tax outlook is significantly better than we expected and that you've had before. Can you tell us what you view the sustainability of that tax rate? And as you move capital onshore and invest in manufacturing, can that come down any further from the range you're indicating for 2018? And then a similar question just related about operating margins. Looks like you're guiding to about 50% in 2018. Is that a stable number? Or do you think that that could come under further pressure as you ramp up R&D? Thanks.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Sure, Geoff. So to answer your first question, I do believe the range that I provided for you for tax rates are stable. I don't know if it's \u2013 it's not necessarily the overall mix, per se, of our revenue. To some extent, it is that. But I think with that lower U.S. tax rate and the fact that we've already seen a significant mix shift because of our HCV revenues declining, more revenues in the U.S., I do believe that's sustainable longer term. It's very fortuitous for us from a timeframe standpoint because with that shift, our rate would have creeped up pretty significantly in 2018 compared to 2017.","Relative to operating margin, I'd say we're a little higher than you project overall but still remain an industry leading. I do feel the 50% plus is sustainable for us. We are in investment mode when you think about R&D, et cetera, so, and we're several large Phase 3 trials, launching BIC\/F\/TAF, but obviously a lot of incremental opportunities going forward. So I would say yes, sustainable, and I think we'd aspire to see it even rise higher over time.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for taking the question. Norbert, I wanted to ask you a question on NASH. You highlighted both the STELLAR studies and the ACC, but you didn't talk a lot about the FXR. In your slides here, it says you had an interim on PBC and you completed the Phase 2 NASH study. Any comments on the profile there, if that's panning out as you had expected with lower rates of itching and some other differentiation versus some of the competitors in the market?","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yeah, Matt, thanks for the question. So the reason is simply that the FXR agonist is somewhat behind the ACC inhibitor. We both present, so the Phase 2 result, studies are just wrapping up. We're looking at the data and we intend to submit this to an upcoming conference, a liver conference. You will then see the results. So just to remind you with our FXR agonist, the hypothesis was that we don't want a high systemic exposure with the FXR agonist. So it got restricted or got focused mechanism of action that releases FGF19 that then goes into the circulation and provides the efficacy. So you will see the completed Phase 2 study at an upcoming conference.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Phil Nadeau of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I had a question on shifting market share in both HIV and HCV. So in HCV, you talk about a $4.3 billion to $4.6 billion year-over-year decrease because of competitive issues. Can you give us some idea of what type of share shift you anticipate in that guidance? And then similarly in HIV, you talk about a $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion increase. What type of share do you think you'll be able to take back with the Bictegravir combination pill? And what's assumed in that guidance? Thank you.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Phil, maybe I'll cover HCV and we'll have John cover HCV. But you know as we said, I think if you compare and take a look at our Q4 revenues of $2.3 billion relative to all the other players, our share is, we've done very well. And in 2018, it's reflective of that continued market share position. I don't want to get into specific percentages, and I think there will be puts and takes across the various markets, but we're very confident that with our product portfolio that we believe we can maintain market leadership position.","In the U.S., the market has moved towards more parity access, which we prefer, right, because it really leaves the prescribing decisions with doctors and patients. And we have been able to maintain parity or preferred access across the majority of the counts overall. So we believe that, yes, we think our share position bodes very well for 2018.","Operator","Thank you.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","I'm sorry. Phil had a two-part question, so we'll answer the HIV question. Thanks, operator. So you asked about market share for HIV. I will say that I'm going to talk about market share specifically, but I can tell you in the U.S., we expect to maintain our market share.","There are obviously some changes due to generic TDF in the United States. I don't think that will affect us very much, as Truvada is still protected. We do think that we can gain that growth that you mentioned through switches from protease inhibitors, so multi-tablet regimens and of course switches from single-tablet regimens. So we think there's enough switching business and then treatment-naive business in there for Bictegravir and additional growth in Genvoya that we'll do quite well in those areas.","In the European Union, however, we do think with the entry of generics in 2018, both TDF and TDF\/FTC and of course TDF\/FTC\/efavirenz, as Robin mentioned, that we will see some temporary decrease in market share and then long term growth getting beyond this year due to the approvals of B\/F\/TAF, Bictegravir\/F\/TAF, which will occur later in the year allowing us to launch in these various countries.","As we mentioned in some of our slides, we have seen incredible uptake of both Descovy and Genvoya across parts of the European Union. I think that bodes very well long term for TAF regimens, and so we're very, very enthusiastic and confident about that franchise there.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Umer Raffat of Evercore. Your line is now open.","Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI","Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking my question. Norbert, I wanted to drill down your STELLAR 4 trial in NASH. And my question is, what do you expect the placebo arm to track at on the percentage of patients that will have a one-stage improvement? And I'm also curious what level of visibility do you have on the ongoing STELLAR 3 and STELLAR 4 trials on the pooled event rate on a blinded basis? Thank you.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yes. So, Umer, the only thing I can point to is the Phase 2 study that we have done. I think I'm very confident we will repeat those numbers. Of course, they won't be exactly the same. As you may remember, the total N was somewhat small, but we saw a difference between placebo and the high-dose active arm at 20%. And we would be very happy with that because, as you know, the endpoint is fibrosis. Something that improves fibrosis or prevents fibrosis progression, that will be a tremendous asset and contribution to the healthcare system.","So the other study, I can tell you we of course are looking in an ongoing blinded way at safety, and I can tell you this, the compound is very safe. We are not seeing anything that would concern us, either laboratory abnormalities or adverse events or discontinuation rates. But having that said, I want to make sure that everybody understands we're blinded to the study. So it's a placebo-controlled study, but in the blinded data set, there is nothing that would concern us.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just one for me on Yescarta. Just wondering if you can talk to us about how important being first to market is in your view given potential entry of a third player next year? And then in your guidance, can you give us any color in terms of what you assume for second half of the year in Yescarta? Is there inflection or a step-up? Or should we just assume a steady Eddie here? Thanks.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","I do think first mover is very important with this area because it allows us to develop this rapport and relationship with the different cancer centers. And so I think a first mover advantage is important in this area. I'm not going to say that it's everything, but of course we have a second entry and then a third entry. You leaped right to the third, but we're expecting a second entry of course in Novartis.","And so I do think that is important so that we have the connectivity, we get through the paperwork, the REMS program. This has to be duplicated for each individual agent coming to market, and so it is more difficult to get the attention of the centers once they have something that works very, very well, which we hope they believe they have in Yescarta. So I think that is an important thing to consider.","You mentioned an inflection point, and as we mentioned on the call, we are now getting centers up and running. We have 28 centers currently that are up and now certified to prescribe Yescarta. We hope to have about 80% of the population by the midpoint in this year. And so I think what we're seeing with these centers is, as they get better at handling both the patients and the payment aspect of this, because that is a negotiation between the center and the payers themselves. As they get that down, it gets easier to bring in new patients, and so we do see a slowly growing momentum in each center as they get up and going.","So obviously, the second half of the year will be a lot better for enrolling patients than the first half of this year. But I don't see it a major inflection point, but just a growing building of patients over time, so that as we exit 2018, we should have a pretty good handle on what the typical flow rate at each center is and what they can handle.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Alethia Young of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and just one on Bictegravir switches. I know Atripla is still the number three regimen in the United States. So I'm trying to figure out like is it more an education with the doctors or is it finding the patients and bringing them back to therapy to encourage them to move to bictegravir versus Atripla thing?","Andrew Cheng - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","So, Alethia, it's Andrew. So I think it's a combination. When you look at the registrational studies that support the filing package, we had patients who were switching from protease-based inhibitors or multi-tablet regimens, which are \u2013 and keep in mind that protease inhibitors are no longer guideline for first-line regimens in the United States, and we have patients switching from Triumeq or the components of which. And so these two groups are probably the groups of individuals that we'll see a lot of the switches from overall as we launch the product.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ian Somaiya of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you, and thanks for taking my question. Just a question on Yescarta. I was just trying to maybe, just would love to get your help on putting that 80% number into actual patient \u2013 80% into actual patient numbers, how many patients does that represent? And as you think about eligibility, are there differences in eligibility as you think about the three different CAR T offerings?","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","So, Ian, I mean we think there's about 7,500 patients in the United States, so 80% of that is well over 5,000 patients. So it's a pretty good number of patients, far more than we would be able to treat this year for example, given our manufacturing capacity. So the 80% is also really something that we're thinking about geographically. You go to a lot of the big centers and there are a lot of people who may be eligible for Yescarta but are just in areas of the country where it's impractical or unlikely a center would be sent up, and so they would have to travel. So in fact, we think geographically it will be a bigger coverage than that. I'm sorry. Overall, it will be a bigger coverage than that but just sort of geographically if you look at it, it will cover about 80% of lives, so that's why we're keeping that at that number.","The second part of the question was, I forgot. It was about the \u2013 I'm sorry, Ian, I forgot the second part of your question.","Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","I think you answered it.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Hopefully I answered it. Okay. We'll move on, operator.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jim Birchenough of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Jim Birchenough - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yes. Hi, guys, and congrats on the progress. Just a question on the broader solid tumor opportunity for cell therapy and whether you feel like you've got the assets internally from Kite and from Cell Design Labs to have solid tumor success, and what are the timeliness for generating some solid tumor cell therapy data? Thanks.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yes so, Jim, I don't think we have everything that we need, and as John said, one thing missing is gene editing, but we are talking to companies and we will do more collaborative deals in that space. I would say it's early with solid tumors, that the problem with solid tumors, or the challenge I would say, is finding a tumor-specific antigen that is not expressed on normal cells. That is by the way a reason why we're excited about CDL, the synNotch technology. Essentially, it needs two antigens in order for the T-cell to get activated, so it gives you much broader specificity if you can go after two cells. Both have to be present at the same time in the same cell surface.","But on the other hand, it's really, it's early days I would say, but it's exciting and that's where the real opportunity lies for cell therapy, I mean, the real commercial opportunity. And you could, for instance, go after neoantigens, you could do shared antigens, and we have announced one study that is ongoing with MAGE A3, A6 with the Rosenberg Group at the NCI. And so that's the opportunity. So you will see more in that space coming from Gilead in the coming years.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","And I would say, Jim, we're going to spread out our bets a little bit, investing in various different technologies, because it's hard to predict which of these will have the breadth to be important and also the specificity and depth of response that's going to be important. So we'll be spreading our bets out there. We do think there's hopeful signs in the solid tumor area, but we've not yet \u2013 don't have much. It's not the similar kind of situation as it was with CD19.","And, Ian, I remembered the question you asked about the label and how the differences between the different labels. And clearly, we don't know what the groups have asked for in terms of labeling, but currently from what we see in the clinical studies, I don't anticipate the labels will be all that different going forward. But that could be a differentiating feature as it always is in medicine and that could lead to better access if the labels were truly differentiated from one another. Sorry, I forgot that at the time.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Cory Kasimov of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, great. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about your BCMA program. Can you talk about how you see potential differentiation here versus others in development? And will you be using the same manufacturing process as Yescarta or are there any new procedures being implemented as you have new CARs entering the clinic? Thanks.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yes hi, Cory. It's really too early to say what the differentiating features will be. We are currently doing dose escalation and it's really a Phase 1, Phase 2 study and we just have to see what the results are and how they compare to the competitors' products. And yes, we're using the same construct, so it's CDZ and \u2013 (51:12) CD28 costimulatory domain with an extracellular binding domain that's different, probably, from the competitors. We don't know that.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yes. And in terms of the manufacturing process, it's not exactly the same as Yescarta. So we are working out unique manufacturing processes for each of these, so it will be different. We haven't determined exactly how different at the moment.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Ying Huang of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a quick one for Norbert. I didn't see you including on the filgotinib male subject safety study in the timeline for 2018 to 2019, the slide deck. And then secondly, maybe another question on the pricing dynamics in HIV market. After you launch B\/F\/TAF in the U.S., do you expect your competitor GSK to use pricing as a potential weapon to keep its share? Thank you.","Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","Yes, Ying. Thanks for the question. That's very observant of you that you have not seen the study. Yes, so we are performing a safety study. As you know, there was a safety signal in pre-clinical studies and in order to justify the 200 milligram dose, which is the higher dose that we're using in this study, we were asked by FDA to perform this study. So the study is enrolling and the reason why we don't have any timelines in it is simply we don't know yet. It's too early. So we have sites up and running. It's somewhat slow, always at the start. We just simply, it's impossible to predict what the exact timelines are.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","And your second study was do we expect our competitors to lower prices. That has never happened in the field of HIV, but I don't know what even GSK are planning. That's all I can tell you.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from Hartaj Singh of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Hartaj Singh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Yeah, hi there. Thanks for the question. I just had a quick question on PrEP with Truvada. It's becoming a fairly decent sized portion of your business and you did indicate that DISCOVERY is now fully enrolled. Can you just talk a little bit about the dynamics for how you see Truvada playing out and then how would you see Descovy kind of rolling into that in the future? Thank you.","Andrew Cheng - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","So maybe \u2013 it's Andrew \u2013 so I'll just start with the first thing which is that the Descovy study is fully enrolled. It was fully enrolled in Q2 of 2017, so we expect to have results sometime in 2019. But keep in mind that it's an event-driven study so the exact timelines are slightly hard to predict this far out. It's not like our, let's say, the Bictegravir trials, which were 48-week studies that once we have our last patient, we can mark those, block those out.","Now in terms of the dynamics of how we see Truvada and Descovy interplay, I think it's difficult to say without the results of the trials to understand the differences, although it wouldn't be unreasonable to think about looking at the dynamics in play that we've seen with HIV treatment, where safety has been a very important factor in driving the switch from TDF-based regimens to TAF ones.","John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.","And I just want to add one bit of data to that, which is if we look at that typical patient who's taking Truvada today, for PrEP, they take it nearly on the frequency with people who take long-term HIV therapy, so about the same number of pills taken per year. So the exposure to TDF would be significant and would carry many of the same risks as TDF was for HIV-infected patients. So TAF may be a better option, particularly given that these patients are not HIV infected, and we think that could be an opportunity as well.","Operator","Thank you.

My name is Phil and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Patrick O'Brien","Thank you, Phil. Good afternoon, everyone. We issued a press release this afternoon providing earnings results for the second quarter which is available on our website where you can also find detailed slides that support today's call. For our prepared remarks and Q&A, I'm joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, John Martin; our President and Chief Operating Officer, John Milligan; our Executive Vice President of Research and Development, Norbert Bischofberger; our Executive Vice President of Commercial Operations, Kevin Young; and our Chief Financial Officer, Robin Washington.","Before we begin with our formal remarks, we want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements including plans and expectations with respect to our product candidates and financial projections, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in our latest SEC disclosure documents and recent press releases. In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.","We will also be using non-GAAP financial measures to help you understand our underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in our press release as well as on our website. I would now like to turn the call over to Robin Washington.","Robin Washington","Thank you, Patrick, and thank you all for joining us. We are very pleased with our strong operating results for the second quarter, delivering product sales of $2.7 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year and 11% sequentially and non-GAAP EPS of $0.50 per share. The U.S. contributed $1.6 billion to product sales, up 20% year-over-year driven by strong underlying demand across all therapeutic areas including the continued uptake of Complera and Stribild, our combined sales grew 11% over the previous quarter.","The launch of Stribild continues to go well. Strong prescription demand was partially offset by a reduction in wholesales inventory levels as Stribild was added to our existing inventory management agreements during the second quarter. Atripla, Complera and Stribild were the number one, two and three most prescribed HIV regimens for treatment na\u00efve patients in the U.S. Overall, major wholesaler inventory levels remain consistent quarter-over-quarter while sub-wholesaler inventories rebounded after a strong -- after a drawdown in the first quarter.","ADAP purchasing was robust in the second quarter and we are encouraged by the recent communications to states for their remaining funding allocation for the 2013 ADAP fiscal year. However, we anticipate a moderating of ADAP purchasing during the second half of 2013, given sequestration and strong purchasing during the first half of the year. Turning to Europe. We executed solidly with product sales of $818 million, up 7% year-over-year excluding the effects of FX. Driven by increased demand and purchasing in advance of the summer holidays.","One quarter following the launch in all big side EU markets as the player uptake continues to expand and is now the second most prescribed regimen for treatment na\u00efve patients. On May 28, the European Commission approved Stribild and we were able to launch in the UK and Germany in the following weeks.","Turning briefly to operating expenses, our combined R&D and SG&A spending were up approximately $70 million quarter over quarter. R&D spending in the first half of the year was driven predominantly by progression of clinical development activities in liver disease in oncology. We anticipate this level of spending to continue in the second half of the year. Additionally, we expect a ramp in SG&A expenses in the second half of the year as we prepare for the anticipated commercial launch of Sofosbuvir. Finally, we are reiterating full year guidance for 2013 as we remain confident in our core business and ability to continue to execute.","I will now turn the call over to Norbert.","Norbert Bischofberger","Thank you, Robin. I\u2019m pleased with the rapid progress across all our R&D programs and the high level of productivity. A large number of clinical development candidates are now being advanced from IND to Phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical development. First, a quick update on HIV. The two phase 3 studies evaluating TAF, Gilead\u2019s novel product of Tenofovir are consequently 50% enrolled. These two studies are identical in design, evaluating Stribild through a single tablet regimen of elvitegravir, cobi, emtricitabine and TAF in in treatment na\u00efve for HIV infected patients. We expect to complete enrolment of these two studies by the end of this year.","In our cardiovascular clinical development program, a number of datasets from various Phase 3 clinical tries will mature over the next 12 months, including three studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of Ranolazine in Type 2 diabetes, a study evaluating the use of Ranolazine to decrease the rate of revascularization and hospital readmission following Percutaneous Coronary Intervention, and the ambition study which evaluates the utility of upfront combination therapy for PAH with Letairis and Tadalafil compared to mono-therapy with Letairis or Tadalafil alone. We look forward to sharing these data with you as they become available.","I will focus my remaining remarks on our hematology and hepatitis C development activities. Starting with hepatitis C. New drug applications for Sofosbuvir have now been filed in the United States, Canada, the European Union, Switzerland, Turkey and Australia. We received notification from US FDA that the Sofosbuvir application has been assigned priority review with a PDUFA date of December 8. More recently, we were also informed that Sofosbuvir will be discussed at the Antiviral Drugs Advisory Committee Meeting scheduled for October 25.","Following approximately one year behind the Sofosbuvir single agent is the Sofosbuvir Ledipasvir fixed-dose combination which was granted breakthrough designation by the US Food and Drug Administration. Phase 2 results from the LONESTAR Study reported in a press release on May 2 2013, show that the fixed-dose combination resulted in 100% and 95% SVRs when used for eight weeks with and without ribavirin respectively. And it resulted in 95% cure rates when dosed for 12 weeks in difficult to treat previous protease inhibitor failure patients, half of who have cirrhosis.","The three pivotal studies that will support the marketing authorization applications of the fixed dose combinations in genotype 1 patients, IM-1, IM-2 and IM-3 are now fully enrolled. As a reminder, both IM-1 and IM-2 are identical in design, with four arms comparing 24 weeks of the fixed-dose combination to 12 weeks, each with and without ribavirin. IM-1 is productive in treatment na\u00efve patients and IM-2 in treatment experienced patients. IM-3 is three arm study in treatment na\u00efve patients comparing 12 weeks of the fixed-dose combination to eight weeks of the fixed-dose combination with and without ribavirin. The primary efficacy endpoint in these three SVR12 and the results from ION-2 and ION-3 should be available in the fourth quarter of this year. The SVR12 data from ION-1 is expected to become available in the first quarter of 2014 and thus we are on track to file for regulatory approvals in the second quarter of 2014.","At the last earnings call, we provided an update on our Japan Sofosbuvir development strategy for genotype 2 patients which represent about 25% of the HCV infected patients in Japan. This registrational program entails a single 12-week interferon free study of Sofosbuvir in in combination with ribavirin. And the first patient in this study was dosed just last week. We now also have agreement with the Japanese regulatory authority on a strategy in genotype 1 patients. The pivotal study would be a two arm study of the fixed dose combination with and without ribavirin for 12 weeks. And we plan to enroll the first patient in this study in the fourth quarter of this year.","We have also recently started our Japan office in Tokyo. Gilead Sciences K.K. would be lead our newly appointed President, Mr. [Uji Orihoma]. [Uji] has over 30 years experience in the Japanese pharmaceutical industry previously holding general management positions at Amgen and Teva. We anticipate adding additional staff over the coming months especially in the clinical development area as we execute the Phase 3 studies.","GS-5816 our pan-genotypic NS5A inhibitor is advancing in two Phase 2 studies. One study evaluates 12 weeks of treatment of GS-5816 and Sofosbuvir and in genotype 1 through genotype 6 treatment na\u00efve patients. And the other study evaluates 12 weeks of treatment of GS-5816 and sofosbuvir with and without ribavarin in genotype 3 treatment experienced patients of whom 50% have cirrhosis. Initial data from these two Phase 2 studies are anticipated later this year and based on those results we will make a decision about moving the fixed dose combination of GS-5816 and Sofosbuvir in to Phase III clinical development.","AASLD will be held of November 1 through 5 in Washington DC. Close to 60 abstracts were submitted to this meeting by Gilead or Gilead collaborators. The title of the abstracts will be published in a few weeks from now on the AASLD website. These submissions cover clinical, virology, pharmacodynamic, pharmacoeconomic and health outcomes of Sofosbuvir to Sofosbuvir\/ Ledipasvir specific dose combinations and GS-5816 as well as updates on Viread and TAF for hepatitis B. In particular, abstracts of the safety and efficacy of Sofosbuvir and ribavirin in pre-liver transplant, post-liver transplant and HIV co-infected patients are included.","Turning now to oncology. A number of presentations and posters in ASCO further define the profile of Idelalisib in B-cell malignancies. One presentation which was highlighted at an ASCO press briefing, described the efficacy and safety of idelalisib monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. In this study, treatment with idelalisib resulted in deep and durable lymph node responses with a median progression free survival of 17.1 months.","Another presentation was on the combination use of idelalisib and rituximab in elderly treatment naive CLL SLL patients. In this study, the overall response rate was 97% and the Kaplan-Meier estimate of progression-free survival at 24 months was 93%. Importantly, patients with (inaudible), and those with the (inaudible) all responded. In both studies, grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent adverse events or laboratory abnormalities were diarrhea, pneumonia, transaminase elevations and neutropenia.","At the International Conference for Malignant Lymphoma Meeting in Lugano last month, the results from study 101-09 in 125 indolent NHL patients were presented. The patients in this study represent a significant unmet need with few if any treatment options. They were doubly refractory to both rituximab and alkylating-agent. The median number of prior therapies was four and the majority of patients were refractory to the standard regimens and to their last therapeutic regimen. Treatment with idelalisib resulted in an overall response rate of 54%, a median duration of response of 11.9 months and the progression-free survival of 11.4 months.","Responses of broadly similar magnitude were seen across all subgroups, including folicular lymphoma, small cell lymphocytic lymphoma, Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobuminia and marginal zone lymphoma. The main toxicities were diarrhea and transaminase elevations. Five Phase III studies of idelalisib in indolent NHL and CLL are ongoing. One of these studies, study 116 comparing rituximab plus idelalisib to rituximab A plus placebo in relapsed CLL is now close to screening. It will be fully enrolled in August and an event driven interim analysis is anticipated to be conducted in the fourth quarter of this year.","Based on the very encouraging Phase II data in CLL and indolent NHL, particularly study 101-09 in double refractory indolent NHL patients, discussions have been initiated with U.S. FDA and a number of European regulatory agencies. As a result of the feedback received, we intend to file marketing authorization applications for idelalisib as a treatment for indolent NHL in both the U.S. and European Union in the fourth quarter of 2013. The outcome of the interim analysis of study 116 will guide our strategy for pursuing the near term filing for CLL also.","In addition to the clinical studies evaluating idelalisib in England NHL and CLL, GS-9973 a specific inhibitor of idelalisib is being studied for safety and efficacy in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies by itself and in combination with idelalisib. GS-9820 and backup PI3K delta inhibitor is in Phase I testing in B-cell malignancies. And our recently acquired JAK 1, 2 inhibitor Momelotinib has been successfully reformulated and we\u2019re currently in discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the specifics of the myelofibrosis Phase 3 program.","In summary, as we move into the second half of the year, we are delighted with the progress on all fronts across Gilead. Our key development programs are making significant progress. Marketing authorization applications for sofosbuvir have been submitted. And we will have a US advisory committee meeting on October 25 and a PDUFA date of December 8. In addition, we're planning on two additional NDA, MAA filings over the next 10 months, one on Idelalisib for indolent MHL in the fourth quarter of this year and one on sofosbuvir sofosbuvir\/ledipasvir fixed dose combination in the second quarter of next year.","We will now open the call to questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from line of Geoff Meacham from JPMorgan. Please proceed.","","Geoffrey Meacham \u2013 JPMorgan","Related on the Japan agreement, does the agreement for hep C speak to the review speed or the pace of reimbursement? And then related to that, I notice you guys are doing a similar study in India. So, just checking to see what other regions you expect to do -- if you expect other regions to have a country specific study? Thanks. ","Norbert Bischofberger","So, Geoff, your first question has to do whether the agreement has anything to do review times. Was that the question, the answer is no. We simply got agreement on (indiscernible) a Phase 3 strategy, and as I said this Phase 3 strategy in genotype 1 is a single-arm study of 12-weeks duration. Sofosbuvir and ribavirin agreement on genotype 1. This is a two-arm study of the fixed dose combination both with and without ribavirin for 12-weeks. We're looking a number of other geographies that require clinical studies, one of which we are actively enrolling that's Russia. and the other country we are looking at is China. So those are the only two. In China, we have not made the final decision as to what to do. And, Kevin, you had a question about reimbursement in Japan.","Kevin Young","Yeah, Geoff, right now any of the timelines don't include any reference to what we do from a reimbursement point of view. So, all of Norbert's comments were relating to very healthy and positive descriptions we've had with PMDA, and we're now starting to build out our own organization in Japan. Our intention would be to launch Sofosbuvir as Gilead with our own team and not requiring a partnership there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum from ISI Group. Please proceed.","Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group","Maybe I'll ask Kevin a question and ask the four if I might. And that is, how many patients, and I haven't been able to get an answer to it yet which is why I'm re-asking it, but how many patients in the U.S. and Europe do you estimate, hep C patients, excuse me, under the active care of hepatitis C specialists right now. And if I can just get latest -- if you won't answer that perhaps I could get comments from Robin or John on your perspective on use of cash right now. I know your balance sheet continues to improve, post Pharmasset deal there is a lot movement in press reports in the biotech landscape right now of M&A. I think it would be a nice time to get your updated thoughts on how Gilead plans to use the cash and your view on larger deals.","Kevin Young","Hey, Mark, it's Kevin. Yes, we are still essentially fine tuning the number that you are looking for. We are building sort of Ipsos like HIV database. It's based on a much smaller number of charts than we normally get per quarter relative to HIV. But we think once we've seen a couple of quarters and it looks solid and it looks reproducible that we will be able to share that number. So, I think we are getting there. We want to have something that is not chopping and changing every quarter. There wasn't a database there. Don't forget that it's taken us ten years really to get something as good as what we have got in HIV. So, we wanted to start this in the right way and try to give you a solid number that is going to have credibility. So, later in the year I think, and round about the launch of the product, I think we will be able to say that with some conviction.","Robin Washington","And Mark I'll go ahead and answer your second question. As we saw in the report, we are very close on a rounded basis to our 1.5 debt-to-EBITDA ratio. So as a result of that we will be resuming during the second half of 2013 our share repurchase program again focused primarily on dilution. I think regarding our overall capital strategy there has really been no change to that. We talked about focusing on debt, we'll continue to invest in our pipeline and we'll be selective relative to licensing and M&A opportunities focused on Phase 2, Phase 3 assets, as appropriate. And as mentioned, we'll be returning cash back to shareholders via share buybacks at this point in time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Porges from Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.","Geoffrey Porges - Sanford Bernstein","I suppose I inevitably have to ask, have you seen any LFT elevations in any of the patients experiences with supposed to -- given what's happened with what might have been your slimming competitor? And then presuming that the answer to that is no, could I just get a comment on the -- Norbert, what's the real role of 5816 given how quickly and broadly you're going with this [ledipasvir]? Thanks.","Norbert Bischofberger","Hi Jeff. So I can't say that we have not seen any LFT elevations because as you know they are part of Hepatitis C disease. But what I can say is that there is no evidence right now that we have seen anything that's related to either sofosbuvir or the sofosbuvir\/ledipasvir fixed dose combination that could be ascribed to either an adverse event or a laboratory abnormality. The second question has 5816. So Jeff, we are currently as you might know, doing this study of the fixed dose combination that contains 5885, in genotype 3 patients and we don't really know whether 5885 will not work in genotype 3. But based on the biology that we have looked at, I would expect it should not be optimal. So at least the 5816 compound will be a fixed dose combination non- ribavirin contained for genotype 3. But our intent is to really launch it more broadly as just a fixed-dose combination for anybody or everybody regardless of genotype.","I\u2019m sure you also know that the genotype assay is fairly straightforward to come by, but it\u2019s an extra test that I think if I remember correctly costs $400. So if could get rid of that and simply see you don't have to really worry about which genotype you are, we have one combination that works for all genotypes, that would be our strategy and that's what we're going to -- though if the Phase II data look supportive of that.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Matthew Roden from UBS securities. Please proceed.","Matthew Roden \u2013 UBS Securities","Congrats on all the recent progress, especially the early filing in NHL and CLL. The question here I think maybe is for Kevin. Last month the U.S. Preventive Services taskforce took a more positive stance on screening in Hep C with a grade of B in all patients in both cohorts. Obviously that's a positive step, but the analysis is still based on the current triple therapy standard of care. So is it reasonable to expect that once the next waves of products come out in Hep C, that that analysis will be revisited and improved up to an A? And if so, can you maybe draw on any of your inferences from your experience in HIV as to what the implications could be in terms of finding the patients diagnosis rates and over what timeframe would you expect it to manifest? Thanks.","Kevin Young","That's great question, Matt. Thank you very much. I have absolutely no doubt that as our new treatments come through, that we're going to see more and more calls for screening of HCV and treatment of HCV. Very interesting this week, in other parts of the world, in Germany we saw one of their leading opinion leaders on national news talking about how much Hepatitis C there was in Germany and the need to be screening patients and treating particularly in that baby boomer age bracket. Actually I think we did quite well to move from the original C category to B. So I have to say Matt, I don't think we have an expectation it's going to be raised to an A in the immediate future. The good news was I think a lot of opinion leaders mount the challenge and lobbied that it should go from the C to the B. We\u2019ve had some recent advisory boards in this area. And I think they were strongly of the opinion that the Hepatitis C test should get reimbursed and that's why a B category helps that. So I've no doubt that as we bring sofosbuvir and eventually all oral to the market that there is going to be a drive to be screening the older population and potentially treating hepatitis C.","Matthew Roden \u2013 UBS Securities","Would it be a reach to infer anything from your experience in HIV in terms of the extent to which this can help capture or identify patients and over what timeframe?","Kevin Young","I think it tends to be the longer timeframe. I think we have done well in hepatitis C but it's a progressive --HIV, but it's a progressive thing, Matt. These things all help and they all buildup. Obviously, we've got to go and be talking to the payers, we got to be talking to perhaps some of the companies that are supplying the hepatitis C tests. It's work that we have good experience from HIV and I think we'll be launching into that in and around the launch of Sofosbuvir.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rachel McMinn from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Rachel McMinn - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I wanted to ask about oncology. You highlighted you are going to be filing for Idelalisib and maybe even in CLL after the initial NHL filing. How do you view the big picture competitive landscape with Ibrutinib filed before you and obviously there's very strong clinical data out there? Do you think you need to have positive [SEC combo] data for this franchise to really take off or do you think Idelalisib on its own can be competitive? Thank you.","Norbert Bischofberger","So, Rachel, I'm actually a little bit surprised that the public doesn't seem to be appreciating the data that we have on Idelalisib as much as they should. So first of all let me say something about Ibrutinib. It's a very good product and they have excellent data (inaudible). But if I look at the data in CLL, the NEJM paper that was just published, it's not too different from what we get in CLL from the study that Jennifer Brown presented at ASCO. And the other thing, let me just point somebody else out. The other study that Susan O'Brien presented at ASCO, so the upfront treatment na\u00efve in elderly with 97% response rate and their progression-free survival estimated at 24 weeks of 93%, let me just make a comparison.","GA101, which as you know there was a press release yesterday by Roche, very nice improved efficacy over rituximab. But if you look at their study, it was GA101 with chlorambucil, ours was rituximab plus Idelalisib. They had a progression-free survival, median progression-free survival of 23 months. So at 23 months, half of the patients have progressed. In our study, at 24 months, 93 have not progressed, 93%. So, and in addition, we have now -- this is a non-chemotherapy, non-alkylating therapy. I mean, this is I think huge progress and I think there is going to be a big role for this compound in the CLL market even in treatment na\u00efve patients. I mean, that has to wait of course until we have done the Phase 3 studies. The initial indication will be for relapsed refractory.","You know the other -- let me make another comment if I may, you know the other thing, I don't think in disease like CLL or NHL you can look at market share. Because patients will live longer and longer with more therapies coming along and I think over time the model should more be that all of them will circle through most of the drugs. So, it's not so much a question of a fixed view of this is the percent market share, but more as people live longer that more and more of these drugs will be used. That's what has happened in multiple myeloma. As you know the survival was 2 years, now it's more like ten years. And so more and more patients circle through the drugs. So I am sorry about my long winded answer but I had to say this. Kevin, do you have any...?","Kevin Young","And, Rachel, just to say that we are going to be very committed commercially to this launch. We will build a business unit for oncology. We already have a very nice group of people here at Gilead who have got good experience in sales and marketing oncology. We are now running our analysis on the right size of field force. We want to be ready obviously by the middle of next year. That's about the right timeline based on the fourth quarter NHL submission and we see this as a strong long-term commitment to the world of oncology.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber from Citi. Please proceed.","Yaron Werber \u2013 Citi","So if you don't mind, I just wanted to sneak in a couple of questions. One, both Hep C related, one, just Norbert, help us understand a little bit the -- increasingly there\u2019s a correlation that SVR4 is correlated with SVR12. Is there any chance you can start a rolling NVA based on SVR4 and maybe file at some point in Q1? And then Kevin, a question for you, about a third of the Hep-C patients or sitting in potentially some kind of a prison. There\u2019s not really good reimbursement right now for those patients. Is that anything that Gilead can do to help access these patients?","Norbert Bischofberger","So Yaron, I want to take the first question. I think that thought, I don't even want to entertain because I think the FDA gave the world a big gift when they said you can file with SVR12 instead of SVR24. That was a big step forward. And remember the other thing is that you can't necessarily conclude from one drug to the other. So if we see a high correlation of SVR12 with SVR12 with sofosbuvir\/ribavirin or sofosbuvir peg-interferon ribavirin, you can necessarily conclude from that that the same correlation would hold with our fixed-dose combination. So no, our regulatory endpoint is SVR12. That's what we were working towards and we have not even had any conversations with any regulatory agencies of potentially filing with SVR4. So I think that will be asked for too much.","Kevin Young","Hey Yaron, it's Kevin. We've had a lot of conversations advisory boards with payors and providers, private, Medicaid, Medicare, VA, corrections. So we've gone across the board from the point of view of the opportunities and the need for sofosbuvir. Certainly in the correctional setting, long-term interferon is very, very difficult just because of people with multiple other comorbidities and psychological problems and obviously transition potentially from the correctional setting back into society. So we\u2019ve had productive discussions. I think we\u2019re going to see some uptake. However, I do think it's going to be a little bit slower, then obviously we'll see a very healthy uptake we believe in the private commercial market, and the other target really for us, which is the VA setting. So I think in terms of prioritization, we're looking at the opportunity to really run programs with the VA as a higher priority than the correctional setting. But we have a correctional team. It's something that we're going to be working on. We\u2019ve had success with HIV and it's certainly in our plans.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams from Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.","Brian Abrahams \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more granularity on the idelalisib regulatory discussions, in terms of how the views on the bar for potential filing and approval on Phase 2 data may differ, if at all, between U.S. and Europe, what initial label you plan to seek? And then what your feedback has been from clinicians since the delta data were reported in terms of how they're expecting to use the drug initially? Thanks.","Norbert Bischofberger","So Brian, the discussions were actually -- so we talked to four European regulatory agencies and the U.S. FDA and actually to my surprise the feedback was very uniform. All the agencies said, absolutely, you have enough data to file for the iNHL indication and the label that would almost certainly read, that would represent the study population which is [doubly] refractory to both rituximab and alkylating-agent. The discussions that we had where opinions were divided a little bit is on CLL and Sharon still had to do Brian that -- you know the study that Susan O'Brien presented at ASCO, the end was 64, but this was also a dose -- it was a number of different doses.","So at the dose which we're seeking to register which is the 150 mg BID, we actually only had 11 patients on that experience. And just like FDA data of 11 patients is really not enough and I have to in a way agree with them. But again, the discussion then became move to study 116, that's what I said today. There will be an interim analysis done that certainly has enough patients. And if that interim analysis turns out positive then we would use those data either to file a new NDA in the U.S. or to update the file during the review in Europe. That's the current plan. And, Kevin, was there another question.","Kevin Young","No, I think answered your question, right, Brian?","Brian Abrahams - Wells Fargo Securities","Yes. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets","Just a philosophical question on how we are thinking about the commercial launch of 7977 which is obviously somewhat around the corner. A lot of people are looking at what Vertex and Merck did in their opening quarters and it was like $500 million combined or so per quarter which was a pretty big annual run rate. But presumably you would do at least that and there is a difference in price and then certainly you have a different efficacy and safety profile. So, how should we be thinking about that relative to what the competitors were doing a couple of years ago? Is there something that we should be thinking about both positively or negatively there?","Kevin Young","I think you can take some insights and some proxies from the launch of the protease inhibitors but other things you can't. Let's not forget that there was quite a lot of pent-up demand for the PIs whatever their profile was turned out to be, there was a lot of pent-up demand over the years until they came out. Clearly, I think physicians have been underwhelmed and have the challenges with the protease inhibitors. If you look at the sort of annualized treatment rates, it's coming down and we expect it to be back at the pre-protease inhibitor levels for the launch of Sofosbuvir. But there's likely to be some patients waiting, but it probably isn't at the levels that we're waiting at the time of the protease inhibitors because there hasn\u2019t been that cumulative number of years.","Having said that, we have a very, very exciting profile and our expectation is that over two to three year timeframe, that the levels of treatment can go back to if not exceed the levels in the heyday of the pegylated interferons, which was a treatment rate of approximately 150,000 patients per year. So, I certainly think we can get back to those type of levels because of the very strong profile that we have. So, those would be the comments that I would have on the sort of a comparison with the protease inhibitors.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank","Quick question on the panel. So what do you think we should really be thinking about as far as the discussion points for the panel? What do you think the key issues will be that actually you will ask the panel to that? And then I just want to make sure, I may have missed this, what is triggering an interim for 116, at what point would you have the interim analysis? Thanks.","Norbert Bischofberger","So, Robyn, I will answer the second question first, because it's fairly straightforward. It's event driven. As you know the endpoint is PFS, and once we have the requisite number of either progressions or deaths, we will do an interim analysis and then look at where the -- is it on the placebo arm, on the Idelalisib arm. And if there is a highly statistically significant P value then the protocol would call for stopping the study because we've answered the question. By the way, this is not dissimilar to what was disclosed yesterday by Roche with GA101 program.","And then the other question you asked is a good one because we had the same question internally. The only thing I could think of the unanswered question in the NDA submission was really what's the optimal treatment for genotype 3? As you know, we have done this study with 12 and 16 week duration. 12 was okay. 16 week was better. So the question becomes, would 24 be even better than 16? Obviously, we don't have data in the NDA.","And the other question, would genotype 3 be easier treated with the neutrino regimen which is 12 weeks of pegylated interferon\/ ribavirin with sofosbuvir. And actually FDA asked us to answer this question and do a randomized study. So we're initiating a study. We're randomizing patients to even sofosbuvir, 16 weeks of sofosbuvir and riba \u2013 sofosbuvir and ribavirin 16, telaprevir\/ribavirin 24, and sofosbuvir for patients that (inaudible) ribavirin 12. That will answer the question again. But again the panel will have the challenge of dealing with the existing data that was submitted and make a recommendation as to what should show up in the label I think. But that's the only thing I can think of that\u2019s substantive.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya from Piper Jaferry. Please proceed.","Ian Somaiya \u2013 Piper Jaferry","Just wanted to follow up on Brian's question on the regulatory view on Phase 2 approvals. Would your approval in NHL and potentially pharmaceutical approval for Ibrutinib in CLL, will that preclude another company from coming in and filing and potentially getting approval on Phase 2 data on either of these indications? Was that even a consideration?","Norbert Bischofberger","Ian, I'm trying to understand what you are getting at, because no. If another company has another agent that shows efficacy in some unmet need population, I don't think it would preclude them from getting approval.","Ian Somaiya \u2013 Piper Jaferry","I guess the question is more specific to a similar patient population. If another company were to come in and file for the same patients population that you\u2019re seeking approval, different drug, potentially slightly different data, would the regulatory body be accepting of that application or willing to review it?","Norbert Bischofberger","It cannot. The devil is in the detail and it depends, but I would on the one hand say yes. On the other hand since there are new agents now going to be available, maybe if everything works out, Ibrutinib and idelalisib, those are going to be players. And you will probably have to show that those that the patient population is refractory to those as well. That's what I would think would happen. Ian, the population that we study, the indolent NHL refractory to Rituximab, refractory to an alkylating agent, refractory to the last regimen, refractory to the most common regimens and they were 54 years old on the average. There is maybe nothing left for them. Normally you would say bone marrow transplantation, but you don't do bone marrow transplantation. There is too much morbidity in that older population. So there is really nothing available currently on the market. So that's the rationale for FDA to accept the file and review the data and hopefully approve it.","Ian Somaiya \u2013 Piper Jaferry","And just a housekeeping question, Robin or Kevin. I don't know which one is more appropriate for. Just Stribild was a little bit light this quarter. I might have missed some of the earlier comments you made related to it. Can you just tell us if there's a one-off event or one-time event?","Kevin Young","Hey Ian, it's Kevin. Thanks for the question. Basically with a new product, it tends to float outside our inventory management agreements. Our major wholesalers like to have enough supply, never quite know how a drug is being taken up. Same with Complera, as it was with Stribild. It will be the same with sofosbuvir. So typically, after about nine months, we agree that it's time for the drug to go within the inventory management agreements, because there is a clear trend and we're able to discuss that with the major wholesaler and that's what's happened. So there was a little burn off of major wholesaler inventory, and that's what clicked Stribild down. I would say Ian, that we're really pleased with the uptake of Stribild. If you look at some of the prescription volumes quarter-over-quarter, Q2 grew by 52% over Q1. The actual dollars for Stribild were 50% higher than Complera, the equivalent quarter post-launch. So, we're pretty satisfied that the underlying trend for Stribild is very, very sound. So we think things are going very well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Phil Nadeau from Cowen. Please proceed.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Company","Kevin, it's for you. You briefly mentioned some of the work you're doing in advance of the Sofosbuvir launch. Could you provide us more details what work you're doing with insurance companies and physicians to prepare them for Sofosbuvir today? And then also, in regards to the VA, what work you're doing there? That's a market that we've seen to be price sensitive in the past. Is there some way that you can make them be less price sensitive and strictly sofosbuvir even if lower price competitors were launched after you? Thanks.","Kevin Young","Great questions, Phil. Let me try and just give you a little bit of a color on where we are with the kind of readiness. First things I'd say [fairly] is that we've hired now all our field based teams. So, that's our medical scientists, national account managers, and we've hired our new HCV sales team. We've sized that team in a very robust way. This is for today's treaters, for treaters that have dropped off but we believe can come back to treat HCV, and we sized it for future HCV treaters. So, we believe we've got the sizing right. That team of sales representatives are beginning sales training and that will be a very rigorous and very intensive three months of sales training.","Our medical scientists and national account managers are actually currently involved in disease awareness education. And as I said earlier, we've been conducting quite a number of advisory boards across all our customer segments physician, nurse practitioner, managed care areas, the VA and corrections. And the last thing before I talk a little bit more about the payer, we have now settled on what will be our supply chain, what wholesalers and what specialty pharmacists will be involved in the distribution and supply of Sofosbuvir. We've done a lot of work on the payer fronts. Clear insight is that the payer was really quite dissatisfied and upset with the introduction of the protease inhibitors. I don't think they were expecting the cost and certainly they were not expecting the poor value in and around the inability for the patient to take the therapy or finish the course of therapy.","The payer clearly is looking at efficacy as the number one criteria, the SVR rates, but really want products that are very assured in terms of getting patients through therapy and curing patients. So, around value. We certainly expect that the current prior authorization to the label for HCV treatments will remain in place with Sofosbuvir. The good news is that the officers are very familiar with the prior authorization step, and they can easily do it via computer or via the phone. So, we are expecting that there will be very good payer coverage and that the profile of Sofosbuvir certainly will get very good support from a payer point of view.","In terms of the VA, we think Sofosbuvir whether it would be for GT 2 or the shortened duration of interferon for GT 1, will be a nice profile for VA. As we are going in with that profile, we think that will be very supportive of a healthy pricing position. We obviously want to leave as much of the decision around using Sofosbuvir in the hands of the prescriber and on occasions that does require some discounting with selective payers, but we'll be ready for that. So I'm very positive about the possibilities of healthy uptake in the VA setting.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Skorney from Robert Baird. Please proceed.","Brian Skorney \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Congrats on a really great quarter. I have two quick ones if I can. I just want to -- assuming that the PI3K Phase 2 combo progresses, wondering if you could just give us an idea of your general thoughts on how you view pivotal combination development. It strikes me that given the efficacy that you see with Idelalisib as a single agent, it could be very difficult to show a benefit by the combination rule on something like PFS or OS when you add the SIC inhibitor, particularly in earlier lines of therapy, where you could probably argue that's theoretically where this type of regimen could be most useful. Have you started thinking about that or discussing with regulators what flexibility they have around the Phase 3 trial designs or any idea what we can think about in terms of a pivotal design for the combo?","Norbert Bischofberger","Hi Brian. No. So we have not had any conversations with regulators and obviously it really depends on what we\u2019re seeing in the Phase 2 studies. But the SIC PI3K combination, I don't know if you\u2019re familiar with all the data in-vitro, there's synergy. We\u2019ve actually seen synergy in humans when you look at base of an activation assay. So it's a really promising combination, which in fact we now see in Phase 2 what the combination shows and based on that we will go into Phase 3. But to give you some -- one example, for DLBCL for instance will be something where -- it seems like our compact \u2013 we don't have enough data yet. We have to study, but Idelalisib may not be completely satisfactory. And as you know, neither is Ibrutinib, particularly in the larger terminal center subset and the APC subset that seems to be working. So I\u2019m sure there will be an immediate place for a combination in one of these subsets of B-cell hematological malignancies where the single agents won't work. But again that will all be guided by Phase 2 data.","Brian Skorney \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Norbert, just to jump quickly to Hep C as a follow-up to Jeff's question, I know you were looking at 5885, 7977 in GT3 patients and in an ARM and ELECTRON. Have you got data from that yet? You didn't mention in response to his question about 5885.","Norbert Bischofberger","Brian, those data will probably be at AASLD assuming the abstract gets accepted. But to make a long story short, the numbers particularly in genotype 3 were too small to make any definitive conclusions. And that's why we have now expanded or enrolled another cohort in genotype 3 that's 50 patients. So those 50 patients will then really give us the answer where the response rate is. The thing with small numbers, so we have a total of eight genotype 3 patients and the confidence intervals with whatever results you get goes from perfect to miserable. The answer is one of those or something in between. We can only enter it if we have larger numbers. We should get those data towards -- in the fourth quarter of this year.","Operator","(Operator instructions). Your next question comes from the line of Howard Liang from Leerink. Please proceed.","Howard Liang \u2013 Leerink","Is your filing for Idelalisib for indolent NHL in the first quarter, would that be for accelerated approvals or full approval?","Norbert Bischofberger","Howard, that has been a debate and the answer is we don\u2019t know. You could make an argument, we should get full approvals because there is no -- it's a progression. There is an ORR in the PSA same point and those are not sold at the endpoint. So it shouldn't be accelerated approval. It should be full approved, but that's obviously a review issue and ultimately an FDA decision.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Terence Flynn \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Two for me. I was just wondering if you can update us on plans for TAF protease inhibitor combo and when we might hear about plans to go forward there. And then anything on the arbitration front with Roche regarding 7977? Thanks a lot.","Norbert Bischofberger","So, in terms of the TAF, the (inaudible) combination is still in Phase 2. As you may remember the response rates that you typically get with protease inhibitors are not as fast as they are with NNRTIs and they are certainly not as fast as they are with integrase inhibitors. So, if you look at the proportion and you take the global time at week 24, it's not the maximum yet. So we really have to go to 48 weeks to ascertain what the real end-point is. And we should get those data sometime in the third quarter of this year. John, do you want to?","John Milligan","It's John Milligan. So the question about the Roche arbitration, there is really nothing to report. It's going along fairly much as scheduled so we really don't expect anything to happen this year as we go through the process of discovery and moving along the process as to finding the contract. So there is nothing new to report here today.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Sendek from Stifel. Please proceed.","Joel Sendek - Stifel Nicolaus","I know it might be a little bit premature to ask this question but just what you think about pricing, pretty much all your new drugs, whether it's sofosbuvir or idelalisib. Is there any thought to may be thinking differently in pricing for cure as opposed to the traditional way of pricing just individually per patient as it becomes more difficult to get full reimbursement?","Kevin Young","Hey, Joel, it's Kevin. I think we look at it always. Obviously with something like, for example genotype 1 HCV, today you got telaprevir and then you've got varying time periods for your peg riba. So you've got the individual PI, you've got the complete therapy and you've got cost to cure. So I think we look at it in all of those different directions and we are going through all of those deliberations right now for Sofosbuvir. I think ultimately, Joel, honestly, I am a bit of a traditionalist and you can look at all of those ways and often companies use sort of, I would say, elaborate ways of pricing because of challenges around the profile of the drug. I think ultimately you do come down to a (inaudible) list price and I think that's where we will be solidly, very clearly, when we come to the launch of Sofosbuvir. So, I think you will see a very clear and a very straightforward way of pricing Sofosbuvir.","Norbert Bischofberger","Joel, I'd like to add something. Ultimately, as we optimize the treatment modality, particularly the fixed dose combination in 5816 that comes behind it, price per cure and price per treatment should actually be the same because each treatment equals a cure. As I have said in the LONESTAR study, it's difficult to treat PI failures half of which were cirrhotic, we had 95% cure rate. So, that ultimately I hope it won't be an issue.","Operator","Mr. O'Brien, we have time for one more question coming from the line of Jason Kolbert from Maxim. Please proceed.","Jason Kolbert - Maxim Group","Just want to ask you same type of question only about Japan and pricing? What is the cost for the standard of care in Japan today and how do the Japanese look at pricing versus how the Americans look at pricing. So, can you give us a feel for where the value of a patient cure is in Japan?","Kevin Young","Hey, Jason, this is Kevin. I see, it's a very simple question you have asked but it's quite difficult to answer because the age of the patients, 43% of Japanese patients are over the age of 65 and they are in advanced stage of their disease, they have had it for a long time. A lot of them are in significant cirrhosis moving to carcinoma. They just are ineligible to the current standard. So, pegylated interferon ribavirin is extremely difficult. And that's why the Japanese opinion leaders and the Japanese patients are very much looking forward to, for example, entry with GT 2, which is just having sofosbuvir and ribavirin.","So, I think in terms of pricing in some ways you cannot wipe the slate clean, and you\u2019re going with these new therapies. And the traditional approach is not a great pegging of price. Typically the Japanese markets do have a discount to the U.S. market. So I think that will be still applicable with sofosbuvir. But I think we\u2019re really starting fresh with these new treatments and the very high need of the typical -- and the profile that the Japanese patient has.","Patrick O'Brien","Thanks, Phil, and thanks everyone for joining us today on the call. We appreciate your continued interest in Gilead and the team here looks forward to providing you with updates on our future progress. Cheers."]}}
