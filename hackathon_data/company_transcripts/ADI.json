At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Analog Devices First Quarter and Fiscal Year 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the opening remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. Please limit yourself to one question to ensure that management has adequate time to speak to everyone.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Ali Hussein, Treasurer and Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Ali Husain - Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations","All right. Good morning. Thanks, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining ADI's first quarter 2016 conference call. You can find our press release, relating financial schedules and our investor toolkit at investor.analog.com. As usual, I'm joined this morning by ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche; ADI's CFO, David Zinsner. The format for today's call will be slightly different. Today's prepared remarks will be relatively short because we want to devote most of the call to Q&A. So, before we start, let's get through some disclosures.","Please note the information we're about to discuss, including our objectives and outlook, includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.","Our comments today will also include non-GAAP financial measures which we have reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in today's earnings release, which we've posted at investor.analog.com. And so with all that behind us, let's get started.","So as you've likely seen, revenue in the first quarter totaled $769 million, which is about even to the same period in the prior year. Compared to the prior quarter, revenue decreased 21%, but this sequential revenue performance masked what was really a tale of two narratives. While weakness in the consumer portable sector exacerbated what is typical seasonal weakness within the consumer market, our business-to-business or B2B markets of industrial, automotive, and communications infrastructure combined to perform in line with our expectations.","So let me give you a little color on our performance. The industrial market at 45% of revenue decreased 5% sequentially during the seasonally weaker first quarter, which was a good result in a challenging macro environment. Compared to the prior year, the industrial market was stable. The automotive market at 16% of revenue decreased 4% sequentially with all sectors flat to down and in line with the seasonal patterns. As compared to the same period in the prior year, revenue from ADAS or advanced drive assistance systems increased 22%. Powertrain sector revenue grew 8%, and infotainment sector revenue increased 6%.","Turning now to communications infrastructure, revenue in this market increased 4% sequentially, which was well ahead of seasonal patterns. Revenue from both wireless and wireline infrastructure customers increased sequentially, as we believe the trough in the wireless market turns into a nascent recovery. As compared to the prior year, wireless revenues decreased while revenue from wireline customers increased.","In total, ADI's B2B market decreased 3% sequentially. Now in the consumer market, revenues decreased 60% sequentially to $126 million. And this market represented 16% of sales. While prosumer audio\/video applications decreased in line with seasonal patterns, revenue from portable consumer applications declined significantly as a result of weaker than forecasted customer demand in this sector, after a prior quarter performance that had far exceeded expectations.","So now, I will turn the call over to Dave for details of our financial performance in 1Q 2016. With the exception of revenue, Dave's comments in our first quarter P&L line items will exclude special items, which in the aggregate totaled $22 million for the quarter. When comparing our first quarter performance to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior quarter and year-over-year results. And reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their comparable GAAP measures are included on Schedule E in today's release.","So, Dave, over to you.","David A. Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Ali. The first quarter was a challenging quarter as we executed through weaker economic conditions and significant weakness in the portable consumer electronics sector. Nevertheless, our B2B markets combined to perform in line with our expectations, and we repurchased $132 million of our shares in response to stock price volatility, which helped reduce our share count by approximately 1%. Revenue in the first quarter totaled $769 million, and diluted earnings per share was $0.56.","Gross margin of 62.2% decreased 350 basis points from the prior quarter, primarily on higher inventory reserves and lower utilization rates. Inventory on a dollars basis decreased $7 million sequentially and on a days basis was 128 days on lower sales.","Utilization rates in the first quarter were in the mid-50%s, and we are planning to increase utilization to the high 60%s in the second quarter. Weeks of inventory and distribution were approximately 7.5 weeks, consistent with the prior quarter.","Operating expenses of approximately $265 million declined $27 million, or 9% sequentially and were flat to the prior year as we continued to carefully manage expenses. Operating profit before tax of $214 million or 27.8% of sales decreased from both the prior quarter and the year-ago period. Other expense was approximately $10 million as we raised $1.25 billion in 10-year and 30-year notes. We expect our net interest expense for the remainder of fiscal 2016 to be approximately $15 million per quarter.","Our first quarter tax rate was approximately 13%, which we expect will be our tax rate for the remainder of fiscal 2016. Excluding special items, diluted earnings per share was $0.56, which was a decrease of 11% as compared to the prior year on higher inventory reserves and interest expense.","Nevertheless, our strong financial model continued to generate solid cash flows, which we used to enhance shareholder returns. Excluding a one-time payment relating to the conversion of our Irish pension plan, over the past 12 months, ADI has generated free cash flow of $1 billion, or 30% of sales, and we have returned $800 million to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.","The first quarter was also a strong working capital quarter, during which free cash flow as a percent of revenue increased to 26%, up from 19% in the prior year, which is an increase of approximately 700 basis points. Capital additions in the first quarter were $23 million, or 3% of revenue, and we are planning for capital additions in 2016 to be in the range of $130 million to $150 million.","In line with our capital allocation strategy, our board of directors approved a $0.02 increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.42 per share, which is payable on March 8, 2016. This dividend represents the 13th dividend increase in the last 12 years. At the current stock price, our dividend yield is approximately 3.2%.","Our board also increased the authorization under our stock repurchase program to $1 billion as we plan to continue to repurchase our stock during periods of stock price volatility. We ended the quarter with a cash and short-term investment balance of $3.8 billion with approximately $1.2 billion available domestically. We had approximately $1.7 billion in debt outstanding, which resulted in a net cash position of $2.1 billion.","Now turning to our outlook for the second quarter, which with the exception of revenue expectations is on a non-GAAP basis and excludes special items that are outlined in today's release. While we are cautious about the macroeconomic environment, current order trends in the industrial, automotive, and communications infrastructure markets suggest combined sequential revenue growth in these B2B markets to be in the mid-to-high single digits in the second quarter.","In consumer, we are expecting another quarter of sequential weakness within the portable sector of this market. In the aggregate, we are planning for revenue in the second quarter to be in the range of minus 2% to plus 4% sequentially. Gross margins are expected to increase to approximately 65.5% in the second quarter on higher utilization, more favorable mix, and lower expected inventory reserves as compared to the first quarter.","We estimate that operating expenses will be up slightly in the second quarter and as a result for operating margins to expand sequentially. Based on these estimates and excluding any special items, diluted earnings per share are planned to be in the range of $0.58 to $0.66, which at the mid-point would represent an 11% sequential increase in EPS.","We are currently operating at the lower end of our financial leverage model range, and we are carefully managing production levels and operating expenses. As business conditions improve, we should drive better operating leverage. Overall, we estimate that we have approximately 800 basis points of operating leverage remaining in our financial model based on our first quarter exit rates.","While near-term market headlines warrant caution, we believe our future prospects remain strong. We have been deepening and broadening our customer engagements while investing in our most critical technology vectors to support a long-term growth. And together with our operating model, these place ADI on a strong platform to achieve up to five dollars in non-GAAP earnings by 2020.","And so now I'll turn the call back over to Ali.","Ali Husain - Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, Dave. All right. So, folks, before we get to Q&A, let's just run through the format. Please limit yourself to one question. If you have a follow-up, please re-queue. And again, we do this in the spirit of fairness, so that all callers get to ask at least one of their questions. We plan to run the call until 11:00, so I think that's plenty of time to get to everyone's questions.","So with that, operator, let's start the Q&A session and folks on the line can ask questions of either Vince, Dave or myself.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Thank you. Good morning, folks. I had a long-term question on the automotive segment for any of you gents who could answer. Autos has been a great business for you long term, last year didn't grow. Can you just help us \u2013 sorry, I'm in a hotel room. Can you please help us understand where the business is positioned in some of the newer areas such as ADAS, self-driving push, safety? So in a sense, what drove the business in the last five years? And what should we be looking at in the future? Thank you.","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Well, Ambrish, as you know, our automotive business has three major components to it. One is the infotainment sector, which is largely built around audio and media products. We have a strong powertrain business which in the past number of years has been driven really by our strength in battery monitoring and control. And last but not least, the safety business, which has three major components \u2013 passive safety and active safety, which are largely MEMS-based activities, and advanced driver assistance.","Now I can tell you that all those sectors grew over the last several years. The infotainment area has grown in the high single digits. Same thing with the powertrain business. And where we have run into headwinds really is on the MEMS side of the safety business. The advanced driver assistance piece, in fact, has been growing at a rate of about 20% over the last two years or three years.","And in the MEMS area specifically, we have been very careful to exit parts of the business that were commoditizing and focusing our R&D in areas where we can get the kind of returns on performance driven products. So that's where we've suffered the headwind, and it provided a dampening effect over the last year in particular. My sense is based on what I hear from customers, what our business units are predicting is that in the latter half of this year we'll be back into, I think, a pretty solid growth pattern with regard to automotive in general across all those three sectors.","Ali Husain - Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, Ambrish. And let's get to our next caller.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel.","Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes. Thank you. You talked about order rates in your B&B business being stable in spite of the macro climate. Could you talk a little bit more about sort of the linearity of those bookings? Are they coming sort of in line with seasonal patterns? Or is there any trends for strengthening or weakening as we look forward?","Ali Husain - Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations","Tore, thanks. This is Ali. I'll take this one. I think if you look at the order patterns throughout the quarter, I think they generally trended again ex the consumer business, I'm talking about the B2B business here. They generally trended as we would have expected them to. I'd say November and December were pretty stable. January saw some pretty good strength. I'd say part of that is just the natural cycle there. January tends to be a stronger order flow month than December, just because it has less holidays. Part of it could be \u2013 there is \u2013 our first and second quarters had the effect of the Lunar New Year. Part of that could be that as well.","But I'd say overall as we now look into February, orders continue to maintain themselves. I'd say when you look at the various businesses, the industrial business is hanging in in February to January rates. The comms business is off a little bit from its January rates. Again, January was a very strong month for the comms business, particularly as you think about some of these wireless infrastructure build-outs in China. There's likely some ordering that happened in the month of January that was likely going to be consumed in February.","So I think overall I'd say it's probably tracking to where we would expect it to be around this time of year. And I think that's certainly implicated in the guidance that we gave for the B2B markets to be in the mid-to-high single digits sequentially in the second quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Bernstein Research","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I want to actually follow up on that. So you're guiding the B2B up mid-to-high single digits. You're sort of calling that seasonal. But I think industrial and auto are typically up in the low double digits sequentially in Q2. So is there something else going on, for example, in comm that's offsetting? Or I mean can you give us some feeling for I guess variation across the three B2B businesses above or below that average because it does seem overall you'll get below normal seasonal for industrial and auto?","David A. Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Right. Yeah. So we actually went back and looked at kind of the B2B in total and by piece. Communications tends not to have as much seasonal effect, and it's more kind of a cycle effect. But when you look at the industrial and automotive, you're right, Stacy, sometimes it's in the double digits, sometimes it's in the high single digits, kind of depends on the year. I think partly it depends on where Lunar New Year kind of falls, and sometimes Lunar New Year is in the first quarter and sometimes it's in the second quarter. And so I think a little bit of the effect of perhaps us being on the lower end of seasonality in those businesses is the fact that Lunar New Year shows up in the second quarter this time around.","Part of it's just you have to pay attention to what's going on in the macro environment, and I think we're being prudently cautious given some of the perturbations out there, things going on in China, things going on with our customers who sell into the oil and gas space. And so I think there's a little bit of prudence there.","And then partly, I think comms had a pretty good quarter in the first quarter. It's going to probably have kind of a more flattish to up slightly kind of quarter in the second quarter, and that would mute the B2B sequential growth rate as well. But overall, I would say we're kind of pretty pleased with how the B2B business has been operating. It had a better than expected first quarter, and so to have the second quarter be a little bit on the lower end of seasonality is, I think, a pretty good outcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Danely with Citigroup.","Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Thanks, guys. Just some more color on the consumer end market. How do you expect that to trend this year? Have you seen any change to your forecast recently? And do you think consumer revenue in the second half of calendar 2016 will be above or below what it was in the second half of calendar 2015?","David A. Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Tough to call the year-over-year growth rates, Chris. Obviously, we have a good position, I think, in the consumer space, particularly in the portable electronic space. We obviously had a really good second half last year, but as the first half of this year has shown, looks like some of that was not real end demand. And so there might have been a little bit of build of inventory \u2013 some inventory build in the second half of last year that we're now feeling the effects of this year. So clearly on a sequential basis, the second half should be quite strong relative to the first half. I'm not sure how things will work out year-over-year, kind of given that inventory build.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah. Good morning, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. I want to go back to the non-consumer or B2B business, and if you look at that revenue over a longer period of time, it sort of peaked out in the October 2014 quarter at about $720 million. And even again sort of your guide for April, you're still going to be $30 million to $40 million below that level. And, Vince, I think in a prior question, you did a good job kind of talking about the puts and takes in autos. I'm assuming industrial military is really a reflection of just kind of a lackluster macro. I guess my question is more on the comm side of the business which is still down the most over that period of time.","Wondering kind of where you think we are in the comm cycle? Do we get back north of $200 million in revenue at some point? Are there structural barriers to get there? And importantly, if you give us an update on how Hittite is performing within that division, that would be helpful because I believe October 2014 was the first full quarter of Hittite revenue.","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So I think the situation in the communications infrastructure market is really about \u2013 last year was driven by \u2013 the downturn was driven largely by what was happening in China with regard to regulatory issues, if you like. What we're seeing \u2013 we came off a very, very low bottom at the very early part of 2015. But my sense is now, we're seeing some bookings momentum. My sense is that we'll see a pretty good growth year overall this year in communications infrastructure. There is a lot of innovation still taking place. And we are I believe gaining share across the boards. Our customers are still driving hard in the wireless area, for example, to increase spectral efficiency, reduce power costs, and so on and so forth in the radio systems, and we're right at the heart of that.","The combination of ADI with Hittite makes us, if you like, the supplier of choice when a customer is thinking of that physical layer interface between the air and the bits, if you like. So we're very, very happy with what we're seeing in terms of the revenue contribution from Hittite. In fact, in the past quarter, Hittite was up over the same quarter in the prior year. So I think overall, that's going well in terms of the revenue and profit contribution, in terms of the contribution in improving ADI's capacity to innovate in these radio systems in 4G. And we're also now starting to get involved in producing, if you like, the architectures for 5G.","But my sense is there's still a lot of legs in 4G. And from our perspective, what we're doing is driving technology and product leadership at key customers, and so I think this year, we'll be about what the market does, and the indications are that the market is getting back into a pretty modest buy mode, I think. And as I said, we have some very, very good momentum in terms of design-ins across the globe, which should bode well for 2017 and beyond.","Ali Husain - Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations","Thanks, John.","Operator","Our next question is from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the question, guys. I wanted to follow up on the industrial end market. It looks like it's performing seasonally, but from some of the other companies in the sector, we've heard about some weakness in certain geographies like China. So can you address the trends that you're seeing across your major geographies in that key end market? Thank you.","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, from the geographic perspective, I would say if you talk about the industrial space specifically, we actually had \u2013 the strongest growth we had was in China last quarter, and Europe was the area of slowest growth. So I think it's a case of \u2013 the macro \u2013 the situation in regard to oil exploration has really impacted the situation in America and to some extent Europe, but from our perspective, China was the area of strongest performance in the first quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks a lot. Good morning, guys. I guess I have a question on the gross margin line. I fully understand you guys had a fair bit of deleverage sequentially. I'm wondering if there were any other factors that played in to the margin shortfall that you guys had on a sequential basis. And if you could specifically just maybe quantify the inventory reserves you had to take on the consumer side.","David A. Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So as you point out, I think we exited the fourth quarter around 66% gross margins. It came down to little over 62%. About half of that was the fact that we lowered utilization in the fab, and obviously when we do that, that has a pretty meaningful effect to the gross margins. And then the other half was inventory reserves. And the inventory reserves were specific to that consumer portable electronics business. We built up inventory to meet what we thought would be backlog in the first quarter and partially second quarter. And as that forecast was taken down by the customer, we were left with more inventory than we needed in the short term, and so we elected to reserve that inventory for that reason.","Operator","Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to follow up on that, Dave, when you look at the consumer business, it's obviously down a lot more than others levered to that customer. Can you just talk about within the supply chain? And you mentioned writing off some of your own inventory, but when you look at the supply chain, was there inventory in that supply chain that you're working through? If you could talk about yields within the modules that your product goes into. And is that cleared up as you look at April such that you could see an uptick in July as you saw last year?","David A. Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I mean, I think that we were a relatively new product, and I think when that happens, I think the whole supply chain probably adds a bit of cushion along the way to make sure that they can all meet the demand. And of course, the end customer doesn't have absolute certainty in terms of what their end demand might look like. So I'm sure they add a little bit of cushion there.","As it turned out, that cushion across the whole supply chain, including the cushion we all had on our own balance sheet, wasn't necessary. And so as a result, you have the effect of an impact to our topline and the need to reserve some of that inventory for a possible disposable. So I think based on what we saw in the first quarter and based on the fact that there was a bit of demand expected in the back half of the second quarter, kind of a resumption to the order flows. We think that this will be behind us by the end of the second quarter, and we'll be back to shipping with consumption.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Smigie with Raymond James.","Vincent Celentano - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. This is Vince Celentano on for Steve. I had a question about the defense business. So the DoD recently released their 2017 proposal. They expected R&D to increase by about 4%. How closely does this tie into your own defense business? And what are kind of the factors that determine whether it grows above or below this amount?","David A. Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Well, I mean, I think what we have seen is that the defense business has actually been performing quite well. And in fact, I think in the first quarter we were up double digits. So we continue to get maybe a disproportionate amount as it trickles down to us the capital spending that the government allocates to defense. Obviously, I think anything where the government is adding expense or capital expense to the budgets of Defense is going to be a good answer for us. In particular because I think a lot of what they are doing are these military systems that require a lot of semiconductor, a lot of electronic content, and that obviously is beneficial to us. So we've been very pleased with the performance of the defense business.","Obviously, the Hittite acquisition just supercharged it for us and has helped us do even better in that market. We're seeing all kinds of opportunities for our military components into that space. But not only that, we're actually figuring out ways to take things in the rest of our business that maybe were more commercial in nature and addressing that content to the military business to even grow it faster. So the pipeline looks great in that space, and I think we'll do very well over the next few years in that market.","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","One of the things that's happening in that area is the mass digitization of a lot of old radio and microwave systems. So there's a huge cycle of upgrades that is in play and that will continue, we believe, for the next several years. So as Dave said, the combination of ADI's mixed-signal technology combined with Hittite's microwave prowess puts us in very, very good stead. And we're certainly seeing that in terms of the business growth in aerospace and defense over the last 12 months or 18 months. And we expect it to be a good contributor to the industrial story over the coming years as well.","Ali Husain - Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations","Next question, operator.","Operator","Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Great job on the OpEx controls over the past few quarters. How should we think about OpEx beyond fiscal Q2?","David A. Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Well, as we indicated in the prepared remarks, we do expect it to go up a little bit in the second quarter. The second quarter and third quarter gets the impact of salary increases. And so there is kind of a natural lift, although it's not significant in the second quarter and third quarter, it will happen. After that I think we're going to be very cautious about how we deploy capital and operating expenses until we're really clear on what the macro environment looks like. And so as we came into this year, Vince really set the edict that we basically are going to kind of keep the pie the same and we'll divide the pie differently based on the markets and product areas that we think have the best opportunity for a return. And I think that's kind of going to be the mindset for us for the foreseeable feature, unless things kind of change dramatically on the macro side.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.","C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI","Yeah. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I guess a follow-up question on the inventory reserve and gross margins. Did you take reserve for your inventory or for inventory at ODMs? Part B, I guess, is that inventory now obsolete or could that be a tailwind to gross margin in the back half of the year? And then lastly, in terms of getting back to prior peak gross margin last year of 66.5%, what kind of step up in utilization do we need to see? Thank you.","David A. Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Okay. So a three-part question. Good. Yeah. So first of all, on the inventory side, that inventory is not necessarily obsolete. So it's possible it could be used in the future. What was the other part of that specific question on the reserves? I forgot that.","C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI","Were you taking reserve for your own inventory...","David A. Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah.","C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI","...or inventory at key ODMs?","David A. Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. No, once it ships out, it's not our inventory anymore. So we don't take reserves on that. This inventory was on our balance sheet. It was in our supply chain. So that's the inventory reserved. It is possible, like you said, if demand were to change in the back half of the year, it's possible that inventory does get sold. I wouldn't rule that out.","In terms of the gross margins getting back north of 66%, I think we actually have a great shot at that. Certainly in the first quarter we were artificially low because of where utilizations were and because of these inventory reserves. We don't expect the inventory reserve situation to repeat itself in the second quarter, but even the utilization if not up to prior peaks we're thinking it's going to be in the low \u2013 the high 60s%, rather. And in fact, we've been in the high 70s% in prior periods, and that's at least 100 basis point improvement to the gross margins. So I think we have a good path towards getting our gross margins back north of 66% and actually probably in relatively short order.","C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I'm wondering if you could give us a sense for how large was your largest customer. And broadly, can you talk about diversification in your consumer business? It's obvious the results and the stock has been extremely volatile. And from our perspective, it's very hard to see whether you can or even want to maintain that socket. You might have it this year, but we don't know what the situation will be next year. So, could you just give us some color on how we should think about modeling that volatility in your results? Thank you.","David A. Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So in the first quarter \u2013 I don't have the number right in front of me, but I think I'm fairly certain it was below 10%, our largest customer, and then it's a long tail after that. So we're pretty diversified from a customer perspective. I think it's a valid question as to do we want this business or not. Sometimes we think about that ourselves based on the Street reactions. But I would tell you this has been one of the single most successful products we've ever developed in terms of its return on investment.","It was a relatively small amount of R&D investment, we were able to utilize technology that was highly proprietary that really cut \u2013 was at the cutting edge of technology, and we were able to redeploy it and kind of customize it to a given customer that really made a difference in their application. And that's kind of our philosophy in consumer. And it has always been our philosophy in consumer. And so we're going to continue to do that. There will probably be several different things we will do in the consumer space that will have characteristics like this that require \u2013 that leverage our existing technology and drive great returns. And quite honestly, I think that the long-term shareholders of ADI want us to do that. They want us to drive good return on investment.","There may be some volatility that happens from quarter-to-quarter, but over the long run, I think we'll be very happy. One of the things I think we sighted was that excluding this pension fund changeover that we had in the fourth quarter, we will have generated $1 billion in the last 12 months in cash flow. We wouldn't have gotten there without this thing. So we're all about driving cash flow and maximizing that, and helping to maximize return on shareholders. And I think that this piece of business and business like this do that.","Ali Husain - Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations","And I would just add, not only do we generate the $1 billion, but we return $800 million of that, and given where the cash flows are, the yield on the free cash flow is somewhere around 6% or 7%, which I think is one-and-a-half times what the S&P is yielding. So, all right, let's get the next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Vinayak Rao - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. This is Vinayak calling for Craig. I had a quick follow-up on the comm business. You saw some good growth over the last couple of quarters in the communications side. And now from your earlier comments, sounds like the business is taking a pause in April. What visibility do you have in that business? What are you hearing from customers? And if you can touch upon the trends you're seeing by geography for that segment.","David A. Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So I wouldn't say it's taken a pause. I mean, we do expect it to be flat to up. And so I think it's certainly \u2013 as I think and Ali mentioned in his prepared remarks, it's in the nascent part of our recovery. We have a pretty good visibility into the pipeline here, because the design cycles tend to be a lot longer, particularly in areas like the consumer space. And so we kind of understand where our traction is in this space. And as Vince mentioned earlier, based on the way we read how things are going to transpire, given the newer technologies that we're bringing out into the wireless comm space, we think we're going to gain share over the course of the next couple of years.","In addition, I think that the market has paused as well. Clearly, it paused significantly in China. And there is a real need for higher bandwidth and as all these devices that we all hold dear to ourselves require more and more data, video driving a lot of it now. And so our expectation is that there will be some capital spent in the wireless infrastructure space, that's what our customers are telling us, that's what their customers are telling them.","We're excited about our position in that space. We think it will only strengthen. And so my guess is, it's hard to call this for sure, but my guess is we'll be in a pretty consistent recovery phase over the next 18 months or so. And then who knows when 5G comes around, but when 5G comes around, I think we're even in better position, particularly given that a lot of the technology requires millimeter wave, which was one of the key reasons we acquired Hittite.","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think in some markets, you've got to take a very long-term view to it. It's a space that we've been innovating in for the last 15 years, 18 years, as technologies became more and more digital in terms of their communications modalities across the various generations. So we're gaining strength every year in terms of technology and customer penetration. We know for sure that there's going to be more and more demand for spectral efficiency, as people use more and more and more mobility, higher bandwidth data streams required. So there will be oscillations quarter-on-quarter, but overall, we believe it's a terrific space to be in. We're investing to win in that market in the radio space. And as I said, our position gets better year-by-year in terms of customer penetration and technology and product quality and availability.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, Vince, one for you on the automotive market. It was very helpful earlier when you gave some of those splits of your business. If I summarized it a different way, investors seem to be a little bit concerned that the automotive market from a SAR perspective is peaking. Could you give us any details on if you're seeing any evidence of peaking behavior? And then probably more importantly, how do you think your business being unit driven, as far as the unit build in the market versus content driven going forward?","Ali Husain - Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations","Hey, Ross. Let me take part of that, and then I'll turn the rest over to Vince. I think from a SAR perspective, really what we saw towards the end of our fiscal year was China, particularly the premium vehicle market there weakening. I think what we're seeing at this stage is that North America is still continuing to be pretty strong. The European vehicle registrations are continuing to be up, and I think very importantly for ADI is that the premium vehicle market in China seems to be stabilizing right now. So that's sort of a macro view in terms of the SAR.","And then just secondly I'd point out from another \u2013 if you take it sort of from another macro view, is that when you look at the dealer inventories out there, those are in good shape. When you look at again the average age of vehicles, they're above their historical norm. So that would suggest that there is still some pent-up demand from the SAR perspective. But that's I guess our sort of 30,000 foot macro view of what's going on with the SAR. I'll let Vince take the second half.","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Maybe just one other piece of additional information. Light vehicle sales were strong. As Ali said, the luxury part of the market seems to have at least stabilized, maybe stalled a bit. But light vehicle sales have been stronger than expected in both certainly North America and Europe. So part of our \u2013 we were talking earlier just about the diversity of our business. Our business continues to become more diverse, as we penetrate Asia more aggressively than we have in the past, building on the strength that we've had traditionally in Europe and America. So I think from our perspective we've got a stronger portfolio than we've ever had. It's really going to be a case of \u2013 from an ADI perspective how well we penetrate the socket. So irrespective of what happens in terms of SAR, we actually have some good momentum in terms of products and technology, which will enable us to get share. So I think it will be a tale of those two pieces.","Ali Husain - Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations","And if I could just add some examples of the technologies that we're bringing to the market. ADAS systems, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, were up 22% year-over-year. That today is largely a 24-gig solution, and over the next couple of years, we'll be in 77-gig solutions as that modality rolls out, puts us in a very strong position to grow. Powertrain systems continue to be strong, again as carmakers want to make cars more efficient. And finally on the infotainment front, that's been a good market for us. I don't know if you noticed, but last month we announced a release with Ford Motor Company announcing what we call an A2B Bus, which is basically taking very high-end audio fidelity, in cabin, takes out a bunch of weight out of the car, still keeps fantastic audio quality within the vehicle, and at the end of the day is a cheaper solution for the car manufacturer. So those are just some examples of the things that Vince was talking about.","Okay. Here we go. Next question, operator. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Ian Ing with MKM Partners.","Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC","Yes. Good morning. My question is on the comms business, 20% off of the prior peak at this point. Xilinx talked about their comm segments not likely achieving prior peaks in the near future, they talked about FTD in China being a smaller deployment than TDD. So for ADI, I mean, do you have the potential to reach prior peaks with some different exposure than Xilinx, perhaps more on the microwave side? And what sort of timeframe do you think that could happen?","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we've got a bigger footprint now than we've ever had. I mean, just the combination of the investments that we've been making for the last several years to make sure that we have the most complete solutions in the radio space, combined with the microwave technologies that we've acquired through Hittites. So I think there are three parts we should think about. One is the macro, the macro cell, the small cell. We believe, for example, that we will see growth this year in the macro cells. It will be relatively modest.","We're also very well positioned in small cells, and I think it's becoming pretty clear that in China, China Mobile is going to deploy small cells this year. We have a very strong competitive moat that we've built in the area of the software defined transceivers that specifically address the small cell arena. And the point-to-point space has been modestly growing, seems to have slowed as of late, but they are the three components. And we've got a bigger footprint. We're getting more penetration. I believe it will be more about market adoptions and what the carriers do in terms of CapEx on hardware versus other things, more so than what we do. So I think we're well positioned as growth continues to gain momentum here, in that market.","David A. Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","And, Ian, not that I'm keeping score, but we're 19% off our peak, not 20%.","Ali Husain - Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations","All right. We'll get to our next caller. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Stephen Chin with UBS.","Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Vince, I want to drill down little bit on the distribution channel. Can you discuss the sell-in, sell through rates in the quarter and what your expectation is in the current April quarter as well?","Ali Husain - Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations","Well, I'll take a first stab at that, and then I can let either Vince or Dave come in. So when we look at the distributor channel this quarter, inventory on a weeks' basis, as I think Dave mentioned in his prepared remarks, were 7.5 weeks, which is pretty consistent over the last several quarters. Deferred revenue, which is a pretty good proxy for inventory in the channel at revenue dollars, was down 1% sequentially. So the channel, I'd say, is behaving itself. I think a lot of the inventory is on the supplier balance sheet. And I think folks are doing a good job in managing the actual channel.","I think when you look at some of the outlooks painted by some of the larger distributors out there, it appears to be a pretty mixed environment. And of course, if you look at that as a proxy for industrial business, as Dave mentioned earlier, if you \u2013 sort of back end of the guidance, we're guiding industrial to be in somewhat of a seasonal range, but likely to be sort of at the lower end of that seasonal range. But I don't know if Vince you wanted to add anything to that.","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, I think what you said is correct in terms of \u2013 you can take our industrial business as a good proxy for what's happening in the channel. So the book-to-bill is positive at this point in time. And as Ali said, we've got modest expectations based largely by the fact that the macro backdrop is, to say the least, volatile at this point in time.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Hi. This is Mark Lipacis. Dave, you mentioned you're cautious and that there's perturbations in China, but the orders in the non-consumer businesses seem seasonal given the timing of the Lunar New Year. And Vince noted that the China industrial market was the strongest industrial market. So I'm trying to reconcile what appears to be seasonal order patterns with your cautiousness. Are customers or distributors throwing up flags? Or is there some other analysis or signals that's driving your cautiousness? Thank you.","David A. Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. And when I say perturbation I mean what you read in the Wall Street Journal and see on CNBC more than anything. But certainly what we see from an order flow perspective would lead you to be \u2013 feel pretty good about the situation from a macro perspective. But I just think we got to recognize that there is uncertainty in the market. I think our customers generally feel the same, feel this uncertainty and just aren't sure what the outcome will look like for this year. And the result I think when those situations arise, it's best to be on the cautious side of things. And if things turn out to be more positive, that would be great. We'll put the money to work at that point. And if it doesn't, we'll have protected our income statement.","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","If you look at what our customers are predicting for this point this year versus the same period last year, it was a lot more caution. I think all the big industrial companies are projecting very, very low single digit growth or flatness through the year. So you've got to take all that into account when you're trying to run your business here.","Ali Husain - Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Freedman with Sterne Agee.","Doug Freedman - Sterne Agee CRT","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. It really relates to your M&A strategy. We've seen in the markets taking a little bit different tack towards deals in the semiconductor space. Those guys that have chosen to lever up and do things have not been received as well. Does this weigh into your thinking at all? And can you give us an update on how you view M&A and what the opportunities you see out there today?","David A. Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I think that for us, we have a pretty high bar. We have a high bar in terms of it's got to add innovation that's core to what we do. It's got to hit the customer base. It's got to be something that the customers turn around and say, well, that was a good idea. We really needed you to have that technology. And then it's obviously got to check the box on all the financial parameters that we have. And like I said, the bar is pretty high in terms of what we'd like to see from that perspective.","And so I think that in that regard, we take a pretty kind of systematic, disciplined approach to it. That's the reason we did Hittite, and that's the reason we haven't aggressively tried to find other deals just to fill the coffer with an M&A pipeline. What we've done is we've been carefully looking. I would tell you that we've kicked the tires on a lot of different ideas over the last year or so, and not one of them has reached the high bar that we set. That's not to say that there won't be one down the road, and I think when that happens, we'll go to our shareholders, and I think we've \u2013 given the bar we set, we'll give them a pretty compelling reason as to why we want to utilize their precious cash to go do that acquisition. And so I think it will end up being positively received in that case. I think when you're doing M&A for the sake of M&A, that's when things tend to turn on you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tristan Gerra with Baird.","Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good morning. Dave, a follow-up to a prior question. What's your sense of the timing for the initial ramp in 5G? And what's the percentage content increase ADI has relative to 4G and also what geographies for the highest growth opportunity for the remaining leg of 4G growth?","David A. Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So I mean usually when you go transition from generation to generation, it's easily into the double digits bomb increase when those transition. I can't tell you when exactly 5G will roll out. I'm going say it is a few years away at this point. There might be little pockets of early adoption, but most of that is a couple years away, I think, for us. But when it comes, we're well positioned for that.","4G is pretty well certainly deployed in North America, although I think there are areas where it needs to be densified. China still has a few things to roll out. They change, I think, sometimes what they're \u2013 the way they want to deploy that technology. But over time, over the next couple of years, I think they will be in a good position. The rest of the world is actually, outside of maybe a few areas like Korea or something, are actually in pretty old generations, particularly in Europe. And so I think there's a lot of room for 4G deployment before we even get into where the 5G takes us.","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","4G still has a lot of legs. As Dave said, it'll be multiple years before 5G comes into play. And you might be surprised to know that if you take the typical customer that we have in the base station area, the macro base station area, the product replenishment rate of the radio is very frequent. There are many, many new radios developed every month for different regions, different spectral usage and so on and so forth within 4G. So there's a lot of innovation and a lot of edge that we can still bring in terms of technology to 4G. And that's what we're doing.","When we make the step to 5G, the frequencies increase, the data rates increase. It's got to be much more spectrally efficient than 4G. It needs lower latency and so on and so forth, and all to drive the improved coverage and the quality of service. So when that happens, we will have been at the forefront of helping our customers architect what 5G looks like in terms of the radio. So it will be multiple years, but I'm still bullish on 4G and what we can do in that area in terms of bringing ever increasing levels of innovation and increasing our footprint there.","Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Deepon Nag with Macquarie.","Deepon Nag - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, guys. Dave, the dividend increase that you did is probably the lowest \u2013 I think it's the lowest you've done since 2009, but repurchases in Q1 were at a very high level. So is there a change in the way you guys kind of view your mix of returning capital? And then on fiscal Q2, are you going to take any more inventory reserve? Because the gross margin leverage I guess is a little bit lower than I would've thought just given the mix in the ramp and utilization rates.","David A. Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So, no. I mean philosophically I guess at the top, we really want to deploy 80% of our cash back to shareholders. And I think the way we look at it is we try to maintain a balance. Clearly, the stock has weakened a bit since its peak, and so we recognize that the buyback is probably going to be fairly active for at least some period of time. And so I think that was really the primary reason why the dividend increase was smaller, because we're trying to maintain the balance to get the return to 80%. I wouldn't read into anything more than that. We do have a stated target that will kind of stay between 5% and 10% a year increases in the dividend. This still stayed within that range, but as you point out, was in the lower end, because we think the buyback will be a bit stronger.","From an inventory reserve perspective, we think we have taken care of that situation and that we don't expect that to repeat in the second quarter. I'd say the primary reason why the gross margins haven't \u2013 I think they got up to north of 66% probably in the second quarter of last year. And the reason they are about 100 basis points below that is because of the utilization levels. We aren't ramping the utilization up quite as much this quarter versus last year at this time. And fundamentally, it's just I think a mix. There are certain things that get done internally, certain things that we leverage outside partners for, and the way the revenues going to fall out, I think for the second quarter is going to be a little bit more disproportionately to the outside wafers that we get from foundry. And so as a result, we won't be cranking the factory up as much in the second quarter.","On top of that, we are focused on the inventory levels of the product we build internally, and we didn't want that to get too high. So hopefully in the third quarter and fourth quarter, this momentum that we think we have in the B2B space continues. That certainly had more wafers manufactured internally, and so we'd expect to see the utilization come up over the course of the year, and that should be a pretty good tailwind to gross margins.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel.","Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes. Thank you. I just had a quick follow-up. Could you tell us a little bit about the thinking behind carrying $1.7 billion of debt?","David A. Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Good question, Tore. So as we came into like that December month, we knew that we had a $375 million bond that was coming due in April of this year. We also thought that we might be using some of the U.S. cash in the near term for an acquisition, and the rates were pretty attractive. The market was pretty excited. And we were particularly excited by the fact that we could get 30-year debt in some cases, or in some amount, at rates that on a tax effective basis would be kind of less than the dividend yield. So we thought that those things combined meant that it would be a good idea to go into the market, get the cash, and be ready.","As it turned out, the acquisition that we were thinking about we didn't end up consummating. We did refinance the bond, so that utilized some of the cash that we raised. The rest of it does sit on our balance sheet in the U.S., but I think we will over time find very good accretive uses for that cash. It was relatively cheap money. We will look to use it in situations where we need U.S. cash for M&A. As I mentioned, we're using some of the cash for buybacks, and so that will obviously be an accretive use of the cash as well. So in terms of net cash, which is the number we are most focused on, we think we'll find ways to kind of bring that down over time.","One of the disconnects we have is we generate two-thirds of our cash offshore. But all of our uses like some of the M&A and certainly the buyback activity utilize U.S. cash. And so we sometimes need to add leverage to the U.S. balance sheet in order to make those happen. And the cash accumulates offshore.","Operator","Our final question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah. I was going to ask the debt question, but I'll ask another one. Vince, can you talk a little bit just about within the consumer space how we should think about sort of pricing over time and your ability to bring down costs on your solutions that you bring to the consumer market, especially as you go into sort of second-generation and third-generation products from your customer?","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, John, we're very discriminating in terms of how we play the game everywhere, not just in consumer, everywhere. But particularly in consumer, we've been very clear that we need to have a strong grasp of the complexity of the application and the quality of the solution that we're bringing. So we're playing really at the high-performance edge. There are many, many things that we can do, but we are very discriminating about the things we take on. And we are \u2013 that's the basis in which we are playing. So we are leveraging, if you like, precision core technology that we sell into many, many different sockets and many, many different applications. And I think it was Ali said earlier that if we hit the right places, we get terrific ROI on a technology that we customize in a particular application space in consumer. So I mean, that's the thesis. That's how we play within that space, and when we hit it, we hit it very, very well.","Ali Husain - Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations","Great. Well, thank you, John.

Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release.","And with that, I'll turn it over to ADI CEO, Vincent Roche. Vince?","Vincent Roche","Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everybody. Well, our first quarter results were in line with our expectations as you will see. And importantly, we managed our operating costs and working capital effectively to position ourselves to deliver margin expansion in the quarters ahead.","Before I discuss the quarterly highlights, I'd like to address the coronavirus outbreak. First and foremost, our top priority is the health and safety of those affected and of course, our employees. We're doing everything we can to provide our customers with the support they need to minimize disruption to their businesses. And while the situation remains fluid, we are monitoring it closely. Prashanth will expand on the financial implications in just a while.","So now into the first quarter, revenues $1.3 billion, down versus the prior year, but in line with our expectations. Operating margin was approximately 37% at a time versus last year due to lower revenue and our decision to lower utilization. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.3, above the midpoints of guidance. Over the trailing 12 months, we generated approximately $2 billion of free cash flow equating to a 35% free cash flow margin. And this continues to places in the top 10% of the S&P 500.","On our call last quarter we shared our priority for 2020, and I'd like to give you an update on our progress so far. Priority one is the efficient use of our capital. The first call in our capital is funding new product development activities. In the first quarter, we invested over $250 million in R&D with more than 90% of this spend targeting the most effective opportunities across our B2B markets. For example, an area of increased focus for ADI is our power franchise. Here we've been increasing R&D to enhance our strong position in the broad markets and to extend into new opportunities across areas like data center, automotive and 5G infrastructure. Our power design wind momentum remains strong. And we expect to double the OTC historical revenue growth rate in the years ahead of us. At the same time, we remain committed to delivering strong shareholder returns. In the first quarter, we returned over $300 million to shareholders. And we just announced a 15% increase to our quarterly dividend.","Priority two is deepening customer centricity. As I\u2019ve shared before, the combination of our broad product portfolio, domain expertise, and manufacturing capabilities sets ADI apart. We're always anticipating the technology needs of our customers and engaging with imparity in order to solve their toughest challenges. And I'd like to share just a few examples specific to our automotive segment with you now.","Our HEV platform continues to gain traction in the cabin electronics ecosystem. By leveraging our platform portfolio, we're opening up new applications for our customers such as active noise cancellation. In the quarter Hyundai became the 14th auto manufacturer to incorporate to A2B technology. And together, we announced the industry's first all-digital road noise cancellation system. With the rise of active noise cancellation, we're creating stickier customer relationships due to the integration of our hardware and software capabilities, while increasing our sum per vehicle.","There's also a level of intensity and urgency in audience moving towards electric powertrains, we were an early player in the market partnering with industry leaders to improve the efficiency of the battery and electric vehicles as our results, our BMS solutions, are delivering greater miles per charge and monitoring battery health more accurately. In the U.S. electric vehicle market, we're benefiting from near-term strength as customers ramp production. And new design wins across future models will help us to deliver on our long-term objective of growing BMS revenue at a double-digit rate.","Priority three is capitalizing on secular trends to expand our addressable markets and drive diversified growth. We've previously discussed with you key secular trends across our company, such as 5G, electric vehicles, factory automation and data center.","Now today, I'd like to spend some time on the space markets, perhaps a more obscure sub-segment of our industrial sector. Our space customers\u2019 challenges are not just are on RF signal processing and power management, space solutions must also perform under extreme cosmic radiation and conditions of high temperatures. We solve these challenges through the combination of our comprehensive product portfolio and passive knowledge base built over many decades of serving these markets. While the space represents a couple of percent of ADI's total revenue today it commands stellar margins, and we see potential to double the business over the next five years.","Now let me share a little more with you about why this sector is exciting to us. The space market is rapidly evolving. Over the last decade, unprecedented levels of capital have gravitated towards this vertical thereby increasing the number of private refunded space companies by 20 times. Therefore, new technologies and capabilities are emerging that are leading to new opportunities for ADI. This includes the advent of low Earth orbit or LEO communication satellites. These satellites are becoming the new frontier in space with forecasts suggesting that by 2020 over 20,000 will be revolver up from just hundreds today. To provide some context, LEO satellites differ from today's geostationary or GEO satellites. Technologically, they provide lower latency and higher bandwidth, which enable real time communication. Operationally, they continuously change their position relative to the earth and always stay connected with a given terminal for approximately 10 minutes.","As a result, the number of terrestrial terminals that communicate with these satellites, whether they are on the ground or in the air, will grow into the millions with the proliferation of LEO satellites. To succeed in creating this network, both satellites and terminals must be capable of being steered. So this requires an exponential increase in channel count enabled through phased array antennas, an architecture that is used in 5G networks already today. And as you can imagine, more channels packed into smaller form factors is increasing thermal and power hurdles.","To help solve the engineering challenges of creating this ubiquitous in all those and always-connected LEO network, our customers are increasingly turning to ADI, looking to us to not only be a supplier but indeed a key system architect. So we're engaging with customers early in their design process to develop end-to-end solutions from antenna to bits, combined with power capabilities to deliver the required performance and, of course, robustness.","Our ability to provide a comprehensive portfolio of space-grade solutions across the entire analog spectrum from RF and signal chain to power is unique. And this cannot be completely replicated by any of our competitors, making ADI to go through supplier for traditional OEMs, as well as the next wave of disruptors.","All told, we see the LEO communications satellite plan becoming at least four times the size of GEO over the next five years. And with LEO\u2019s shorter refresh cycle compared to today's satellites, we expect our space business to deliver a steadier stream of revenue in the years ahead.","In summary, space has the potential to be a meaningful growth driver and unlock value across other verticals as well. Once fully operational, these LEO networks will provide real-time, reliable high-speed connections globally ushering an opportunities from autonomous driving to telesurgery.","So in closing, and speaking broadly about ADI, I believe demand for our solutions will be unprecedented as technological innovation underpinned by ubiquitous sensing, hyper-scale and edge computing, and pervasive connectivity continues to grow rapidly. And as I look ahead, I believe we're very well positioned to deliver sustainable, profitable growth, and indeed, the strong shareholder returns.","So with that, I'll hand it over to Prashanth.","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","Thank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our first quarter earnings call. My comments today with the exception of revenue and nonop expenses will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release.","ADI delivered a solid first quarter. Revenue came in line with our outlook as we meaningfully reduced channel inventory. And through our disciplined spending, operating margin and EPS were above the midpoint of guidance. We also raised our quarterly dividend to $0.62, an increase of 15%, the high-end of our target range of 7% to 15%. The dividend is the cornerstone of our capital allocation policy, and this represents the 17th increase over the last 16 years. These consistent increases reflect our commitment to strong shareholder returns as well as our optimism about the long-term prospects for our business.","Before getting into the income statement, let me first cover the end market. In line with our expectations, our first quarter B2B revenue declined 15% year-over-year as better-than-expected industrial demand was balanced by softer communications activity. Industrial, which represented 53% of revenue during the quarter, declined 7% year-over-year as we forecasted most applications within this highly-diversified business declined while aerospace and defense, once again, grew double-digits year-over-year. Communications, which represents 18% of revenue during the quarter, decreased 31% year-over-year, as wireless and wired both declined. While communications is an inherently lumpy market, our position has never been stronger or more balanced across the ecosystem. We are at the early stages of the global 5G rollout, which we continue to expect will be a multiyear tailwind. Our Auto business, which represented 16% of revenues during the quarter, declined 16% year-over-year due to weakness across all applications. As Vince highlighted, we remain confident in auto due to our strong pipeline of customer wins, especially in our infotainment platform and our market-leading BMS position. And lastly, Consumer, which represents 13% of revenue during the first quarter, declined 20% due to portable applications. As we said in our last earnings call, we expect 2020 to be the bottom for our Consumer segment.","Now onto the P&L. Gross margin came in at 68.5%, up slightly sequentially, and down 180 basis points year-over-year, as favorable mix was offset by lower utilization. As a reminder, fab utilization was near trough levels this quarter in order to reduce our balance sheet and our channel inventories. OpEx in the quarter was $412 million, down 4% sequentially, and down 8% year-over-year. In light of the software revenue environment, we curtailed spending and have delivered sequential OpEx declines in each of the past five quarters. As a reminder, we plan to exit fiscal 2020 with $50 million of annualized savings across cost of goods sold and OpEx.","Operating margins finished at approximately 37% above the guided midpoint. Nonop expenses were $47 million, down $3 million sequentially, and $9 million year-over-year, driven by lower interest expense. Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 12%. All told, first quarter adjusted EPS came in above the midpoint of guide at $1.3.","Now moving on to the balance sheet. As we planned, inventory was reduced by about $20 million or 4% sequentially. Despite this reduction, our inventory days increased to 133 due to the lower level of revenue. We call that our target for inventory days is 115 to 125. But during the process of closing two legacy LTC facilities, we do expect to carry an additional 5 to 10 days of bridge inventory to support our customers. We also reduce channel inventory by approximately $40 million in the fourth quarter, and plan to reduce channel inventory in the second quarter again, but to a lesser degree. CapEx in the quarter was $55 million, or about 4% of revenue, and we expect to end fiscal 2020 slightly below our 4% long-term target.","On a trailing 12 month basis, free cash flow finished at $2 billion, or free cash flow margins of about 35%. Over this period, we've returned more than 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks after debt repayments. We paid approximately $200 million in dividends and repurchased $160 million of our stock in the first quarter. We still plan to pay down between $300 million to $500 million of debt in fiscal 2020.","Now I'll provide some context on our recent business trends and our current view on the coronavirus. In the first quarter, we saw signs of stabilization as we expected. Orders trended better throughout the quarter and have overall remain relatively resilient into the second quarter. However, unsurprisingly, we had begun to see weaker demand in China related to the extended Chinese New Year and ongoing business disruption. As such, our outlook assumes that China's demand for Industrial, Automotive and Consumer is minimal for all of February, before returning to a more normal level in the last two months of our second quarter. And we are assuming an impact on our Communications business due to the high likelihood of a delay in the 5G rollout. So our forecasting business dynamics in China is very difficult today. Our guidance reflects our best estimates.","So looking ahead of Q2, revenue is expected to be $1.35 billion, plus or minus $50 million. This includes an approximately $70 million revenue reduction due to the near-term risks associated with the coronavirus. And as I said earlier, we expect to reduce channel inventory again, but to a much lesser degree than in the first quarter.","At the midpoint of $1.35 billion, we expect B2B revenue in the aggregate to increase mid to high-single digits sequentially with growth across all of our B2B markets of Industrial, Automotive and Communications.","Based on the midpoint of guidance, op margin is expected to be up sequentially to approximately 37.5%. We are planning for our tax rate to be between 10% and 12% for the quarter, and we are improving our fiscal 2020 outlook to between 11% and 13%.","Based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.10, plus or minus $0.08. While we are mindful of the uncertainty around this, I echo Vince's optimism, we are encouraged by near-term trend that point to a stabilization and improvement across end markets, and we are extremely confident in the long-term growth opportunities for ADI.","Let me give it back to Mike now to start our Q&A.","Michael Lucarelli","Thanks, Prashanth. Okay. Let's get to our Q&A session. Please limit yourself to one question after our initial response. We'll give you the opportunity for follow-up. Operator, can we have our first question please?","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Jamie Zakalik","This is Jamie on for Vivek. Thanks for letting us to ask a question. So similar to peers, you guys noticed some stabilizing and improving trends in end markets in the January quarter. But it seems like growth has actually decelerated across all the end markets. So I guess, are the improving trends more in February even with a lot of these virus headwinds? And is it specific to any end market or geography or is it in more broad-based?","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","Yeah. So, Jamie, I think the first quarter was in line with what we expected. So there was deceleration going into the first quarter. Now, remember that in this quarter we under shipped the channel. And as I have said in my prepared comment, we under shipped by $40 million. So on a revenue [indiscernible] reg basis, PO ship in was $40 million below sell-through. As we go into the second quarter, orders were improving over the course of the first quarter. And we expect that to continue into the second quarter with this note that we made on disruption in China, where we believe some of this demand is going to get pushed out to future quarters. So I do think that our view here is that we've sort of bottomed out and we get better from here through subsequent quarters.","Vincent Roche","Yeah. Maybe I can add a little bit of color as well from a market perspective on that. So, what we're seeing is, in spite of what looks like a delayed 5G deployment in China, in the second quarter, we're expecting growth actually quite good growth in our communications 5G sector as well as wire line. And that growth is becoming a little more broad-based. We're seeing, I would say, green shoots in the factory automation and process control side of things as well, which is a significant part of ADI's Industrial business, and also gathering strength in the ATE sector. And from an automotive standpoint, we're seeing particular strength in our business in America as well as Europe at this point in time.","Michael Lucarelli","Given the long of that answer, we're kind of push to the next caller please, Cheryl.","Operator","And our next question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Your line is open.","Tore Svanberg","Vince, I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit more there on 5G. You said it's becoming a more broad-based business. Just trying to understand geographically where the growth is coming from, because obviously it's not coming from China near-term. So if you could elaborate, that would be great. Thanks.","Vincent Roche","Well, I think, Tore, China has taken a pause. Asia is still, at this point in time, in terms of deployments today, Asia is by far the strongest in 5G. I think what we're seeing is the \u2013 probably, a faster roll-off in 4G than we had anticipated. 5G has taken a bit of a pause in China, but is set based and what we see in terms of demand is set for a ramp during the second quarter. And also I pointed out that wireline for ADI in general, whether it's data center, whether it's Metro or long haul networks is doing quite well. So yes, we come into the second quarter. Our book-to-bill has been -- is well above one. And that gives us the confidence in the growing strength of that business through the second quarter here.","Michael Lucarelli","Thanks Tore. Do you have a follow-up?","Tore Svanberg","Yeah. Just a quick one. Prashanth, you did a good job lowering channel inventory. It sounds like you're going to lower a bit more again this quarter. Could you maybe give us some targets either by weeks or what dollar amount that you trying to lower than by?","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","Well, I think, Tore, we had mentioned in our first quarter or fourth quarter call that our goal was to get back to our target range by the end of the second quarter. It may take us a little bit longer now given that we didn't include the impact of the coronavirus in the top line. So we're still heading towards the same channel inventory target that we\u2019ve had before. But with bit of a softer top line, I think, it might actually be end up third quarter before we're back in range.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Toshiya Hari","Your Automotive business was down 16% in the quarter, which was in line with your guidance, but relative to peers a little worse on a year-over-year basis. Vince and Prashanth, you guys talked about your optimism around from the design-win activities in BMS and infotainment. But in the near-term, what's driving kind of the double-digit decline in your Automotive business? Is that mostly channel inventory reduction? Or are you losing share? I guess more importantly, how are you guys thinking about kind of the through-cycle growth rate for your Automotive business over the next couple of years?","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","Yeah. Well, look, I -- we have been very, very clear. The two growth drivers for ADI in the automotive sector are the infotainment area, A2B active noise cancellation, audio signal processing in general. And of course, BMS has been, over the last couple of years, a double-digit growth driver for ADI. I think in the quarter just past BMS, which has a strong root in China, has suffered as a result of the virus. And \u2013 but, when we look into the second quarter, we expect our second quarter has better trends in North America and Europe. So we're expecting modest growth in the second quarter. The headwind for ADI has really been the safety sector where our 24-gigahertz radar technology is declining, probably at a rate a little faster than I had expected. And also in the area of MEMS, more the kind of the passive safety MEMS where we withdrew investments three or four years ago. So, I think, we'll begin to bottom-out, I think, on those headwinds. Specific to safety, we have a new safety modality in 77 gigahertz, which is, by all accounts, very, very exciting for our customers. We will see the bottoming, I think, of the MEMS and the 24 gigahertz radar decline. So my sense is in the areas we've picked powertrain, infotainment, we're very, very well-positioned to grow those sectors over the next two, three, four years.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Your line is open.","Ambrish Srivastava","Thank you very much. Prashanth, I had a question on the actual weeks of inventory, and I might have missed it, but did you give an actual number? I think you were 8.5 weeks in the prior quarter.","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","We did not give a number, Ambrish. What I mentioned, if you took the channel inventory down to $40 million, but if you do the math, we're still going to be above our target range because the revenue -- the numerator has moved, but the denominator has also shrunk. So on a ratio standpoint, the weeks is still high, but we did take a big chunk out, and we're going to take more out in Q2 as we mentioned.","Michael Lucarelli","Is there a follow-up, Ambrish?","Ambrish Srivastava","I did. Vince, maybe for you. In the two areas as real quick on Industrials, what's the right way to think about given what's going on in China and broader. How to think about return to growth in the Industrials business? You guys outperformed last year, but what -- how should we think about year-over-year growth returning? And then, comps, we always ask you about why less. It\u2019s slightly a different question. How are you guys positioned in wireline versus if you look back at years ago? And then what gets you excited about the design wins in -- that should be ramping out in wireline. Thank you.","Vincent Roche","Thanks, Ambrish. Let me try and address the Industrial question first. So, we are seeing our aerospace and defense business continue to grow at double-digit rates annually. We are seeing, as I said a little earlier on the factory automation side of things, I said Asia is on a -- I'd say a solid improvement in its demand pattern. I think inventory hangover has largely been taken out of the equation in the industrial sector. So, I think, when we look at the impact of the virus in China, we're not expecting really anything in the industrial sector in terms of shipments there for the month of February. But, all that said, we've a very solid book-to-bill in the industrial sector. And we will get, I think a decent increase in our top-line and industrial during the second quarter. On the wireline side of things, our gain there is really two pieces. We have a very strong leadership position in optical control systems for data centers. So all of the things, for example, will use our technology in their data centers for control of the optical signal chain. And also the cable market, we have a good position there in infrastructure systems. So wireline business has been growing high-single digits now for several years. And I don't see any decline in that. I think that'll be a decent growth driver for ADI. It runs into the region of $400 million annually in terms of sales at the present time. So I view that very much, Ambrish, as a tailwind for the company.","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","Yes. Let me also add on the Industrial side, we did take down general inventory meaningfully. A lot of that relates to Industrial. And if you look at Industrial, kind of zoom out, we look at it on a trailing 12-month basis, we only down low-single digit. It was a pretty good performance in a tough macro backdrop, and that goes to the diversity of that business. With that Cheryl, we\u2019ll go to next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets.","Mitch Steves","I just wanted to clarify couple things. I think you guys did a very good job now kind of talking about your capital allocation, but what I'm having hard time understanding is kind of the margin mix here. I realized that space and satellites probably higher margin, I'm guessing at 80% to 90% gross margin. You guys are actually coming down a bit in the gross margin line. Can you maybe talk us through what the gross margin profile should look like in the first half and the second half? And then how that would flow through the operating margin line as well?","Vincent Roche","So I guess a little bit of background right. Our model is 70% gross margin for a long-term model. And in good times, we were operating at 72%, in more challenging times, like now, we're down in the high 60s, so through the cycle it\u2019s 70%. As we move forward from here, we see two things that are going to be impacting margins, both utilization and mix. So Q1 represented the trough level of our utilization expectations for the year. So a fair amount of under absorption at our internal manufacturing facilities. That gets better from here on and that will be tailwind to margins. And also as some of the questions that were asked, Vince mentioned the strength in Industrial, we expect Industrials to continue to be growing as we move forward. And Industrial, in general, is one of our highest margin businesses. So that will also provide tailwind. So I would expect that you can see sequential improvement in gross margins through the balance of this year, likely getting back to our model margins in the second half, maybe towards the end of the end of the year.","Mitch Steves","And then I just have one follow-up just in terms of the seasonality for the business. I think maybe you should probably be thinking a little bit of a more conservative view in April just because it sounds like China is going to open up March 1. But when I looked at the July quarter, going from April to July, should that be, I guess, above the seasonal given that April was depressed from all the macro items are going on?","Vincent Roche","So the guide for our second quarter included a $70 million adjustment that we made at the top for the impact of the coronavirus. And the math that we use to arrive at that is we essentially zeroed out February in China for Industrial and Auto and Consumer. And then we also made an adjustment for Communications being pushed of -- the department of 5G being pushed out of it just because of the labor challenges that are going on there. We expect that to begin unwinding as -- in the subsequent months and certainly be back to normal in the third quarter. Could it be above normal? That's certainly a possibility depends on the timing of how that $70 million comes back. It's our current view that that is purely a timing shift that that is not locked demand. But as to when that falls back in, it's hard to say. But the order activity certainly suggests that it's not going away.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is open.","Stacy Rasgon","Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to view in first on comp, so it sounds like you're pushing it out. Your prior guidance for comp last year was to grow year-over-year and it feels like you're backing away from that, but the trajectory in the second half on the old guidance was for very strong sequential growth kind of every quarter going forward. How should we be thinking about the trajectory of comp in the second half, I guess, given the pump in Q2 versus the profile that was \u2013 that you had in mind three months ago when you gave guidance? Do you still expect to see a similar ramp maybe just off a lower base?","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","Yeah. So, just a few things, Stacy. For the first quarter, a little bit lower than we expected mainly due to the 5G pause that started in the second half of '19. Moving into the second quarter, orders have begun to come back in very much as we expected, and our book-to-bill is above one. So that's supporting a strong sequential increase in second quarter for both 5G, but also as Vince mentioned, we're seeing some good strength in wireline had been reported by a number of peers as well. The sequential increase is below our initial expectations because of the -- a lot of that was related to 5G timing in China. So I think everything is moving a little bit to the right here. So it's hard for us to say at this point whether the timing of that recovery is still going to put us up year-on-year, but I think we'll have to see how quickly this demand recovers and whether the installations happen as it caught up in the year or not? But we feel very good that this is really a dislocation of demand versus actual loss or destruction.","Vincent Roche","I'll tell you one other comment in that, Stacy. Our optimism about what's happening in America related to 5G has strengthened over the past quarter as well. So yes, we have the disruption in China. It's really a delay of demand rather than disruption. But my own sense is that we probably see more activity in the back end of the year in the U.S. relating to 5G.","Michael Lucarelli","Is there a follow-up, Stacy?","Stacy Rasgon","I do. Thank you. So it sounds like also, even though we have the delay because of coronavirus in China that the order patterns still seem to be very strong. How do we think about the strength of those Chinese orders in relation to potential increases in sanctions that we have been hearing about? Do you feel like there's any sort of scramble on the part of Chinese customers to get out in front of those sanctions? What do you see in terms of customer behavior in relation to the regulatory?","Vincent Roche","Yeah. I think first off, when you look at the geopolitical machinations, it's actually very hard to figure out what's going on. So, but, I think with our business in general, we have many thousands of customers in China, many thousands of product skews. And we see ongoing demand that there are obviously areas where we are restricted, particularly in 5G. But I think the rest of our business right now is in a kind of normalized markets and regulatory situations. So the demand we're seeing is despite the disruption here because of the virus, the demand in China is actually quite strong across the board otherwise.","Stacy Rasgon","Let me rephrase the question. If, all of a sudden, like the diminimus threshold gets dropped from 25% to 10%, and the foreign direct products will gets strengthened and they put more stuff on the controllers, does that impact how you guys view the trajectory in China as we go through the year? Would you have to reevaluate what you can ship and what you can\u2019t? ","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","Well, yes, we would have to reevaluate. But remember that we have adjusted one large communications customer down from a traditional mid-single to low-single digit as percentage of revenue. So that is kind of -- that's the limit of our exposure depending on what happens to that particular customer.","Vincent Roche","Yeah, I think it very much depends on the scope of what happens. So far everything we've seen is relating to one specific area of communication. So, unkown, Stacy, but we'll see. Time will tell.","Operator","And our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley.","Craig Hettenbach","I just wanted to follow-on the comments about the opportunity to double Linear's growth in the coming years. And Prashanth if you can talk about, I know, there is some gross margin levers as you consolidate manufacturing and just kind of how you dealing on that in terms of the growth profiles versus kind of margins for linear in the next couple of years?","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","Sure. So I'll take the margin side of it, and then in terms of doubling the growth, I\u2019ll let Vince comment. On the margin side of it, we have talked about the focus we've got on shutting down two facilities. We've taken -- we've made announcements on those. We've actually been able to accelerate some of the savings for the \u2013 for one of the factory closure, so we're going to start seeing some of that benefit in cost of goods sale at the end of this year. But the balance of that $100 million, we see feathering in over 2021. And as we've stated in the Q4 earnings call, our intention is to let \u2013 to kind of let all that come through be the bottom line. So we are not looking to redeploy that cost of good things. So you should see some lift in our gross margins on an ongoing basis as we exit 2020 and through 2021. In terms of kind of the progress we're making to double that linear growth rate, let me hand that up to Vince.","Vincent Roche","Yes, so I think we're making good progress Craig, in kind of equalize the value of the kind of legacy ADI mixed signals technology value in a given application with power. So we're looking for equivalent, for every dollar of mixed signal we expect to get a dollar power. And that's what the market opportunity available is. I can tell you that our pipeline for the LTC portfolio and, specifically power is up about 40% actually year-over-year, and we're moving into production down the automotive sector, the communication wireless sector, wired, we're in early volume production as well. So we expect to see those areas run in terms of meaningful impact on the top lines during 2021. And there are many, many, new stockists in the industrial area that we're working on. So that will just take a little longer given the slower uptake in terms of turning design-ins to revenue. But I think a lot like Hittite, we feel -- we went through this process with Hittite. We've doubled the size of that company -- that franchise over the last five years. And I think we're on a very good track right now with LTE to achieving 200, 300 basis points of top line growth based on the strength of the portfolio, and the activity at the customer level that we're seeing.","Michael Lucarelli","Thanks, Craig. We go to the next caller.","Operator","Our next question comes from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Harlan Sur","Good morning. Good to see the fundamentals starting to improve here. A&D grew greater than 20% last year, defense budget was approved beginning of this year. It's strong up 4% versus last year. And you guys expect continued double-digit year-over-year growth here this year. And the \u2013 so is most of the strength coming from the defense segment? Or are there also programs in the commercial aerospace SATCOM sector that are starting to fire as well?","Vincent Roche","Yeah. As I said in the prepared remarks, obviously, defense budgets are in our favor in terms of buying technology and deploying it, so we're in good shape there. And, yeah, we're seeing a strong double-digit growth in the space area as well. And that's relatively -- we've had a good position there. But if you like the explosion in the launch of LEO satellites and GEO satellites is really increasing demand for the company. And we're looking at in these applications many thousands of dollars of content per satellite kind of thing. So we're very optimistic about that. But it's a combination of both. Both parts of that business are really growing well.","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","Harlan, I would say, remember, think about defense as when DoD gives the money to the primes and the prime start deploying it, this is going into a design decisions that were made many years ago. So we are enjoying the flow of that larger budget into the primes and then to us for decisions that were made some time ago. We still have quite a bit of great design activity that has yet to be funded. So that starts to come. On the aerospace side, its holding as well as it can be expected given the environment that's growing on there. And then in the space, as Vince mentioned, space is really in front of us. That growth is in front of us. So while ADEF has been growing at a nice clip and continued to, we feel even more optimistic about what's in front of us coming both from space and future design-win activity that happened for the defense business.","Michael Lucarelli","Thanks, Harlan. We\u2019ll go to our last caller please.","Operator","And our last question comes from William Stein from SunTrust. Your line is open.","William Stein","Thanks for taking my question. Two of them really, first, I'm hoping you can provide some update or commentary as to the competitive situation and maybe the legal competitive situation with an FPGA supplier in high performance converters, maybe competitive trends as to design win traction relative to that vendor?","Vincent Roche","Well, broadly speaking in terms of competition, we've outgrown our closest competitors for the last three years. And so, we're clearly gaining share across the board in Communications and Industrials, in particular. So I think competitively we're in good shape. I think pricing is very, very stable as well. So, I think overall legacy is strong, our design pipeline is strong, and we're excited about the new R&D programs as well that are coming to fruition for the company. In relation to the litigation with, as you said, a large FPGA company, we will give you -- as new information emerges, we'll be transparent with you, and we'll communicate with you. But at this point, all I can say is that we're confident that this matter is going through the court and be successfully resolved. And we are defending our IP very aggressively, and we believe we have a very, very strong case, so that's where it is. It's within the court, but we're very optimistic with how things are going.","Michael Lucarelli","You said you have a follow-up, Will?","William Stein","Yeah, appreciate that. Just on the Covid impact. It sounds like what you're saying is that you're assuming certain orders are zero for February given where February '19. I assume that's actually what you're seeing in the order book. Is there any anticipation for weakness later in the quarter? And also any supply disruption that you're noticing at all? Thank you.","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","So on the orders, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, it is very hard to kind of sigh the activity of what's going on in China. So when we arrived at our 70, we wanted to give the investor and analysts\u2019 community what assumptions are we using knowing that these are very dynamic. So for our assumptions, we've taken our China activity to zero in February and pushed out a little bit of 5G. On the supply chain side, we're not seeing much disruption at this standpoint. We had some of our back-end suppliers early on. We're struggling just \u2013 we\u2019re getting some labor into -- to run their activity. But that's also been resolved as time has settled out here. So from our standpoint, our supply chain and we just revalidated this with you guys this morning our supply chain we feel good about.","William Stein","That\u2019s great. Thank you.","Michael Lucarelli","Thanks Will. I'll also add, I think it might be helpful, given your question, kind of given our outlook of B2B what we think is market is going to do, because it seems a little confusion out there of how we think the markets are going to do. We think each market grow sequentially. We said, in total B2B will be up mid- to high-single digits. Our rank order those three. I think comps is little better than that. Industry does in line with the overall outlook, and auto does a little bit worse. So that's going to help you think of how the corona is impacting our business. And with that, thank you everyone for joining us. A copy of the transcript will be available on our website. And all of our reconciliations and information can also be found on the quarterly results section of our website.

Sir, the floor is yours.","Ali Husain","Okay, good morning everybody. Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning everybody. Thanks for joining our conference call. You can find our press release and relating financial schedules at their usual place, at investor.analog.com. With me on the call today are ADI\u2019s CEO, Vincent Roche; ADI\u2019s CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah; and Mike Lucarelli from Investor Relations.","First, let's get through our disclosures. Note that the information we\u2019re about to discuss, including our objectives and outlook, includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call and we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.","Today\u2019s commentary about ADI\u2019s fourth quarter and fiscal \u201917 financial results will be detailed further in our 10-K, which we expect to file over the next few days. In addition, note that ADI\u2019s fourth quarter and fiscal \u201917 financial results and short term outlook will include non-GAAP financial measures when comparing our results to our historical performance. Special items are also excluded from the prior quarter and year-over-year results.","Available reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today\u2019s earnings release and in our Web schedules, which we\u2019ve posted under the quarterly results section at investor.analog.com. Our Web schedules also include a historical view of what the combined ADI and Linear Tech would have looked like by end markets, by quarter for the last three years.","And lastly, please note that ADI\u2019s first quarter of fiscal \u201918 includes an additional week, so fiscal 1Q \u201918 will be a 14-week quarter. And as expected, include one normal week of revenue expense.","Okay, so with that, I'll turn it over to ADI\u2019s CEO, Vincent Roche. With the exception of fourth quarter revenue, Vince\u2019s comments about our financial results are on a non-GAAP basis and exclude special items outlined in today\u2019s release and in our Web schedules. Okay Vince, it\u2019s all yours.","Vincent Roche","Thank you, Ali and very good morning everyone. I\u2019d like to firstly welcome Prashant to ADI. This is, as you know, Prashant\u2019s first quarter as our CFO and I am really delighted to have him join ADI.","Turning to the quarter. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was another very successful quarter for ADI. And I am pleased to share our results with you this morning. Revenue in the fourth quarter totaled $1.54 billion and was above the midpoint of guidance as the communications and consumer markets led our sequential growth, while the industrial and automotive markets were stable through the prior quarter.","Our strong overall revenue performance coupled with disciplined operational execution expanded growth and operating margins and drove diluted earnings per share to $1.45, which was above the high end of our guidance. Now to provide you with a historical perspective, over the last five years, ADI has doubled its revenue base to $5.2 billion, expanded operating margins by over 900 basis points to approximately 40% and nearly tripled free cash flow generation on a combined Company basis to $1.9 billion or 34% of sales, which is within the top 5% of all S&P 500 companies.","From a strategic perspective, 2017 was a Watershed year as we completed the acquisition of LTC, further deepening and widening our competitive moat, expanding our capabilities and high value signal processing and power management applications, and giving ADI the ability to more completely serve the ever expanding needs of our more than 100,000 customers.","ADI is now able to solve customer problems from sensor to cloud, from DC to 100 gigahertz and from nanowatts to kilowatts with a leading market position in all product segments. Fiscal 2017 was also marked by strong execution across our portfolio of products and customers. For example, in the industrial markets, which represented 46% of revenue in fiscal '17, our battery formation and test equipment solutions experienced both cyclical and secular growth as we gained additional dollar content in our customer systems and added new customers in this expanding market, which is forecasted to grow 5 times by 2022.","The factory automation sector also grew strongly during the year as customers made both Brownfield and Greenfield upgrades to manufacturing equipment. Here ADI's technology solutions are enabling value creation for our customers by helping reduce [technical difficulty] time, boost productivity and make manufacturing more flexible and configurable.","In healthcare applications, our optical sensor based solutions also grew strongly over the prior year, led by vital signs monitoring and imaging applications. In the automotive market, which represented of 15% of revenue in fiscal 2017, we made excellent progress on the promise of autonomous driving with new innovations and radar technology, where our solutions provides superior range and resolution capability beyond anything available in the market today.","And in automotive infotainment applications, we hit an important milestone for our A to B Audio Bus solution, surpassing 1 million units shipped in the year across platforms of many automotive OEMs including Ford.","The communications market represented 18% of revenue in fiscal '17. Within this market, we've experienced a 10-fold revenue increase over the past four years for our software defined radio solutions, which have become the market leader from macro sales massive MIMO and small cell."," The consumer market represented 21% of revenue for the year and also grew strongly led by portable applications.","As we often say, look favors the prepared minds, and we've been preparing and investing for this moment for many, many decades. And across our business, we are creating, capturing and retaining value by leveraging our culture of innovation to solve our customers\u2019 biggest and most pressing challenges. Building on a very strong 2017, we believe we can continue to drive long-term profitable growth by investing at the cutting edge to grow our core franchises and by extending our reach with our customers.","So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to ADI's new CFO, Prashant. In his short-time here, Prashant has hit the ground running, providing me and the organization with his keen strategic insights. And I'm very confident that with his operational focus and financial discipline, we will increase shareholder value further.","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","Thank you, Vince. Good morning everyone. And let me add my welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. I'm very excited to be joining Analog Devices and to be joining Vince\u2019s leadership team. This is a Company with tremendous legacy of innovation, and I look forward to helping to drive the business and deliver against our long-term financial model.","In my eight weeks here, I've been deeply impressed with the quality of our ADI's technology, the dedication of our employees and the depth of our customer relationships. I have met many of you by phone already and I look forward to getting on the road and meeting you in-person.","Now getting to our results. As Vince mentioned, the fourth quarter of 2017 was an excellent period across the multiple dimensions and caps off a very strong year. As I walk through the P&L with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses, my comments will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release.","Revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.54 billion, up 6% sequentially and above our guidance midpoint. Gross margins of 70.9% were 40 basis points higher than our guidance primarily on higher utilization and cost synergy capture. Inventory was stable at 108 days in the quarter and on a dollar basis, inventory increased to $31 million sequentially as we ramped production to match strong demand. Distribution channel inventory of seven weeks was stable to the prior quarter as well, on both the weeks and the dollars basis.","Operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $435 million or 28% of revenue, which improved operating margin to 42.6%. Non-operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $67 million, and we should see this decline by $2 million to $3 million per quarter for fiscal '18.","Our fourth quarter non-GAAP tax rate of 9% included a full-year true up to bring the 2017 rate to 9.6%. But as we look to 2018, we expect the 12% tax rate, which is an improvement versus our previously issued guidance of 15%. EPS for the fourth quarter was $1.45, bringing the full-year to $4.72, up $1.65 from the prior fiscal year. Free cash flow generation was very solid in the quarter at $630 million with an associated free cash flow margin of 41%.","And during the quarter, we paid down $350 million of debt, which has helped reduce our net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 2.6, down from the 2.9 in the prior quarter. Capital additions in the fourth quarter were $65 million and we expect capital additions in fiscal 2018 to continue to run at our model of approximately 4% of sales. During the quarter, we paid $167 million in dividends with an associated quarterly cash dividend of $0.45, representing an annual dividend payment of $1.80 per share. All-in a good quarter to wrap-up a solid year.","Let us now turn to our outlook and expectations for the first quarter of fiscal '18, which with the exception of revenue, are also on a non-GAAP basis. We are planning for revenue in the 14 week first quarter to be in the range of $1.44 billion to $1.54 billion. We expect a full weeks revenue benefit from this 14th week as it falls in the last week in the month of January. Adjusting for the additional week and at the midpoint of guidance, Q1 revenue is expected to decrease sequentially.","On this same basis, we expect ADI\u2019s B2B markets of industrial, automotive and communications, in aggregate, to decrease in the mid-single digit sequentially in this seasonally slower first quarter, but to be up over the prior year led by the industrial end market.","Given that our revenue guidance by end market is not perfectly correlated with our actual results, this will also be the last quarter in which we provide our revenue outlook by end market. Of course, we will continue to guide you to an overall revenue range. We are planning for gross margins to remain relatively stable sequentially and to be in the range of 70.5% to 71%.","Operating expenses are estimated to be in the range of $440 million to $450 million and include an additional week's worth of activity related to the 14 week quarter. On a 13 week basis, operating expenses are expected to decrease in the mid single digit sequentially. Based on these inputs, we expect operating margins in the first quarter of 2018 to be in the range of approximately 40% to 42% and for diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, to be in the range of a $1.20 to a $1.36.","So to wrap it up, this was a terrific quarter performance and wraps up a very strong year of revenue growth, margin expansion, EPS growth and free cash flow generation. Looking ahead, we're encouraged by a number of positive indicators across our business, including the strong secular growth drivers, a robust opportunity pipeline and access to customers at an unprecedented level, which combined with our strong free cash flow and commitment to deleveraging, will continue to drive value for our shareholders.","Now, before we move to the Q&A, I have an additional announcement. To help continue the successful integration of Linear Tech, I am delighted to announce that Ali Husain has accepted the position of CFO for ADI's power division supporting Steve Pietkiewicz and will be relocating with his family to Sunny, California. Vince and I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ali for the tremendous work he has done with the investment community and we look forward to working with him in this new role to drive even greater shareholder value in the future.","Moving forward, Mike Lukareli who many of you already know from his work with Ali over the past couple of years, will be your main point of contact in IR. I have enjoyed getting to know Mike over the past few weeks as someone who is both energetic and knowledgeable. I'm sure you'll find Mike to be a great resource for your investment research on ADI.","And so with that, I'll turn it over to Ali for our Q&A session.","Ali Husain","Great, thanks Prashanth. It\u2019s been a privilege working with the investment community and I look forward to this new challenge. So let's get to the Q&A session. Please limit yourself to one question. After we provide you with our initial response, we'll give you an opportunity for a follow up question. So operator let's get to our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer","My first question, Vince, is just around industrial year-over-year growth. I think clearly one of the investor concerns out there is that that part of your business has been growing greater than 20% for several quarters consecutively. And I think there's some concerns around sustainability. Last quarter, you highlighted some one-offs that helped to drive some of the strength, including things like ATE. Were there one-offs in the October quarter? And I guess more importantly as you look out over the next several quarters, how would you expect year-over-year growth rate to trend and what sort of the more normalized growth rate we should suspect as being sustainable?","Vincent Roche","I think, let me start with the last part of the question first about sustainable growth rates. If you look back over the last five years of our business, we've had a growth rate in 2017 that was well beyond 20% in the industrial sector. But actually when you aggregate over the five years, the growth rate was around 5%. And I think that is a sustainable number and the way to think about the long-term growth trajectory for the industrial business. So then looking into '18 how do we view things? Well, I think for sure the strong GDP environment bodes well for the industrial business, number one. I think also we're seeing good growth drivers. I've had the benefit of speaking to many executives at many of our industrial customers over the last several months, the last few quarters. And what I can tell you is that the activity in building out the industrial IoT; I talked in the prepared remarks about the Brownfield upgrade in America; for example, the Greenfield those outs in China. All these things I think are good secular growth drivers that have many-many years of legs to them, particularly I would say in China.","And added to that John we're seeing for example the emergence of these rechargeable batteries everywhere in cars obviously everybody knows about smartphones and so on so forth, but the formation and text of those battery systems is quite a great performance challenge and an area where we see a lot of opportunity to bring precision technologies to market. So I think you've got to be skeptical to some extent. I think there are it's -- are those growth rates sustainable? Yes I think on a 5% level they are but my sense is heading into '18, we should be able to hold the gains.","I guess, the only caution retailer there is one in the industrial market is the world of ATE. But again, there what we're seeing is for example the shift from hard disk drive to solid state memories to building out of these giga memory factories and giga factories in general to support consumer goods. So I think when you put everything together across instrumentation, aerospace and defense factory automation and instrumentation, in general, I think we're in for a good cycle rate now.","John Pitzer","And then maybe as I my follow-on, just on the consumer side, it was a lot stronger than expected in the October quarter. Wondering if you can give us some color on what was driving the strength? And I know Prashanth in your prepared comments you mentioned you want to stay away from giving guidance on an ongoing basis by end market. But during the Analyst Day this year, you kind of gave fairly specific guidance for all of fiscal \u201818 on consumer. And as we think about your different content in flagship phones and how that might look into to the January quarter. Is there any help that you can give us on what we should expect to see at a consumer at least relative to seasonality going into January?","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","Well, our consumer business in the quarter was ahead of expectation. It was at the high end of our expectation. And it was purely driven by portable applications. And as we signaled at the Analyst Day, we\u2019re expecting our consumer business to be down on 2018, largely on the back of a weaker portable market, portable business for ADI. And you're already starting to see that weakness in the guidance that we're now providing. So I think at the midpoint of guidance, if you take \u201818 the prediction for \u201818, we expect consumer to be down meaningfully over 2017.","John Pitzer","Perfect, thanks guys. Congratulations on the results.","Vincent Roche","John, I would only add that if you take the guidance we've given you, you adjust for the 13 quarter, which is the first calculation. And then back out the B2B guidance we've given you, you should be able to impute the consumer guidance and you'll come up with a pretty meaningful number, which is the trend that we've been indicating for the past several quarters is starting to materialize.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Craig Hettenbach","So I had a question on the automotive market. You highlighted 1 million units of A2B. Can you just talk about the breadth of that? I know you mentioned Ford. But just kind of design, breadth of design, and how you see the trajectory in A2B?","Vincent Roche","Craig, virtually all the OEMs across the globe have adopted A2B. And we just basically got our steam going in 2017 largely in the U.S. and to some extent Europe. So we're at the very, very early stages, we're not at the need of curve yet, so to speak. So I expect hockey stick in the A2B market over the next three years and it will ramp in '18 and '19. And I think we'll be at some significant sustainable level of revenue in the 2020 timeframe. So we're in the ramp phase, but I think it's very meaningful that we've already shipped a million units into production models at this point.","Craig Hettenbach","And then as my follow up for Prashanth, what are the key areas as you step into the CFO role there. Key areas of focus for you and opportunities you see going forward?","Prashanth Mahendra","So certainly, primary goal is going to be ensuring that we deliver against the financial model that was communicated over this summer. That means we need to grow our revenue, convert that revenue into high profit dollars and then deliver that profit at cash flow growth to pay down our debt. I would say equally important will be to work collectively with the three division presidents to ensure the successful integration of LTC, to achieve both the revenue and the cost synergies that we're underpinning the deal rationale. And then maybe last, I think, Vince has mentioned in prior calls that I've been chartered with working with the division leaders to really uncover and capture opportunities for track value, help drive shareholder value. That include areas that I've already begin working with the organization on such as pricing.","Operator","Our next question is from William Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein","I'm hoping you can characterize lead times and book-to-bill in the quarter that's being reported and compare them to the prior quarter?","Prashanth Mahendra","Yes, I can help you with that. So as I mentioned, activity remains fairly stable. So, on a book-to-bill basis at the enterprise level just hare under 1 as we head into the first quarter. And then if you back out consumer, some slight expansion versus that. However, as I mentioned, the channel still looks very stable and at around seven weeks and equivalent on a dollar basis. So we're heading into the holiday season but from where we stand today, given the somewhat limited visibility that this industry has, so things look to be stable.","William Stein","One other follow-up if I can. I'm hoping you can offer some competitive commentary on the converter market in light of one of the field programmable Gatorade company, is highlighting this product they call an RFSoC that they indicate is taking share in the converter market, maybe you can comment on that.","Prashanth Mahendra","Look as is the dynamic in the business world, good markets are always going to attract competition. And I think competition in the converter market in general has been really consolidating over the last five or seven years. But we've got a five decade history of building high performance analog solutions for our customers across the board in areas like wireless infrastructure, wired infrastructure and other important areas like aerospace and defense, civil aviation and so on.","And what I can tell you for sure is that, as the OEMs deal with ever increasing technology complexity, our customers in the area of these communication systems, in particular, where a lot of the very-very high speed data converter products are used they need a very broad array of microwave of RF, mixed signal technology and of course power technologies. And it's really about smartly partitioning their solutions for performance, for power efficiency, for footprint, and last but not least cost.","And we have a multi-decade history of not only delivering on all aspects of those performance dimensions across the board, but also we've been delivering a broad suite an array of converter products for many-many years on time with very high quality. And last but not least, great support at the application and system level. So there'll always be competition. But our portfolio is unmatched in our industry irrespective of whatever configuration a customer is using. So there'll always be competition but it's our job to stay ahead right on the cutting edge of what's possible.","Operator","Our next question is from C.J. Muse with Evercore.","C.J. Muse","As you think about the extra week in January, do you expect that to be equally apportioned across all segments or do you think one or two will be better than others? And I guess as a follow up to that, how do think about normal seasonality heading into the April quarter?","Vincent Roche","C.J. that extra week is just a calendar consequence of how the ADI fiscal is run. So it comes around every five to six years. It will be equivalent across all industries. And since it falls in the month of January, I would not expect anything out of the ordinary for that. But I would remind everyone that as you build your models going forward into Q2 that you do want to adjust your sequential growth rates to reflect that you\u2019re moving from a 14 week into a 13 week quarter.","C.J. Muse","And then I guess as my follow-up, I guess to kind of follow-on John's question around the sustainability of industrial strength year-on-year. Can you walk through as you look back on '17, how much of the strength was a reset to GDP versus replenishment in the distribution channel versus rising silicon content. How do you think about those three factors in terms of 20 plus percent growth?","Vincent Roche","In terms of raising silicon content, I think there is no question that there is more sensing more measuring being applied to factory automation and process control machines. So we benefit from that. It\u2019s something at doesn\u2019t get talked about as much is the automation of labor in China and that's going to be a multiyear build out. And many of our European and Japanese customers, in particular, are benefiting from that build out. But that will be -- that's part of the China 2025 initiative. So that's very significant and will be for a long time to come.","And I think look there is certainly an anxiety around supplier there. So clearly, a certain amount of the demand is driven by anxiety. But I would say when you look across our channel, you look across our customer base inventories are up somewhat. Our inventories are up a little but we are building these on the basis of what we believe to be real demand. So I think this is very much a demand driven cycle and I think when you look at the inventories across the board, things are pretty good balanced at the moment.","Operator","Our next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.","Stacy Rasgon","First on the guidance next quarter, the B2B corrected for the extra week, down mid-single digit, seems to be a bit worse than I would consider normal. Is there anything specific across your three businesses, I guess, relative to what we had ordinarily see as we go into Q1 that\u2019s driving that maybe a little worse than normal seasonality?","Vincent Roche","Well, I would say Stacy that when you look at that on a year-over-year basis, even guiding B2B as we did, is still pretty healthy growth year-on-year. So that gets you almost to high-single digits low double-digits or year-on-year [multiple speakers]\u2026","Stacy Rasgon","But industrials up like [5%] year-over-year. So I men what's going on\u2026","Vincent Roche","Stacy, in the first quarter if you back into the guidance industrial will be up in the mid-teens and the B2B markets, as Prashanth mentioned, are forecasted to be up in the high-single digits over the prior year in the first quarter to 13 week basis. So into a quarter that is typically lower on seasonality basis, particularly for industrial given that you have the holiday period for the factories.","Stacy Rasgon","So I mean you always have the holiday period in that quarter?","Vincent Roche","Correct. I'm just saying on a sequential basis.","Prashanth Mahendra","Stacy, we\u2019re headed into a seasonally weaker quarter. We read the order flows and we provide you with the guidance range that we think is reasonable. You can chose take a midpoint of that range it creates a high-single digit road in the B2B market for the prior year. That's the best we can tell you. The other I\u2019d point out is we did beat the midpoint of the guidance in the prior year by 260 basis points. So we're certainly coming off of a pretty strong result. And I think the year-over-year growth rate is really what we would look to in terms of how we think that are running the business at least excess of our business. So that's helpful, did you have a follow up?","Stacy Rasgon","I wanted to ask about automotive. So it's flattish year-over-year and sequentially, but also year-over-year on a combined basis with Linear, which maybe is bit of odds before we're seeing some period but also maybe sounds like a little bit odd on what you're seeing on your A2B market and the growth in there. So can you talk a little bit about the auto dynamics, in particular, on a year-over-year basis when does that start to grow and what's been going on over the last year?","Vincent Roche","So if you look at the legacy ADI business during '17, that part of our automotive business grew in the high-single digits where we had some headwind was specifically because of the continuing battery management weakness in the LTC portfolio. So that whole BMS thing that whole market is highly concentrated in terms of customers and programs. So really what we're seeing is still working off of the inventories in China, but the pipeline that we have in BMS designs is good.","And so we see that business recovering during '18 as several of these new customer programs start to come online. So I think by the end of '18, we'll be on a good growth track in that business, but that is the primary dampening effect, if you like, on our automotive business. And as we said at the Analyst Day, we expect this business to grow at two to three times SAR, and that's still our commitment.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.","Mark Lipacis","If you look at the operating margins, they've expanded over by about 450 basis points over the last year, 950 bps over the last three years. And I was wondering is there a physical limit to the margin profile here? Is there any reason why they would not continue to drift up overtime?","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","Mark, I would probably take you back to the financial model. And that's where we have modeled out how this business is going to -- expected to operate over the next several years. So we have some favorability movement now. We've talked about utilization rates I think we\u2019ve talked about bringing in synergies little earlier than possible. But I would say that the way to think about it is to really hold us to that model so that's the standard we hold ourselves to.","Mark Lipacis","And a follow up, if I may. If you look at previous industries that have consolidated, you do see upward bias on or better pricing environment, the Analog Industry has been consolidating. You guys have been an important driver of that.","Can you describe -- and I know that you have mentioned pricing as one area of focus as you head into this opportunity. Can you describe what you have been seeing on the pricing environment over the years? Are you noticing changes? Thank you.","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","Mark, I'm going to let Vince take that. Since he has a longer perspective on pricing and the trends that we're seeing?","Vincent Roche","I think it's true to say that certainly consolidation has helped to stabilize prices across the industry. We're also seeing stabilization, partly because of the environment in which we're working but also because we're paying a lot more attention to getting -- understanding where there is elasticity and just basically holding on to the value that we generate better. So I think it\u2019s a trend and we're certainly seeing stabilizing trends across our business over the last two or three years and I believe that stability will continue.","Ali Husain","And Mark, I would only add from my personal observations is there's a broad section of the ADI portfolio that is very sticky and we need to ensure that we take advantage of that to ensure that we're getting fair value for the technology that we bring to our customers and that could represent some pricing opportunities.","Operator","Our next question is from Tore Svanberg with Stifel.","Tore Svanberg","My first question is on communication, so it's starting to grow nicely year over year again. I was just hoping you could add a little bit more color on what's driving that especially in relation to topics like 4.5G, 5G, optical and so on?","Vincent Roche","So the communications business, as you know, is driven by two primary sectors. We've seen wireless infrastructure particularly strong it was up over the prior quarter. And driven by demand in developing regions like India for example but also in more developed markets like North America and China. We've seen both macro and smaller cell strength. And I'll give you a little more color in terms of technology in a second before -- after I make a comment on the wire line side of things.","So it's well known that the wire line business, particularly the optical part of that, has shown weakness in China over the past year. So that's been the damper there. I think the wireless sector is going to see some good growth in the coming three to five years and I'll give you a little bit of color on that.","As I see it, there is good activity still on 4G, heavy activity on 4.5G and 5G is in trials right now. But I think the boundaries between 4.5G and 5G are blurring to some extent, both of them are going to be based on massive MIMO. The indications are that that market is going to start to ramp in the latter part of 2018 into 2019, and going to peak to 2020. But as I said, we're seeing for example, activity where customers, our existing customers, are targeting at extending life of 4G systems.","So there's activity in upgrading 4G, introducing 4.5G and getting 5G into play. So as I said, I think with all the demands for mobile data, we're still working hard on the classical problems of integration, design agility, power consumption and with our LTC, the acquisition of LTC we have a very strong power portfolio. So we're in a better and better position as a company to take advantage of these trends across the board. So whatever the configuration that customers use in 4G, 4.5G, 5G, ADI is very well prepared to satisfy our customer's needs.","Tore Svanberg","From my follow-up for Prashanth, so you talked about utilization being up sequentially. Could you talk about where you stand on utilization today? And maybe more certain, in general where you are on in-house versus outside outsourcing at this point, especially given some of the fiber capacity that's out there at the wafer level?","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","So I think your first question is utilization levels. So Q4 was a significant improvement for us in utilization. We don\u2019t share a specific utilization percentage rates but it's fair to say that we were extremely busy internally in our fabs. And on the balance between now that we have the LTC operation in consolidated, we\u2019re about 50-50 split between what we do in-house and what we give to third party or our channel partners.","Operator","Our final question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.","Gabriel Ho","This is Gabriel Ho calling in for Ambrish. Thanks for filling me in. So I am just looking at the core ADI businesses up 14% year-over-year and then your linear is up 5%. So what is driving the differences in year-to-year performance and also going forward how should we think about maybe to business to come work as you integrate the two businesses?","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","So I would say a few things. First, LTC\u2019s industrial business grew double-digit year-over-year, so that' very much in line with how the peers are doing. The automotive business, Vince, has already spoken to the inventory unwind and what's happening there. So overall, we're comfortable with where LTC is. I think, historically, an investor pain point for LTC has been, their focus on managing the business for gross margins versus a balanced revenue growth and that is part of what the integration process is driving and bringing them into ADI\u2019s mindset about profitable growth to deliver the EBIT margins and the free cash flow. So as we look forward, I think that's very much into what we look to merge with the organization is to bring that top line focus into LTC, which for some of the organization hasn\u2019t been as strong as an ADI.","Gabriel Ho","And as a follow-up, I think now that the two businesses are combined, I think setting the 13-14 week quarter aside. So how should we think about in general the seasonality of your business for each quarter on a quarterly basis, going forward?","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","I think the way to think about it is that the ADI and Linear Tech B2B markets actually behaved quite similarly on a seasonal basis. What I would encourage you to do is we placed a schedule on our website that tracks the end market revenue by quarter for the combined companies. And so just that you can go back and calculate what you think seasonality would be, because going forward, it's our sense that these two businesses certainly in the B2B markets track actually pretty similarly.","So I hope that was helpful. Thank you again for joining us this morning for the call. A copy of this transcript will be available on our website. And all the reconciliations and additional information can be found on the quarterly result section of our Investor Relations site at investor.analog.com. So with that, thank you for joining us and have a happy Thanksgiving everybody.","Operator","This concludes today's Analog Devices' conference call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the opening remarks, there will be a question and answer period. Please limit yourself to one question to ensure that management has adequate time to speak to everyone. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Ali Husain, Treasurer and Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Ali Husain","All right, Great, thanks Jennifer, and it feels good to say good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining ADI\u2019s fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 earnings conference call. You can find our press release and relating financial schedules on our Investor page at investor.analog.com.","As usual, this morning I am joined by ADI\u2019s CEO, Vincent Roche, and ADI\u2019s CFO David Zinsner. The agenda for this morning is as follows. First, we\u2019ll provide a brief overview of our fourth quarter and fiscal '15 results and then we\u2019ll provide a current thinking in our outlook for the first quarter of 2016 and finally events will capstone the prepared remarks following which we\u2019ll open up the lines for Q&A.","So before we start, let\u2019s get through the important disclosures we have to make every quarter. Please note the information we are about to discuss including our objectives and outlook includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.","Our comments today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which we have reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in today's earnings release, which we have posted on our IR page at investor.analog.com. So, let's get started.","As you've likely seen from the press release, ADI had another very strong quarter. Revenue in the fourth quarter totaled $979 million increasing 13% sequentially and 20% year-over-year. These results were above the high end of our guidance range primarily due to strength in portable consumer devices and to a lesser extent from some recovery in the wireless communications infrastructure market.","For our just completed fiscal 2015 revenue totaled $3.4 billion with industrial applications representing the largest portion at $1.5 billion or 44% of sales. The balance of revenue for the year was about evenly distributed across consumer, communications and automotive applications.","So during the fourth quarter, continued strength in consumer portable devices resulted in $317 million of consumer revenue which was a sequential increase of 53%. Here, our precision technology platforms are being leveraged to deliver highly innovative user experiences and are driving very strong ROI for ADI\u2019s R&D investment.","Revenue from communications infrastructure customers represented 16% of revenue and increased 12% sequentially in the fourth quarter which was ahead of expectations. Wireline applications decreased sequentially while the combination of inventory replenishment and improving wireless CapEx spend drove our strong wireless infrastructure sequential revenue performance as customers continue to deploy our highly innovative microwave and RF solutions.","Now despite this near term rebound, wireless base station deployments are well below prior peaks and I\u2019d say the same is true for ADI\u2019s wireless infrastructure sales. During the fourth quarter, our broad and highly diversified industrial end market decreased 4% sequentially which was in line with seasonal patterns. All of the industrial sub segments within the industrial business declined sequentially with the exception of aerospace and defense which was stable to the prior quarter. Now as you know the industrial market is our most diverse customer base, it spans many different sub segments, it requires a highest performance technology, as you well know it also supports very long life cycles and earns above corporate average gross margins.","During the fourth quarter our automotive business at 14% of sales performed in line with expectations and was stable to the prior quarter, while near term demand we believe is being impacted by lower than anticipated sales of premium vehicles in China, premium automotive suppliers continue to incorporate ADI\u2019s high performance technologies and applications such as radar based advanced driver assistance systems and powertrain efficiency systems which grew 33% and 10% respectively during the fiscal year \u201815.","Automotive revenue for the year totaled $526 million growing at 9% revenue CAGR over the past five years which is in fact three times the rate of vehicle unit growth over this period. So in total, ADI\u2019s fiscal \u201915 revenue increased 20% from the prior year and totaled $3.4 billion.","So now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Dave for details of our financial performance in the fourth quarter and in fiscal \u201915; with the exception of revenue and other expense Dave\u2019s comments in fourth quarter and fiscal \u201915, P&L line items, free cash flow and free cash flow margin will exclude special items which in the aggregate totaled $243 million for the quarter and $335 million respectively for the year when comparing our fourth quarter and full year performance to our historical performance special items are also excluded from prior quarter and year-over-year results and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their comparable GAAP measures are included on Schedule E and Schedule F in today's earnings release.","So with that Dave, I\u2019ll turn it over to you.","David Zinsner","Thanks, Ali. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. The fourth quarter was once again a very strong and profitable quarter for ADI and we set records for quarterly revenue, earnings per share and cash flow generation.","Revenue this quarter increased to a record $979 million and diluted earnings per share was $1.03, with both results above the high end of our guidance. Gross margin this quarter were 65.7% which was in line with our guidance and down 40 basis points from the prior quarter primarily due to mix.","Days of Inventory in the fourth quarter decreased to 114 days from the prior quarter\u2019s 128 days primarily on higher revenue and dollars of inventory decreased $12 million over the prior quarter.","Weeks of inventory and distribution were approximately 7.5 weeks which was consistent with the prior quarter. Total end customer orders decreased in the fourth quarter as compared to the third which is quite typical in advance of a seasonally slow first quarter and our book-to-bill was below one.","Operating expenses in the fourth quarter increased 6% sequentially, lagging well behind the 13% sequential increase in revenue as we continue to manage operating costs very tightly, allowing us to gain more operating leverage in our model. As a percent of sales, operating expenses in the fourth quarter declined over 200 basis points compared to the prior quarter and declined over 300 basis points compared to the same period a year ago.","Operating profits before tax increased to $351 million or 35.9% of sales which is 170 basis points higher compared to the prior quarter and 270 basis points higher than the same quarter in the prior year.","Other expense in the fourth quarter was approximately $4 million and represented the net interest expense on our debt. Our annual tax rate was lower than the rate we had anticipated at the end of our third quarter, as a result we trued up our tax rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 which had the effect of increasing the fourth quarter EPS by $0.10 per share.","Even when excluding the positive impact from the tax adjustments diluted earnings per share grew 21% sequentially on the 13% increase in revenue and were again above the high end of our guidance.","Cash flow in the fourth quarter was very strong excluding a special payment associated with the conversion of our Irish pension plan, ADI generated $422 million or 43% of sales and operating cash flow and CapEx was $46 million resulting in free cash flow up $376 million or 38% of revenue.","Fiscal year \u201915 capital spending was $154 million and our plan for 2016 is for capital spending to be between $140 million and $160 million. At the end of the fourth quarter our cash and short term investment balance was $3 billion with approximately $700 million available domestically. We had approximately $870 million in debt outstanding which resulted in a net cash position of $2.1 billion.","During the quarter we returned $237 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, which included higher share buyback activity of $112 million as our buyback program responded to the volatility in our stock price.","On November 23, 2015 our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.40 per outstanding share of common stock. This dividend will be paid on December 15 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on December 4.","Now let me take a moment to talk about our performance in 2015. Revenues of $3.4 billion increased 20% over the prior year and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 33% to $3.17. Our cash flow generation was strong during the year, excluding the previously mentioned Irish pension plan, operating cash flow were 33% of sales or over $1 billion and free cash flow was 29% of sales or $978 million for the year.","During the year, we returned $718 million to shareholder in dividends and share repurchases. We also increased our dividend by 8% in fiscal 2015 which was our 12th dividend increase in the last 11 years.","All told, ADI had a very good fourth quarter and fiscal 2015. Our financial model, converted top line growth and a very strong earnings growth and we continued to generate strong cash flows while enhancing shareholder returns.","So now to our outlook for the first quarter, which with the exception of revenue expectations is on a non-GAAP basis and excludes special items that are outlined in today\u2019s release. Our current expectations for the first quarter of 2016 is for revenue to be in a range of $805 million to $855 million which would represent a sequential revenue decline of approximately 18% to 13%. It is important to note that excluding consumer ADI revenues at the midpoint of this range are expected to decline sequentially at a mid-single digit rate which is in line with seasonal trends.","The most significant sequential revenue decrease is expected to be in our consumer business which is seasonally down in the first quarter but will likely exhibit more pronounced seasonality after a very strong fourth quarter in which it grew 53% sequentially.","In the industrial and automotive markets we also believe that seasonal trends will largely prevail. Our communications infrastructure business is expected to remain relatively stable to fourth quarter levels ahead of seasonal patterns on a continuation of the modest but steady recovery in this market.","The midpoint of our guidance range represents an increase of 8% year-over-year and would mark the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue increases for ADI which will be quite a good achievement.","Given our plan for lower sequential revenue and as it typical in our first fiscal quarter we are reducing production levels in the first quarter to approximately 68% from their current mid 70% level. As a result, we expect first quarter 2016 gross margins to be approximately 64.5%.","By remaining disciplined on our production levels, we believe inventories will be well positioned to support strong leverage once we resume sequential revenue growth. We expect operating expenses in the first quarter to be between $274 million and $279 million which would represent a sequential decline of approximately 6%. We are planning for a tax rate to be approximately 14% in the first quarter which is also our planned non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal 2016.","In total, excluding special items we expect diluted earnings per share in the first quarter to be between $0.65 and $0.73. At the midpoint of this range, diluted earnings per share are expected to grow 10% year-over-year and this would represent the 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings per share growth for ADI which would also be a very good result. We believe that our financial results are a good proof point that our strategy to focus on sustainable innovation across diverse applications and markets is working.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Vince.","Vincent Roche","Thank you Dave and good morning everyone. As Dave and Ali have highlighted, fiscal \u201915 was a very good year for ADI in terms of our financial performance. Our strategy which emphasizes technology innovation and platform reuse across a diversity of applications proved itself once again.","Thus even though on certain macro economy impacted industrial and automotive and cyclical headwinds reduced communications infrastructure sales, these were more than offset by significant uptake of our signal processing technology and portable consumer devices. It was also an excellent year in terms of key accomplishments. In 2015, we successfully integrated Hittite and expanded available opportunities that we believe will deliver strong revenue synergies starting in 2017.","Our integration teams and processors are finely tuned and have successfully achieved our 2015 cost synergy targets which are expected to accelerate further in 2016. During the year, we continued to align our investments to critical strategic priorities streamlining our management structure while making investments to support our future growth.","But as we take stock at the end of this fiscal year, I think it\u2019s important to look at our past performance over a longer period and provide investors some context on where we have come from and where we want to take our company.","Over the last three years despite an uneven macro economic backdrop we have grown our revenue at an 8% annualized growth rate and we have converted this top line growth into 14% diluted earnings per share growth. We\u2019ve also been committed to returning cash to our investors over the last three years we have grown our dividend at a 10% annualized rate while returning $2 billion to shareholders in dividends and share buybacks and our annualized TSR over this period is 16% which is in fact higher than the S&P 500 return over this period.","As Dave mentioned, ADI\u2019s FY\u201915 diluted earnings per share were $3.17 and it is our goal to increase our non-GAAP earnings per share to up to $5 by fiscal 2020. And I think this is also an opportune time to point out that as we stand today we are in fact ahead of this schedule in reaching this goal.","We\u2019ve also invested and continue to invest in future growth opportunities. Over the past three years we\u2019ve invested over $4 billion in future growth initiatives through R&D, M&A and capital additions. These are significant investments that we believe have been made at the right time in our company\u2019s history and hold us in good stead for the coming opportunities that we believe will drive our future growth.","Over our first 50 years we have created a tremendous market share position in the foundational technologies that form virtual bridges between the physical and digital worlds. When customers need to reliably sense, measure interpret and connect physical, chemical and biological phenomenon to computational demand, ADI has become their go to supplier. It is our view that as the world becomes increasingly connected our machines become more autonomous, the demand for more and more virtual bridges is quite likely to increase, and this trend clearly plays to our core capabilities.","In our terminology, we believe that the information and communications technology sector has entered its third wave. The first two waves were dominated by big iron, personal computing, mobility and connectivity. Various monitors were being applied to the third wave such as the internet of things, industrial 4.0 and so on. Whatever it\u2019s called, it\u2019s going to be above the pervasive use of artificial sensory and computing power for people and machines to see, to hear, to feel and so on throughout the physical space.","As this third wave begins to take shape, it is creating growth opportunities for ADI that we expect will be beyond those achieved in the prior two waves. ADI\u2019s 50 years of signal processing leadership is at the center of this third wave with the combination of the cloud and big data we can enable our real time understanding of what\u2019s going on in our world so that we can act, react and predict in high value applications in areas such as healthcare, industrial and automotive applications for example.","In fact existing and new customers are inviting ADI to help them to build even more virtual bridges to enable them to unlock the latent value and create potential new revenue streams. For example, many of our industrial customers who in the past may have worked with us to control the most valuable engines and industrial machines are today looking to massively instrument those very same machines and capture the value created by the data they generate. The value of the information generated in fact has the potential to become even greater than the value of the actual thing it is connected to. And this is very exciting for our customers and in turn it\u2019s also very exciting for us here at ADI.","We are the acknowledged market leader in convertors and amplifiers, two of the most critical technologies that bridge the physical and digital worlds and we\u2019ve also focused significant technical talent over many years and the development of ultra low power sensors and micro controllers that are optimized for reliable power efficient IoT solutions. Equally as important, our recent acquisition of Hittite means that ADI also possesses the full range of connectivity solutions necessary to transmit data to the cloud for analysis of trends and patterns and then back to the node to be acted upon.","We\u2019ve made steady progress this year in applying our silicon technology and algorithm heritage and strengths in deep domain at applications knowledge of the physical edge to create complete sensor to cloud solutions that are efficient, secure and reliable. This creates the possibility for ADI to not only create, but also to capture additional value as we move more deeply into the information spectrum.","We will continue to build momentum in these novel growth applications in the years ahead while ensuring that we continue to strengthen our technologies and customer engagements in our core business. At ADI we are very excited about applying our expertise to create solutions that solve the most important problems leading to smarter cities, smarter buildings and factories as well as transforming healthcare and ultimately people\u2019s lives.","Now these are just some of the many applications with which we are helping our customers. Our customers are increasingly involving ADI early in their innovation conversations and leveraging our capabilities to architect solutions to these varied soft challenges. As the third wave takes root we expect that growth from these high performing solutions will drive future revenue and profit growth for ADI.","So before I finish, I would just like to reiterate our often spoken strategic objectives. Firstly, we believe that innovation drives business success, we focus on sizeable markets that value the performance we deliver in high value areas at the intersection of the physical and digital worlds. Secondly, we believe in diversity of markets, applications and customers. We place many modest new product beds in carefully chosen applications and engage directly with the customers that represent a very large part of our served available markets. Diversity ensures sustainability and resilience and this has been proven by our ability to successfully navigate the extraordinary transitions in the semiconductor industry over the past 50 years.","Thirdly, innovation and diversity enable ADI to build wide and sustainable economic modes that enhance shareholder value. And of course this is all made possible by the talent, the ingenuity and passion of our global workforce to continuously raise the standards and technology, customer engagement, supply chain and myriad other areas in a business as complex as ours. As the markets we serve move closer to ADI, I firmly believe our best days lie ahead of us. Thank you.","Ali Husain","Great. Thanks, Vince. For those listeners interested in learning more about ADI in the IoT space, we recently webcast a 45 minute presentation that actually goes in this topic in much greater detail you can find all that information on our IR page.","So let\u2019s talk quickly about how we run the Q&A session. I\u2019m going to ask that you limit yourself to one question. We're going to run the call until 11:00, so after you ask your primary question and if you still want to ask a follow on, you should re-queue. And as we say each quarter we run the call in this format in the spirit of fairness, so that all callers will get a chance to ask at least one of their questions.","So with that, operator, let's go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura Securities.","Romit Shah","Yes, thank you. Dave, just historically April has been one of your better periods in the year I think on average probably up mid to high single digits. But now that consumer is such a more significant portion of the business, how do you think about seasonality in the April period?","David Zinsner","Thanks, Romit. I think you are right in that obviously when we are more concentrated in industrial we would have seen a much bigger ramp seasonally in the second quarter, which we expect to see that seasonality in the second quarter for industrial. But consumer now is a larger portion of our revenue is a bit of a wild card. I think that that quarter is generally seasonally down a little bit, obviously we don\u2019t have any visibility into the quarter yet but that would mute a little bit the sequential increase that you would typically see in the second quarter. But as you know this is semiconductor business and you never really know how things will pan out until you are really up on top of that quarter and can make a better determination.","Romit Shah","Okay. Thank you.","David Zinsner","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Danely with Citigroup.","Chris Danely","Guys, nice quarter, I guess you can go tell Tom Brady to eat your heart out. So if we look at what happened in October and January a little more of revenue volatility than historical at ADI, so I guess to continue on Romit\u2019s question, how do we think about seasonality in 2016 and with that $980 million of quarterly revenue bogey what gives you confidence you guys can exceed $980 in either of the July or the October quarter in 2016 maybe just talk about this visibility on the consumer front?","David Zinsner","Yes, I mean this, we\u2019ll have obviously a larger consumer business; generally the second half of the year is much stronger than the first half of the year or at least from a fiscal year basis for us, given that that\u2019s generally when new product launches happen, Christmas builds happen and so forth. So that will definitely change the seasonality a bit for the overall company. My guess is that typical seasonality for ADI is going to be relatively similar sequential increases every quarter for different reasons. Obviously the second quarter will be, would be more of an industrial story, the third and fourth quarter are likely to be more of a consumer story. And what was your other question Chris, missed it.","Chris Danely","Just to talk about visibility on the consumer front. How you feel about maintaining market share there in the second half of the year as to exceed $980 million in revenue?","David Zinsner","Well again we have real confidence in revenue when we actually have orders and we have orders usually out about through the following quarter. So it\u2019s difficult for me to say what\u2019s going to happen over the next few quarters. But, I would say our position with all of our large customers is very strong and we expect to have a strong position with all of those customers out for the distant future.","Chris Danely","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer","Hey congratulations on the strong results for the fiscal year. I guess another question on the consumer side. If you look at the revenue ramp over the last several quarters, the vast majority of that\u2019s been driven by Force Touch; you guys are relatively new supplier for a new application that the customer feels is important enough that they actually highlighted in kind of their advertisings and we know there\u2019s been some yield issues on the module away from you.","And if kind of try to dig back into your sort of revenue coming from Force Touch and try to equate that to a unit number for your customer, it does appear that you are over shipping, so David wondering if you could help us understand when you look at the January quarter, do you think you are over shipping to your customer right now and when you look at the guidance for consumer in the January quarter, do you get most of that back in January so you feel more comfortable that you are not over shipping the demand right now?","David Zinsner","Let me start by saying that obviously we don\u2019t talk about individual products and individual customers. Our customers don\u2019t appreciate that and it\u2019s really up to them to start talking about what their end markets are doing and their applications are doing. But I\u2019ll talk specifically about our consumer business, clearly the first, the back half of this year had a very good ramp. And that was driven not by one single product and quite honestly not by one single customer. We did announce in our 10-K we had a 13% customer for the year, so obviously, and that\u2019s unique, so obviously we did have one customer that did quite well but there were a lot of things that did very well for us in the consumer business in the back half of the year.","So that\u2019s one thing I think everyone should keep in mind. Clearly when you have a big ramp like we did in the fourth quarter and we telegraph a decent sequential decline in the first quarter that would indicate something is going on and I think it\u2019s safe to assume that there probably was inventory that built in the fourth quarter for reasons that are specific to those customers and how they want to manage their supply chains and so forth. But I don\u2019t think it was anything out of the ordinary, that\u2019s I think it\u2019s relatively typical for how those customers manage their inventory.","And as is the first quarter decline, which I think starts to digest that inventory. I don't know how long it takes for that whole thing to kind of smooth out; a consumer of this size, particularly driven off of portables is a bit different for us than we have historically had a position in. So we'll have to kind of see how it goes, but my guess is that it picks back up in the third and fourth quarter and does quite well and all of that stuff will make sense to all of you guys that try to back into in end consumption and so forth.","John Pitzer","Helpful, guys. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.","Craig Ellis","Thanks for taking the question, guys, and congratulations on the strong results. Dave, on the gross margin outlook with the sequential decrease, can you just frame up some of the gives and takes because it would seem like mix would be a tailwind to gross margin, but volume looks like a headwind. What was utilization in the quarter, and where do you think it is in the outlook? And what does your ability to control inventory mean for the gross margin trajectory as we look out to the April quarter and beyond? Thank you.","David Zinsner","Yes. So, I think, I talked about utilization within \u2013 help me out Ali, what it was?","Ali Husain","Utilization was in mid 70s, we're bringing it down to about 60% in the first quarter.","David Zinsner","Right. So, that obviously will drive most of the gross margin decline. There is a bit of a mix also as you point out that is driving a little bit of the gross margin. I would say that the mix decline fourth quarter or first quarter has a little bit more to do with -- believe or not mix, within the industrial space, not mix within our broader business categories. And so that's what will drive the gross margins. After that obviously we'd expect to be bringing back our utilization. Hopefully seasonally we see a strong industrial ramp in the second quarter and that would certainly drive better volume within the factories and should get the gross margin back up to the levels that we see today.","Ali Husain","Our industrial business today Craig is about 10 odd percent off of its revenue peaks that we achieved back in sort of the third quarter of 2014. So, I think our goal here is to really get the inventories in good shape, which we're trying to do here in the first quarter with pretty low utilization rates, precisely for that reason to get inventories in good shape for what we hope will be sort of a seasonal second quarter, obviously it\u2019s too early to call that at this stage. But if we do see sort of seasonality in the second quarter than industrial generally does better and we should see some pretty good gross margins and drop through the earnings, so hope that answered the question and let's get to the next caller.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel.","Tore Svanberg","Yes. Thank you. Great results. So, your backlog is up 16%, is there anything I can read into that number and I'm thinking especially since your backlog is obviously for several months further out. If you sort of take the consumer out of the equation, does that number sort of signal that your industrial and communications business is strengthening?","David Zinsner","Well, I think, most of it is, I think at the midpoint of our guidance we're looking at 8% year-over-year, because if I'm not mistaken the backlog that you're talking about Tore, in the 10-K is a comparison of backlog coming into last year versus backlog coming into this year and we are predicting revenue to be up 8%. So it\u2019s not surprising that backlog would be up.","The other thing is, I think in some cases the consumer business which will be up year-over-year probably pretty meaningfully gives us a little bit more visibility than some of the other markets. And so, from a mix perspective that actually helps on visibility in terms of backlog, but it really isn't extending the visibility at all. It still all shippable within the quarter and for the most part and really doesn't influence how we would think that the second quarter would pan out?","Vincent Roche","And let me just, Tore, give you little bit of color, you mentioned specifically industrial and communications infrastructure, so let me just give you a little bit of color around the bookings in the quarter. For industrial we saw August quite weak as it generally is seasonally in that month. September was actually quite stable which is bit of anomaly really in the industrial business, generally speaking September comes back quite nicely. This time around it was actually quite stable to August levels. And I think if you remember back there were some pretty screaming macro headlines at that point in time.","Interestingly, then the October month actually was quite strong for the industrial business. And November seems to have leveled off here little bit. And I think we're feeling pretty good about the environment generally thinking about a pretty seasonal sort of environment for the first quarter for industrial.","We haven't mentioned yet, but the weeks of inventory and distribution were 7.5 weeks consistent with the prior quarter. Our deferred gross revenue balance which is a pretty proxy for inventory in the channel of revenue, dollars was down 2% in the quarter. So, I think it's all sort of hanging together there as far as we can tell here for the next quarter and that's definitely in our guidance.","On the communications infrastructure side, it was up 12% sequentially this quarter in terms of revenue. Wireline was down somewhat. So the implication there is that wireless actually did better than the 12% which is in fact did. I think most of that we told you last quarter that we felt like we're under shipping and demand in that space, I think a lot of that this quarter in terms of revenue performance was a result of inventory coming back in line within demand, you're starting to see some good base station deployment activity there, although still it\u2019s obviously early to call.","But in terms of the order flows in comps during the quarter, we actually saw better order flow every month of the quarter in the comp space. So, that's where we're at. I hope that answered the question and let's get to our next callers.","Tore Svanberg","Very helpful. Thank you.","David Zinsner","Great.","Operator","Our next question is from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Craig Hettenbach","Yes. Thanks. I just wanted to discuss your approach to capital allocation. If I look at, you've had a healthy mix, certainly focus on dividend increases, the Hittite opportunistic M&A. On the M&A front and especially as the industry consolidates, just how you approach that relative to the return of cash and any type of metrics you're most focused on?","David Zinsner","Thanks, Craig. Yes. So obviously we are focused on the dividend. We mentioned it in the prepared remarks that we would like to see that continually increased. I think we had 12 increases in the last 11 years, so we'd like to keep on that pace. We do opportunistic buybacks. We think some of our shareholders do favor the buyback or at least appreciate the buyback. And so we have maintained relatively consistent approach. It does tend to buyback more when the stock is weaker which I think provides a good return on investment for the shareholders.","And then lastly, as you point out, Craig, we do have an M&A approach. We have a very high bar in terms of M&A. We don't \u2013 we certainly don't look our bank that's kick the tires on a lot of deals. We pick ones that are very high quality. It really starts with companies that have a high degree of innovation and where that innovation is I guess complementary to our own technology with our existing customer base. So, we will do deals from time to time. They generally will be in the Hittite kind of size range or probably lower, in some cases we're actively looking at things.","When you tend to look at businesses that do have a high degree of innovation, it usually comes with really good gross margins, very good operating margins, very good return on R&D investments and so forth, so I think from a financial perspective those are somewhat of the outputs as opposed to the inputs, but they do \u2013 those do tend to go hand in glove with really innovative companies.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. Thanks for the color, Dave.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC.","Amit Daryanani","Thanks a lot for taking my question, guys. I guess one of the biggest things that people tend to talk about you guys recently was just the concentration issue with your largest customer at this point? So maybe if you could just talk about the solutions or the products you have with your largest customer, the potential to expand that into other solutions, into other Vectors be that consumer out in different sectors. And would you have to look at M&A as a way to diversify concentration?","Vincent Roche","Well, actually, we've never been more diversified as a company. We have more products in the portfolio than we've ever had. We address more customers than we've ever addressed. There actually is a company in very, very good position on that front. With regards to the consumer markets in general we have very strong leverage from our core technology platforms. In the consumer business it tends to be more of a precision oriented product development effort, and so we get very strong leverage, for example, from our industrial product base which tends to be precision oriented inherently. So, we're looking always for areas. Innovation comes first for us. We build the core technologies. We platformize the technology. Bring it to as many applications as we possibly can. And in the consumer area we're picking up the very, very highest level of challenges that we can possibly address and we believe those problems are sustainable over time.","Of course, time will tell whether that's well founded or not. But we believe we are in a very, very good position. And as Dave mentioned earlier, even within each customer we look for diversification of applications and products and technology and that is the case everywhere we're playing in the consumer area as well.","David Zinsner","And I'd just add on the M&A front, we don't drive our M&A off of kind of a diversification approach, because we're concentrated with one customer. We do pick usually companies that have a lot of diversity and by virtue of that we do get a lot of diversity. But our first and foremost objective is to find really great technology that complements our existing technology.","Amit Daryanani","Perfect. Thanks and congrats on the quarter, guys.","David Zinsner","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial.","Chris Caso","Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Question on the comp space and follow-up on some of your comments there, I guess particularly within the wireless part of that space do you think the excess inventory within that space has been digested at this point, so that going forward the growth in that segment should be propositional to the growth of base station deployments and obviously understand those base station deployments are well below their prior peak?","David A. Zinsner","Yes, Chris, thank for the question. Obviously, never say never, right, I mean, it\u2019s a lumpy market for reason. But our sense when we look at the order flows, when we talk to our customers is that, that period of time where the inventories were massively drawn down is behind us, so obviously we can't speak for other companies and other suppliers, but what we can tell for our products, what we're shipping into the space at the current moment is pretty well balanced within demand in this space.","And frankly, when we look at the order flows and we're thinking about the guidance for the first quarter, generally speaking the first quarter is down in sort of high single digit sequentially for the comp space. And this time if you back into the guidance that were implying it will be fairly stable. So, if you look at the regional perspective, North America has been pretty stable. China now has started to deploy TDNFD [ph], again it's slow, but it has started and so we saw some impact and some good benefit for that in our quarter.","And if you look at emerging regions they continue to deploy. We had particularly good quarter, in India this quarter for example, so I think things are moving. I think they are slow and steady, but at least they're going into right direction.","Chris Caso","Thank you.","David Zinsner","Sure.","Operator","Our next question is from William Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein","Thanks for taking my question. Vince, you highlighted what sounds like what could be sort of virtual cycle between your comp infrastructure and market on one hand and the other three end markets. And I guess it\u2019s sort of raises a question as to which of these you expect to grow fastest as you enter this environment or this thing you describe just sort of the third wave. And I also wonder whether consolidation plays into that thinking and whether M&A sort of plays into the thinking of where to position relative to that virtual cycle of data development?","Vincent Roche","Yes, great question. So, we have a long-term model. For growth, we believe that the markets that we can \u2013 if you like leverage most in terms of driving growth at the upper end of our two to three times GDP model, the automotive and communications infrastructure areas, and I still believe that's to be true. We put out some targets last year at the Analyst Day. And I think those targets are still valid there. Obviously consumer is going to be at the upper end of that as well. I think if we can over the long term, we have certainly for the last three years we've been able drive our industrial business at a couple of times GDP level. We'd been very, very good stead well into the future. And what I've given you in terms of those targets is really about what we do organically rather than whether we have to buy more heft. As Dave has indicated we're always going around looking for technologies that make more of an impact to the overall solution that we deliver to our customers and we're taking more of strategic view rather than a financial view or an operating view of M&A, so it's more about finding those bolts in technologies that make ADI more relevant. Make our technology and product offering more powerful in the eyes of the customer. But generally speaking I think we are in a very, very good position to originally take care of our future.","William Stein","Thank you.","Vincent Roche","Thanks, Will. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Wong with Wells Fargo.","David Wong","Thanks very much. When we look at your industrial and communications segments and year-over-year comparisons, do you recon these numbers reflect the end market or they suppressed by any rationalization of product lines or customer action following the Hittite acquisition?","David Zinsner","Well, obviously in the first quarter of 2015 we had Hittite, so there really \u2013 it\u2019s a direct comparison. I guess I do \u2013 in the communications business we are certainly operating at what is a lower level than what we think is the normal build out of base stations on a year on year basis. So it's impacted by the reduction in spending in wireless infrastructure in a couple of different markets. Granted it\u2019s recovered from its trough, but it\u2019s not certainly at what would be considered normalized levels.","I think in the industrial business, it was a relatively on a year-over-year basis, a relatively modest increase, but kind of within what GDP like growth rate has been. So I would say that's probably reflects kind of normal end demand in those end market.","Vincent Roche","Yes, I will say \u2013 I'll just add a little more color. We had a record with regard to the Hittite portfolio in the quarter just gone, and given our relatively depressed communications market, though there was some recovery, what I've been most pleased with that is the diversity of the applications as we're able to target outside of the communications infrastructure business with that portfolio.","David Wong","Great. Thanks.","David Zinsner","Thanks, David.","Operator","Our next question is from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","Hi, good morning. Thanks and congratulations on the solid quarterly execution. I think Ali said in the prepared remarks that the auto CAGR has been growing about 9% over the past few years, pretty solid performance. That's decelerated a bit kind of flat growth here in fiscal 2015, looks like given the guidance around Q1 that's probably going to be flat year-over-year?","The team has talked about a better design win pipeline in terms of dollar constant capture in 2016 within the automotive segment. So I guess the question is that the team still relatively confident about the potential for reacceleration in automotive. And then, which sub segments that you're going to see more of the growth, is it in power train and safety, are you going to see some growth in infotainment as well? Thank you.","Vincent Roche","Yes. Good question. So, we had a lot of enquiries over the last couple of quarters about our performance specifically in the automotive sector. And what I'll tell you is that it's really a tale of two businesses during 2015, it was relatively flat quarter. And when you extract, I think I've mentioned before to you that our MEMS safety business has had some, no pun intended some speed bumps along the way here. And \u2013 but our automotive business with the exception of MEMS safety actually grew in the high single digits year-over-year.","Primarily in the areas like advanced driver assistance, the predictive safety side of the business has grown at a stellar pace for the company over the last two or five years. I believe that will be the case into the future. And the power train, specifically the sensing part of that business and the battery monitoring control has done well and will continue to do well.","Infotainment is very diversified area and we tend to target the high end of that business with our digital signal processing and our data acquisition technology and algorithmic technologies. We've new technology called A to B which is method of moving sound through the car essentially, speech and sound in a way that is very efficient, very, very low latency, very low weight in terms of the wiring cables and so on. We've a lot of new sensing technology coming into play, an area like AMR for example where we are developing a leadership position, which will be a whole new category in that business in the future as cars electrify and become more automated.","So, I think what you're going to expect in the automotive business during this coming physical year is that the first half will be within seasonal pattern of the current business level, but the second half I do expect to pick up in the growth of the overall business at the higher end of the growth model which is three times GDP kind of level. So, we're confident given the alignment between the products we have and customer programs that we've got. And it's an area where we have been intensively investing and increasing the investments over the past five years. So, I think we'll return to a growth pattern towards the backend of 60 [ph] and beyond. So that's my sense based on everything that I know at this point in time.","David Wong","Great. Thank you very much for the insights.","Vincent Roche","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya","Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on good results and execution.","Vincent Roche","Thank you.","Vivek Arya","I just wanted to clarify on this overbuild versus under build in consumer so we don't blow it out of proportion. So, Dave on Q4, you mentioned some slight overbuild, is it possible to quantify that? In Q1 I assume that is perhaps some under build. So as you emerged from Q1 are you going to emerge with some signs of shipping into actual demand? And I know it's probably a little early but how does rough visibility look like for Q2? Thank you.","David Zinsner","We got little visibility into Q2 and it would be premature for me to even mention which direction it would even go. Yes, I don't want to and I think you actually point out a good point. I don't want to over emphasize build. Most of that we believe, most of the shipment were consumed, but when you have a fourth quarter to first quarter transition like we're talking about we have to believe that there is some kind of digestion that happen for a little bit of it, which drives us to believe that on a sequential basis consumers is going to be down and that's why we're guiding to where we're guiding and it will probably be down more than the corporate average.","Outside of that, I can't give any more visibility, obviously there's a lot of moving pieces within the consumer business. I'm trying to identify every application and every customer is going into and figuring out what they're all doing is next to impossible for us, we get the orders as we ship them and we leave it them to figure out what to do beyond that.","Vincent Roche","It\u2019s probably good time to just emphasize that despite all of sort of near term noise that year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter the midpoint would be 8% with double digit EPS growth, so thanks for the question, with that we'll get to our next caller.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Smigie with Raymond James.","Steve Smigie","Thanks a lot, guys. Just quick follow-up on the out performance in the quarter, I think you mentioned that it was due to multiple products there in consumer, obviously there's been some discussions with Force Touch. Can you talk about what parts other than Force Touch were parts of the out performance in the quarter?","David Zinsner","I'm not even saying that was a reason of the out performance in the quarter. All I can say Steve is we have many customers within our consumer business. We have lots of customers running portable size of the business and we have a lot of different products that go into those applications. So\u2026","Vincent Roche","Yes. It could be since we again, the product we ship into these applications tend to be precision oriented in areas like sensing. In audio and also in the areas of image processing, so there kind of a three category you should think about when you think of ADI's position within these portable consumer application.","Steve Smigie","Okay, great. Thank you.","Ali Husain","Thanks, Steve. This is Ali Husain. We're three minute short of the hour. I think we're going to keep going with the questions, but I think the time is probably over for those who have re-queued unfortunately. So I think let's keep going to at least get everybody's first questions in. We'll get to our next caller.","Operator","Our next question is from C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.","C.J. Muse","Good morning, Thanks for squeezing me in. I guess overall looking for your kind of big picture macro view here, what are your thoughts in terms of where we are in the cycle. Where do you see pockets of health maybe pockets of weakness and there really speaking geographically and how all of that shapes up in terms of the recovery picture in the first half of 2016?","Vincent Roche","Yes. I'm not sure there is a cycle by the way anymore in the semiconductor industry. And I think lot of the consolidation somewhat ensure that as well. So, I think there is a decent match between supply and demand right at this point in time. Over the years we've all deploy methods to deal with the volatility and we've lot more transparency I think as well into areas of supply and demand. So, I think in some ways what you should be looking at for 2016 is probably what the macro economic climate does and we've started messaging our growth trajectory or the algorithm we have for growth as well on that basis, some multiple given the various markets that in which we play and what they're capable of delivering in terms of macro level growth and modulated by where we are with our products and technologies and our customers in these areas. So I'm not sure there is a particular cycle in our industry any more. And probably safer to look at what the macro environment does in the various regions.","Ali Husain","Thanks C.J. And let's get to our next caller.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tristan Gerra with Baird.","Tristan Gerra","Thank you. To follow-up on your commentary about automotive, what type of market share position do you think you can have in driver assist over the next couple of years and on the basis of your design wins and how big does it get as a percent of your automotive market?","Vincent Roche","Yes. It\u2019s a good question, Tristan. I -- off the top of my head I don't have the numbers, but the growth rate of our advanced driver assistance business has been one of the strongest and probably the strongest growth element by the way during 2015. It\u2019s a meaningful parts of ADI's overall automotive business node at this point in time. We have some very existing new technology build on some microwave technology that we build on our very advanced technology platform that we are about to \u2013 we'll be sampling over these coming years to our customers that will change the game in radar technologies.","And so, I think when you look at that business overall, certainly safety is going to continue to be a very important part given the mandates, everybody wants more safety, so and I think the capabilities that we have as a company as well in active, passive and combining those with predictive, puts us in quite a unique position actually to be able to look at the safety problem as a system of problems and tailor our solutions to those needs.","Tristan Gerra","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.","Ambrish Srivastava","Hi. Thank you. Dave, I had a question on CapEx guidance for the full year and also along those lines, free cash flow margin given that a higher ROI and higher operating margin business is going to be a bigger portion of the mix. Should we expect that free cash flow margin for fiscal 2016 should be higher? Thank you.","David Zinsner","Yes. We're certainly driving the free cash flow to be higher, that is our goal. And then, the portion of the CapEx, I mean, we're striving towards 4% or so CapEx as a percent of revenue, that's really our goal. I think we had a very good year in terms of free cash flow this year. I think we can do better next year with a lower CapEx as the percent of revenue to help drive that a little bit. And there are some things we did have to build inventory this year up for some rents that occurred in some last time builds related to Hittite. Those activities are behind us in terms of building inventories. And we should get I think a pretty favorable working capital number or 2016 which could help drive better free cash flow number for 2016 as well.","Ali Husain","Yes. And if I can just add quickly Ambrish, free cash flow for the year excluding the onetime pension payment was 29% of revenue. The model range is 28% to 32%. So I think we're within that range but certainly towards the lower end of the range. And within the quarter we generated ex that payment 38% of our sales in free cash flow which is actually very, very strong. And as you know we return 80% of everything we generate to shareholders either through dividend or buyback. So, thanks for the question and next caller.","Operator","Our next question comes from Harsh Kumar with Stephens.","Harsh Kumar","Results, great guidance \u2013 great results. Let me just ask quickly about wireless infrastructure, it's quite a bit off the peak that you guys hit I think in the January part of this year. You're talking about some pretty good trends happening right now as you see it in wireless infrastructure. What is your best view of how the environments looking as you get into the next year and maybe all through 2016 for comp?","Vincent Roche","Yes. As Ali said earlier on, it's from a geographical perspective North America was pretty flat. I think this story in terms of demand has been driven by China over the course of FY 2015; the government carrier investigations have had a huge impact on the deployment of infrastructure there. So, I think the pace will pick up and we've seen some pickup over the last quarter. Demand has solidified and strengthen. But I think during 2016 you will see a pickup in the FD deployments, FDD, TD and particularly in the area of with regard to China Mobile, small cell deployment in the second half of the year to densify the network and get more capacity.","And my sense is that 4G we've seen for example, in India over the past quarter, some deployments in an area of where the deployment of LTE is really, really, really low has a long way to go. I think it will be steady in America and probably grow marginally in Europe as carriers deploy more infrastructure there to catch the networks, so in a lot of places still 2.5G into 4G.","David Zinsner","Harsh, I think it\u2019s a question of when not if and I think we're very well position across all the carriers in all the regions. So, inventory look to be in good shape. The orders is hopefully will hold up. As you mentioned our comp business is well of its peaks, I think I look back into that 23% off of its recent revenue peak, so I think there is plenty more to go there and it\u2019s a question of when not if. So, thanks for the questions and we'll get to next.","Harsh Kumar","Great, guys.","Vincent Roche","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore","Thanks for sneaking me in and congratulations on the strong quarter. I had a question on the cash flow on the capital allocation side. You guys have done a great job returning cash, like you said about 95% of free cash flow in the last year. But that's come somewhat at the expense of domestic cash, which looks like it's down about 20%, 25% year-over-year. So I guess my question is, when you guys have the domestic versus offshore cash, how do you reconcile that with both your cash return to shareholders whether it's repurchase or dividend? And how does that impact your M&A strategy, if at all, acknowledging you were able to use offshore cash for Hittite?","Vincent Roche","It\u2019s a complicated web, no doubt about it. We \u2013 I think in general if we are returning 80% of our free cash flow back to shareholders, we don't generate at that level in the U.S. and obviously all of that has to come from U.S. cash flow. So, the U.S. entity definitely will be a borrower and that's why you \u2013 that's why we have $3 billion of cash and $875 million of debt today is because we lever up the U.S. balance sheet, but on a net basis we still have a net cash position worldwide. And I think that generally the approach.","There are situations in which national cash would be utilize and energy point out one of those would be for acquisitions. There's also a number of things that we could potentially do outside of the U.S. in terms of acquisitions that it\u2019s not a very complicated transaction to utilize that cash. So, we will use some of that cash obviously for M&A but to the extent we need U.S. cash we will use the bound leverage to get that.","Vincent Roche","Ross and we have overall liquidity domestically at $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion which obviously includes the revolver as well. But that gives us plenty of flexibility to do the things that we want to do here in the U.S. All right, thanks for the question, next caller please?","Operator","Our next question is from Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks so much for taking the question. This is Chris [ph] on for Blayne. And congrats on the strong quarter and guidance. It feels like it\u2019s been a dead horse here, but I just wanted to kind of drill in on the consumer business and if you could just talk a little about linearity over the last couple of quarters for the core business there you\u2019ve obviously had a big ramp in this wireless space but just the existing business outside of that big ramp, how has that trended over the past couple of quarters?","Vincent Roche","Yes I think let\u2019s just look at the last quarter here. Overall I\u2019d say orders excluding the consumer business in August were down from the prior quarter, they were slightly up in September and October was very strong as I mentioned earlier particularly in the industrial space coming off of a sort of a weaker September. So, now that\u2019s generally how it\u2019s trended and I think where we have given the guidance here for the first quarter based on what we are seeing in the order flows, so I think if you exclude the consumer business generally everything else is sort of trending seasonally here in the first quarter. So thanks for the question and we\u2019ll get to the next caller.","Operator","Our next question is from Doug Freedman with Stern Agee","Doug Freedman","Great. Thanks for taking my question, squeezing me in guys. Real quickly -- looking at gross margins, can you give us a sense to the range that we would see between the industrial consumer auto and comms groups? I know you mentioned that the industrial is contributing to a little bit of the headwind because it is soft in the guidance. But I would have thought the consumer being below average would also been a little bit of an offset, maybe if you could help me just magnify the range that we would see across the businesses so we have a better understanding going forward? Thanks.","Vincent Roche","Yes, I\u2019ll see if I can give you any color. The industrial business obviously is our highest gross margin business and is above both the corporate average. Communications is slightly above the corporate average. Consumer is slightly below the corporate average and automotive is slightly below the corporate average. So those are kind of the range. The only challenge in that gets that, there is also the dynamic of what gets made in the factory and so sometimes mix does play a part in kind of factory absorption and how many wafers we produce and so forth. So that\u2019s a complicating factor that drives a little bit of the gross margin.","But I would just tell you maybe stepping back from it, we had a very good year in terms of gross margins for 2015 we had 66%. We think that while focusing on innovation we generally will get very good gross margins in the future we\u2019ve got some things that we are looking at that we continue to execute on that help lower our cost and improve our pricing, but I think over the last few years our ASPs have been going up. So we think we have a very good opportunity to push those gross margins higher over the next few years.","Doug Freedman","Great. Thanks so much, congrats again.","Vincent Roche","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Ian Ing with MKM Partners","Ian Ing","Yes thanks, so obviously you are addressing a lot of opportunities here in convertors and amplifiers and you got good portfolios there but could you remind us of your view on power management is this area you would like to get into perhaps to leverage your scale and customer facing resources or is it not interesting at this moment?","Vincent Roche","Well power management as a technology for us we have good traction in areas like communications infrastructure but for us we are not trying to build a broad base catalogue of products. What we are doing is taking the capability that we have inside the company in terms of process, technology and in terms of circuit technology and applying that technology to build products that strengthen the overall signal chain particularly in more of kind of vertical applications where we can get the leverage in areas as I said like wireless communications infrastructure.","So that is the strategy for the company in power management and we\u2019ve made some very, very good progress there over the last three or four years as we have given up the goals in trying to build a broad catalogue and brand and power, but instead target it very, very carefully at the applications where the interplay of power technology and signal chain technology you know creates a virtual cycle here.","Ian Ing","Thanks Vincent.","Vincent Roche","Okay.","Operator","Our last call comes from Stephen Chin with UBS.","Stephen Chin","Hi guys, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask a follow up on automotive. You gave good color earlier on some of the secular trends there, but just from a geographic and maybe kind of is there a macro picture perspective. Was China the only area of weakness or was there any other geographies type of this showing softness in the quarter and just to that what\u2019s the potential for interest rates to increase in the coming quarters. Do you think the higher cost of lending impact auto sales as well?","Vincent Roche","Yes, I think we are not a room of economists here for sure, but let us at least tell you what our thinking is Stephen. So in the quarter, the business trended really as we expected frankly. It was up 1% sequentially. All the three sub segments of automotive were essentially inline and pretty stable during the quarter. When you started the year, the forecast for vehicle growth in China was 7% and as we are ending the year here it\u2019s down to about 1% or 2%.","And China obviously consumes a good amount of premium vehicles, for ADI we\u2019ve done sort of the back of the envelope map, a map here. On our revenue in the automotive space and it\u2019s probably sort of mid teens impact from sales and certainly that would have an impact on our revenue. I think when you look across the other regions, I\u2019d say North America has been doing quite well, the European vehicle registrations every month are up, so that\u2019s generally a good sign.","When you look at North America; the average age of the vehicles is greater than its historical average. Dealer inventories are below their corporate average. In China they have recently announced a stimulus programs are on sales tax for automotive. So, again I\u2019m not an economist and I don\u2019t play one on TV either, but I guess from our sense everything is sort of trending as we would have expected except I\u2019d say for the China region which certainly has been weaker for the entire Industry.","And so certainly we are not going to be agnostic that that would have an impact on our sales as well particularly as China consumes a fair amount of premium vehicles. So I hope that answered your question Stephen and I guess that\u2019s the end of our earnings call here. We\u2019re 15 minutes past the hour. As a reminder, our first quarter 2016 results are scheduled for February 17. Again, 08:00 A.M. press release Eastern Time 10:00 A.M. earnings call. So thanks for joining us this morning. We look forward to talking to you soon.","Operator","This concludes today's Analog Devices' conference call. You may now disconnect."],"2072":["Analog Devices, Inc.

My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Analog Devices first quarter fiscal year 2015 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the opening remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. Please limit yourself to one question to ensure that management has adequate time to speak to everyone.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Ali Husain, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Ali Husain - Director-Investor Relations","Great. Thank you, Jennifer, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Analog Devices' first quarter fiscal 2015 earnings conference call. We posted a press release and relating financial schedules on our IR website at investor.analog.com and I'd encourage you to follow along as we go through our results today.","Our agenda for this afternoon's call will be as follows. First, I will provide a brief overview of our first quarter results. Then Dave Zinsner, our CFO, will review our financial performance in the first quarter and provide our business outlook for the second quarter. Then Vincent Roche, our President and CEO, will provide closing remarks. And after Vince's comments, we'll open it up for questions.","Today's call will include non-GAAP financial measures that have been adjusted to exclude special items in order to provide investors with useful information regarding our historical results and our outlook. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release, which is posted on our Investor Relations webpage.","The information we're about to discuss, including our objectives and our second quarter outlook, includes forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those described in our earnings release and our most recent 10-Q. Except as required by law, we don't undertake any obligation to update the forward-looking statements made by us today to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Therefore, this conference call will include time-sensitive information that maybe accurate only as of the date of today's live broadcast.","And with that, let's get to the main program. Revenue in the first quarter came in near the very high-end of our guidance range at $772 million, decreasing 5% sequentially and increasing 23% year over year.","Communications infrastructure and consumer applications exceeded our revenue plan while industrial and automotive were about in line with our expectations for the quarter. Revenue from communications infrastructure customers at 26% of sales decreased 4% from the prior quarter, as both wireless and wireline applications decreased sequentially. Communications infrastructure revenues increased 45% year over year and 14% on an organic basis.","Consumer revenue at 12% of sales increased 1% sequentially. Within consumer, growth in portable consumer applications offset seasonal revenue declines in the sector. Over the past several years, we have been refocusing our consumer investments around performance-centric prosumer A\/V and user experience-centric portable devices. In the first quarter, our consumer business registered its first year-over-year quarterly revenue increase in five years, growing 27% over the prior year's first quarter, which we believe is a good sign that the headwinds we were facing in the sector have abated.","The industrial market at 45% of sales performed as expected, decreasing 6% sequentially as a result of fewer business days for ADI, our customers, and our distributors in our January quarter. Compared to the prior year, industrial revenue grew 21% in the first quarter and 11% on an organic basis.","The automotive market at 16% of sales decreased 8% sequentially, as car manufacturers took their seasonal production breaks over the holiday period. The long-term trends for the electrification of automobiles remain strong, and ADI is very well positioned across infotainment, powertrain, and safety applications.","In total, our core businesses of industrial, communications infrastructure, and automotive represented again 88% of our revenue in the first quarter and have combined for 11% compounded growth over the last five fiscal years and 14% growth in our fiscal 2014.","So now I'd like to turn the call over to Dave for details of our financial performance in the quarter and for our business outlook for the second quarter of 2015. With the exception of revenue, Dave's comments on our first quarter 2015 P&L line items will exclude special items, which in the aggregate totaled $21 million. When comparing our first quarter performance to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior quarter and year-over-year results. And reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their comparable GAAP measures are included on Schedule E in today's earnings release.","So with that, Dave, it's all yours.","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Ali. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.","As Ali just outlined, ADI had another very good quarter. Sales in the first quarter totaled $772 million, and diluted earnings per share excluding special items were $0.63. Gross margins of 65.6% in the first quarter decreased from the prior quarter's 66.4%, primarily as a result of lower factory utilization but were better than our plan on a better mix of business. Compared to the prior year, gross margins increased 50 basis points on a better mix.","Excluding purchase accounting adjustments, inventory on a dollars basis was flat to the prior quarter and on a days basis was 126 days on lower sales. Utilization rates in the first quarter were in the mid-60%, and we're planning to increase utilization to the mid-70% in the second quarter.","Inventory and distribution on a dollars basis was also approximately flat to the prior quarter and on a weeks basis was approximately eight weeks on lower sequential sales. Operating expenses of approximately $264 million declined $5 million from the prior quarter. The decrease was primarily due to savings resulting from the prior quarter's restructuring action.","Operating profit before tax of $242 million or 31.4% of sales decreased 180 basis points from the prior quarter but increased 240 basis points over the prior year.","Other expense in the first quarter was approximately $7 million. We expect our net interest expense to be approximately $5 million per quarter for the remainder of fiscal 2015.","Excluding the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit and other special items, our tax rate in the first quarter was approximately 15%, which we expect will be our rate for the remainder of fiscal 2015.","Excluding special items, diluted earnings per share in the first quarter was $0.63, as I mentioned, near the high end of our guidance and up 29% over the prior year.","At the end of the first quarter, our cash and short-term investment balance was $2.9 billion, with $740 million available domestically. We had approximately $870 million in debt outstanding, resulting in a net cash position of $2 billion.","During the first quarter, capital additions were $24 million or approximately 3% of sales. Our capital expenditure plan in 2015 is to be between $150 million and $165 million.","We have a strong financial model that generates solid cash flow, and we remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders. For the trailing 12 months, we generated $883 million or 29% of our sales in operating cash flow. We also generated free cash flow of $729 million or 24% of sales, and returned $790 million or 108% of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of a dividend or share buybacks.","Our quarterly dividend is a very important part of our total shareholder return philosophy. During the quarter, we returned $115 million to shareholders in dividends. In addition, today we announced that our Board of Directors has approved a $0.03 increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share payable on March 10, 2015. This represents an increase of 8% and is in line with our model to increase our dividend annually by 5% to 10%.","During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $60 million of our stock, which helped reduce our diluted share count by about 1 million shares. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $700 million remaining under our current board authorized share repurchase program.","So now to our outlook for the second quarter, which with the exception of revenue expectations are on a non-GAAP basis and exclude special items that are outlined in today's call and release. After a solid first quarter, we are planning for revenue in the second quarter to be in the range of $810 million to $830 million or up approximately 5% to 8% sequentially. At the midpoint of this range, revenue would increase 18% year over year or at a high single-digit rate on an organic basis.","By end market, we expect industrial and automotive to lead our sequential revenue growth and for the communications infrastructure and consumer end markets to remain stable to the first quarter levels.","We are planning for gross margins to increase to approximately 66.5% on higher utilization and a continued favorable mix. We estimate that operating expenses will grow approximately 2% to 3% sequentially, which of course is well below the sequential revenue growth we expect to achieve in the second quarter. Based on these estimates and excluding any one-time items, diluted earnings per share are planned to be in the range of $0.70 to $0.74 in our second quarter.","While this is solid operating leverage, our utilization rates are expected to be only in the mid-70% levels in the second quarter, and we continue to carefully manage our operating expenses. Based on our first quarter exit rate, we estimate we have approximately 500 basis points of operating leverage remaining in our financial model given that the high end of our operating margin model is 36% of sales.","So to wrap it up, the first quarter was a very good start to the year. We had a strong year-over-year revenue growth with quality earnings and cash generation and we expect an even better second quarter.","So now I'll turn the call over to Vince.","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Dave, and good afternoon, everybody. As I mentioned last quarter, during these calls, I will occasionally provide additional perspective on the markets and technological trends that are driving ADI's business and the growth opportunities ahead for ADI.","Today, I'd like to give you some insights into our strategy in the industrial automation market specifically. This market is characterized by a diverse set of many thousands of customers and myriad applications with long life cycles. Customers not only demand highly innovative products and solutions, but these products and solutions must function at very high levels of accuracy, robustness, reliability, and efficiency in very harsh operating environments.","These dynamics create high barriers to entry, making industrial automation precisely the type of market that ADI actively pursues for sustainable growth and attractive returns. Within automation, ADI has a long heritage of providing technologies and product solutions in such areas as programmable logic controllers, distributed control systems, field instruments, motor controls, robotics, and industrial sensing. This business has traditionally served a variety of factory and process automation customers in such areas as automotive, pharmaceutical, and chemical manufacturing and then among many others. But today our customers' customers are responding to unprecedented challenges in an effort to remain globally competitive and boost productivity while decreasing energy costs and their carbon footprints. Our customers are focused on increasing the agility, the safety, and the reliability of their manufacturing systems.","Facing the scope of these challenges, customers are racing to re-architect their system designs and are working to transform yesterday's factory floor into the connected enterprise of tomorrow, and this transformation is showing up on ADI's bottom line. In our fiscal 2014, sales into the industrial automation market represented about 25% of our $1 billion-plus industrial business growing 14% compounded over the last five years, far outpacing the growth of our served available market.","And we were very optimistic about our continued growth in this sector. Let me explain why. The industrial automation sector is largely about precision sensing, monitoring, control, and communication. We have spent the past 50 years building our expertise on our brand with our high-performance precision analog and mixed-signal processing capability, where we can supply thousands of products to our many thousands of industrial customers at sub one part per million quality levels.","In recent years, we've been increasing our product development and systems engineering investment in this area. In addition to our data converter, linear, DSP, RF, and MEMS portfolios, we continue to broaden our reach with the addition of, for example, isolation products. We are better positioned than ever to understand our customers' signal processing system needs in order to deliver more complete solutions that anticipate and address their pain points.","Now I'd like to give you a couple of examples of the results of these investments. Today, in the area of process control systems, our customers need to maintain several hundred manufacturing platforms that are hardwired and dispersed all across factory floors. Not only are these systems inefficient but they require teams of service personnel to roam the floor and manually ensure each individual system is operating effectively.","A couple of cogent examples will explain how we're changing the game here. For example, ADI's product designers have produced a groundbreaking highly integrated software-defined signal processing solution that has the ability to reduce our customers several hundred platforms down to just a few that can be individually reconfigured with software to adapt to the various applications needs.","This helps make customer systems more flexible and agile while decreasing their maintenance and service costs. In addition, ADI's software configurable platforms enable customers to pack 50% more channels into the same or smaller form factor without performance compromise and at the highest safety and reliability levels.","Another example, more than 40% of the world's electricity is consumed by industrial plants with inefficient industrial motors consuming most of this electricity. In these applications, ADI is enabling highly precise measurement and control to enable our customers to create the highest-accuracy, efficient, and reliable motor control systems.","In these same applications, our isolation products are increasingly becoming a key differentiator for ADI, enabling machine and operator safety by isolating the electronics from high-voltage operating conditions. Also, our MEMS sensors are increasingly coming to the fore in industrial automation and are a key differentiator for ADI.","In machine health monitoring applications, for example, our MEMS vibration sensor with an embedded radio frequency transceiver enables remote monitoring of industrial machine health to detect early machine failure and to save our customers' customers from costly plant downtime.","So in essence, these are the forces driving what many of our customers call Industrial 4.0. Our customers are increasingly relying on ADI's signal processing system domain know-how, our products and technologies, and we are very well positioned to capture the opportunity and to drive revenue growth for ADI well into the future.","And so with that, we'd be very happy now to take any questions you might have on any part of the prepared remarks here.","Ali Husain - Director-Investor Relations","Jennifer, can we get to the Q&A, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.","James Vincent Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Guys, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the really strong results and guidance. If I could ask first on the consumer side, it's terrific that that \u2013 that the issues in that segment seem to have kind of played the course and don't seem like they're going to be acting as a headwind going forward. Do you think that the resolution of the issues in that segment is more just the fact that the segments that you are letting roll off kind of fully played out or do you think you've actually gained some share in that segment that's enabling that segment now to be not a headwind anymore?","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good question. I think it's largely a case of the headwinds being largely behind. We have been building some core technologies using some of our precision technologies, for example, to develop some new products that will come on stream in the future here particularly in the portable area. But I think it's really a mixture of \u2013 I think as I said the headwind is largely behind us and I think we've got some tailwinds now that will propel us through the parts of our business, the two areas that we focus being prosumer, the audio\/video prosumer area and the portable area where we've been, I'd say, modestly investing but doing some really exciting things that's have been and will come to fruition in the not-too-distant future here.","James Vincent Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Terrific. That's helpful. And for my follow up, if I could ask Dave. Dave, you mentioned utilization going to the mid-60% I think next quarter. Can you give us the range where that's been over the last couple of years kind of high and low?","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","I think it's actually, Jim, it was the mid-70% for Q2.","James Vincent Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I'm sorry.","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","It was mid-60% for Q1. And I'm just kind of scanning through it. It peaked out in the second and third quarter of 2014 in kind of the mid-70%. Let's see. I'm just looking in the low. It probably got down to about 50% \u2013 in the first quarter of 2013, at least, it was 50%. I'm not sure beyond before that.","James Vincent Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So we're getting back to a pretty healthy level here in the next quarter?","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","We're getting into the mid-70%. We have \u2013 I would say that in 2011 \u2013 of course that was heady times \u2013 but in 2011 we were in the low-80%. So we certainly can operate this facility at a utilization level that's much higher than we are today and we would get obviously the incremental gross margin fall through from it so that's not out of the realm of possibility.","James Vincent Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's terrific. Really, really helpful. I appreciate it. Congratulations again.","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Jim.","Ali Husain - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Jim. And, operator, before we move on to the next question, just a reminder that we'll have everyone try and keep to one question as the call will run until 6:00 and so feel free to re-queue after asking your first question. We'll get to our next caller now.","Operator","Our next question is from David Wong with Wells Fargo.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Can you give us any feel for the communications infrastructure end market by geography? Are there some regions that are relatively strong and others that are relatively weak at the moment?","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'd say America has been strong. We're still \u2013 everybody is waiting for Europe but I think it's been really a story about America, China, to some extent Japan and Korea. We had some good strength in India as well over the last couple of quarters. And, I think we're expecting China to continue to be reasonably strong at least for the first half of the year in the TV systems. And again, we expect a growth year this year in communications infrastructure for ADI.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thanks.","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, David.","Operator","Your next question is from Chris Danely with Citigroup.","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, guys. Can you just talk about what the Hittite contribution was during the quarter and then how you expect that to play out for the rest of the fiscal year?","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Hittite was in kind of the mid-$70 million level, which was kind of consistent with where we thought it would range. Obviously, in the back half of the year, we're thinking that it's likely to be up from where it is today. I would guess that the second quarter is going to be \u2013 given that we think communication is going to be relatively flat, I would guess Hittite is going to be relatively flat too.","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And revenues there, please?","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I beg your pardon?","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Revenue, too?","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","That's what we're talking about.","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, got you, got you, got you. I thought you were talking about margins.","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Oh, no, no, revenue \u2013 yeah, that was revenue. Yeah, margins are consistent with where Hittite's margins have been historically.","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. This is the time of year when new pricing kicks in on value purchase volume purchase agreements. Can you give us a sense of what impact that's having on your quarter going forward if that was in line with what you've seen seasonally in the past or more or less?","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","It's more or less in line, although we've taken a lot of steps around pricing to get more discipline and this year I think we did better than in years past in terms of the agreements with the key customers. We've also really kind of scrutinized our pricing across the long tail as well to make sure it was kind of consistent with the value that we're providing and in some cases actually there was a little bit of an increase. So I think we did pretty well on the pricing side. It was generally very stable through the negotiations and I would think through 2015 we'll have very, very stable pricing.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great, thanks for that detail and congrats on the strong results.","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the question and nice job on the dividend increase, guys. The question is really just a clarification. You noted that there was upside versus expectations in consumer and communications infrastructure. To what extent was it much more one or the other? And given that consumer contributed to the upside why did mix play a role in better gross margins?","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","I think they were both equally as strong. I don't think there was one specific area that outshines the other. From a mix perspective, generally actually our consumer business has pretty good gross margins. They're up north of 60%, so they actually don't impact our margins as much as you might think. And obviously, communications is above the corporate average, so that's very helpful to our gross margins. So that's generally why the mix turned out to be a positive for us this quarter.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to dig into the gross margin guidance just a little bit. So we've got about, I think it's 90 basis points of upside, but we have utilization going up 10 points or so from the mid-60% or the mid-70%, better mix, higher revenues. I'm just trying to figure out. How do we think about the relationship between gross margins and utilization on a point-for-point basis? And are there any headwinds that are affecting the margin guidance as well that are offsetting some of the tailwinds that seem to be there?","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","I think the general rule of thumb is usually that for every 1% increase in utilization, you get 10 basis points of gross margin improvement. We're roughly guiding in the 66.5% range. It obviously could be better. Certainly there are a lot of good things happening in the gross margin side. And the second quarter mix is generally a bit better because industrial has good strength in it, which is what we predict. And of course the utilization should lift it up.","There are always a few things that kind of can go against you. And I think given that's the case, we generally factor that into the gross margin guidance when we give it. But like you said, it could go a little bit better. I think the fall-through on gross margins for the second quarter \u2013 Ali, correct me if I'm wrong \u2013 is 80%. Right?","Ali Husain - Director-Investor Relations","That's correct.","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","And that's all also a good rule of thumb. As revenue goes up, you generally get 80% fall-through, and that tied to the 66.5% which is what we go with. But this quarter was a perfect indication that we can't exactly nail it down to the electron, to the tenth of basis point, and so there could be upward momentum depending on how things go.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you.","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Sure.","Ali Husain - Director-Investor Relations","And, Dave, not only has the gross margin dropped through at 80%, at the midpoint of guidance, but the operating margin is also around 70% drop-through. So thanks for the question and we'll go to our next caller.","Operator","Your next question is from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys, this is actually Matt Diamond on for Ross. Congrats as well on the results and the guide. There has been some talk about changing seasonality in the industry. I'm curious. From a bookings perspective, how does the current bookings dynamic compare to normal seasonal to the extent that normal really applies?","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","I actually think that \u2013 I would say that the cycles seem to be less predictive at this point. But seasonally, I think things are happening as they normally happen year to year. We saw bookings obviously come down initially in the quarter, and obviously were soft through the Christmas period. But after that, the bookings levels did ramp up in the January month. And February up until this point was quite strong. So it's consistent with \u2013 and of course that momentum happened a lot in the industrial and automotive space. So it's consistent with the guide that our opinion is that industrial and automotive should see very good sequential growth this quarter. And there's a lot of stability around the other two end markets, consumer and communications infrastructure, which generally would be a positive indication that those will be stable through the second quarter. And that's pretty \u2013 the second quarter generally for us seasonally is a very good quarter, and I think it's lining up to be a very good quarter for the second quarter.","Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Ali Husain - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Matt. We'll get to our next question, operator.","Operator","Your next question is from Romit Shah with Nomura.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Yes, thank you. I was hoping you guys could talk about the M&A environment. As you've probably heard, Micro out looking for strategic alternatives. Freescale is reportedly for sale. So if you could, just talk about that. Are you guys getting pitched a lot of deals and what's your appetite these days? Thanks.","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Bankers have to earn a paycheck, and so they've always been interested in pitching us deals regardless of whether it was a good environment or not. But in any event, we do have an active acquisition program in place. That was how we got to the Hittite acquisition last year. I think for us it continues to be about, what do we think is going to be important for our customers for us to have in terms of technology, and then we look out across the universe of opportunities to see if we can find that technology and companies, be it relatively smaller or large.","And so generally, if businesses are getting shopped, I wouldn't say that incentivizes us either to do it or not to do it. Really we start fundamentally with this list of what are the things we want in our portfolio that we don't think we can do organically, and those are the things that drive us to do acquisitions. And at this point now, nothing to talk about; we continue to survey the landscape, but there's nothing active at the moment.","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Our job number one for us, Romit, is to make sure that we shelled out a significant amount of money to buy a great asset in Hittite. We are determined to make sure that we create the leverage that we believe is available both on the top line and the margins and in terms of building up a really important $1 billion-plus franchise here for RF and microwave. So that's job number one for us at this point in time.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Then, just to that point, you've been very vocal that any potential acquisition has to be strategic, and that was one of the clear merits to the Hittite deal. But I wonder looking at what's been done over the last year, in particular the Avago-LSI transaction, if you're more open-minded to doing something that may standout more from a financial perspective?","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","We're not in the business of doing things just strictly for financial reasons. We've got to have strategic merits for us to do it.","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","For us, it's really about making sure that the combination of ADI and Hittite is capable of creating something greater than the sum of the parts. In other words, we can put our two pieces together and, over time, produce growth that was beyond the reach of both companies separately. So we're well on track, I'm delighted with the response from our customers. We have some great examples just very, very lately in fact where in the communications sector in particular, the Hittite, there's a tremendous vein of really good engineering and technology there that the customer relationships, the breadth of coverage that we have in the channel, that we're bringing Hittite now to places that we had hoped were possible to bring Hittite based on just ADI's scale, depth, and breadth. So I'm very, very pleased so far with what I'm seeing.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Great. Thanks for the color and congrats on the great results.","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, guys, and congratulations on the strong quarter and outlook. On the solid industrial trends in the business, I'm interested in the regional trends within this segment here in the April quarter and what sub-segments in automation, instrumentation, healthcare, energy are you seeing strength?","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","For the second quarter?","Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes, for the second quarter.","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","I think our two biggest sub-markets are industrial instrumentation and automation and those we expect to have very good second quarters. Healthcare is probably going to be up a bit, but it'd be relatively modest. I think defense is probably going to be relatively flattish. Energy management, which are smaller component, are likely to be a little bit up. Geographically speaking, obviously, the two major markets that industrial serves is the U.S. and European markets. When we looked at the bookings levels for those two markets in industrial, that's supported a pretty meaningful increase for the second quarter on a sequential basis. So I think those two areas will be probably the ones that outshine the others in terms of performance.","Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thank you very much.","Ali Husain - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Harlan. We'll get to our next question, operator.","Operator","Your next question is from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes, thank you. On Hittite, understanding that some of the revenue synergies will take time to play out but can you give any early stage anecdotes in terms of things you're looking to do with the distribution channel or customer engagements after closing Hittite?","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","There's a lot of activity. During the past three months or so, we launched Hittite into our channel. So we've gotten the attention of our biggest distributors globally and we've put more than 1,000 product SKUs into the distribution channel. So it will take time. But the response \u2013 I've spoken with these distributors myself and the response has been very, very positive to creating leverage and expanding the reach of Hittite across the globe. You know as well I just mentioned that we've seen some terrific evidence of deeper penetration of Hittite, particularly into some of our larger customers as well where the engagements, the combination of ADI's mixed-signal with Hittite's very, very high-performance analog, RF, and microwave technologies, that combination is starting to change the game in terms of the kinds of conversations we're having with our customers.","So for example in the instrumentation area, we've gone from competing against each other on product sockets to having a conversation about how that customer manages their frequency plan across their entire product portfolio. One of the very large routing companies is working with us on some very advanced technologies that Hittite has brought us in particularly the cable area. So there's lots of empirical evidence that the combination of the pieces and ADI's just breadth and coverage of customers globally is making a difference there.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks for the color, Vince.","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Thank you for taking my question. My question is really on the automotive segment. So, Vince, you've done very well over the last few years, but when I look at the last two quarters, automotive sales have been roughly flat to modestly up which is somewhat different than what we have seen from the competitors. So is this just order lumpiness? Do you think you have a complete portfolio in automotive? What will be the catalyst to turn automotive segment back to what overall company growth rates can be?","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, good question, Vivek. So automotive for ADI, 2014 was actually a strong year for automotive for ADI. We grew at three times the SAAR and have done so also over the last four years or so. So 2014 was a good year. I believe 2015 will be a growth year for ADI. We believe that the long-term projection for this business I think we said publicly should be that we can grow this business at a minimum of twice the rate of SAAR and I think the business as has been in the past is capable of growing three times the rate of SAAR. So it's a very sizable business for ADI now. We've done well in the past. I believe it's a terrific growth opportunity for ADI in the future.","I mean that said, it's a lumpy business to some extent given that there is really probably 10, 15, 20 customers that really matter, big programs that tend to last a long time. So I think the way to look at it is that some years we will achieve 3x, some years we won't. So \u2013 but I think overall, you've got to look at this business over the long-term. We've been increasing our investments. We've got terrific diversity now in terms of customers, products, and there's a lot of new things happening in automotive in terms of safety systems. We've got some exciting new technologies that we've been introducing as well into the real technology purveyors out there in terms of things like noise cancellation, infotainment, powertrain. So I think the future is going to be very, very bright for the industry and for ADI.","Vivek Arya - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Ali Husain - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Vivek.","Operator","Your next question is from Steve Smigie with Raymond James.","J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks a lot. I'll add my congratulations on a nice quarter and guide. Dave, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what you think the share count might look like in the April quarter or at least the magnitude of share buyback you guys might be contemplating?","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Good question. I guess I have to be somewhat of a prognosticator of what I think the stock price is going to do over the time. I mean generally speaking, if the stock is strengthening through the quarter, we would unlikely be buying. Yeah, that's the right way to say it. Because we tend to buy when there is kind of historical weakness in the stock and when there's not, we tend not to be a buyer. So I don't know exactly what's going to happen through the quarter. I hope it actually goes up and to the right. But the way we've modeled it is we thought that the share count would be in the kind of 316 million, 317 million range. It's possible it could go a little lower than that. It's possible it could be a little higher than that.","J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great, thank you.","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Sure.","Operator","Your next question is from Tore Svanberg with Stifel.","Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes, thank you, and congratulations on the record revenue outlook. Vince, I wanted to follow up on the industrial automation segment. I think you said it's grown about 14% CAGR the last five years...","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","...which was a period when industrial automation sort of just scratching the surface as far as the opportunities. So should we expect that business to potentially accelerate from that growth rate, and do you have other sub-verticals within industrial that have that same growth profile?","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, it's a good question, Tore. We've been, generally speaking, increasing R&D in the industrial space over the last several years. We've been strengthening and broadening the portfolio, the signal processing portfolio. So I think we are making our basic products and technologies more attractive to our customers, the industrial customers. We've also, incidentally, been increasing the footprint of our field operation in terms of selling an applications resource over the last five or seven years, developing the relationships, building the engagements at the engineering level. So I think we're in a good position in terms of products that we've got the coverage that we've got in the industrial space.","And also, our customers \u2013 as I said in the prepared remarks there, many of our industrial customers are asking us to get more involved in helping them instrument the sense to be able to create information for them and communicate information about machine health, for example. So my sense is both in terms of the things we are doing organically as a company and what the market will enable ADI to do, it will be a bright future. I think also, in the instrumentation area with the addition of Hittite, we're able to do new things in the microwave sector and instrumentation, in aerospace and defense, for example, as well.","And I think everybody is expecting a lot from the energy sector and it's been lumpy. It's based on regulation and government mood and so on and so forth, but it's an area where we've got some good technology on the metering side, on the communications side, and we have a broad portfolio of products that sell into the transmission and distribution of electricity as well. So \u2013 but I think in terms of being able to create leverage here I think automation is going to be strong for ADI, particularly strong, and as I said the high-frequency part of instrumentation I think is going to be good for the company as well.","Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Very helpful, thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the questions and congratulations on strong results. Relative to the guidance in April, if industrial and consumer is sort of stable\/flattish Q-on-Q, it means the other two buckets \u2013 I'm sorry industrial and auto need to grow about double-digit sequentially. I'm just kind of curious is one bucket growing faster than the other? And I hate to use the word normal seasonal, but would you characterize double-digit sequential growth in the April quarter as normal seasonal or are there other drivers like content growth that you think is starting to kick in at the April timeframe for those two buckets? Thanks.","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","You're correct in that's roughly what has to happen. I think that the industrial business will, on a percentage basis, do better than the automotive business sequentially. And actually I think there is \u2013 it's hard to gain a lot of share in industrial in a quarter. This is a business that doesn't move quarter-to-quarter, it doesn't even move year-to-year in a lot of cases. So if you look at the sequential growth rate in the 2014 second quarter, I think industrial grew at about 13% sequentially and that's been kind of the range of what we're probably talking about for industrial for this second quarter. So it's basically seasonal.","We'd like to believe that we have invested a lot in automotive and in the industrial space. We've moved a lot of R&D away from some of the more high-flying consumer opportunities and into these areas over the last five or six years. So all of that takes time to get traction, and I do believe that 2014 and at least how things are lining up for 2015 for those markets, does indicate that we've got some momentum in these businesses and that the fruits of the labor of all this R&D investment that we've made over this five-year period is starting to pay off in terms of revenue design wins, design-ins and so forth.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Helpful. Thank you, guys.","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Sure.","Operator","Your next question is from C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.","C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI","Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Dave, in your prepared remarks, you talked about 500 bps remaining in terms of operating leverage. Curious if you could talk a little bit about your underlying assumptions there in terms of what kind of top line mix utilization you require to get to that kind of number?","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","I mean the margins of these businesses \u2013 of course there has been some mix impact quarter-to-quarter in terms of the impact to gross margins, but I think largely they're fairly close to each other. I don't think we have to rely on one business doing better than another business in order for us to kind of hit the targets. Our goal is to get to 68% gross margins. And given that we're 250 basis points below that, I guess, at this point, 250 basis points of the 500 basis points is going to come from just gross margin leverage, which is largely going to be a function of, we believe, factory utilization, a higher top line- over some fixed overhead expenses, and just a laser focus on this in terms of pricing discipline and cost discipline. And I think we've been able to do a fairly good job in both of those areas over the last couple years to improve the gross margins beyond where they would've been. And then the rest is obviously trying to get the operating expenses down a couple hundred basis points as a percent of revenue and that will get us the rest of the way there to get us our 500 basis points of improvement.","I don't think it's going to happen next quarter. Obviously, I don't know that it happens next year necessarily. But I think in a fairly stable environment with some growth like we think we can do over the course of four or five years, I think we'll have a very good steady march towards improving that operating margin leverage that we talked about.","C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI","Very helpful, thank you.","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Sure.","Operator","Your next question is from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Thank you, guys, pretty solid execution here. Just on order trends, Dave, is there any difference in European order trends at the distis versus here given the currency upheaval that we are seeing? Thank you.","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","You mean orders from distributors on us you mean?","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Right, right, given that they are sitting on depreciated currency.","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Obviously, the currency moves around a bit. We transact mainly in dollars. And so sometimes they get a windfall in terms of gross margins; sometimes they don't. But their business is shipping our product and so they're going to need to hold the inventory to be able to do that, and we don't think they're going to adjust their inventory behavior based on some FX perturbations.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And then your earlier response you did say \u2013 I just want to make sure I got it right. For the guidance, you did say that you expected both European and the U.S. geos to be strong? Correct?","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Correct.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Ian Ing with MKM Partners.","Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC","Thanks for taking my question. Communications segment down only 4%. You thought it could underperform the other three segments. I'm just trying to understand how your comms business can outperform FPGAs. You've heard Xilinx talk about a flat to low-growth environment they're facing this year, and your converters do often sit next to FPGAs. I'm just trying to understand the source of the outperformance.","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","This is another area where we've been investing heavily in increasing ADI's reach across the radio subsystem over the past number of years. So as we've said several times, our content from generation to generation has grown, and that is the case in, for example, 4G today as well where we're getting somewhere between 20% and 30% more BOM value per 4G radio subsystem. And also ADI in terms of diversity of that radio application is stronger today than it's ever been.","Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC","Helpful, thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Stephen Chin with UBS.","Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks for taking my question, another one on geographic demand, if I could. Relative to Japan and China, could you talk a little bit about how the order trends are looking in those two geographies, especially in the industrial end market? Is it still in correction mode, or do you sense a trough coming anytime soon? And also any foreign exchange related impact to longer-term orders, especially in Japan? Thanks.","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","At this point, we're not seeing any impact from FX changes. I think in general, industrial \u2013 again, it has a pretty good second quarter, so I'd expect those businesses to do okay. I think we have generally \u2013 I don't necessarily remember how it breaks down by segment. But I think in total, we expect China and Japan to be relatively flattish. So my guess is industrial does a little bit better and some of the other markets probably do a little bit worse, and that nets it out to relatively flat.","Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Vijay Rakesh with Sterne, Agee.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","Good quarter here. Just on the automotive side, can you talk about which segments you are seeing strength in automotive? And also geographically what's your exposure in automotive? Thanks.","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Geographically, we're probably more concentrated at the European automakers to start with, and then a close second is the U.S., followed probably by Japan and Korea at equal levels. The strength I think for the second quarter on a sequential basis, my guess is that we'll see strength across all three of our sub-segments, infotainment, safety, and powertrain. I don't think any particular sub-segment is going to do necessarily better than any of the others.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","Great, thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Chris Danely with Citigroup.","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Just for round two, can I sneak in two quickly?","Ali Husain - Director-Investor Relations","Yes, go ahead.","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","You talked about the end markets. Can you just maybe give us a sense of the ranking of end markets you expect as far as growth goes for the calendar year? And then also, would you characterize your overall environment as better than seasonal? And what do you think the drivers of the better than normal seasonality would be, if it is like that?","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Better seasonal for the year you mean or...","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Would you characterize like the current orders environment as a little bit better than normal environment?","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","That's the same question I thought we got a little bit earlier, but I think that it's generally pretty seasonal in terms of the order flow. And then as far as we rank the end markets, it's a little early to be able to try and do this but I think all four markets will likely grow this year.","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","I would hope so.","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Now we obviously get a lift in the industrial and communications markets by virtue of the fact that we have Hittite in there. So obviously they're likely probably to do better than the other two because they get a full year's effect of Hittite versus one quarter's effect of Hittite that we had in 2014. And then consumer is probably the next and probably auto is going to be the slowest this year.","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, that's perfect.

Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","They're all recycling.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets LLC","We're coming back in, just one more for you. I know you guys have been working on improving some of the margins in the MEMS business. Can you give us where you're at in the progress of that program?","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","On the baseball analogy, I would say we're in the second or third inning. We do have some products that are starting to come out that carry better margins. Obviously, they take some time to get traction. My guess is that traction doesn't happen until late in 2016, maybe 2017, and that will be an inflection point for us in terms of improving gross margins. We're obviously focused on the cost side of the equation as well and we've made steady progress. So margins are improving, but they still have a ways to go to get to where we think they'll be acceptable.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets LLC","What percentage of sales should we characterize MEMS as now?","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","It's in the mid-single digits I think.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great.

Accounting Bulletin 606 on revenue recognition, it seems like it's effectively trying to eliminate sell-through revenue recognition and it's already causing some companies to rethink there \u2013 how they recognize their revenues. Have you guys looked at this? And if so, can you tell us how you think this may impact you guys and when you might expect to implement it and would it cause you to recognize a big chunk of the $280 million in deferred revenues in one quarter? Thanks.","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","That's the first time I've ever gotten an accounting question, I think. I feel so honored. Yeah, the \u2013 we are aware of the Bulletin. It does seem to indicate that at some point down the road the sell-through way of recognizing revenue might go away. I think in a couple of years \u2013 I'm not even sure what year this all starts to come about \u2013 I think it's like 2017, 2018. So we have a ways to go before we have to worry about it. I'm not even sure whether you kind of restate history and then as if you had never done revenue recognition on a sell-through basis. So we will have to see how that goes. It's quite a few years away, though, so we haven't spent a ton of time worrying about it.","Ali Husain - Director-Investor Relations","Mark, for ADI, I'd say it's probably effective in our fiscal 2018 here, so we've got plenty of lead-time here to deal with it.","Mark J. Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Fair enough, thank you very much.","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","And if there is, like, some one quarter kind of impact, what we'll do is we'll provide some sort of pro forma schedule so that it's very easy to tell how we've done from quarter to quarter so it doesn't cause an issue.","Mark J. Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Sounds good. Thanks.","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Sure.","Ali Husain - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from Deepon Nag with Macquarie.","Deepon Nag - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Could you talk about how the tax synergies with Hittite are progressing and, longer time, how are you guys thinking about balancing your needs for onshore cash with a falling tax rate?","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","The tax structure of Hittite is now kind of fully integrated with our tax structure. At this point now, we're pretty much realizing effectively a lower tax rate for Hittite. There's probably a little bit more that will fall through by the time next year rolls around, but I think for the most part the big step function improvement has already happened. You are right, we constantly balance U.S. kind of cash flow needs and international cash flow needs over time. I think we have plenty of cash in both locations and certainly plenty of liquidity beyond the cash that we have on the balance sheet.","I think to be able to manage both entities effectively without kind of a meaningful adjustment to our tax rate in the event that one particular entity needs cash and the other can provide it there may be some cash flow that moves from one location to the other and that would have some effect on the tax rate but it'd be relatively minor and I don't think would have a big impact on earnings.","Deepon Nag - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thanks. And if I could sneak one quick one in on small cells, just how design traction of that business and how we should think about that as a percentage of your revenue over the next couple of years?","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, well, the design activity has been tremendously successful for ADI. We've been working hard on building a set of transceiver technologies that are highly integrated in terms of the RF and the mixed-signal chains. And as I said, we've great design in coverage across the globe. And it's my expectation that somewhere in the late part of this year into next year we'll start to see it become a meaningful portion of the business assuming that the rollouts take place at the rate we expect. It's hard for me to give you an exact prediction in terms of what proportion of our revenue, but I think it's true to say that from what our customers are telling us and what the carriers believe that the deployments will begin in the second half of this year in earnest some time. So when they happen, we'll benefit very, very well I believe.","Deepon Nag - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","That's great. That's all I've got.","Ali Husain - Director-Investor Relations","And I would just add, Deepon, on the small cell thing. A lot of times it comes down to the definition of what's a small cell versus what's a macro. The miniaturization of the macro base station has been happening for several years. In fact, I think if you look at the stats on some of these macros, they're actually placed about 50 meters apart. So do you call that a macro or do you call that a small cell? But in any event, I think our sense is that the small cells in the back half of 2015 should start to layer on top of what we're doing on the base station on the macro side. So overall, it should be a good year for us in comms infrastructure. So with that, let's get to our next question.","Operator","The next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Thanks. Just a quick one. I believe, Dave, in response to a prior question you mentioned Hittite was about mid-$70 millions in Jan and you expected it to be sort of flattish in April. If you could clarify that. And just on a like-to-like basis, how should we think about the growth at Hittite in fiscal 2015? Thank you.","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Actually, now to think about it, the industrial business is likely to have a pretty good second quarter, so I probably \u2013 I was thinking about it from the comps perspective, but yeah, so of course the industrial will go up. So I guess sequentially Hittite will be up in the second quarter versus the first quarter. And then what was your second question, Vivek?","Vivek Arya - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Yeah, just for the full-year, conceptually from the time you acquired Hittite and where you expected the growth rate to be. Now that it's been under your belt for a couple quarters, how are you thinking about full-year growth trends for that acquisition?","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","It's going really well. I think the likelihood is that this thing is going to grow kind of in the double-digit range and that was what it had been consistently growing at for a while. It had a couple years just like everyone else where it wasn't doing that, and then it turned around and started to do pretty well. So that's pretty consistent with what we thought. I mean it wasn't too terribly different than where we thought things would end up. I'm very excited, as Vince pointed out, that there is a whole bunch of new designs that Hittite was unlikely to have gotten had they not been part of the ADI portfolio, and Hittite has actually helped us in some cases win some business on the signal processing side that we wouldn't have ordinarily had gotten had it not been for having the microwave capabilities. So the business is performing at least as good as we thought it would, but I think that the revenue synergies that we'll get over the long-term are going to do much better than we thought we would going into the acquisition.","Vivek Arya - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Thank you.","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Sure.","Operator","Your next question is from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the follow up, guys. Back to the consumer segment, with the re-tooled product portfolio, is the consumer business now a business that can grow on par with the rest of ADI's businesses? And if not, is it north or south, and what kind of visibility do you now have in that business? Is it short-term, a quarter or two or is it longer-term with the mix of applications that you now have exposure to?","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","I think it grows at the levels of the rest of the business now. Thankfully not a headwind. Of course consumer is a little bit lumpier so there may be years where it does did better than that, years where it does a little worse than that. But I think in general that business should grow around the corporate average.","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Just add to what Dave has said there, Craig. So we're not interested in a business as you know that hasn't got legs to it over the long-term. We like sustainability, we like diversity, we like good returns. And I think in the consumer area, we've been very, very clear that with our customers, give us the problems that are really, really hard to solve, and those are the problems we've been getting. Also, not just one generation at a time, we are building this business, albeit the innovation cycles are, they're short, they're very, very rapid but as best we can, we are able to see at least a couple of generations out from the existing solution, if you like. So we are trying to apply our algorithm, if you like, for the rest of ADI where we're trying to build a long-term view in the spaces, a few targeted application spaces particularly in the portable area, as Dave said, where we think we can get good sustainable growth over the longer-term.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Thanks for the color.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel.","Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes, just a quick follow-up. Dave, you guided OpEx to be up 2% to 3% sequentially which is sort of half of the rate of your top line growth. Is that how we should think about OpEx growth for fiscal 2015 as well as sort of half of your revenue growth?","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","For the total, you mean?","Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Correct.","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, and I haven't quite done the math but I think in general what we're trying to do is have it average around what the fourth quarter of 2014 was. So I think the fourth quarter of 2014 was about $270 million and so we're roughly thinking we'll average that over the course of the four quarters of 2015. So that probably does have the effect of half the rate of revenue growth but I guess it obviously depends on what the revenue growth rate is and I'm unable to predict beyond the second quarter what that's likely to be.","Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","That's very good. Thank you.","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Okay, thanks.","Ali Husain - Director-Investor Relations","All right, Tore, well, thank you. And I'll throw it back over to Vince to close out the call.","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, thanks, everybody, for the questions on the call here and hope you are as excited as I am about the results and the future of ADI. We continue to focus our investments on profitable, diverse, and sustainable markets where, as I said just a while ago, there are tough problems that need to be solved and where the barriers to entry are high. We also have a culture. We just turned 50 by the way and what has sustained this company over the 50 years and will bode very well for the company in the future is that we've got a culture that's driven by innovation, excellence in everything that we do, and a real passion for solving the deepest challenges that our customers are dealing with. And it's my sense that this will be a great business for many, many decades to come.","So once again, thanks for listening in, and we look forward to speaking to you at an upcoming conference or at next quarter's earnings call.","Operator","This does conclude today's Analog Devices conference call.

Fishman","Okay, Ali. You can take a deep breath.","Ali Husain","I just want you to have more time is all, Jerry.","Jerald G. Fishman","Okay, good. Glad to hear. Well, hi and good afternoon to everybody who's joining the call. As you know from the press release, our revenues for Q1 were about $622 million, which was down about 10% from the previous quarter and also down about 4% from the same period last year, which you might remember, the first quarter last year was a 14-week quarter. The diluted earnings per share, which exclude a few special items, was $0.44, which was at approximately the midpoint of our guidance that we provided last quarter.","Overall, the order and sales patterns were very challenging during the first 2 months of our Q1, as our customers continued to reduce their inventories and industrial and infrastructure capital spending remained very muted going into the end of the calendar year. In January, order rates began to improve and remained strong so far this quarter. Our belief is that the current order strength is the result of our customers becoming more confident about their prospects as 2013 unfolds and also the end of inventory de-stocking. This has certainly been a pretty tough cycle, particularly in the industrial market where we believe that customers ordering has been well below consumption now for several quarters. Based on historically low customer inventory levels and feedback we get from our largest customers and also our largest distributors, we expect that Q1 will likely be the trough quarter for ADI in this cycle.","Over the past few quarters when demand weakened, we very carefully managed our business, keeping production levels low and our inventory under very tight control. Inventory dollars actually went down in Q1, although days increased as a result of the sales decline. We also managed operating costs very tightly, and we moved strategic resources to the most important programs. And finally, by design, our variable compensation costs were lower as business conditions weakened. So this all, in combination, produced very respectable margins and very strong cash flow during a very challenging quarter and has also set up significant upside operating leverage as business conditions improve.","Our very strong cash flow and balance sheet support an increase to our dividend, and this afternoon, we announced that our Board of Directors voted to increase our quarterly dividend to $0.34, which is up 13% from last quarter. This increase reflects our strategy to continuously enhance our shareholders' returns via increasing dividends and is enabled by ADI's very strong and consistent cash generation capability. Since the first dividend was paid in December of 2003 almost 10 years ago, we have paid the cash dividend to shareholders each and every quarter, and we've grown the dividend consistently over that period.","So now I'd like to turn the call over to Vince for some more details and insights into the trends in the end markets, and I'll come back after Vince and Dave finish their comments to make some comments about what we see going forward. So Vince?","Vincent T. Roche","Well, thanks, Jerry. Good afternoon, everybody. Well, as we expected coming into the quarter, sales were mostly down sequentially across all our major end markets. So I'll talk about some of the specifics and provide some insight into what we see going on in each of the major markets.","Firstly, industrial sector revenues, which make up about half of our total, declined 8% sequentially in Q1. The decline was broad-based across customer tiers, geographies and channels and across automation, energy, instrumentation and defense aerospace applications. As has been the case now for several quarters, order rates from industrial customers appear to be well below consumption rates. Customer inventory reductions, coupled with constrained CapEx, dampened order rates from these customers for much of Q1. But since early January, order rates have been improving, which leads us to expect the industrial end market will be the strongest grower in the second quarter.","Now we've spoken many times about the importance of the industrial segment to ADI, and we continue to see an excellent match for the full suite of ADI's high-performance signal processing technologies. There are many macro level opportunities in such areas as power grid management, machine automation and precision instrumentation, which drive the deployment of more and more sensor and actuator systems, which in turn will drive the need for high-performance signal processing. We've been steering increasing levels of R&D to the segment over the past few years to strengthen our core capabilities in converters, linear and DSPs, and to extend our capabilities in areas such as RF and MEMS in order to capture the opportunity available to us. This strengthening technology platform, along with ADI's strong reputation for technology, supply chain and quality amongst the tens of thousands of customers we serve, leads us to believe that our industrial growth can be pushed well above the average in the future.","So let me turn to the communications infrastructure segment. Now in this area, sales declined 12% in the first quarter after 3 successive quarters sequential revenue increases. The decline was broad-based, with the largest sequential decrease coming from the wireless infrastructure subsegment. The CapEx environment worldwide was muted, and customers rebalanced their inventories in Q1 as they headed into the calendar year-end. Our expectation is for modest growth from the infrastructure sector in 2Q, with meaningful tailwinds to the business as we progress into the second half of the calendar year.","Now accelerating the deployment of 4G LTE and TD-LTE wireless systems globally and the introduction of heterogeneous networks combining macro and small cells offer solid growth opportunities for ADI. Our customers are dealing with significant challenges in the areas of efficient and flexible spectrum utilization, power reduction, system cost and deployment efficiency. Because the radio architecture sets the performance envelope for the system, customers need the advanced radio transceiver technologies in which ADI specializes.","In the past 3 years, we've increased R&D to broaden our core technology reach in order to exceed our customers' needs and position ADI to deliver the most competitive radio transceiver solutions on the market. Now in addition, we've sharpened our focus in the wireline sector to focus on control applications and selective data path with advanced converter, linear and timing power solutions for the leaders in cable, Ethernet and optical infrastructure.","We remain very bullish about ADI's growth prospects in the infrastructure segment, given the growth in equipment installation footprint, the fact that we continue to deepen our engagements with the market leaders and the increasing content available to ADI as we extend our available market from generation to generation.","Let me focus on automotive now for just a few minutes. Revenue there declined marginally in the first quarter, down 3% sequentially, representing 17% of sales compared to 16% in the prior quarter. During the first 2 months of the quarter, we experienced inventory reductions at our customers. In January and into February, we have seen indications of an improved demand environment. So in the second quarter, we should see modest growth in automotive. Over the last few years, automotive has been a consistently strong growth sector for ADI, almost doubling in revenue from 2007 levels. With the push-pull effect of government mandates and an insatiable appetite from OEMs for high-performance signal processing, our long-term expectations remain high in automotive. Car manufacturers continue to electrify and automate the automobile. Predictive, preventive and protective safety systems, precise powertrain control systems and high-quality multimedia systems require proliferation of sensors and actuators, which in turn place ever-increasing demands in signal processing technology. So we believe this is an excellent match for ADI signal processing.","Also, while we continue to have a strong presence in the U.S. and European manufacturers, we've made significant progress in executing our plan to penetrate the Asian market over the past few years. The combination of a growing served available market, strong technology match and deepening customer engagement leads us to believe that the automotive end market will continue to be a strong growth story for ADI.","And finally, the consumer business declined 22% sequentially in what was an expected seasonal decline for that business in Q1 after a very strong performance in the fourth quarter. In total, consumer was 17% of sales, which is a more typical consumer mix for ADI compared to 20% in the prior quarter. We expect this segment will be approximately flat in the second quarter.","Now as we've mentioned before, we have been refocusing R&D on those parts of the consumer market where we can make a demonstrable and sustainable difference to the user experience, particularly in audio and imaging applications. In order to mitigate the inherent sector volatility, we endeavor to invest in a given application only when we are convinced that we can play over several generations in a leadership position and make adequate returns. Many such subsectors exist in the consumer market, and we will carefully exploit these opportunities with the market leaders in the years ahead.","So at this point, I'll hand over to Dave, who will take us through the details of the financial results.","David A. Zinsner","Thanks, Vince, and good afternoon, everyone. As Jerry had mentioned earlier, first quarter revenue declined 10% sequentially to $622 million. Revenues declined 4% compared to the first quarter of 2012, which, as Jerry mentioned, was a 14-week quarter.","Our gross margin was 62.7% in the first quarter. This was down from 63.8% that we reported in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of lower factory utilization. Utilization decreased from the high 60s in the prior quarter to the mid 50s in the first quarter, which dropped inventory on our balance sheet by $6.5 million.","Inventory and distribution was down in dollars in the first quarter but in terms of days was up about 1 week to 8 weeks based on lower sales. We believe inventory in this channel is increasing, in line with improved end customer order rates through the distributors.  Lead times for our direct OEM customers remained similar to last quarter and are in good control, with virtually all of our shipments to OEMs occurring within 4 weeks.","We recorded a $40 million restructuring charge in the first quarter, and if you'd like further details, you can find more information in the Form 10-Q filed with the SEC today. Excluding this charge, operating expenses were $222.7 million, which was down $5 million compared to the prior quarter. The decrease was primarily due to tight control over discretionary items and also due to our variable compensation model, which modulates with business performance.","Operating profits before tax for the first quarter, excluding this restructuring charge, was $168 million or 26.9% of sales, down approximately 400 basis points from the prior quarter. Other expense of $3 million in the first quarter was flat to the fourth quarter and reflect the ongoing run rate of our net interest expense.","Our first quarter tax rate was approximately 17%, excluding an adjustment of our annual tax rate for the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. We're expecting our tax rate to be approximately 17% for the remainder of FY '13.","Diluted earnings per share of $0.44, excluding special items, was at the midpoint of our guidance.","Cash flow in the first quarter continued to be strong. We generated 25% of our revenue or $158 million in operating cash flow. Capital expenditures were $18 million, resulting in free cash flow of $140 million or 22.5% of revenue for the quarter.","Our cash and short-term investments balance increased about $87 million during the first quarter and now stands at approximately $4 billion, with approximately $1.1 billion available domestically.","At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $760 million in debt outstanding. Net cash on a per outstanding share basis was slightly above $10.","Our accounts receivable balance was down about $10 million versus the last quarter on lower overall shipments in the quarter. And our day sales outstanding increased to 48 days from 45 days in the prior quarter, which is typical in a recovering business environment.","During the first quarter, we distributed approximately $91 million or 69% of GAAP net income in dividends to our shareholders. Our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.34 per outstanding share of common stock, up from $0.30 last quarter, which will be paid on March 12, 2013 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on March 1. At current stock prices, this dividend represents an annual yield of about 3% and represents a 13% dividend increase. While we repurchased a relatively small amount of stock this quarter, we continue to view repurchases as an important vehicle to improve shareholder return, and we'll continue to be opportunistic buyers of our stock, with about $560 million remaining under our board-authorized share repurchase program.","Our results in the first quarter continue to demonstrate the strength of results to invest for the future while responsibly dealing with the realities of an uncertain market. Our actions during this cycle have built in significant operating leverage as we continue to focus our investments on profitable, diverse and sustainable markets and begin to increase production levels as orders increase while keeping tight control of our operating expenses. We have a very responsive manufacturing organization capable of responding quickly to the changing demand patterns.","So now I'll turn the call over to Jerry for some closing comments and to discuss ADI's outlook for next quarter.","Jerald G. Fishman","Well, thanks, Dave. As I mentioned earlier, our sense is that Q1 will turn out to be the trough quarter for ADI in this cycle, and we expect revenue growth in Q2. We expect our most significant revenue growth during second quarter will be from industrial customers where higher order rates, inventory stabilization and somewhat higher capital spending should drive strong sequential growth in the quarter. We expect our communications infrastructure will grow slightly, mostly as a result of inventory stabilization. But as Vince mentioned earlier, our largest communications customers are forecasting many new deployments, which should result in higher demand for ADI in the second half of the calendar year. Automotive should also grow in Q2, given our higher opening backlog and generally stronger demand patterns in many regions. We expect our automotive business to continue to outgrow the market as a result of better overall car sales and a very strong ADI product position.  For our consumer business, our plan is to be flat in Q2, with the growth of this business very dependent on the product cycles of our customers.","In total, we're planning for revenues to grow between 4% and 8% sequentially in Q2. For the year, we should benefit from higher industrial and communications capital spending, which drives a very large portion of our business and also some more content gains in automotive. We expect utilization will be slightly better in Q2 relative to Q1 as we continue to manage our inventories. This, coupled with a stronger product mix, leads us to estimate gross margins will increase to approximately 64% in the second quarter. We're planning for OpEx to remain approximately flat in Q2, and that, coupled with the gross margin increase, should continue to provide very strong operating leverage in Q2. And as a result, we estimate that our earnings in Q2 to be in the range of 49% to 55% a rate of growth quite a bit above what our expected sales growth is.","As we look longer term, we have very high confidence in our business strategy, which combines our very high-performance signal processing component technology that we sell to tens of thousands of customers, with a very unique ability to integrate this core technology into systems-level solutions for the largest customers in our served markets. Our customer base around the world is increasingly convinced that our core technology is the best in class, and our increasing systems knowledge, as applied to more integrated products, is becoming a real differentiator in our business. While economic uncertainty certainly remains, we believe that we're making the right trade-offs between continuing to invest for the future while very carefully managing the short-term operations of the company. And if this cycle follows the patterns of previous cycles, we will emerge from this cycle stronger than when the cycle began, and we should continue to provide continuing very solid returns to our shareholders as a result.","Ali Husain","Great. Thanks, Jerry. We plan to run this call until 6 p.m. Eastern Time. [Operator Instructions] And with that, operator, we're now ready for questions from our participants.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Firstly, I wanted to dig in a little bit into the revenue guidance for next quarter. So your typical Q2 seasonality, if I look over the last 10 years or so, might be somewhere in the ballpark of, say, 1% to 4%. You're guiding up, say, 4% to 8%. Is this the snapback that everybody's been hoping for? Is this just an end to customer de-stocking that's driving that? Are customers moving into a restocking mode? Or do you see the potential for customers move back into a restocking mode? Or would you expect, I guess, a return to seasonal or even potentially sub-seasonal growth as the boost from the end of the de-stocking process tails off?","Jerald G. Fishman","Well, I mean, again, it's all speculation, Stacy. But our sense is that the increases we're seeing in the orders, which supports the guidance we provided, is really the combination of all those things. It's that -- I think customers are, at the margin, more enthusiastic as some of the uncertainty, particularly in the United States and Europe has been lessened, certainly. And also, as we've been saying particularly with industrial customers, there's been a huge de-stocking going on out there, which is why industrial revenues have fallen so fast. So I think there's some inventory replenishment going on, consistent with a better outlook, particularly in the industrial market, going forward. So I think like in most cycles, it's never a simple answer. It's a combination of things going on that are causing us to have a plan for Q2 in the range that Dave and I had mentioned.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Are customer inventories really that low? I mean, if we're looking at distribution, you're right back to 8 weeks, which is sort of dead in the middle of your sweet spot. [indiscernible] inventory doesn't look all that low?","Jerald G. Fishman","Yes. It's 8 weeks based on very low sales levels. Distributors are counting to the fact that sales are going to go up next quarter, and they are trying to get their inventory levels in line, particularly with industrial customers, of what they are expecting going forward rather than what they've seen going backward.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. For my follow-up, I just want to dig a little bit into the margins for this quarter. So you had a little bit of upside. I think you guided to 62%. You came in at 62.7%. With utilizations in the 50s and a revenue miss, I was just wondering what drove that margin upside in the quarter.","David A. Zinsner","The mix was a little bit better than we expected, particularly the mix within our industrial business, so that made it a little bit better.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Which end markets in industrial were driving that?","David A. Zinsner","It was a combination of instrumentation and automation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up to Stacy's first question. Particularly in the industrial segment, has the pickup in orders gotten the orders to the consumption levels yet? Or are customers still ordering below consumption level?","Jerald G. Fishman","I don't really think we know with that much precision. I wish we did. But in the industrial market, we're serving tens of thousands of customers, and a lot of that is coming through distribution. So I think the only thing that we can really communicate is a sense we're getting from the largest customers, from the distributors that their outlook is a little bit better and they are starting to order some product. I think beyond that, all we can do is speculate, and I'd rather not do that.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sure. In the comm infrastructure segment, you talked about meaningful tailwinds in the second half based on many new deployments. Geographically, can you give us a sense of how that breaks down and the timing of how that breaks down? Is that potentially China first and then maybe the U.S. later? Or how might that work?","Vincent T. Roche","Well, I think if you look at the public announcements in terms of capital spend, you've seen AT&T, T-Mobile in the U.S. announce very aggressive build-outs during the course of year '13 here. And China Mobile and China Telecom have talked about as well releasing the, if you like, the second part of the 4G TD-SCDMA release as well in China, particularly in the second half of the year. So it seems that if you were to kind of characterize the thing, you'd say America, in particular, and then, to some extent, Japan as well. I know Japan is doing some build-outs in terms of backhaul and wireless infrastructure during the course of the year, but I think China is very much second half as we see it at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with JPMorgan.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So my first question, I'm probably the only guy on this call that wants the upturn more than you guys. So...","Jerald G. Fishman","I don't think so.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","We've heard from a number of other companies that business is picking up. Jerry or Vince or Dave, can you just compare and contrast this year versus last year and why this is or is not a head fake? Is anything different between this year and last year?","Jerald G. Fishman","Well, that's the same exact question we keep badgering our guys with, by the way. But I think last year, there were so many economic uncertainties that emerged right after the beginning of the year that were historic in nature, particularly in the U.S. and Europe but even to some degree in China. So our sense is that those -- anything could happen. The world could get very uncertain very quickly. If you want to be pessimistic, there's a lot of reasons to be so about that. But our sense is that the -- what happened last year was actually quite unique. And this year, although there's still uncertainty, it's not the catastrophic uncertainty that plagued the market when the world collapsed sort of 9 months ago. So that's our plan. That's our assumption. That's the best feedback that we get from the large customers. We're have to just wait and see what happens, but that's the best we can predict right now. And we're just trying to communicate what our plan is through the balance of the year based on the feedback we're getting from the customers.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And as a follow-up to that, just on bookings, you commented that they continue to get better. What -- do you have any sense of what your book-to-bill is so far this quarter? Is it tracking ahead of what it was last quarter?","Jerald G. Fishman","We don't really look at that in that way week-to-week. I think just generally, we're seeing stronger order patterns in most regions, and they're noticeably stronger. So given the breadth of the customer base we have, we view that as a good sign right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Just on inventory days, I know you guys have been trying to manage it flat on a days basis, and it creeped up a little bit this last quarter. Yet at the same time, we are seeing pretty decent gross margin leverage in April. So should we expect inventory days to sort of hover around the 120-plus level? Or do you think you can bring it down here in April?","David A. Zinsner","Well, our goal -- if you look back last year and use that as a proxy, our utilization -- we actually increased our utilization up into the 60s last year and let the inventory go up. This time around, we're just tweaking the utilization up a little bit in an effort to get our inventories down a little bit in absolute dollars. And in addition, since revenue will be up, that should bring the days of inventory down several days, I would imagine. So our goal is to get kind of days of inventory down this quarter and kind of position us for even more significant operating -- or gross margin leverage in the back half of the year, assuming the recovery continues.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And just as a follow-up, guys, if you step back and look at historical revenues and profits, I think April of 2011 was your revenue peak, it was around $800 million and you were generating operating margins of around 38%. If we were to get back to $800 million, is that still sort of a reasonable number to assume for operating margins? Or do you think you can maybe do a little bit better than that?","David A. Zinsner","Yes. I mean, I think it's a first order. We're definitely committed to getting back to those same growth in operating margins at those similar revenue levels. There are things that we're doing internally to even goose that up further. But first, we'd like to just get the recovery underway. But we have been investing in the industrial and communications markets more significantly than we have in the past so as to have a better mix in terms of gross margins. And we do some things on the finance side to help manage and improve disciplines around cost and pricing to help drive the margins further. So we think all those things are in the cards for us. So at a minimum, we get back to the same gross margins. And hopefully, if we can execute to the things we think we can, we can even do better.","Jerald G. Fishman","I think that Dave said earlier, one step at a time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Eliscu with UBS.","Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just kind of following up on the expense question. On -- specifically on OpEx, if we get some good growth over the next several quarters, 4 to 8 quarters, are we going to see a catch-up in the variable portion of OpEx that potentially makes OpEx grow faster than sales? Or have you instituted some limits there that keep OpEx to grow below sales growth?","David A. Zinsner","I think you've seen in the past, we've done a pretty good job of managing OpEx and not letting one component of it drive the behavior of the operating expenses. Our goal is to grow OpEx at a rate that's slower than the revenue growth. We intend to get leverage from the model. So I think you can expect operating expenses to grow at a rate that's below revenue growth.","Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And as a follow-up question, in the automotive sector, we have seen historically where that's been among your fastest-growing segments. Has something now changed in that segment where perhaps industrial, especially as we see the restocking there, assume the growth leadership over the next few quarters? Or does the content growth and just overall macro get automotive back to that fastest-growing segment?","Vincent T. Roche","Well, it has been clearly the fastest-growing segment over the past number of years for ADI. Over just the very, very recent short term, the luxury car manufacturers have shown very, very strong output, for example, particularly the German car manufacturers. So I think it's a mixture of -- over the last number of years, it's been a case of the market is just craving technology to differentiate automobiles in general for powertrain, for safety and for entertainment. And we have a good position in all 3 spaces. We're not overly dependent in any 1 area. All 3 areas are growing nicely. So given also that we've raised our R&D investments in that area in the past 3 years and that we're very well-positioned with the mid- to high-end car manufacturers, in particular, across the globe, as I mentioned in the script, that we're also seeing good penetration at this point in time for our technologies in the Asia region. So it's become a global business for ADI. We have very good reach across the applications, broad technology for MEMS to converters, linear RF and so on. So we're very bullish for the long term. And I think it's really a question of what the market deals rather than ADI specifically, I think will be what the market deals us.","Jerald G. Fishman","I think another clarification would be that in the short term, I think the snapback in industrial will be a little heavier because it went lower, and the inventory went lower relative to historical levels in the industrial market. So in the short term, you might see a factor snap back on the industrial market. But in the longer term, the automotive market still offers great growth prospects. But in the short term, it might be more weighted towards industrial.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shawn Webster with Macquarie.","Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research","I had a question on the communications end market. And I think when you came into the quarter, you were expecting it to be flattish, and then it ended up down 12% sequentially. What were the deviance from your expectations for the January quarter?","Jerald G. Fishman","Oh, we had lower orders. I mean, I don't mean to be facetious, but the -- that business is very lumpy, and we don't get a lot of -- some -- a lot of very accurate forecasts since it's very customer-centric and region-centric and deployment-centric. So I think one of the reasons that our sales was lower is we mis-forecast that. And there's a million reasons but basically was that capital spending in that sector was very weak, particularly into year-end, weaker than we had thought. And as a result, our sales were lower. Again, it's very hard to predict because of the concentration of customers, but that's what happened.","Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research","So there wasn't any notable trend in terms of geography or wireless versus wired?","Vincent T. Roche","No, it was spread across both the primary segments there and...","Jerald G. Fishman","As we say, our Eastern business and our Western business.","Vincent T. Roche","Yes. And across fixed, as well as wireless. So it was very broad-based.","Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research","Okay. On the 8 weeks of inventory at your channel customers, the -- recognizing that it's kind of like the normal level, when was the last time it was at 8 weeks? Because it's been below 8, I think, for the last year or so.","David A. Zinsner","Yes, it's been about 1.5 years since we've been at 8 weeks.","Jerald G. Fishman","I think the important thing is -- what I pointed out earlier is that the weeks when the revenues are changing quickly is not a great indicator. I mean, distributors order parts based on what they were expecting, not what they have seen last quarter. And when there's a transition in the market, the weeks cause you to come to the wrong conclusion. So you have to basically look at the dollars relative to what the expectation we have for next quarter is. And from that standpoint, that's why distributor orders on us were up.","David A. Zinsner","Yes. I mean, in absolute dollar terms, it was down about $12 million quarter-over-quarter. And we haven't been at this level in absolute dollars since 2010, as low as this since 2010. So this is actually a pretty low level of inventory. It just happens to show up as 8 weeks because of this quarter's revenue level.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Aashish Rao with Merrill Lynch.","Aashish Rao - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","David, in prior cycles, ADI has seen trough-to-peak incremental gross margins of 85% to 90%. Should we expect similar fall-through during this recovery? Or do you think the shift towards more fabless kind of model could result in a lower gross margin fall-through?","David A. Zinsner","We haven't really had much of a shift. It's been running about 50% internal and 50% external basically since I've been here. So it's been pretty stable. And every quarter, it might move 1 percentage point to the 49% or to the 51% in the external side. So I don't think that has any impact on our gross margin leverage going forward. I would say, on a rough quarter, it probably is kind of a net 80%, 85% fall-through for gross margins. Of course, any quarter can be slightly different based on the mix. The more -- obviously, the more internal we have, the better the fall-through is. But I think it's a rough quarter that's probably in the ballpark.","Aashish Rao - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, cool. And then, Jerry, consumer sales fell 20% sequentially in January as expected and kind of guided it to be flat in the second quarter. How was your design win momentum on 2013 products? And how do you sale -- how do you see sales playing out over the course of the year in consumer?","Vincent T. Roche","Our consumer market is the composition of many submarkets, and we very, very carefully picked our places there. You may have noticed, over the last number of years, we've reduced R&D in general in the consumer space. So we're trying to pick those places where we're playing with the market leaders, we're defining problems that are really meaningful to the user experience, that we're able to convince ourselves that we can solve problems that are really meaningful but also that we can invest and maintain a sustainable position. So clearly, I think the momentum for ADI at this point in time is in the portable arena, in particular, but also the imaging area. We have a broader base business in broadcast. It's a reasonably significant part of the consumer space where we have a very, very broad base of products deployed across a lot of customers. So it's a mix but, I would say, dominated by more portable applications in the areas of audio and imaging.","Jerald G. Fishman","I mean, I think one of the questions that we get quite often is, \"Is consumer going to start to dominate your business? And is it going to be a much larger percentage of your revenues? Because that's one of the places that you get very high growth.\" I think our operating assumption is not that, that we don't expect consumer to grow as a percentage of our sales from where it is now, which is 15% to 16%. That's by design because of the volatility. And it's much harder. And as Vince was saying, to find places where you can sustainably add value over many, many generations. So I think our sense is there's tremendous opportunities for growth for ADI in the infrastructure markets. And at the same time, there are good opportunities for us if we're very selective in the consumer market. But I think if we had to sort of stand and look into the future, we'd probably say that if you look out a couple of years, consumer sales would certainly not increase as a percentage of our sales. And that's certainly not the way -- or that's certainly the way we're investing our very scarce R&D dollars right now. So if we have to make a guess of that over the next couple of years, it would probably be about the same percentage of sales as it is right now, no more, probably not much less.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley.","Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wonder -- the big picture -- if I could look at your industrial business, it looks like you're down about 25% or so over the last 8 quarters. If you look at that across the subsegments of industrial, I remember I had a thesis that stuff like medical equipment or energy might not come down as much as everything else in a macro weakness. Did that prove to be true? Or are there segments of industrial that held up better? Or was it pretty uniform across the subsegments that you track?","Vincent T. Roche","Well, the -- I think the part of our business that had the biggest downturn was the instrumentation part. Generally speaking, as you know, the industrial business is very, very CapEx-sensitive. So most parts suffered roughly the same, but I'd say instrumentation was down a little more, particularly large items like big iron ATE, for example, automatic test equipment. But also, factory automation suffered, needless to say. There's been a very rapid build-out of plant and equipment in big manufacturing zones in China, for example. So they're taking a bit of a breather, particularly during the past 12, 15 months. But I think, overall, we saw a fairly, evenly distributed downturn in the subsegments, but instrumentation in this past quarter was a little more affected.","Jerald G. Fishman","I mean, I think over many, many years, our industrial capital spending has been a good trend predictor for our business. And the correlation is very, very tied to that. So typically, what you see is, when industrial capital spending goes down across all those segments that Vince mentioned, our sales react at a very -- very quickly to that. And they also rebound very quickly from that. So it's basically a question of what's going to happen with industrial capital spending around the world over the next couple of quarters. If it turns out that we see some growth in that, reflective of less uncertainty out there, I think our industrial business will do quite well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harsh Kumar with Stephens.","Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Wondering if you could give us an idea if you are more -- your wireless infrastructure is more centric around 3G or 4G. And any kind of split that you may be able to give us a color would be very helpful. And then I have a follow-up.","Vincent T. Roche","Well, our business -- we have a broad business in 3G. That's the dominant part of ADI's wireless infrastructure business at this point in time. The fastest-growing part of infrastructure for ADI is obviously 4G, given the rapid deployments in the Western and Eastern hemispheres. I'd say, at this point in time, the split, I don't have the absolute accuracy here. But I believe 4G is somewhere in the region of 10% at this point in time. The 3G is probably in the region of 70% and 20% in 2G, but the shift is very clearly towards 3 and 4G.","Jerald G. Fishman","And that shift has very positive content implications for ADI. The amount of content we have in 4G is higher than it was in 3G due to the breadth of the product offerings. As Vince talked about it, there's certainly more transceivers -- more radio transceivers in future generations than in prior generations. So I think the design-in base we have in 4G or it's equivalent in most locations is very strong, which is why it's one of the reasons why we're enthusiastic. As those deployments accelerate, we hope, in the second half of the year, we should do fine.","Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Very, very helpful. And then, Dave, I'm not sure if you gave a number for the loading of -- expected loading on the fab for the 2Q time frame.","David A. Zinsner","I said utilization -- you mean on the utilization base? Is that what you're asking, Harsh?","Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Yes.","David A. Zinsner","So I think I've said in the prepared remarks that utilization will be in the high 50s, [indiscernible] in the mid '50s this quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie with Raymond James.","Steven Smigie","Dave, just a housekeeping question. If we were to get the R&D tax credit back again for fiscal '14, would you likely run around that same 17% in that year as well?","David A. Zinsner","Yes.","Steven Smigie","Okay, great. And then just sort of a higher-level growth question. Overall, if we were to get into a more normalized environment, it seems like -- where it seems like maybe we're trending towards -- given all the dollar content increases you're getting on multiple devices out there, would you be able to achieve something like a 3x GDP growth? Let's say global GDP was 4%, could you hit a 12% growth? Or is 8% to 10% sort of more a reasonable assumption?","Jerald G. Fishman","It's very hard to tell because it's speculation, but I'd say more the latter than the former.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with Caris.","Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Dave, just to start off with you, nice dividend increase here after a substantial dividend increase a year ago. Can you just help us understand what the parameters were that helped you and the board settle on the $0.04 increase? And how do we think about any potential for further increase from here?","David A. Zinsner","Yes, sure. So one thing I think the board has proven and ADI has proven, that we're pretty committed on the dividend. And maybe more broadly speaking, we're pretty committed to returning cash to shareholders. If you go back to 2003 when we started the dividend, and I think shortly after that, started a pretty meaningful buyback program, we've given back about $6.5 billion to investors over the course of the last, you know what, 9, 10 years. So that's a commitment that they've had in the past. That's a commitment that the board and senior management have in the future. So I think, largely, increases in dividend are going to be dependent obviously on earnings. And as we grow earnings, I think you could expect us to continue to grow the dividend. We think it's a great vehicle to kind of systematically and routinely provide cash back to our investors. You'll still see us do buybacks. We're committed to that program as well. I think we said we have a little over $500 million in the buyback program that exists. We'll go out and get more if we need to. We're going to be a bit more opportunistic on the buyback side. It's going to depend a little bit on the stock price and its relationship to kind of historical averages and things like that. But I think you'll see us be committed both on the buyback and the dividend. I mean, our goal was, historically, we had paid back a payout ratio, I think, of about 40%. Our payout -- our goal was to get the payout ratio up. We didn't have a specific number in mind other than to say we wanted to be -- it to be more meaningful as a percent of our earnings. And that was the basis around why we increased the dividend this quarter. The other thing is, I think we felt like we had some confidence around a quarter, too, that was going to be much better than our first quarter. We felt we were getting our legs under us from the inventory work-downs that we had experienced in the prior few quarters. And so now seems like the appropriate time to ramp the dividend again.","Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then just a follow-up question. And I know there's been a lot of focus on industrials. And this is either for Jerry or Vince. If you look at your end markets, it seems like they're all coming back pretty strongly. But I'm wondering if you can provide some of the same color on a geographic basis. Are you seeing a fairly uniform recovery geographically? Or are there certain geographies that are really leading and others that are lagging? And if so, which would those be?","Vincent T. Roche","I'd say -- let me start with the weakest. I'd say the recovery in Japan, if there is one, is very, very muted. Europe is getting back to some kind of a strength, but I'd say the better growth is in America and China, somewhere between America and Europe at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Dave, for you. CapEx for 2013, can you offer a number for us?","David A. Zinsner","Yes, sure. Our goal is to be around $100 million. I think we put a range in there of $90 million to $120 million or so, give or take. I think right now, the way the trajectory is working, it looks like we're going to land pretty much on the $100 million.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","All right. And can you highlight for us where you think you might run into some capacity constraints? What I'm really looking for here is some sort of impetus in the market where we might find that lead times are to stretch the soonest.","David A. Zinsner","I don't think we're going to be the great proxy for lead time expansion. We're pretty good at keeping our lead times pretty short. As I mentioned, we're only bringing our utilization up to the high 50s this quarter. We have 121 days of inventory. We have -- we seem to be in pretty good shape on the back-end, but that's the nature of our model. We like to be on the side of keeping our lead times short, not have a lot of double bookings and stuff. At some point, I would imagine some competitors who manage things much more tightly, you might run into that situation. But that's probably not going to be us, Doug.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","All right. If I could, Jerry, for you and Vince. Could you offer some commentary on what you're seeing as far as ASP trends? I know there were some efforts a few years back to try to push some of your ASPs higher. Has that been successful? And do you think you could move your ASP mix over time?","Vincent T. Roche","Well, it depends very much on the market. In general, by the way, our ASPs are very, very stable. As Jerry mentioned just a little while ago, we are seeing ASP extensions particularly in areas like communications infrastructure where for successive generations of technology deployment, we're just getting more content, more value and per application. The same is true in the automotive space. I would say industrial is very, very stable. But as a corporation, we're always looking for ways to just essentially price the technology that we have to the value we're creating and do our best to hold it. So -- but I think it's true across the board.","Jerald G. Fishman","Yes, I mean, I think the point that Vince raised, this is exactly the right one, is that there's a lot of ways to get your prices up. One way is you can just go after your customers and say, \"By the way, what you used to buy for x, you're now buying for 1.05x.\" And generally, that doesn't have a happy ending. There are other ways to do it in terms of price management, in terms of making sure that your value keeps going up to customers. And I think we're more on the value creation side than just random price increases, which is not our history and not what our customers expect to do. But when you have 10,000 products that you sell to 100,000 customers, a very small movement to that make a big difference. And there's a lot of more professional price management that we can do that is quite well-anticipated by our customers. So it's really a whole bunch of things, but these things are very long-term programs. And we do see beginnings of movement on some of that stuff. But just to clarify because somebody asked us this question last time, we're not going out just raising prices willy-nilly to customers because we know that doesn't end well.","Vincent T. Roche","I think you're aware that a large part of our industrial business, for example, goes through the channel, and a large part of that business again is with smaller customers, a lot of  products, smaller customers with very, very long life cycles. And that business tends to run off book cost forever. So a large part of our business is essentially transacted once, and we never have to reprice that business again. So most of the critical management of pricing is obviously with larger customers in large market sectors.","Jerald G. Fishman","One of the other point, I think, that's worth noting is that one of the very unique services that ADI had to offer for many, many years and continues to in the future is we don't discontinue many products. So for these customers that Vince was talking about that has very long life cycles, many of these customers buy our products for 20 years. And a lot of it -- and this is true with the small accounts, it's also true in some of the very large accounts. And when we go out and visit those customers, we hear that, that's a very, very important aspect of what customers really value because when they're not using many parts for application, to go redesign a 20-year-old part out doesn't get them great economic benefit and if the margin causes them great economic pains. So I think we have concluded that, that is very valuable to customers. Our customers are willing to pay us for that because the design costs of changes is so high. So these are really sophistications of our model as compared to vast changes in corporate philosophies.","Ali Husain","Great. Thank you. Well, that's all our callers for today.

Roche","Thanks, Ali, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. As you've seen from our press release, revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $678 million, up about 1% from the previous quarter and within the range we have provided. Diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.62, up 9% from the previous quarter and above the high end of our range. Business conditions during the quarter were generally stable worldwide in spite of the U.S. government shutdown in the early part of October. Now, while we did not see precipitous declines in business as a result, we believe that the uncertainty created by such an event impacts our business, particularly in our industrial and communications infrastructure businesses, which together make up over 60% of our sales and are highly dependent on capital spending.","Let me take a moment to talk about our performance for the full year of 2013. Reflecting the uncertain economic and political climate during the year, revenue declined 2% to about $2.6 billion. Overall, virtually all of our end markets were flat to down in fiscal 2013, with the exception of automotive, which grew 4% over the prior year. This was really a tale of 2 halves in fiscal '13, with the second half of the year showing some good momentum, and our industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure markets combining for 8% growth in the second half as compared to the first, which is a positive sign. For the year, gross margins of 64.3%, operating margins of 30%, excluding special items, and diluted EPS of $2.15 on the same basis were credible results in what was a challenging environment.","Our operating cash flow was over $900 million or 35% of sales, and free cash flow totaled $789 million or 30% of sales. In addition, we enhanced shareholder returns with dividends and share repurchases that totaled over $460 million or 59% of free cash flow. And our total shareholder return for the year was 28%.","Turning to our performance by end market, during the fourth quarter, our growth was led by the automotive segment. Now revenues in this segment were better than expected, increasing 9% sequentially and 19% on a year-on-year basis on strength across infotainment, safety and powertrain applications. Revenue was bolstered from new infotainment platforms that are moving into production and the ramp of our next-generation safety platforms, including ADI's radar, that are seeing higher adoption rates. In powertrain, our self-start battery monitoring technology gained wider traction in more mainstream higher volume vehicles, further fueling potential growth. As the electrification of the car continues to gather momentum, ADI is aligning investments to provide increasing levels of content that enable lower emissions and higher fuel efficiency. The automotive sector continues to be a very good growth business for ADI with a 3-year revenue CAGR of 13%. This business totaled 19% of sales in the fourth quarter.","The industrial sector represented 46% of sales and grew 2% over the same quarter in the prior year and was flat sequentially. The overall flat sequential performance showed positive trends within industrial. Our automation and process control business saw a third consecutive quarter of growth driven primarily by customers in North America and Asia. As we projected, last quarter our Defense and Aerospace business recovered in the fourth quarter, growing by more than 10%. The instrumentation business, after growing strongly in the second and third quarters, declined sequentially due to lower revenue from automated tech equipment customers, primarily in the areas of smartphones, tablets and other devices with wireless connectivity. The remainder of our instrumentation business serving a broad customer base was flat sequentially. Instrumentation was, however, stronger in the second half compared to the first, as well as our total industrial business.","We are confident about the myriad of opportunities within the industrial sector as customers take advantage of ADI's high-performance signal processing technology and system domain knowledge to create more intelligent, connected and energy-efficient systems, including robotics, textures and other factories and process automation systems. We believe these trends, in addition to the opportunities still ahead in areas like health care, smart grid and motor controls, should result in higher growth rates in our industrial business in the future.","Communications infrastructure, after growing 13% in the prior quarter, was flat in the fourth and represented 21% of total sales. In wireless infrastructure, we saw a modest sequential growth tied to deployments in North America and Asia, which was somewhat offset by inventory reductions at some base station customers. As a result, overall wireless revenue was flat sequentially and represented approximately 2\/3 of our total communications infrastructure revenue. We continue to be optimistic about the prospects for our wireless infrastructure business, and we expect growth to resume in 2014 as U.S. capacity deployments accelerate, China builds out its 4G network and the European communications market, which is showing signs of a recovery where the CapEx catch-up accelerates into 2014.","Our wireline business was also flat after a strong third quarter. We saw a good performance related to 100-gig optical systems for transmission and Metro networking infrastructure, as well as backhaul systems for LTE networks, which was offset by declines in products sold into the lower-speed networks. Longer term, the buildup of cloud connectivity and backhaul connections in response to high-bandwidth data demand should drive good growth for our wireline business, where ADI's focus on precision control and timing is a key enabler of high-performance optical systems. This, together with our strong high-speed signal processing solutions delivering next-generation cable solutions should also drive strong growth opportunities for ADI.","And finally, our consumer business, which was 14% of sales in the fourth quarter, decreased sequentially as a result of declines in areas within consumer where we no longer focus. We've spent many years refining our mix within consumer and refocusing our investment dollars. For example, during the fourth quarter, we completed the divestiture of our microphone product line. Notably, consumer revenue outside of the microphone area increased sequentially.","I believe there are many good opportunities ahead for ADI consumer, where we can leverage our existing core technology into applications that make a demonstrable difference to the user experience. Our design activity is strong, particularly in the portable space, where the timing of revenue for ADI would primarily be a function of our customers' product cycles rather than seasonality.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Dave who will take you through some of the details of our financial results.","David A. Zinsner","Thanks, Vince, and good afternoon, everyone. Fourth quarter revenue increased about 1% sequentially and declined 2% year-over-year to $678 million. Our gross margin was 65.6% in the fourth quarter, and this was up 110 basis points from the third quarter, primarily on higher factory utilization.","We continue to carefully manage production in our facilities. Utilization increased from the mid-60s in the third quarter to the high 60s in the fourth quarter. On a days basis, inventory increased by 2 days to 111 days in the fourth quarter and is in good position relative to our model. On a dollars basis, inventory on our balance sheet declined by $1 million and is now at its lowest level in 11 quarters.","We started the fiscal year by dropping our utilization rate down to the low 50s and over the course of the year, average low 60s utilization rates, bringing our inventory on a dollars basis down by $30 million or 10% compared to the same time last year, while maintaining solid gross margins of 64-plus percent and continuing high service levels to our customers. Lead times for our direct OEM customers remain similar to last quarter and are in good control with virtually all of our shipments to OEMs occurring within 4 weeks. We plan to decrease utilization to the mid-60s in the first quarter, which should keep our inventory on a dollars basis approximately flat to fourth quarter levels.","Inventory distribution on a days basis was slightly above 7 weeks, which is lower than the prior quarter. Total end customer orders decreased in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, and our book-to-bill was below 1 in advance of our seasonally lower first quarter.","During the quarter, we recorded a $16 million restructuring charge redirecting resources to areas we believe have better ROIs. Excluding this charge, operating expenses were $229 million, up $2.5 million from the prior quarter.","Operating profit before tax for the fourth quarter, excluding the restructuring charge, were $215 million or 31.8% of sales, up 90 basis points from the prior quarter. Other expense of approximately $3 million in the fourth quarter, excluding any special items, was flat to the third quarter and reflects the ongoing run rate of our net interest expense at current debt levels.","During the quarter, we reported an accrual of approximately $37 million related to our pending petition with the Tax Court. While we believe our tax position is appropriate, a recent Tax Court ruling in a matter not involving ADI required recording of this accrual. Combined with the taxes related to the gain on the sale of our microphone product line, this had a result of a tax rate of 29% in the fourth quarter. Excluding these items, our tax rate in the fourth quarter was approximately 8%, which reflects an adjustment of our annual tax rate from 14.5% to 12.9%. Based on current assumptions, we expect our tax rate in the fiscal 2014 year to be approximately 13%.","Diluted earnings per share, excluding the special items I mentioned, was $0.62 and $0.04 of it related to the fourth quarter tax rate adjustments that I mentioned. For the year, diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, were $2.15, up 1% from the prior year.","Cash flow in the fourth quarter was very strong, with operating cash flow representing 42% of revenue or $282 million. CapEx was $49 million, resulting in free cash flow of $234 million or 34% of revenue. For the year, CapEx was $123 million and our fiscal 2014 plan is for CapEx to be around $150 million. 2\/3 of that relates to ongoing capital spend and about 1\/3 of it is for new facilities.","Our cash and short-term investments balance increased by about $233 million during the fourth quarter and now stands at $4.7 billion, with $1.3 billion available domestically. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had approximately $870 million in debt outstanding, resulting in a net cash position of $3.8 billion.","We also distributed approximately $106 million in dividends to our shareholders, and on November 25, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.34 per outstanding share of common stock, and that will be paid on December 17 to all shareholders of record as of December 6. At the current stock price, this dividend represents an annual yield of 2.7%.","During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $43 million of our stock, with most of the repurchases occurring later in the quarter as a more aggressively tuned stock buyback program responded to lower stock prices. During the year, we increased our dividend 13% and in the fourth quarter, our combination of dividends and share repurchases represented 64% of our free cash flow.","So in summary, fourth quarter and fiscal 2013 delivered solid results in a pretty tough macroeconomic environment. We believe the portfolio and productivity actions we have taken during this cycle set us up for significant leverage and sales increase. Factory utilization improves from current levels, and we continue to control operating expenses. So now I'll turn the call back over to Vince, who will discuss ADI's outlook for the next quarter.","Vincent T. Roche","Thanks, Dave. Well, we're starting the first quarter with lower opening backlog, and order trends, while stable overall in the fourth quarter, were lower than in the prior quarter. In addition, many of our largest customers have plans for shutdowns during our fiscal first quarter to coincide with the Christmas and New Year holidays and plan to reduce inventories heading into their December year ends. As it turns out as well, the Lunar and New Year in Asia falls in late January, which is also within our fiscal quarter. In our distribution channel, the story is also quite similar with our largest distributors calling for a seasonal or marginally down performance for their December quarter end. We are, therefore, planning for our sales in the first quarter to decrease in the range of minus 5% to minus 10%, which at the midpoint is in line with how our business as it performed over the last 3 years in the first quarter, even when accounting for differences relating to the divestiture of our microphone business.","Based on this expectation of lower sales, we plan to reduce production levels in the first quarter, which we expect will reduce gross margins to between 64% and 65%. We plan to manage our expenses as always very carefully, and as a result, we expect our operating expenses to decline about $3 million to approximately $226 million in the first quarter. We are expecting our tax rates in the first quarter to be approximately 13%. So given these assumptions, our diluted earnings per share should be in the range of $0.44 to $0.52 in the first quarter.","Our largest customers are approaching 2014 with guarded optimism about their growth prospects. Our industrial customers are talking about an impending upgrade cycle in automation and process control systems. In addition, the secular growth opportunities in automotive and communications infrastructure continue to unfold, so we also expect to benefit there.","As we close out fiscal 2013, I also think it's important to reflect upon our performance over a longer period of time. The last 3 years has been a slow growth environment as you all know, with demand being constrained by deferred capital spending decisions. For ADI, where much of our business is tied to some form of capital spend, this has a very real impact on our revenue performance. While we cannot control the macroeconomic environment, we can centrally control how we run our business relative to it. Over the past 3 years, we've been very busy at ADI, refocusing our R&D investments and technologies that target the most attractive growth opportunities, pushing the cutting-edge of our signal processing technology also. We have been deepening and broadening our customer engagements, while ensuring supply chain agility to respond to changing business conditions.","Now, for example, in fiscal 2010, automotive made up only 12% of our sales. In 2013, we exit the year with automotive now making up almost 20% of our total sales, as we have continued to gain share of market in this space. Conversely in 2010, our consumer business made up 22% of revenues compared to only 14% now, thus significantly improving the mix of our overall business.","In addition, in our just-completed quarter, we sold our microphone business, which was primarily focused on consumer applications, so that we can focus our MEMS investments on higher growth opportunities in industrial and automotive applications. On the manufacturing side, we have efficiently managed the production levels in our fabs and responded quickly to business conditions, ramping utilization rates as high as the low 80s in the second quarter of fiscal 2011, at greater than 67% gross margins, while dropping utilization rates down to the low 50s in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 while still maintaining greater than 62% gross margins. During this time, we've maintained exceptional service levels for customers and kept inventories under very tight control.","We have not allowed this period of slow economic growth to slow our returns to shareholders. Earlier in the year, we committed to returning an average of 80% of our generated free cash flow to shareholders over the next 5 years, which is a significant increase from the 60% of free cash flow we have averaged in the prior 3 years. In addition, in that period of time, we've grown our dividend at a 16% CAGR and our total shareholder return is 17% on a 3-year compounded annual basis. Now, all of this puts ADI on a strong platform on which to build our future. At ADI, we have a deeply talented and committed workforce across all functions in the company. We possess the broadest and deepest signal processing technology portfolio in the industry that we're bringing to bear on our customers' greatest engineering challenges each and every day. As many of you know, we hold leadership positions in the foundational technologies for signal processing, namely converters and high-performance linear products. Over 2\/3 of our overall sales come from these 2 product areas, where we are continuing to gain share. The convergence of pervasive sensing, cloud and mobility we expect will create a strong growth opportunity for ADI in the future.","We continue to align our portfolio of choices with the most attractive opportunities, and we continue to work hard to broaden and deepen our customer relationships. We remain flexible so that when the world recovers from its current malaise, ADI will be better positioned than ever to drive top line growth, strong operating leverage and earnings growth and higher returns for our shareholders.","Ali Husain","Thank you, Vince. [Operator Instructions] So with that, operator, we can start taking questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Steve Smigie with Raymond James.","Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the guidance in terms of the divested business that's I think your point you're saying would have been down about seasonally what you've been seeing over the past few years. So if you added back in that microphone business, can you talk about what that would be down and if that would even be potentially above seasonally when you add that back in?","David A. Zinsner","Probably the easier way, Steve, to talk about it is to talk about how that impacted our guidance rather than what would have happened had we had the business because now we have the visibility and the fact that we sold it already. I think that we would have been kind of 1% better had it not been for the fact that, that business kind of went away. So the guidance of 5 to 10, it would have been like 4 to 9.","Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the comm market as well. I think there's been some fits and starts at some of the China rollouts here. And I'm just curious if you could talk about your dollar content. I think, say you have several hundred dollar content on a particular base station. Even at 200,000 base stations at least in this first phase, would that really be enough to significantly move the numbers here, or is that just a piece of the puzzle, and you've really got to have continuing 3G buildout, you got to continue to have other regions buildout to keep or give you opportunity for revenue growth over, say, 2014?","Vincent T. Roche","Yes. Well, Steve, maybe the best way to answer that question, the ASP, the system ASP for the content of ADI provides into a 4G system where the radio architectures are very, very complex, more complex than the prior generations. We're getting about 20% more ASP. That varies from customer to customer, how do the channels run in the systems, and so on, so forth. But an average of 20% more ASP. Now, obviously the ultimate result depends on the -- there is a certain amount of replacement value, of course, replacing 3G systems. We believe that we'll move from something like 4G in our 13-year business, fiscal '13 being about 20% of the share to about 40% towards the end of FY '14. So if the unit volumes even stay flat with FY '13 on a system level basis. Just given the ASP increase, we would expect some level of outlet in our numbers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Just based on that guidance you've given us, it looks like fiscal '14, at least at this point, is on track to be flattish, maybe not so much growth unless we get better than seasonal growth in the remaining quarters of the year. So given that, backdrop -- well first, I guess, I'm curious if you guys are more optimistic about next year. And second, onto that assumption, how are you thinking about OpEx growth, again, in fiscal '14?","David A. Zinsner","Yes, well first I probably would challenge that assumption. I mean, if you take away -- the first quarter of last year had a pretty meaningful amount of microphone revenue in there, if you strip that out, I'd say at the midpoint of the guidance, which is a tepid quarter for us, the first quarter will be up kind of mid-single digits. So over the rest of 2013, the microphone business slowly became de minimis. So I think the likely conclusion is that we probably will have a growth year in 2014, a little early to call what the magnitude of that is. From an OpEx perspective, I think as Vince talked about CEO on down, we've got a pretty hard rein on the OpEx level, and we're going to manage it pretty tightly until we start to see some revenue growth. And I think we've got all the dials in place to be able to do that. We did take a restructuring charge this quarter. It gave up, freed up some expense but enable us to double down the areas we wanted to and not have kind of a headwind in terms of expenses. On top of that, we sold the microphone business; that certainly carried some expenses and we realized that capacity to be able to manage through this without too much trouble. So I think we're -- I feel pretty confident that we're going to be able to manage the OpEx to get leverage through to the quarter assuming -- through the year, rather, assuming revenue had some growth to it.","Vincent T. Roche","Let me add just one other comments to it, Romit. I would say looking into '14, unless we had some major turbulence on the geopolitical or the -- I think events out of our control, my sense is '14 will be a year of growth. That's my own sense from talking to our customers, just looking at the cycles of our business. We've actually gone through 2 sequential years of revenue decline, and that's an extraordinary -- very, very unusual in our business. We've been in this business almost 50 years. So what we're seeing is the macro delays just dampening enthusiasm and people's willingness to spend CapEx. But my own sense is '14 will see an improvement barring some geopolitical turbulence there.","David A. Zinsner","Did you have a follow-up, Romit?","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Yes. Just within OpEx, drilling into R&D as a percentage of sales, I'm sure you've probably noticed that it's about -- R&D is about 7 to 8 points above your largest competitor in analog. And does TI have economies of scale for being larger or do you guys feel like the investment you're making in R&D actually positions you for better growth looking out over the next 12 to 24 months?","Vincent T. Roche","Well, we believe that innovation -- from the superior innovation brings superior results. We have the best signal processing story on the market. We have the broadest technology base, and we are pushing the edge like hell to allow us to have the best building blocks, to allow us to have the best ability to integrate into complete signal processing solutions that we need. And my belief as well is that we will get -- we've been making a lot of choices over the last 3 or 4 years in terms of the products that we picked in the markets that we really care about, and we're going to see the benefit of those choices I believe over the next year or 2 years. So I think if we can get this business into a 6%, 8% -- which is our expectation, by the way, 8% plus I believe is possible in -- when that kind of spend where -- we're spending because we believe in the growth possibilities, and we stick with that piece.","Operator","Your next question comes from Aashish Rao with Bank of America.","Aashish Rao - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Dave, within your Jan quarter guidance of down 5% to 10%, I don't think I heard you say this on the call but could you provide some relative color on sales expectations in the 4 different end markets?","David A. Zinsner","I think Vince talked about it in his outlook that we expected all end markets to be down sequentially. Most -- I'd say usually every end market is down in the first quarter sequentially, at least it has been over the last few years. So pretty consistent with the kind of the normal seasonal patterns we see for all end markets. Do you have a follow up, Aashish?","Aashish Rao - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, so I'm guessing so you're basically saying everything is down roughly in that 5% to 10% kind of range?","David A. Zinsner","Yes, I think consumer will be a little bit weaker because it definitely has a bigger seasonal headwind in the first quarter. But they all will be down.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, Dave, just a follow-up to that question, if you look at the seasonal pattern over the last 3 years, you guys are guiding this January quarter about in line with seasonal. But you go back further seasonality was a little bit better for you guys, i.e. down less than January. So I guess, when you look at the guidance for Jan, are you characterizing this as sort of normal seasonality or do you think some of the macro issues that you talked about are also weighing in the guidance?","David A. Zinsner","Three years is a pretty good history and I think we were down 10% the first and the last 2 years and the year before that, I think we were down 7% or 5%. So it's -- I mean, it's kind of in the range of what we would normally expect. I mean, clearly, the cyclical kind of tailwinds and headwinds have a big impact at times, and right now, there doesn't feel like a big updraft in our businesses. Typically in the second quarter, we do see a lot, a much stronger environment because of the industrial space. So we will wait and see how it happens. But, I mean, I think we guided last year down 6% to 12%, so down 5% to 10% is better than that. I think the year before, we guided 5% to 10% so it's relatively consistent with our guidance the year before. So this is all kind of, plus or minus 1% or 2% of the norm.","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Perfect. And then guys just maybe a little bit longer term, so you guys talked about your industrial and communication exposure as being reasons why the growth has been somewhat lackluster. But a lot of your peers have similar type exposure albeit you might be a little bit on the high end. And if I look at the data, you continue to kind of undergrow the analog industry and many of your peers, and I'm kind of curious as to why you think that is. And then I guess, more importantly, what's the catalyst to get to guys back into a position of outsized growth relative to peers?","Vincent T. Roche","Well, I think you've got to take the window, the measurement window into account. Nothing moves, the share doesn't move rapidly in the industrial space, and many of our competitors, by the way, lump a lot of different subsectors into industrial, such as automotive, for example. So we separate automotive and focus our discussions always on the component parts of our industrial business, automation, instrumentation, aero and energy. We have a growing position with our key customers. We've put a lot of focus over the last 5 or 6 years into not only the long-tail, augmenting the long-tail of our business across the 50,000, 60,000 customers, but also committing R&D to applications and programs that the larger industrial customers care about. So we're -- as I said earlier, we're starting to see the benefit of the design and pipeline in those areas with a lot of new products that we put in place over the last 3, 4 years. And I think we will see, as we've said before, there are some longer-term trends around energy efficiency, smart machines, smarter energy that we will see the benefit of over the long term. So I think for us, it's both a focus on the customer, on the application, on the product and focusing our investments very, very heavily, and being able to grasp the opportunity there. And again in communication infrastructure, it depends very much on the window you're taking to make the measurements. But in the core areas, the core technology areas of converter and linear, we have gained share in the communications infrastructure space year-over-year for the past several years. I think it's really been a case of the environment being muted from a macro perspective, and CapEx being dampened that has hurt sales.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Danely with JPMorgan.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A bit of a longer-term question here. So you're sort of giving up the seasonals over the last few years and the overall not just spending environment but global demand environment has stuck for the last few years, and it doesn't seem like there's any change coming. So, I guess, my question is you have a fair amount of cash offshore, but actually a lot of cash. What's the desire, the thoughts around using that cash in some way, shape or form to help either growth or performance of the stock, either bring it back and just pay the tax penalty or lever up and do something with that or make some sort of acquisition or something else? Can you just give us your thoughts on that? And then if there's anything interesting there.","David A. Zinsner","Yes, that's a loaded question. Yes, well, I mean, first of all, we have $1.3 billion domestically. We have plenty of options with the cash we have on the U.S. books. If we follow through that, then we'll decide what to do beyond that. The priorities for that cash are, of course, with our cash flow from operations generated in the U.S. We utilize mostly that to pay the dividend. And on the excess, we're looking to either buy back stock or do some small kind of tuck-in M&A deals to help kind of amp up the growth rate. And I think both of those you're going to see over the foreseeable future. You saw kind of the beginnings of our share repurchase program starting to kick in. I would tell you that we had perhaps, say, becoming the alpha ourselves a little bit and perhaps not quite the aggressive structure we wanted to put in place in order to get stock buybacks to start percolating. We recognized that, obviously, and in the fourth quarter towards actually the tail end of the fourth quarter, we tweaked the model to make sure we did buy back stock. That started to take effect and I think you'll see that going forward, and we continue to look for opportunities to do M&A work. We're very selective in what we look at. We have a high bar for what we're going to utilize our cash reserves for. And so -- there'll be sporadic in nature for sure, but there'll certainly be, I think, the opportunity for us to grow the top line through M&A and the bottom line through a combination of M&A and taking shares off the Street.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First question is a near-term one. The second one is a longer-term one. And the near-term one, was there any change in linearity and specifically, did the latter part, the month of October, get to -- get weaker to lead to this guidance that's clearly below the Street as -- regardless of how we want to define seasonality?","David A. Zinsner","Yes, I wouldn't call it significantly weaker, but I mean, I think we kind of track orders on a weekly basis, kind of on a 13-week rolling average. And they came out of July pretty strong. So we had a benefit of that going into August, looked pretty good. I'd say it did modestly trend downward over the course of the 3 months. And so that did perhaps for us at least kind of changed the dynamics of what we thought about for the first quarter. Having said that, we quite -- can't quite understand exactly why the Street had us down to the level that they did because if you go back in history, it's pretty clear that we declined kind of in the 5% to 10% range typically most years. So we were a little bit surprised that, that had gotten disconnected. But we guide on a quarterly basis, and so we're updating you guys to let you know that, yes, indeed, it will be more from us -- a seasonal pattern for us in the first quarter.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So, I guess, my longer-term question and the follow-up side is on the comp side of the equation. Any number of companies have talked about that being a great growth opportunity going forward because LTE, et cetera, but -- yet any number of those with that telecom exposure have continued to disappoint and ask investors to just wait until the goodness comes. It's just one quarter beyond the horizon over and over again. Do you believe there's any aspect where we have a substitution effect going on, where 3G spending is going down at the same time 4G is going up, and so we all focus on the 4G side, but the 3G side is something that's missed? Or what would you use as the explanation as to why that segment, maybe not ADI-specific, but overall has continued to be a relative challenge versus investor expectations?","Vincent T. Roche","They know, Ross. I mean, the replacement cycle has been going on for 2 decades now between 1G, 2G, 2.5G, 3G and so on and so forth. And so there's nothing new there. And, of course, as the technologies become a little bit more mature, customers get what they call productivity from year-to-year. So that's been a facet of the business. There's no question. There is some replacement of 3G with 4G, but I think there are dynamics happening. Every system from generation to generation, the complexity increases and the amount of technology that a supplier has got to have to be able to address the more integrated solutions that are taking place from generation to generation is a competitive differentiator. And we've been investing heavily over the past 5 years to bring out the most sophisticated radio architectures to allow our customers, to build more complete transceiver technologies and to extend from the baseband right into the RF. So I think there's a significant technology differentiation that you'll see the benefit of -- that we will see the benefit of in the years ahead. I think also on the customer side, there's a consolidation taking place. The bigger suppliers will become bigger, and I think the smaller bit players will fall off the edge, so -- and partnering is becoming a more distinct part of the activity between ourselves and many of our customers. So I think -- and also when you augment -- sorry, you complement those comments with the fact that 4G systems are going to allow people to do things in terms of moving social media, mobile, video data in a much more user-friendly way, I think the future looks good at least from a technology and customer perspective for ADI from a market perspective.","Ali Husain","Thanks, Ross. I think that was your follow-up. And folks, we're closing in pretty hard on the 6:00 hour here. We have quite a few number of callers still on the line, so I'd ask you that at this stage, please limit yourself to one question. [Operator Instructions] I'd take this quick opportunity here to also remind everyone that our Q1 FY 14 earnings call is scheduled for February 18, 2014, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time. And operator, with that we'll go to our last few callers and one question please at this stage. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tristan Gerra with Baird.","Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just as a follow-up to the LTE question, I think recently, 3G revenue was about 70% of your mix on the communication infrastructure side. Is that 3G portion of revenue declining and specifically, since we are assuming LTE is less than 10% despite the 20% increase in comp and that you mentioned earlier on the call, is it fair to say that 3G decline could actually at least offset that LTE ramp currently?","Vincent T. Roche","Well, clearly, 4G is growing as a proportion of the overall total. The 2G system builds are very, very small now. So it really is a case of our wireless communications infrastructure business being driven by 3G and 4G deployments. So my sense is who knows exactly how the share will tally at the end of 2014, but I believe that we're -- today, we're at around 20% in terms of our total mix being 4G. I think by the end of 2014, we will see 4G being somewhere between 30% and probably closer to 40% of our total.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Wong with Wells Fargo.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","With planned production levels you have for the coming quarter, what will your utilization rate be and what percentage of current products will be manufactured at foundries?","David A. Zinsner","Yes, I think we're going to be in the mid to low 60s in terms of utilization -- I'm sorry, David, what was the other question you said?","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And with that, what percent of your total product will be manufactured at foundries in the coming quarters?","David A. Zinsner","Oh, probably about 50% will be manufactured in foundries.","Operator","Your next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just want to follow up, you talked about inventory reductions in base stations. That's obviously after the strong July. So was that China Mobile-related? And then if you could just talk about whether you're getting any indications of when that will work through.","David A. Zinsner","I don't know specifically what region of the world they were selling it to. It was really one OEM, and they expect it to be done by -- I think their goal was to have it cleaned up in their minds by the end of the calendar year, probably for reporting purposes. So my expectation is we'll be done here pretty shortly, and we'll be back to normal pretty quickly.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Vince, just following up on the 4% growth in autos last year and your comments on start-stop, just anything from a design perspective, what you're seeing as we go into fiscal '14 and what you're thinking for automotive growth.","Vincent T. Roche","We believe it will be a growth year. What we saw this year was strength gaining throughout the -- from quarter-to-quarter. The second half was quite a bit stronger than the -- the second half was quite a bit stronger than the first half. And our fourth quarter saw a 19% gain over the fourth quarter in the prior year. So we're seeing good strength overall in all the sectors of powertrain, safety and infotainment. So we have a lot of exciting things happening in terms of being able to drive that growth further. We're seeing -- I think if you look over the last 3 or 4 years, each of those 3 sectors has been growing in the -- at a compounded -- double-digit compounded rate. And I think over the next few years, we can probably look at a 10% growth rate for that business, given that the denominator is as big as it is now. So -- but I think we have a lot of new programs that are coming into play. We have a lot of exciting new technologies that are at the early stages of adoption. And as I've mentioned before as well, our business has been very centered -- at least in the early stages was very centered on European and American customers, so we've been able to complement that over the last couple of years with a good design and activity and design traction in Asia -- as well as Japan and Asia. So I'm very optimistic, given that car companies still differentiate their offerings with electronics technology of which semiconductor is the foundation. So more and more sensing, all good stuff for ADI and I feel optimistic this year coming, as well as the -- over the longer term.","Operator","Your next question comes from Terence Whalen with Citi.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","This question has to do with the comment you made about Chinese New Year and the January 31 date. I was wondering to what degree quantitatively in terms of percentage of revenue do you think that's an impact versus, say, if we got a later Chinese New Year in mid-February?","David A. Zinsner","I have no idea, Terence. It could be a complete guess. I mean, it's probably -- certainly, that whole area shuts down for a good solid week. And certainly, some part of our revenue falls directly into Asia. But a lot of the -- our customers, even in North America and Europe, are shipping into Asia and can be impacted by that. It's not insignificant. It's a meaningful impact.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Dave, relative to your comment before about kind of why the Street was modeling what it was modeling, you guys have been undergrowing your peers overall, I mean, somewhere between 5% and 10%, and industrials specifically between 10% and 15% this year. Could we be modeling a catch-up or should we just assume that's kind of gone, and we should be kind of modeling in line with peer growth? I think that catch-up dynamic was some of the reason that folks might have been modeling more than what would have been seasonal.","David A. Zinsner","I think -- if you look at this over a couple of years, I don't think there was any difference between any of us quite honestly. There may be, in the short term, some perturbations because of revenue recognition in the period of the quarter. We're talking about a lot of these guys, obviously, report as of the end of September. We report at the end of October, and so there's some dynamics around that. There's no way market share changes in the industrial business. The cycles are 20 years. Nothing -- very little comes off in any 1 year. It's just not possible. I mean, I wanted -- on a more aggregate basis, as you look at ADI versus other peers out there, we have made a concerted effort to shift away to some extent from the consumer market. And there is no doubt that has caused a headwind in our business. We will definitely acknowledge that fact. It's been -- those investments have been put forth into areas in the industrial space, in the wireless space, in the comm infrastructure space, more broadly in the automotive space, and so forth. And a lot of those do have 3- or 4-year design cycles. So it takes a while for that -- those designs, that, the design effort to show up on the revenue side. So could there be that dynamic in their vis-a-vis the consumer? I certainly acknowledge that fact, but I think on the industrial space relative to the peer group, that's all just timing around quarters and how to keep companies recognize revenue and so forth.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephen Chin with UBS.","Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Vince, I just want to follow up on the comment you made in your -- the remarks regarding investments in the consumer area. Did you mention portables? And if so, is that just in reference to computers or is that smartphones and tablets? And can you just talk about the reason [ph] behind that and the timing of when some of those investments pay off?","Vincent T. Roche","Yes, so we made a very determined move out of PCs several years ago, and we have no dependence on PCs at all for our revenue in the consumer space. So when we talk about portable, we're really talking about smartphones and tablets in particular. So we have a pretty -- it's a fairly modest relative to the overall spend, but nonetheless, we have a pretty significant spend in developing audio subsystems, sensing subsystems and some other particular functions that our devices, that make a big, big difference in the user experience. And we've made very, very good progress, as Dave said, in terms of getting the products, getting underlying technologies and products ready, and we have a heavy -- we've got some good design ends and we have good design activity taking place. So I think we're starting to see the benefit on the portable side over this year and into 2015.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley Caris, Research Division","Vincent, you had remarked in a question that was asked by Romit that you thought fiscal '14 could be a year of growth. Can you identify what gives you confidence that the year can be one of growth whether it be things that you're seeing on an end-market basis, a geographic basis or a channel basis?","Vincent T. Roche","When we talk to industrial customers, for example, we have a customer roster of 50,000 to 60,000 total. So I spend a lot of time talking to our largest customers in particular from all different regions, all different market segments, and I think if you talk to industrial customers, they see, as I said on the automation side, actually, we've seen some decent growth over the past couple of quarters. And our belief is that will continue. There will be an upgrade cycle as capacity has expanded in industrial machines and plants. There's a lots of -- as you know, in America, for example, there's a lot of activity in gas exploration and energy, in general. So we're benefiting from that, I believe, in the process control sector. Instrumentation, outside of ATE is doing well. ATE has become a notoriously cyclical business. It's got basically 2 buying cycles known in a given year. And so I think between what we read in terms of our design activity at our larger customers, what our larger customers are telling us about their beliefs in terms of the economics of their businesses and the demand for this and the technologies they've got. We think that will be a contributor to growth in '14. As I said, I believe automotive will continue to grow. I don't see any reason why for a number of reasons unless there's a big slowdown in the demand for cars there. But -- and communications infrastructure, the buildout of 3G or 3 or 4G in China will -- China and America and the upgrade cycle in Europe, I believe, will contribute to growth in 2014. So that's the lion's share of ADI these days. Those 3 businesses I've described to you, that's around 90%, 80%, 90% of our total business.","Operator","The next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I want to revisit the guidance again briefly. I want to put aside questions of share gain or undergrowing or overgrowing the competition, but this is the ninth quarter in a row that you guys have guided your forward revenue below expectations, and I know you said you were surprised where the Street was this quarter, but again, this is 9 quarters in a row. Is this just a continual problem with managing Street expectations? Or is something else changed versus where you used to be in terms of, I guess, more accurately forecasting? I'm just trying to figure out what's different now versus where The Street has been on this.","David A. Zinsner","Well, thank you. We don't give guidance past 1 quarter, so what you guys put in your model is what you put in your model, first of all. Second of all, I think in an environment where it's been tepid, I think that most of the Street wants the world to be a better place. And so I think they create guidance that has some expectation around wanting it to be a better place. And it's just not, I mean, that the macro world is not improving that much. We're growing at a very tepid rate right now. And so I think that, that's the fundamental challenge that, I think, you guys want and believe that things are off to the races, and it's just -- the macro world is just not there yet. So I hope in 2014, that environment does get better and industrial companies start to spend some capital and the communications companies start to invest in infrastructure, and if that happens, it's going to be a very good year, and we'll be doing the opposite. We'll be beating your expectations. But at the moment, that hasn't happened, so we can't give you any visibility into a brighter day. But I think at some point, it does have to get better, and we're going to plug along. We're going to continue to invest in the areas that we think have the best opportunity to grow, and I think over time, you'll see that work out for us.","Operator","The question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just looking at ADI's comm side, if you look -- one of [indiscernible] exposures to telecom versus enterprise and as you look at January quarter, how do you see those 2 subsegments trend?","David A. Zinsner","Well, most of our sales would be into telecom as you call it rather than enterprise. I don't know what the exact split is, but I imagine it's 80% or greater in telecom, metro and transmission networks, dish networks and a much smaller proportion into enterprise, but I really don't know what the split is going to be. What -- how it's going to perform in the first quarter, I really don't have any idea of that.","Operator","The next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Dave, I'll take the accolade. I was one guy who was living in the dark world for the quarter, but coming back to the consumer -- but just on the consumer side, you guys have been very forthcoming over the last several quarters on how you're deemphasizing it. And just looking out ahead, I'm not able to understand why chase after the portable market. The world is full of people. I mean, look at Maxim and their focus. You get a design win, and you guys had that yourselves a few quarters ago. You got the win then. Why not just walk away from that segment and stick with your really sticky businesses where you're doing a great job?","David A. Zinsner","Well, I think, yes, we are definitely [indiscernible], but I think we are certainly focused a lot in other areas that are stickier. But our fundamental premise is about innovation. It's about areas where we think we can innovate way better than anybody else in the industry, and believe it or not, there are pockets within the consumer space where that can happen, where the innovation is so mind-blowing, let's say, that really no one else can do what we can do. And we can be in several generations. Now, can we be in a generation for 8 different versions year in year out? Maybe not, but I think if we can be in a consumer application for several generations doing something fairly innovative, we'll make a good ROI on that. And a lot of times, we take that capability, and we learn from it and poured it back into the other markets and that also has some leverage opportunities. So that's why we keep our toes in the water, I think, in the consumer side. I don't know if you have anything to add, Vincent.","Vincent T. Roche","Yes, so let me just add one other comment to what Dave has just said. There's another part to our consumer business. One part is portable, but we have a business in consumer that's in areas like broadcast studios, high-quality enterprise audio and video. And in those areas, the life cycles of those products and the margin structures of those products actually look a lot like a horizontal business in the industrial space. So that's really the foundation of our consumer business. And as Dave said, if we can find certain areas to supplement that business in the portable space, where our technology we believe makes a real difference and we can make that difference for several generations, then we'll invest. But -- so it's really a segment with 2 very, very different businesses within, and we're very, very careful about how we spend our money and where we select the investments in both places.","Operator","Your next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I'm hoping to address the normal seasonal view one more time, if I might, especially relative to the last 3 years. If we look at just that time frame, there's been approximately 0 growth. And so if we hone in on that to calculate our view of normal seasonal for the rest of this coming fiscal year, I don't think that the result is consistent with your growth view longer term. So maybe either help us understand what management believes the typical seasonality pattern would be later in the year or maybe you could give us an updated view on the long-term revenue growth opportunity.","Vincent T. Roche","I think there's talk about that; the goal is to have 8% or there in the zip code growth. And we've got the team behind them on that, so that's our goal. I think what happens is the second quarter generally is -- got a pretty good environment to it. It's up in the high single digits. And then what we would need to see in order to have your kind of year-over-year solid growth is we're going to have to have a couple of year -- a couple of quarters in the back half, where it's kind of sequentially better. The other thing that we -- which I talked about in the -- one of the prior conversations is that for the last several years, we have been de- emphasizing parts of the consumer business, and that has been a headwind, and we divested one of the key parts of the business, which is the microphone business. I think -- we think that's pretty much behind us and that we kind of leveled off, and we think we have some opportunities in the consumer space that will drive some growth. Timing of which is a little uncertain, but we have pretty good confidence that there will be designs won here in the not-too-distant future. And so we think that's no longer a headwind. That, in fact, might be a tailwind for us. The other businesses we have some investments and that we think from a design viewpoint look pretty good for the next rest of the year. And if the macro does okay, we should have a really solid 2014. I think it's early to say. We're not even a month into 2014. We've got to see how it goes. We'll update you in a quarter and let you know how things are progressing.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ian Ing with MKM Partner.","Ian Ing - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","I've actually got a nonrevenue question for David. There's a $3 million OpEx decline in January. Could you talk about contributions of shutdowns at the factory or company level and given less holidays in April, should we expect some related increase after that effort?","David A. Zinsner","So, yes, I mean, I think the reduction in the OpEx has not as much to do with shutdowns as it does to do with just kind of the variable component coming off and kind of our normal operating expense management in the first quarter given it tends to be a little bit of a slower period. There is certainly a benefit on a spend level in the manufacturing because we are shutting down the factories and that helps us because we -- obviously, we expect our wafer production to be down and this way, we can reduce some of the overhead costs by shutting down for some period of time. So that has some benefit, the magnitude of which I'll have to kind of go back and pencil out, but -- and I'm sorry, was there another part of the question?","Operator","Your next question comes from Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Dave, if you could give us a sense of what range of gross margins the company presently has, and given the lower growth, what's it going to take for you to have utilization move up by about 10 points where your -- is there a way to do that with your factory base?","David A. Zinsner","Well, as you might expect, we have a fairly wide range of products in the portfolio, and so we certainly have margins up into the 90s for certain products. And in certain cases, we have products in the 50s. And that's kind of -- I'd say that's generally the range. There's probably some outliers to that spectrum as well. I think in -- I can't remember exactly the period of time we were running that, but I think we were in the mid-2012 range running in the mid-70s in terms of utilization, and we were kind of in the upper 600s for a sustained period of time, probably shipping at a little bit of a higher level, inventory was being built in distribution. So it wasn't that -- it wasn't too far ago -- too long ago that we were actually 10 points above. So in the right environment where the growth is back into that range, you could see the utilization start cranking up. And one of the things we did this time around, which I'd say in previous, let's call these mini cycles, what we didn't do is we really took out an active effort to reduce the inventory levels. I think I've mentioned in the prepared remarks that we reduced inventory by $30 million, and that have a pretty meaningful impact on our margins, and we still have 64-plus percent margin in that period. But the good news is we really kind of cleaned the desk. So as the demand starts to go up, the production is kind of instantaneously moving up as well. We should see that margins move up pretty quickly along with that, so I think we've set ourselves up on a gross margin basis to have really good leverage.","Ali Husain","Thanks, Doug, and I believe you were capstoning our evening here, so I think we all did a pretty good job keeping good time.

I\u2019d like to now introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.","Michael Lucarelli","Thank you, Sheryl, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our second quarter fiscal 2019 conference call. With me on the call today are ADI\u2019s CEO, Vincent Roche; and ADI\u2019s CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah. For anyone, who missed the release, you can find it and relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com.","Now on to the disclosures. The information we are about to discuss, including our objectives and outlook includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and in our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.","Our comments today about ADI\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2019 financial results and short-term outlook will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude special items. When comparing our results to historical performance, special items are also excluded from the prior quarter and year-over-year results. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today\u2019s earnings release.","Okay. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to ADI\u2019s CEO, Vincent Roche. Vince?","Vincent Roche","Thanks very much Mike, and a very good morning to everybody on the call. Before I get into my recap of the quarter, I wanted to briefly touch of recent developments. As you\u2019re no doubt aware, the U.S. Government announced last week that it\u2019s restricting a large communications company from acquiring U.S. products and technology. While this will have at least a short-term impact on our communications business our business is global, broad, and robust and we\u2019ll manage through this.","Prashanth will give a bit more insight into the anticipated financial impact of this development during his particular section. So, now on to our highlights. The second quarter of fiscal 2019 was another successful quarter for ADI with revenue from our B2B markets increasing year-over-year once again. This represents the twelfth consecutive quarter of annual B2B revenue growth, which is really a testament to the diversity of our franchise and our ability to innovate ahead of secular growth opportunities.","Revenue of $1.53 billion came in at the high-end of our guidance led by strong year-over-year growth from our communications applications across multiple segments. Adjusted gross and operating margins increased, compared to last quarter to 70.6% and 41.5% respectively. All told, adjusted EPS was $1.36, which was also at the high end of outlook.","Now, over the past 12 months, we\u2019ve generated approximately $2.1 billion in free cash flow or 34% of revenue, and during that time period we\u2019ve returned more than 100% of free cash flow to our shareholders after debt repayments. Now, before we move on to the financial section of our call, I\u2019d like to continue our discussion around ADI\u2019s key markets, their trends, and ADI\u2019s strategic initiatives positioning us to capitalize on these opportunities.","We previously discussed our strong position in the wireless market, particularly in massive MIMO and 5G where our content opportunity is up to 4x compared to traditional 4G systems. So, today I\u2019m going to talk about the other third of our comms business, namely the wireline market. The wireline market is very profitable. It\u2019s a steady growth business for ADI with the combined company having grown at a high-single-digit rate annually for the past five years.","The market and its challenges around precision, control, and power are a perfect match for ADI's comprehensive portfolio and domain expertise. There are many applications within the wireline business, but today I want to focus on the fastest-growing segment namely the optical market. The primary driver of the wireline market is unsurprisingly exponential growth in demand for digital data.","IP traffic across carrier networks and data centers is doubling every 2.5 years, driven primarily by Cloud Compute, backhaul of 4G and 5G networks, and consumption of data rich content. This extraordinary growth represents a significant challenge for the carrier networks and data centers that transport and manage this data as it\u2019s not possible to lay new optical fiber, our double data center floor space every two years. So, their challenge is ADIs opportunity.","The two primary ways to solve their data throughput problem are increasing the speed of the existing fiber network and reducing the form factor of data ports to increase data density. Carriers are increasing their speed of their networks by upgrading from 100 gigabits per second to 400 GPS, and in some cases, to more than a terabit per second. At the same time, optical modules are being scaled down by 2x, 4x, and even 10x.","At this level of data throughput, our customers are pushing the optical components and subsystems such as lasers, modulators, and coherent signal processing to their physical limits. Precisely controlling throughput, managing synchronization, compensating for signal impairments, and reducing system noise is critical to overall system performance. By partnering closely with our customers, we\u2019re developing highly optimized optical control and power management products that match the smaller form factor required in next-generation optical systems.","Importantly, for every 4x increase in speed in an existing network, our control content opportunity increases by more than a third. This 400-gig control port space is the fastest-growing segment of our optical business, largely driven by the rapid growth in data center port traffic, but a high precision signal chain only solves part of the problem in these next-gen carrier and data centric networks.","Denser optical networks create power and thermal challenges that our customers must also mitigate to avoid harmful impact on the network\u2019s potential speed and data throughput, not to mention, impact on their operating expense as power and cooling represent over 30% of a data center\u2019s total cost of ownership. Now, that\u2019s a huge opportunity for our power portfolio. We\u2019re taking our core power franchises, namely \u00b5Module and Silent Switcher technologies for example and leveraging ADI\u2019s market leading position to broaden our customer reach and develop optimized solutions for this market.","In addition to optical port solutions, we also supply innovative power sequencing and hot swap products. These technologies enable our customers to mitigate costly downtime and avoid disruptions by managing the highly complex power chain of network and servers and routers. The addressable market for these solutions continues to grow as port and data traffic density continues to increase.","Now, as said in the past that for every dollar of signal chain we sell into a system, there\u2019s at least a dollar of power opportunity, and the wireline market is no different. Since our combination with LTC, we\u2019ve seen our pipeline in power for the wireless market expand very significantly.","So, in closing, we expect continued profitable growth over the long-term in the wireline market as control and power challenges intensify in response to the market\u2019s densification with ever increasing bandwidth demand. And as providers shift to silicon photonics, we expect even more opportunity for ADI as control and power solutions are necessary to compensate for the lower inherent performance of these silicon-based photonic solutions.","And with that, let me hand it over to Prashanth.","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","Thank you, Vince. Good morning everyone and let me add my welcome to our second quarter earnings call. My comments today with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. Now, on to the quarter. In the face of geopolitical uncertainty, we are pleased to report strong second quarter results with revenue, operating margin, and EPS all coming in above the midpoint of our guidance.","As usual, I will cover the end markets before moving to the P&L. Our second quarter B2B revenue increased approximately 3% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in our communications business. The industrial market, which represented 50% of sales in the quarter performed as expected, decreasing mid-single digits, compared to the year ago quarter.","Strength in aerospace and defense was outweighed by the anticipated weakness in our automation and memory test businesses. The comms market represented 24% of sales during the quarter and experienced very strong double-digit year-over-year growth led by ongoing strength in wireless, while our wireline franchise also continued to grow nicely. Our results this quarter reflect ADIs higher content and share in 5G.","We believe 5G remains in the early stages and our technology remains a key enabler. And as Vince just highlighted in his section, our wireline business is well-positioned to continue to grow profitably in the years ahead. Our auto business represented 16% of sales and was relatively flat, compared to the year ago quarter. Strength in BMS, which increased well over 20% year-over-year and momentum in our power franchise helped to mitigate the overall weakness in vehicle units during the quarter.","And lastly, our consumer business represented just 10% of sales in the quarter, the lowest consumer mix since 2016. As expected, this segment decreased on a year-over-year basis. And now moving to the P&L, revenue for the quarter was at the high-end of our guidance at approximately 1.53 billion, down 2% year-over-year. Gross margin came in at 70.6%, up 30 basis points sequentially, but lower year-over-year, primarily due to market mix. And in what is normally a higher OpEx quarter, OpEx decreased sequentially to $443 million.","Operating margin of 41.5% came in stronger than our guided mid-point. Non-op expenses in the quarter were $61 million, slightly higher sequentially with the increase primarily related to a one-time expense in the quarter. Interest expense decreased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Tax rate for the quarter was better than forecasted at approximately 11%. And all told, adjusted diluted earnings per share from the second quarter came in at the high-end of guidance at $1.36.","Now moving onto the balance sheet, as is normal in the second quarter, inventory dollars and days increased slightly sequentially, and our channel inventory also increased sequentially and year-over-year, but still remain comfortably in our target range. CapEx in the second quarter was $75 million or 5% of sales for the full-year. We expect CapEx to be temporarily higher and remain at approximately 5%. This additional spend his to support future growth opportunities, especially for our power franchise, as well as the colocation of our product and business development teams.","Free cash flow was approximately $2.1 billion on a trailing 12-month basis, an increase of 6% year-over-year, despite the additional CapEx outlay. Over the past 12 months, we have returned more than 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks after debt repayments. In the second quarter, we repaid $250 million of debt, paid $200 million in dividends, and repurchased over 100 million of our stock.","Now before moving to guidance, I want to give some context around the additional uncertainty impacting this quarter's outlook. As Vince mentioned, the U.S. Government recently announced export restrictions to a large communications company. Our third quarter guidance takes into account the estimated impact on ADI from these restrictions, including no revenue from that customer for the remainder of the quarter.","We are currently reviewing our ability to resume shipments under the recently announced temporary general license. And while we do not talk about specific customers, I will say that ADI has an extremely diverse business. The communications market is a bit more concentrated, but still over the trailing 12 months, our largest communication customers only represented mid-single digits or less as a percentage of total ADI sales.","So, now onto the outlook, which with the exception of revenue and non-op expense are on a non-GAAP basis and exclude special items outlined in today's release. Third quarter revenue is expected to be $1.45 billion, plus or minus $50 million. And at the midpoint, we expect our B2B markets of industrial automotive and communications in the aggregate to decrease low single digits year-over-year.","At the midpoint of guidance, we expect third quarter operating margin to be approximately 40.5%. Non-op expenses are expected to decline sequentially to approximately 56 million and we are improving our projected tax rate to be in the range of 13% to 15% for the year. Based on these inputs, diluted EPS, excluding special items is expected to be $1.22, plus or minus $0.07.","So, overall it was a very successful first half of the year for ADI, especially when you overlay it with an uncertain economic and political backdrop. I remain very confident that investments we have made and continue to make will position us for continued outperformance over the long-term.","Let me hand it back to Mike, to start our Q&A.","Michael Lucarelli","Okay. Let\u2019s get to our Q&A session. Please limit yourself to one question. After our initial response, we will give you an opportunity for a follow-up question. Sheryl, give our first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is open.","Vincent Roche","Good morning, Tore.","Tore Svanberg","Thank you. Yes, good morning. Thank you. I was hoping maybe you could talk a little bit about your core business, excluding communications. So, obviously I know that\u2019s a very specific situation, but if you look at, especially industrial and auto, are those markets starting to show a path of a recovery? So, if you could add some color there, that would be great. Thank you.","Vincent Roche","Yes, sure. Thanks, Tore. Well, let me start with industrial. So, I think it's true to say that business has stabilized across the board. We see our customers' inventory levels being very, very normal. And also, channel inventory, which is often a proxy for what's going on in the industrial market, is in line also with our targets. I think overall, when the macro turns, I think we see a lot of upside improvement to the business as confidence improves and CapEx is deployed at higher rates.","So, if I try to unpack it a little bit for you, so in terms of the second quarter, it performed pretty much as we expected. And particularly, we were pleased with the results that we achieved in the aerospace and defense area, where the combination of the Hittite and ADI signal processing solutions are really coming to the fore there, where we're taking share as a company and we see that as a good steady growth driver for many, many years to come.","Geographically, I think it's true to say where a lot of our industrial business is centered at Europe and America, we're up year-on-year, fairly stable. And, you know, the areas of weakness we saw were largely in Asia, all the various major regions of Asia. So, looking out a little bit here, we're seeing stabilization. And I think we will see some annual growth in the third quarter here as well.","So, I think that's kind of the shape of the industrial business. If I just talk about the automotive sector for a little bit here. So, our performance on revenue was much better than units, than SAAR. And we did see a very modest build in channel. As you know, we're on POA accounting these days when we report to The Street. And we did see a little bit of growth there. But the performance was driven by our growing position in battery management systems for electric vehicles. I think also, I'm very pleased to say that our power business is improving across the board. We did better in power than SAAR, for example.","So, when we look at our performance, power did better than the unit growth in terms of vehicles sold. And also, our A2B solutions in the infotainment sector continue to ramp gradually here. So, I think if you look at more SAAR-exposed applications, steady-state applications, infotainment, for example, they were down high-single digits. And that represented about two-thirds of the overall business. I think the portfolio is very balanced. We've got many new things coming onboard that help us to outgrow any particular weaknesses in SAAR.","Michael Lucarelli","Tore, I'll add one point. You asked about kind of stabilization. We are already seeing stabilization in the industrial market. I think what we're excited about is, it is kind of a better decline year-over-year we expect in the third quarter versus our second quarter results. So, we declined about 6% in the second quarter. We think it gets better in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis. Do you have a follow-up?","Tore Svanberg","Yes. Thank you for that color. Really helpful. As a follow-up, if we look at the communication customer that we're talking about here, how long would it take for a company like ADI to maybe requalify some of that business with all their potential customers? Thank you.","Vincent Roche","Well, I think we're in a very, I would say, great situation here, Tore. We're very well covered as a company across all the various major OEMs with good penetration. In fact, historically high penetration across all the various OEMs. So, I think I should start up the conversation by saying that generally speaking, 5G is a [indiscernible] technology that is yet really to begin. I think we're seeing trials in Japan and Korea at this point in time, but it is really yet to begin in earnest in any volume. And that's probably going to come in the 2020 time-frame.","So, no matter what happens in terms of puts and takes, you know carrier and OEM relationships, I think the company is well-positioned. And specific to China, I guess it's a question of when deployments happen rather than if they happen. And we still have to navigate a lot of uncertainty here in terms of the trade ban. So, we're going to know a lot more, I think, over the next 2, 3 months. But as I said, I think it's a case of when deployments happen globally rather than if. And we're in a good position in terms of the dollar content we've got in the various OEMs and our position across all the OEMs at this point in time.","Michael Lucarelli","Thank you. We\u2019ll move to our next caller please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next caller comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Vivek Arya","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. And good job on maintaining the profitability despite all these macro and the Huawei headwinds. Vince, it's interesting that your comments on industrial sound somewhat more optimistic than some of your peers who have, you know are looking at all this tariff situation and they are sounding somewhat more downbeat. Is it some company-specific product cycles? How are you sounding a little more optimistic than what we are hearing from some of your peers?","Vincent Roche","Yes. It's a good question, Vivek. We, as a company, I think have been more focused than our peers in terms of R&D deployment and customer engagements over the last decade. And I think we are, generally speaking across the board, both at large, say, automation customers, tests and lab equipment-type companies and aerospace and defense, which I've talked a little bit about just a little earlier on, I think we are in a better share position now than we've ever been. It's a big, big part of who we are as a company.","So, there's tremendous engagement and focus and with many, many tens of thousands of customers. So, I think bringing LTC into the fold as well, we increased the strength of our franchise in terms of signal processing, but also the power set of things with LT. So, I think it's the combination of all those things that has positioned it. It's largely intrinsic or endogenous things we've done over the last decade position us to take share here. So, I think it's the strength of our franchise, strength of our customer relationships and the combination with LTC at this point.","Vivek Arya","Got it.","Michael Lucarelli","Do you have a follow-up, Vivek?","Vivek Arya","Yes. Thank you. So, for the follow-up, I just wanted to make sure we are kind of all level set on what this ban to Huawei actually means, right? So, let's assume that, that ban stays in place. Hopefully, it gets resolved. But for just the purpose of kind of recordkeeping, there is no more Huawei \u2013 your July quarter kind of takes out Huawei. What should we assume from the following quarters? Should we just assume Huawei goes to zero after that? What is the right way to kind of de-risk the model from a Huawei perspective? Thank you.","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","Sure. Yes. So, for the current quarter, Q3, we've presumed no more shipments. And if you take \u2013 I think your assumption is, let's assume that, that ban stays in place, then it's likely that we would be prohibited from continuing to sell to that customer for subsequent quarters. But as Vince has mentioned several times, we are largely customer-agnostic. We have high share in all of the carriers. It's a very different situation than what we had in 4G. So, as that demand shifts to other wireless infrastructure carriers, depending on where that deployment happens, we expect to continue to do quite well in providing the necessary technology to enable the deployment of 5G and the continuing deployment and growth of 4G.","Vivek Arya","Alright. Thanks, Prashanth.","Michael Lucarelli","We\u2019ll go to our next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Harsh Kumar from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Michael Lucarelli","Hi, Harsh. How are you?","Harsh Kumar","Hi, good. Thank you. I want to echo my congratulations as well, fantastic job in this rather turbulent environment. I want to follow up on the Vivek's question. Last time we saw this, the song and dance was ZTE getting banned and the expectation was that Huawei would step up and take share. So, basically, if I hear you correctly, what I think you're saying is that the customer in question, Huawei, if that's banned, you are suggesting that others, including ZTE, might step up and take share and the impact would be much less than perhaps the direct business that you do with Huawei. Is that the correct way to think about it?","Vincent Roche","Potentially, yes. I think it really depends now on how the Chinese government and the various carriers, when they reflect on things, how they decide to handle the timing of 5G release at this point in time. But there are options. I think 5G conforms to a standard. And I think all the carriers have different options. They probably have favorites. They've got the first favorite, the second favorite. But there are options. And the way we view it, we are well-positioned in terms of our technology portfolio.","In fact, many of the things we're doing, particularly in 5G, are highly differentiated, with more content, more coverage in the radio systems than we've ever had. So, look, it will certainly help a lot if this trade \u2013 this ban is lifted in a reasonable time period here. But I think irrespective, as I said, in my earlier comments, the rollout of 5G is unquestionable. And it will really be a question of timing rather than if the system gets deployed. So, yes.","Michael Lucarelli","Yes. Harsh, so just to, I'll say, unpack a little bit from kind of a number standpoint. The things we looked at when we put together our guidance was there's three factors. One was the actual shipments to that customer. Two were the secondary impact to other customers who ship to that customer. And third would be, additional demand picked up by competitors on that customer. And we put all that together, that's how we came up with our guidance. And we kind of think the second, too, so the secondary impact or the additional share impact kind of neutralizes zero. So really, it's all about that customer going to zero in our outlook.","Harsh Kumar","Fair enough. Very helpful. And then for my follow-up, we've been trying to talk to other semiconductor companies. And they're all very confused because of just it all happened so recently. A lot of the companies are saying, well, they sell directly to Huawei, but they also sell a whole bunch through distri. Would you tell us if you guys are prohibited from selling through distri to Huawei as well? Or is there a chance that shipments could be moved around a little bit and perhaps \u2013 I'm not saying the full impact is mitigated, but some partial impact is mitigated at this point?","Vincent Roche","No, I'd say like we're as confused as everybody. The information flow is [indiscernible] and it can be often confusing. So, I think the coming days, the coming weeks will bring a lot more clarity to what's actually in the ban, what's out of the ban. But as Mike said very clearly right now, our interpretation is that we will be upholding the ban to the fullest extent and we won't be shipping anything to Huawei for the foreseeable future.","Michael Lucarelli","And for the avoidance of doubt, we have no channel revenue in the midpoint of our guidance that we expect to go on to this communications customer.","Harsh Kumar","Understood. Very helpful. Thanks guys.","Michael Lucarelli","Harsh, thanks for the questions. We\u2019ll take the next one.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Harlan Sur","Good morning. Thank you taking my question. The defense spending budget for this year has been a real tailwind for the team. And it's actually been quite broad-based, right, modernization, aircraft, ground systems, missile defense and so on. A&D obviously has been doing well for the team. Can you just help us understand how A&D has been growing on a year-over-year basis? And then how has the budget focus on modernization helped to kick off maybe some new potential initiatives for the team?","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","Yes. Harlan, we don't talk much at the specific segment level in terms of numbers, but I will share that our aerospace and defense has been doing particularly well. And it was one of the items that helped us offset some of the decline we saw in other industrial. The overall, sort of in the second quarter results, the year-over-year growth was pretty substantial, I call it north of 25% on a year-over-year basis for aerospace.","We are benefiting from those record military budgets that you've meant. So, it's across all of our application areas, the communications, the UAVs, radars, space exploration areas. The combination with Hittite also helps bring a lot of new technologies that we can take advantage. So, it's been a great business for us. And we see that continued modernization of defense is going to pay dividends and growth for ADI for several quarters to come.","Michael Lucarelli","Yes. And just to level set on the call, our industrial business is 50% of sales, but it's very diverse within that 50%. So, I'll just remind everyone that aerospace and defense is about 20% of industrial, automation is about 20% of industrial, instrumentation is about 20% to 25%, health care is just about 10%, and it is a remainder across a bunch of, I'll call it, smaller customers. So, it's a very diverse business within industrial for us. Do you have a follow-up, Harlan?","Harlan Sur","Yes. Appreciate the insights. So, within the comms business, really appreciate the insights on some of the new opportunities in optical, especially around signal processing and control. I believe that within wireline though over the past couple of quarters, you've seen some weakness in 100-gig for optical networking targeted at cloud data centers on the well-known sort of capacity digestion by the hyperscalers. Are you guys starting to see fundamentals in 100-gig starting to improve kind of near term?","Michael Lucarelli","Yes. Our wireline business has been growing. In the last quarter, it grew mid-single digits year-over-year. And the quarter before that was about 10% year-over-year. So, I think it is impacting some. Our wireline business had been a quite steady growth market for us. It's been overshadowed by the wireless, I'll say, [it has to] grow much faster. But the wireline for us and optical within that has been growing.","Vincent Roche","Yes. I think data centers are today still largely 100 gig-based. But the fastest growth we're experiencing is in 400-gig. And that's both the kind of the metro long-haul, as well as data centers. So, as this data need continues to double every 2.5 years, we're going to continue to see an aggressive move into 400-gig, and in fact, into terabit and beyond over the coming few years here. So, I think it's a mixture. And we're seeing strength across the board in our portfolio.","Harlan Sur","Thank you very much.","Michael Lucarelli","Next caller please.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Ross Seymore","Hi guys. Thanks for letting me ask my questions. First, congratulations on the automotive business being flat year-over-year. It's a solid quarter by any measure. I know, Vince, you gave the color on some of those drivers with BMS, et cetera. But from a bigger-picture perspective, you guys had been underperforming for a few years. And now, you're outperforming. Is this a sign of an inflection point that you think like going forward, you can go back to at least performing in line with peers or even outperforming? Or do you view this as just kind of one quarter of improvement in that regard?","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","So, Ross, let me level set how we did in the first half. And then let Vince kind of talk more broadly. So, first, remember that we run our business on a \u2013 we run the channel really on a POS basis, but we report our revenue on a POA basis. So, in the second quarter, POS was down just slightly, very low single digits, but much better versus units. So, we did see a little bit of modest build in the channel. And that helped growth. But within that, certainly very strong performance in BMS, power and A2B. Vince mentioned that we've got the cabin electronics and some other businesses exposed to SAAR.","So, as we look forward to the second half of this year, a little bit of that channel build that we saw in the first half is probably going to provide some headwind because again we do manage the business on a POS basis. But the optimism that we have been talking about for over a year now and the inflection in our auto business that we really expect to start in 2020, that remains a high conviction. And I'll let Vince maybe talk more about what's behind that.","Vincent Roche","Ross, if we go back several years, you know we withdrew R&D and support. We still ship some sensor products. But we've largely seen the, I think, the tailing off of some of our more commoditized MEMS sensing business begin to stabilize there. If I look at the areas where we're seeing the growth come from as a company, I think our infotainment business remains very, very strong. It's been growing year-on-year now for several. BMS, still a very, very small penetration of electric vehicles in overall SAAR. And by the month, we get more and more convinced that, that's going to be a very significant business for the company. And that's \u2013 that business is doing better and better for us. In fact, we have been capitalizing that business as well. ","We \u2013 in comparison, if you'd like, the portfolio from LTC, so we've been capitalizing the business in terms of R&D and equipment to make sure that we can meet the upside demands here for new products as well as supply line for the long term. I mentioned a little bit earlier on as well that our power business, the LT portfolio is doing increasingly better when compared to the market at large. And when you take these new, emerging Level 3, Level 4 sensing systems that need, call it, modalities like IMUs, that need these advanced image quality radar systems and LIDAR, we are in virtually all the really important high-end solutions that are emerging at Level 3 and above. So, I think our business has been largely the \u2013 the headwind on our business from the sensor side of things is abating. And these new product modalities are getting stronger and stronger in terms of traction. So, that's kind of the story in automotive for you.","Michael Lucarelli","Do you have a follow-up, Ross?","Ross Seymore","Yes. I just want to pivot back to the comms side of things and appreciating all the uncertainty and the details you've given on the call thus far. One other aspect that investors are focused on is the inventory in that area. And I know it's difficult to discern, but how are you viewing any pre-buying that might have been occurring specifically from the now-banned customer? And I think what people are concerned about is even if the ban ends, was there enough pre-buying buffer that the snapback afterwards might not actually occur? So, any color you could have on the inventory in that channel and specifically any pre-buying would be appreciated. Thank you.","Vincent Roche","I think the inventory in general, Ross, across the board, all are OEMs in the communications area, these new advanced architectures. I think the inventory is very, very well balanced. I don't see anything untoward or anomalous. And I think things are in good balance there.","Michael Lucarelli","Yes, Ross. I'll say even before the ban came in place; we expect our communications business \u2013 we thought before that ban was going to grow sequentially. So, I don't think pre-buying was a big worry of ours, given our good share across the board. Now that obviously has changed. And we think it's not going to grow sequentially. And probably on a year-over-year basis, it's only up slightly. Kind of help you for some context there.","Vincent Roche","Yes. I think the way to think about this as well in terms of inventory balance, like most of ADI's portfolio, it's really more a question of when the inventories that we have sold rather than if. I think that's generic to all these core B2B businesses for ADI.","Ross Seymore","Thanks guys.","Michael Lucarelli","Alright, we\u2019ll go to our next caller please.","Operator","Our next question is from William Stein from SunTrust. Your line is open.","William Stein","Great, thanks for taking my questions. First, I'm wondering if you've analyzed or if there's any impact, we might expect from additional stop ship orders that have been speculated in the press. For example, I think it's pronounced HikVision. I might not be getting that right, but I'm wondering if you have an exposure to these surveillance companies in China that look like they could potentially be customers.","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","Well, it's a good question. I would emphasize that the rest of the ADI business is very broad and diverse. So, as more companies may be identified, there will certainly be some analysis that we will have to do, but unlike the communications business, which is among our most concentrated, the diversity of our franchise and the large number of customers that we sell to provide great insulation against having kind of macro shocks from these political impacts.","William Stein","And that's really helpful. One more if I can? Can you talk about both for the quarter, just posted in for the guidance, the trends within the consumer business and specifically the split between your traditional prosumer business and the more volatile handset part of the business? Thank you.","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","Yes. So, we originally said that consumer is going to be down 10% to 20% in 2019. Our forecast is really now at the high end of that. We expect to be down 20% year-over-year. We continue to see some weakness in the portables market. We are seeing a little bit of unanticipated weakness in prosumer. And how much of that is driven by the macro environments and such, we're trying to assess right now. But we do think that kind of the worst is behind us and that the long-term growth for the prosumer business should really align closer to GDP. And it's really similar to our B2B business.","Michael Lucarelli","Yes. From a standpoint, as we exit this year, we expect our portables business and our prosumer business to be about equal in size, so as to provide to some more stability to the consumer business for us going forward. Alright, Sheryl we\u2019ll go to our last question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Your line is open.","Ambrish Srivastava","Hi, thank you very much for squeezing me in. I just wanted to make sure I understood the exposure to the large customer and in terms of the model, Prashanth. Should we be then thinking \u2013 you gave us a trailing 12-month number, but should we be thinking high single digit? And then based on your answer to an earlier question in terms of de-risking the model, should we assume for the next 2, 3 quarters, you get none of that and then you start to \u2013 other customers to pick up slack maybe 2, 3 quarters down the road? Is that the right way to think about the model and then the OpEx impact as well?","Michael Lucarelli","Hi, Ambrish. I'll answer the first part of your question. So, I think we were pretty clear on the prepared remarks saying our largest customers within comms was mid-single digit at most in the trailing 12 months. We did have a couple weeks of shipments, I would say, in this quarter. So that won't repeat next quarter. And after that doesn't repeat in 3Q, I would put 0 in going forward until the ban is lifted.","Ambrish Srivastava","And the OpEx trajectory, how should we think about the OpEx?","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","Look, the OpEx is we're going to continue to invest in the business. Of course, where appropriate, we're going to look at our discretionary cost. But I wouldn't make a meaningful change to how we think about the OpEx. The first lever that absorbs the chock of a revenue decline is our variable compensation. So, that will, of course, be impacted by decline in revenue. But beyond that, we're going to \u2013 we're committed to investing today for products and technologies that come to market several years out.","Vincent Roche","I think the way to look at it, Ambrish, is that the demand for our technologies is absolutely unprecedented. So, we're keeping our eye on the long term in terms of making sure that we have aggressive funding in place to fund all the R&D programs that we think are critical to the company's future, the same with our customer engagements. And I mentioned a little while ago also, we ramped our capital expenditures to make sure, particularly on the LT side of the business, that we have what we need to get our products to market faster and get the supply to our customers. We know the opportunity is there, so we're keeping our eye on the long-term prize here.","Michael Lucarelli","Do you have a follow-up, Ambrish?","Ambrish Srivastava","I do. Thank you for all the clarifications. Just a quick one then. In your B2B guide, I think, Vince, you mentioned, you gave the color on the industrial. And then should auto \u2013 we should expect that to be up year-over-year in the current quarter of that period? Thank you.","Michael Lucarelli","Yes. Ambrish, Vince gave some comments. Industrial actually should be down year-on-year, but the growth will be better than the second quarter is how to think about industrial first off. Auto also, I would say, probably down year-over-year, but much better than what I would say units are doing out there to the thing we talked about in the other Q&A remarks, BMS and power and A2B ramping. And communications, we also discussed it should be about, I would say, flat to up slightly year-over-year. So, that should kind of help you get to that low single-digit guide for B2B as a combination.","Ambrish Srivastava","Awesome. Thank you.","Michael Lucarelli","Okay. With that, thank you, Ambrish, and thank you everyone, for joining us this morning. A copy of the transcript will be available on our website. And all available reconciliations will also be on the website. Thank you, and we'll talk to you guys soon.","Operator","This concludes today's Analog Devices conference call.

Sir, the floor is yours.","Michael Lucarelli","Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 conference call. With me on the call today are ADI\u2019s CEO, Vincent Roche; and ADI\u2019s CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah.","For anyone, who missed the release, you can find it and relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com.","Now on to the disclosures. The information we are about to discuss, including our objectives and outlook includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors including those discussed in our earnings release and in our most recent 10-Q.","These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.","Today\u2019s commentary about ADI\u2019s fourth quarter and fiscal \u201818 financial results will be detailed further in our 10-K which we expect to file next week.","Our commentary about ADI\u2019s fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 financial results and short-term outlook will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude special items. When comparing our results to historical performance, special items are also excluded from the prior quarter and year-over-year results.","Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most typically comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today\u2019s earnings release and on our web schedules which we have posted under the Quarterly Results section at investor.analog.com.","Okay. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to ADI\u2019s CEO, Vincent Roche. Vince?","Vincent Roche","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Well, I\u2019m very pleased to report that ADI had another excellent quarter to cap off what was an exceptional year for the company. We once again hit a high watermark by achieving record revenue of $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter. In addition, we expanded operating margins to 43% and delivered $1.55 of diluted earnings per share.","Looking at the full year now, revenue surpassed $6 billion for the first time. Growth was led by our B2B markets that increased well into the double digits year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share increased more than 20% year-over-year, and most notably, we generated over $2 billion of free cash flow. This robust cash generation enabled us to continue investing in the future of our business, rapidly reduce our debt by over $1.5 billion during the year and returned cash to our shareholders.","As we outlined on the last call, going forward we plan to return 100% of our free cash flow after debt repayments. In fact, we have returned $10 billion to our shareholders since 2005 through dividends and share repurchases.","Beyond being a strong year financially, it was also year of exceptional business progress for ADI also. So I\u2019d like to spend a little time describing our progress in 2018 and show how specifically it positions ADI for continued strength in 2019 and indeed beyond.","Firstly, we made tremendous progress in the integration of LTC, using our best of both approach, employees across the entire organization are unified and working towards a common goal of delivering long-term profitable growth.","Our R&D teams have synergized product roadmaps and development activities, and are busily extending the cutting edge of analog, mixed signal, power and sensors to deliver impactful solutions to our customers.","Our combined sales force has made really great strides in building and converting our opportunity pipeline. In fact, our revenue cross-selling opportunity has doubled in value since our Analyst Day across large customers and also in the broad market.","During the year, we successfully achieved our initial $150 million of cost synergies. In addition, as previously announced, we are optimizing our internal manufacturing footprint, reducing our cost bases by another $100 million, while enabling a more agile operation that is positioned to capture new growth upside.","All that said, given the complementarity of our combined product portfolio and customer relationships, we are increasingly confident in our objective to double LTC\u2019s revenue growth over the next few years.","In short, we have created an industry-leading product portfolio and team of analog, RF and power engineers with capabilities that range from sensor to cloud from DC to 100 gigahertz and from nano watts to kilowatts.","We exit 2018 in a stronger position than we have ever been and are extremely well-prepared strategically and operationally to grow and take market share in 2019 and indeed beyond. In addition to our own preparedness, our confidence is grounded in a few externalities that transcend any potential short-term uncertainty in 2019, namely, [immutable][ph] technology macro trends that are creating secular tailwinds for ADI. ADI\u2019s analog expertise between the physical and digital domains becomes ever more critical to our customers\u2019 business success and simultaneously, our customers are partnering more deeply with us to get the full benefit of our technology capabilities and product solutions to enable them to meet the innovation demands of their customers.","And we are very well-aligned with these externalities and have been making strong progress during the past year to position ourselves for success in 2019 and beyond. For example, in the Wireless Communication sector, you may have seen recent press around deployments of 5G massive MIMO beginning in Korea. ADI\u2019s software defined transceivers are enabling those deployments and this is just the beginning.","Many other global carriers are expected to deploy 5G massive MIMO over the coming years. Much of the innovation of 5G\u2019s systems is taking place in the radio subsystem, given the increasing demands for spectral space thermal and cost efficiency, our comprehensive portfolio of software defined, mixed signal, RF, microwave and power management technologies will enable ADI to create even more compelling solutions for our customers in the years ahead.","These massive MIMO enabled radios contain an eight times increase in radio channels, representing a significant growth opportunity for ADI and the opportunity to capture potentially up to 4 times the content when compared to current 4G solutions.","I should note also that in addition, power management attached design wins in this area are just beginning, but progress thus far leads us to believe that our power portfolio will continue to provide tailwinds for us in communications in 2019 and in further years.","And indeed massive MIMO is just a stepping stone to millimeter wave based future generations. Here carriers will look to increase the radio channel count up to 512 channels per radio and we are very well positioned to once again solve these immense radio challenges with our comprehensive cutting edge portfolio. So I believe we are really in the early stages of a multiyear growth cycle in this particular space.","So, now turning for a moment to the industrial sector, here the digital factory envisioned by Industry 4.0 is expected to increase productivity and lower cost. ADI has the heritage, the domain expertise and the most comprehensive set of technologies and capabilities to deliver the required level of precision and robustness our customer\u2019s need.","For example, we are building beyond our traditional strength and precision control isolation of power products by adding communications technologies, such as industrial grid deterministic Ethernet and sensors in areas, such as depth, motion and vibration, which more than triples our content opportunity and expands our addressable market.","In automotive, FY18 was year of really solid progress and I have increased conviction that we are on the right path to return to our target growth rate of at least high-single digits annually.","Growth in our Kevin electronics business has accelerated to a double-digit growth rate this past year, driven mainly by our long-term strength in audio processing, and our future is equally bright here, we are adding new vectors to our audio processing foundation like A to B and C to B media transport technologies, and we are attaching our power management portfolio in these engagements as well, positioning us for continued strong growth in this particular sub sector.","On the active safety side of the business, high-speed signal processing technology is required to deliver ever increasing levels of precision in Level 3 plus autonomous vehicles. Here ADI\u2019s radar, LIDAR and IMU solutions coupled with power management are strengthening our position across nearly all self driving programs. And as is the case -- as in the case with Baidu, our customers are relying on ADI to achieve their vision of fully autonomous vehicles.","In the electrification application area, we have made stellar progress in strengthening our BMS solutions in FY18. Our current generation delivers up to 20% more miles per charge compared to the competition and extends the battery\u2019s useful life. We are now sampling our next-generation solution, which provides another efficiency and performance leap, while adding additional safety features.","Beyond that the subsequent generation of our multi-generational roadmap includes architectural innovations that will change the way the BMS problems of power density, accuracy and weight are solved in the future.","And finally, I\u2019d like to say a few words about our Healthcare business and progress. Revenue in this market has increased at a double-digit growth rate over the past five years and I believe it\u2019s really just getting started. In areas such as remote patient monitoring and digital X-Ray systems ADI\u2019s expertise in high-performance sensing, signal processing and power control is ever more critical to our customers.","For example, in the area of digital X-Ray imaging, several years ago, we made a pivot to a domain inspired approach to solve our customer\u2019s most difficult problems. We have leveraged our strong heritage of high end component building blocks and pushed the innovation curve to new levels to create highly integrated subsystems from photons to bits for example.","These solutions have simplified and intensely complex problem by reducing our customer\u2019s design challenges, radiation dosage and similar tenuous increasing image fidelity. We have thereby extended our addressable market to capture new levels of value. And in general in the Healthcare area, I believe that economic needs and new technology adoption our converging to enable a new vein of growth in the future for ADI.","So, in closing, I\u2019ve put forth the constructive scenario here today and while some may be a bit skeptical, given the present macro uncertainty and geopolitical fears that present our world, our confidence I believe is very well founded.","We have a diverse business across customers, products and applications, that position us to succeed and excel in any macro climate. We have other than enormously to our cutting-edge technology portfolio during the year and we have deepened our customer engagements. So we are in a position to capture the upside, while being agile enough to weather any perturbations in the marketplace.","And amidst an environment of increasing change and complexity, we continue to leverage our greatest asset, our people, who continuously push the edge, learn and adapt to create ever more innovative solutions for our customers each and every day, which ultimately drives returns for our shareholders.","And so, with that, I\u2019d like to hand it over to Prashanth.","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone. And let me add my welcome to our Q4 \u201818 earnings call. As usual, with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses, my comments on the P&L line items will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which exclude special items outlined in today\u2019s press release.","We wrapped up 2018 with another record setting quarter, revenue at $1.6 billion and EPS of $1.55, and we converted this growth into strong cash flow, generating over $2 billion on a trailing 12.","But before I get into the details of the income statement, let me cover the end markets. Our fourth quarter B2B revenue increased 13% year-over-year, led by double-digit growth in the industrial and communications markets.","The highly diverse industrial end-market represented 49% of sales in the quarter and increased 10% year-over-year. Most sectors increased compared to the year ago quarter, led by strength in instrumentation, healthcare, aerospace and defense. As expected, this growth was moderated by slower demand in factory automation, mainly related to China.","The comps market, which represented 22% of sales in the fourth quarter increased once again at a double-digit rate year-over-year, driven by strong performance in both the wireless and wired markets.","Growth in our wireless business was broad based and accelerated as continued momentum in our 4G business was augmented by early deployments of massive MIMO. We expect this to carry into 2019 and beyond as 5G represents an enormous opportunity for ADI.","Our Auto business represented 15% of sales in the quarter and increased at a low single-digit rate year-over-year. Growth was led by cabin electronics and the BMS application.","And lastly, our Consumer business represented 13% of sales in the fourth quarter. As expected, revenues declined year-over-year. However, portables declined less than expected.","Now moving on to the P&L. Revenue for the quarter was at the high end of our guidance at approximately $1.6 billion, increasing 4% year-over-year. Gross margins of 71.2% increased 30 bps year-over-year and were flat sequentially. OpEx in the fourth quarter was $452 million and at approximately 28% of revenue, well within our target of sub 30%. And finally, op margin were a record at 43%.","As we continue to delever, non-op expenses in the fourth quarter declined to $56 million and with our full year true up our Q4 tax rate was approximately 8%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter came in above the midpoint at a $1.55.","Now moving onto the balance sheet. Inventory increased 4% sequentially and days were 114 in the quarter, relatively flat from the third quarter. Disty inventory declined sequentially and exited the year right in line with our target of six weeks to eight weeks.","We generated free cash flow of approximately $2.2 billion or 35% of sales over the trailing 12 months, and as of yesterday\u2019s closing price our free cash flow yield is 6.8%.","During the quarter, we repaid $225 million of debt, we paid $179 million in dividends and as we outlined in our last earnings call, we have resumed our share repurchase program, now that our leverage is sub-2.","As of yesterday, we have purchased nearly $260 million worth of shares. CapEx in the fourth quarter was $86 million and we expect to continue to run and our model of approximately 4% of sales for 2019.","Before I move on to guidance, I want to remind you that in January -- in the January quarter we will adopt a new rev rec standard ASC 606 to coincide with the start of our 2019 fiscal year. We are among the last few SEC registrants to do so due to the timing of our fiscal year.","We have historically deferred revenue and the related costs for shipments to certain distributors until the distributors we sell their products to their customers. Upon adoption of ASC 606, we will recognize revenue upon shipment to our distributor.","We plan to provide a historical quarterly end market revenue look back under the new standard with our first quarter 2019 earnings release. Meaning you will see changes in our historical growth rates, as they will reflect revenue from shipping into distribution versus shipping out.","But for context, during 2018 the change in channel inventory for the year was pretty minimal, as channel inventory increased in the first half and was reduced in the second half of the year. On average over the past three years, channel inventory impacts annual revenue by plus or minus 1% while quarterly variances could be and have been larger.","Now onto guidance, which with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses are also on a non-GAAP basis, and exclude the items outlined in today\u2019s release. As a reminder, the first quarter of 2018 was a 14-week quarter, so all of my comments on revenue growth and our commentary during the Q&A session will exclude this extra week. So we are normalizing our growth rates to give you a like-for-like comparison.","First quarter revenue is expected to be $1.51 billion at the midpoint on both the old and new rev rec methodology. To be clear, we are forecasting a midpoint of $1.51 billion on both in sell-in or new ASC 606 standard, as well as fixed sell-through basis because we expect minimal change in channel inventory during the first quarter.","At the midpoint of guidance, we expect total revenue to increase 7% year-over-year on a sell-through basis. And we expect our B2B market of Industrial, Auto and Comps in the aggregate to increase low double-digit year-over-year, led by the Communications market.","This would represent our eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth for our B2B market. Under the new rev rec method year-over-year growth would be approximately 4% at a company level and at high single-digit rate in the B2B markets for the first quarter.","We are planning for gross margins to be approximately 70.8 lower sequentially due to the normal shutdowns around the holidays, as well as business mix. We are expecting operating expenses to be around $450 million at the midpoint. This was down slightly sequentially and does include some one-time items. So you will not see the usual lift going into Q2.","We expect op margins in the first quarter to be approximately 41% and we expect our non-op expenses to be approximately $56 million and our tax rate will be in the range of 14% to 16%. This tax rate is slightly higher than our previous outlook due to new IRS guidance released in September. Based on these inputs, diluted earnings per share, excluding special items is expected to be $1.28 plus or minus $0.07.","Before moving on to the Q&A session, I want to inform you that this will be the last quarter, we are going to be providing gross margin and OpEx guidance. This will be the only change as we will continue to provide the other items for outlook including operating margin.","This does not change our long-term operating model that we discussed at our Analyst Day of 70% plus gross margins and op margins in the range of 39% to 45%. We are making this transition as it aligns to the way we manage the business, that is, we focus on driving profitable growth and operating margin expansion.","So, all-in, it was a terrific quarter to cap off a very successful year for ADI, and while we are mindful of the economic uncertainty around us, I will echo Vince\u2019s optimism that we enter 2019 equally excited about the opportunities ahead.","And with that, let me turn it over to Mike to lead our Q&A session.","Michael Lucarelli","Thanks, Prashanth. Okay. Before we move to Q&A, I want to remind everyone of a couple of points. First, we are moving to sell-in accounting starting first quarter 2019. And second, the first quarter of 2018 was a 14-week quarter. As such our commentary around expected growth in the first quarter 2019 will exclude these two factors. In short, our growth commentary will be in a 13-week sell-through basis.","Okay, let\u2019s get to our Q&A session, please limit yourself to one question and after our initial response, we will give you an opportunity for a follow-up question. Jennifer, can we have our first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel.","Tore Svanberg","Yes.","Vincent Roche","Good morning, Tore.","Tore Svanberg","And thank you, good morning and congratulations on the results in a tough environment. The first question is on the Industrial business. So, obviously, it\u2019s very diversified and I\u2019m just wondering if you could comment a little bit on what your customers are seeing there as far as this slowdown. Are they sort of in a wait and see based on what the macro political situation is or are they, perhaps, a little bit more optimistic about \u201819. Just trying to gauge how your Industrial base is feeling right now?","Vincent Roche","Yeah. Thanks, Tore. The -- well, I think, I\u2019ve talked with quite a few customers both domestically here in America and internationally over the last quarter, quarter and a half, maybe two quarters, in the atmosphere of the kind of the macro uncertainty driven by trade war rhetoric and so on and so forth, and the impacts of the tariffs.","I\u2019d say, generally speaking, customers are remaining optimistic, though there is, obviously, concern, which is dampening enthusiasm for laying down CapEx and taking a long-term view to demand.","So, I would say, at this point in time, what we are seeing though is, cancellations are kind of a normal rates and lead times for the most part are pretty normal. So in the Industrial market itself, we are seeing pockets of softness. I would say in the Automation part of our business, it\u2019s largely softening in China and we are seeing strength, for example, in the electronic test and measurement side of our business, obviously, healthcare has remained strong for the company and I think aerospace and defense is also an area of continued growth and some good acceleration there over the last quarter or two.","So I think that provides you some color. And from our point of view, Tore, we have, obviously, been investing heavily from an R&D and customer engagement standpoints over the past -- really the past decade. So I think for ADI we are better positioned than we have ever been in that market. It is our number one focus, I would say, and it\u2019s broad, it\u2019s deep, it\u2019s got many thousands of products, many thousands of customers associated with it. So we are optimistic about our capacity to continue to grow content and to gain share as we have been doing in \u201818 and beyond.","Michael Lucarelli","Thank you, Tore. Do you have a follow-up?","Tore Svanberg","Yes. Thank you, Vince. That was very helpful. So I had a clarification question, you mentioned, now with the synergies between Linear and ADI. I think you have used the word double. I\u2019m just wondering does that mean the revenue synergies are now up to $2 billion or is it, if you could just clarify that statement? Thanks.","Vincent Roche","Yeah. I think back in \u201817 when we had our Analyst Day we were talking, at that point in time about our visibility and confidence towards $1 billion. So, yeah, we are well above that now and looking at continuing to grow and we have certainly confidence that we have doubled that synergy number over the past year and a bit.","Michael Lucarelli","Yeah. I will just add\u2026","Tore Svanberg","Okay. Thank you.","Michael Lucarelli","A bit why we are so confident we can double the growth at Linear as our pipeline expands. Okay. Thank you. We take our next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","Vincent Roche","Good morning, John.","John Pitzer","Yeah. Good morning, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Can you guys hear me?","Vincent Roche","Yes. We hear you fine. Yeah.","John Pitzer","Perfect, Vince. Thanks for letting me ask questions. Congratulations on strong results. Vince just on the comp sector, you had mid-20% year-over-year growth last quarter, you just put up almost 30% growth this quarter. You did highlight some of the drivers there. I\u2019m wondering if you could dissect that growth a little bit. I know that you were really positive about the backlog you had at Hittite now that it was under sort of your control from that M&A long product cycle designs. To what extent is Hittite helping to drive this growth? And I guess are you at all concerned that some of this growth might be pull ins from China trying to get these parts before the trade war escalates to potentially not being able to get these parts. Just given how important massive MIMO and 5G are. Maybe you can help lay some of those concerns and just give us a little bit more detail there?","Vincent Roche","Yeah. Thanks, John. Good question. So let me start with the latter part of your question first. I don\u2019t get any sense that there\u2019s any form of tension or panic buying by our Chinese customers to get ahead of any tariffs or trade war concerns.","Remember as well, what we are seeing now, is an accelerated build out of, I would say enhanced 4G and moving into the early stages of 5G, that\u2019s a multiyear process anyway no matter what. So what I\u2019m seeing is a good balance between what we see is the increasing demand from the carriers, and I would say, the supply from our customers to meet the carriers demands.","When you look at the, put the whole thing together, we are looking at \u201819 being another year of double-digit growth. We have, as I said, we have got 4G tailwinds and that\u2019s driven by content gains we have been making over the last three years, I\u2019d say.","Hittite incidentally, just to give you a little bit of a benchmark here. When we acquired Hittite it was roughly a $217 billion trailing 12-month revenue company. The Hittite portion of our business is well over $400 million at this point in time and it isn\u2019t just communications, its where microwave and those radio frequency technologies are used in aerospace and defense, and other parts of the instrumentation industrial market.","So I think when you put the massive MIMO addition to 4G or 5G as some people call it in the early stages of 5G, that gives ADI a tremendously increased opportunity value over 4G. And as I said, in the prepared remarks, my sense is that we have got a 4 times content improvement as 5G begins to ramp up here.","So it\u2019s a -- and that by the way, doesn\u2019t include, we are not including any specific targets for LTE in that number, but there\u2019s a huge cross-selling opportunity. We are beginning to go to production with power designs at this point in time. So I think the tailwinds are strong and ADI\u2019s content has grown, our portfolio has never been stronger. So that\u2019s what we are seeing. I think it\u2019s a share gain story for ADI.","Michael Lucarelli","Thanks, John. Do you have a follow-up?","John Pitzer","Yeah. Just quickly guys, I hate to bring it up, because it\u2019s such a small percentage of the revenue and the growth drivers. But you have historically just given us some color on the consumer segment and how we should be thinking about that, especially given the different launch times of flagship handsets, how do we think about consumer going into the January quarter?","Vincent Roche","Well, looking into \u201819, we started the year off a bit stronger, given the content that we have in some of the, say, older platforms. All that said, we are still expecting that consumer will decline somewhere between 10% and 20% on the portable size in \u201818, while the prosumer part of our business, which should -- which looks a lot more like a B2B sector is continuing to perform well for the company.","So I think the way to look at this, John, after this year\u2019s growth, growth will be determined by essentially new sockets either what we win or what we lose, that will determine ultimately what happens I think after \u201819.","But as always, we are optimistic about where we are playing in consumer and we continue to be selective in the areas that we target and we are always seeking to increase diversity of application and customer. So I think that\u2019s the snapshot of consumer at this point.","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","John, we\u2019re looking for a 7% increase on a sell-through basis for the consolidated company and 12% for B2B, so you should be able to impute to the numbers you need for consumer.","Michael Lucarelli","Thanks, John. We will go to our next question.","John Pitzer","Yeah. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Roche","Good morning, Craig.","Craig Hettenbach","Okay. Yes. Thank you. Vince, can you just expand on the comment around the confidence in automotive returning to kind of high-single digits? And then if you are able to frame it, I know there\u2019s some A2B programs that may help in the coming years, as well as kind of BMS, but just any additional details would help?","Vincent Roche","Yeah. Thanks, Craig. Well, first and foremost, cabin electronics, that part of our business has done very well during \u201818 and we are well positioned for more growth in the \u201819. So the growth in that area was double digits in \u201818.","And yes, the A2B application space is growing for the company. We have added this new media transport modality as well that we call C2B. And we are also now are getting the benefit of adding LTCs Silent Switcher Technology into some of these sockets as well. So we are at early stages of an up ramp in our power business there.","I think, as well, it was well publicized during the year that we had some troubles with our Battery Management Solution Technology, but I think, we have really turned the corner particularly in the second half of \u201818. In the second half, we achieved double-digit growth and we expect \u201819 also to be a double-digit growth performer for ADI.","So, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks as well, we are sampling our next-generation BMS and we have got some very interesting architectural innovations as well coming on the back of that, that will change the way these systems are designed and implemented in the electrification activity.","On the sensing side, again, I\u2019ve talked about some of this in the prepared remarks, cross radar, we have got our -- we are sampling our 77 gigahertz image quality radar. We have -- a very interesting and growing diversified pipeline in the LIDAR sector that combines both LTE and ADI mixed signal technologies and many customers are starting to use our IMU, inertial management units in the kind of L3 plus autonomous driving areas.","So I think we have continued to accelerate during \u201818 in terms of stabilizing BMS and starting to get us back to a growth trajectory and a lot of exciting things going on in autonomous vehicles as well. So, hopefully, Craig that frames that it up for you.","Michael Lucarelli","Thanks, Craig. We are going to move to one question, no follow up given interest of time. Moving over next question, Jennifer?","Operator","Our next question is from C.J. Muse with Evercore.","C.J. Muse","Yeah. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I guess more of a cyclical macro question. You talked about seeing some softness in China. Curious if you are seeing softness in anywhere else, particularly as you think about the strong U.S. dollar and potential impact to emerging market demand. We\u2019d love to hear your thoughts cyclically where you might be seeing other pockets of weakness, if at all?","Vincent Roche","Yeah. Thanks for the question, C.J. So, yeah, from a geographic perspective, I\u2019m going -- what I\u2019m going to talk about here is, is based on design in revenue. So what\u2019s happening in each region from an innovation design standpoint.","I\u2019d say, as we have come out of the year, all markets have increased year-over-year, growth was led by China. And I\u2019d say, looking at the sequential trends geographically, most markets were slightly up or a little down and no big moves one way or another to report there.","Industrial was up year-on-year, it was a little weaker quarter-on-quarter. Automotive was up year-on-year, again a little quarter -- little weaker quarter-on-quarter. But we believe that was related primarily to macro effects there SAAR, China, this new testing modality that\u2019s being adopted in Europe. So, but we expect it to come back in the first quarter to our target.","And Communications across the Board all the primary geographies in which we\u2019re strong Communications were up very, very big on a year-on-year basis and also sequentially. So and that broad-based strength was led by China, as well as the EU particularly in the Communications area. So, hopefully, that gives you a sense for the atmosphere on the geographic basis. Prashanth, do you want to add anything.","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","C.J., I would just add that. Remember, we think about our geographic revenue based on where activity is designed. So when we think about from a market standpoint, I mentioned factory auto, effect to automation was one that we have seen some softness, automated test equipment was the other area we are seeing some softness, but outside that, really the rest of Industrial has been staying in growth mode. So that\u2019s what\u2019s forming are sort of confident for the Q1 outlook.","C.J. Muse","Very helpful. Thank you.","Michael Lucarelli","Thanks, C.J. We will move to our next question?","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.","Mark Lipacis","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you guys have noticed any shifting of the supply chain manufacturing out of China into other areas, and if that is impacting your own business? Thank you.","Vincent Roche","I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything really of note. First off, we are not so impacted by the tariffs, but there are some signs that our customers are trying to work around the cost impact of the tariffs. I think, there are some passing on of the cost to end customers and also a very small amount, at least from our perspective, I\u2019d say, a very small amount of mitigation by our customers by moving to areas not affected by the tariff, when it comes to manufacturing their products. But, I think, it\u2019s very, very de minimis at this point in time.","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","Mark, I think, we are\u2026","Mark Lipacis","Thank you.","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","\u2026 we are probably more familiar with our specific production and what we are seeing is customers looking at supply chain changes that allow them to maybe avoid staging products in the U.S. that would then get further assemble them and have those go directly to other countries where the assembly happens and thereby avoiding the tariffs.","Michael Lucarelli","Thanks, Mark.","Mark Lipacis","Thank you.","Michael Lucarelli","We will move to -- on to our next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.","Ambrish Srivastava","Hi. Thank you very much. Vince, I just wanted to make sure I understood your comments about the slowdown. It sounds like you are characterizing it as a near-term uncertainty. You did talk about cancellations. Could you just help us understand what the order rates were doing as you were entry at the current quarter? And then more importantly, what are the factory loadings going to look like at ADI and structurally the company a lot more profitable than in the past cycles. Just help us understand the playbook, if we were to go into a deeper downturn? Thank you.","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","Sure. I\u2019ll take some of those and Vince, you can add some pieces.","Vincent Roche","Yeah.","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","So let me take factory utilization. Certainly, we are headed into the holiday season. So our factory utilizations normally unwind a bit for those that are impacted by Thanksgiving, and then, again, for the Christmas, New Year\u2019s period. So utilizations are coming down, but not necessarily linked to changes in the demand environment beyond our original planning areas.","In terms of booking activities. Certainly, our Industrial business is seeing book-to-bill below parity and it\u2019s been a while since we have seen that. But as I mentioned that, we see, yeah, we see most of that being heavily weighted from the two segments factory automation and automated test equipment.","Order activity has stabilized from where it was. Now, I don\u2019t think we have the have the wherewithal to call the bottom here. But I\u2019m just giving you the facts that we saw, we certainly saw an improvement in October versus what we saw in September.","Vincent Roche","Yeah. So, I think, Ambrish, another little bit of color. So, I would say, for the most part, what we are seeing is really a pause rather than any, we are not seeing cancellations of such, I think, it\u2019s a pause, it\u2019s a level, it\u2019s the macro uncertainty that\u2019s causing customers to be a little cautious. Lead times for the company are really normal and I would say, as I\u2019ve just said, cancellations are normal.","And just to give you a little more depth of color on that. So the legacy ADI is well within the normal range of supply chain metrics. In other words, greater than 90% of our portfolio shipping within the normal four-week to six-week window that we plan to report.","LTE is a little more mixed. We have had some, I would say, tightening of supply, demand has been strong and supply has been a little tight. But we have been investing aggressively and putting in place new capacity in fact, over the last couple of quarters to support not just today shortfalls, but also to support the future growth that we are expecting and increasingly optimistic about.","So, the book-to-bill is just, as Prashanth said, just a little below parity on the B2B side, driven largely by Industrial. So, but I think, the book-to-bill that we have given or that we are seeing is very supportive of the guidance that we put out there.","Michael Lucarelli","All right. Thank you, Ambrish. Next caller please?","Operator","Our next question is from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore","Hi, guys. Thanks for let me ask the question. Congrats on the strong results.","Vincent Roche","Thank you, Ross.","Ross Seymore","A bigger picture question for you Vince is, I think, you said that the guidance would imply the eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth in your B2B business?","Vincent Roche","Yeah.","Ross Seymore","A very impressive track record for sure. That\u2019s -- if I go back in my model, that\u2019s the longest stretch of double-digit growth, I can find at any point in time. So, I guess, two points on that. How much of that do you think is company specific share gains target investments, et cetera versus a cyclical uplift and how do you view the sustainability of the growth rate or even the target growth rate for your B2B segment?","Vincent Roche","Yeah. There\u2019s a lot of very good questions there, Ross. So, I\u2019d say, I mean, it\u2019s very hard to parcel precisely what is market, what is ADI. Clearly, we as a company have -- we retool the entire strategy of the company, eight years, nine years, 10 years ago to focus very, very heavily on the B2B area.","In fact, we are spending to today, 95% for our R&D in the B2B space -- spaces and most of our customer engagement activities as well, of course, are in the B2B area. So the addition of the -- the added R&D focus on the legacy ADI portfolio in the B2B area, the addition of Hittite and now LTC, where LTC was largely focused on B2B.","I think positions the company well. We have been taking share that I\u2019m sure of and believe we will continue to gain share. And of course, we were aided by favorable macro trends, I think, generally speaking, PMIs have been positive for the last several quarters and GDP has been strong. So, obviously, the environment is strong.","But I think ADI is executing in a more focused, more intense way as well and capturing the opportunity. So we believe, again, that B2B will increase within our -- I think a more moderated growth range. We have said that for the long-term that if we can grow our B2B business kind of 2 times to 3 times GDP we will be content on an ongoing basis and that\u2019s my sense for \u201819 as well, barring any macro cataclysm that, that\u2019s what we are going to see again in the -- we are going to see that kind of growth rate in the coming year.","Ross Seymore","Thank you.","Michael Lucarelli","Thank you. And Jennifer, we will move to our last question please.","Operator","And our final question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the good results.","Vincent Roche","Thank you.","Vivek Arya","Vince just a question on the competitive landscape, you mentioned massive MIMO is the strong area of growth for you. Xilink has also been talking about their RF SoC product. I\u2019m wondering how do you see the competitive landscape shaping up and what\u2019s your visibility and design wins on next-gen 4G and then 5G?","Vincent Roche","Yeah. So, I think, first off, there are many, many solution variance out there when -- between the antenna and the bitstream, so to speak. And there is we have the strongest portfolio of technologies from right from the antenna down into the bitstream areas.","So as I said earlier, as we move into the 5G, the early stages of 5G here, we are looking at potentially 4 times the content availability compared to the classical 4G that we have been part of over the last five years, seven years.","And when we get into the millimeter wave side of things, there -- we have, again, we have got the broadest portfolio, we can architect and a very flexible way to all the various customer needs. So as 5G millimeter wave comes in, we are looking at potential gains of 8, 10 plus in terms of potential content, just given the channel count on the radio transceivers, which by the way, is where most of the innovation is taking place in these 5G systems at least until they virtualize in the early \u201820s or so.","So, there\u2019s -- there are kind of three or four major building blocks in these base stations these days. There is the classical transceiver. There is the massive MIMO addition. There is all these power technology that we can bring to bear now as well for our customers and then there is the digital base-end, the digital front-end.","And we are innovating, not just in the analog space, we are also pushing the boundaries incidentally on the digital side and those boundaries they blur, they shift, they ebb and they floor over multiple generations.","But in our software defined transceivers, for example, we have taken a significant amount of digital content and combine that with our conversion technologies under our radio interface capabilities and dramatically reduce the footprint of the radio and cut the power levels down as well. So those are all important answers to very, very critical problems that our customers have.","So my sense is, over the next, say, five years till we got into millimeter wave, we are looking at a potential content increase of 3 times to 4 times and then it\u2019s a question of how many radios deploy and but we are very, very well-positioned from the content and architectural coverage standpoint.","Michael Lucarelli","Okay. Thank you, Vivek. And thank you everyone for joining us this morning. A copy of the transcript will be available on our website and all available reconciliations and additional information can also be found at the Quarterly Results section of our website. We look forward to seeing you this quarter at Credit Suisse Conference and the BMO Conference in the coming weeks and thanks for joining us.

My name is Rachel, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Analog Devices' first quarter fiscal year 2014 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) Mr. Husain, you may begin your conference.","Ali Husain","Thanks, Rachel, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Ali Husain, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining our first quarter 2014 earnings call. With me today are Vincent Roche, ADI's President and CEO; Dave Zinsner, ADI's Vice President of Finance and CFO; and Maria Tagliaferro, Director of Corporate Communications.","During the first part of today's call, Vince and Dave will present our first quarter results and our outlook for the second quarter. The rest of call will be dedicated to Q&A.","If you missed our press release, you can find it and all related schedules on ADI's Investor Relations website at investor.analog.com. Today's conference call can also be accessed from our Investor page. And a replay of today's call will be available within two hours of the calls completion.","During today's call, we may refer to non-GAAP financial measures that have been adjusted for certain non-recurring items in order to provide investors with useful information regarding our results. We have included reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in today's earnings release, which is posted on our Investor Relations' website.","Before we begin today's call, I'd like to review the Safe Harbor statement. Please note that the information we are about to discuss includes forward-looking statements intended to qualify for the Safe Harbor from liability, established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.

Therefore, this conference call will include time-sensitive information that may be accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, which is February 18, 2014.","So now, I'll turn the call over to Vincent Roche, ADI's President and CEO, for his opening remarks.","Vincent Roche","Thanks, Ali, and hello, everybody. Thanks for joining our call today. As you've seen from our press release, revenue in the first quarter was $628 million, which was down 7% from the previous quarter, but up 1% from the same period last year and at the midpoint of our guidance that we provided. Excluding the microphone product line, which we divested in the fourth quarter, first quarter revenue actually grew 5% year-over-year.","Diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.49 and slightly better than the midpoint of the guidance we provided last quarter. Overall, the first quarter of fiscal 2014 unfolded about as we had expected. We felt some order weakness around the holiday periods, when many of our customers tapered their operations. But starting in January, order rates begun to improve, led by the industrial, communications and automotive markets and we ended the quarter with a book-to-bill that was above one.","In addition, the feedback we have been getting from our largest customers suggests that they are more optimistic about their growth prospects for 2014. This feedback coupled with the strong order momentum we are thus far seeing, gives us some measure of confidence that the improved sales performance we experienced in the second half of fiscal '13 can sustain through this year 2014.","Now, turning to our performance by end-market during the first quarter. As expected, sales were flat-to-down sequentially across all our major end-markets, but were largely up on a year-over-year basis. Our all-important industrial business performed in line with expectations declining 7% sequentially, primarily as a result of fewer production days of customers in our first quarter. A number of holidays fell into our first quarter, including this year, the beginning of the Lunar New Year in Asia.","On a year-over-year basis, our industrial business grew about 3%. Now, while the macroeconomic data points are mixed lean channel inventories and increase confidence at our largest industrial customers, are both very positive signs for this more than $1 billion of highly diversified franchise going forward.","In automotive, revenue decreased in line with our expectations and this market made up 20% of our overall sales. Sales in this sector decreased 5% sequentially, as manufactures in North America and Europe took seasonal production breaks. Each of our focus applications within this sector exhibited modest sequential declines.","On a year-on-year basis, our automotive business grew 15%, which was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue increases, as we continue to grow in content and gain share in this market across all geographies. Also we are collaborating with innovative car brands and their tier-1 suppliers worldwide to develop smarter, more fuel-efficient vehicles, and together we are applying signal processing technology to make each generation of design better than the one before.","Revenue from communications infrastructure customers was approximately flat sequentially, but was up 11% on a year-on-year basis and represented 22% of our sales in the first quarter. This sequential revenue performance was a very good result in what is typically a seasonally weaker period for our communications business.","During the first quarter, the wireless infrastructure business was up slightly and the wireline business decreased marginally, as we had expected. Sales to our wireless infrastructure customers were driven by TD-LTE base station deployments in China and the beginning of U.S. 4G LTE network densification, which together with expected deployments in Europe and emerging regions, should benefit our communications infrastructure segment during 2014.","With the proliferation of more and more 4G-enabled devices hungry for bandwidth and running on strange networks, operators are increasing investments in LTE systems, and they are benefiting from increasing per user revenue and service differentiation. In aggregate, the industrial automotive and communications markets together made up 88% of our total sales in the first quarter.","And finally, our consumer business, which was 12% of sales in the first quarter, decreased sequentially in line with normal seasonal patterns and year-over-year, as a result of the sale of the microphone product line. Portables, digital imaging and prosumer audio\/video, all declined.","So now I'll turn it over to Dave, who will take you through some of the details of our financial results, and Dave will also provide more color on our recently announced dividend increase and share buyback authorization.","David Zinsner","Thanks, Vince, and good afternoon, everyone. As Vince mentioned, revenue in the first quarter was $628 million, which was down 7% sequentially and up 1% year-over-year. Excluding the microphone business, which we divested, revenue was up 5% compared to the same period last year.","Gross margin was 65.1%, which as you know was better than our guidance. Inventory on a dollars basis, increased $6.6 million and days of inventory increased to 120 days, as distributors managed inventory in advance of the Lunar New Year and as we positioned inventory for strong sequential growth in the second quarter.","Inventory levels remain in good control. Compared to the same quarter in the prior year, first quarter 2014 inventory was lower by $17 million or 6%, and utilization in the mid-60s was higher than the low-50s utilization rate in the prior year.","Our plan for the second quarter is to increase our utilization levels to the low-to-mid 70s, which on higher expected sales should decrease our days of inventory. Inventory in distribution on a dollar basis was lower than in the prior quarter and on a week's basis was about 7.5 weeks.","During the first quarter, we recorded a $2.7 million restructuring charge, as we continue to identify opportunities and redirect resources to the areas we believe have better returns. Excluding this charge, operating expenses were $226.8 million, which was down $2.4 million from the prior quarter. Excluding special items, operating profit before tax were $182 million or 29% of sales, which was down 280 basis points from the prior quarter and up over 200 basis points from the same quarter in the prior year.","Other expense of approximately $4 million in the first quarter represents the ongoing run rate of our net interest expense at current debt levels. Our first quarter tax rate was approximately 13%, which we expect will be our tax rate for the remainder of fiscal 2014. Diluted earnings per share, excluding the restructuring charge, was $0.49 and slightly ahead of the midpoint of our earlier guidance.","Cash flow in the first quarter continue to be strong. We generated 25% of our revenue or $157 million in operating cash flow. Capital expenditures were $48 million resulting in free cash flow of $109 million or 17% of sales. Our 2014 plan is for capital spending to be approximately $170 million, of which about two-third relates to ongoing capital spend and about a-third for new facilities.","Our cash and short-term investment balance increased by about $18 million during the first quarter and now stands at approximately $4.7 billion, with approximately $1.2 billion available domestically. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $870 million in debt outstanding, resulting in a net cash position of $3.8 billion.","So now I want to take a moment to talk about our capital allocation strategy and reiterate our commitment to returning 80% of our free cash to shareholders. In line with our capital allocation strategy, during the quarter we repurchased 1.8 million shares or $89 million of our stock and distributed $106 million in dividends to our shareholders.","In addition, our Board of Directors approved a 9% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.37 per share, which is payable March 11, 2014. And they also increased the authorization under our stock repurchase program to $1 billion. This capital allocation strategy coupled with strong earnings growth will continue to drive our return to shareholders higher.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Vince, who will discuss ADI's outlook for next quarter.","Vincent Roche","Thanks, Dave. Well, we started the second quarter with solid bookings momentum. We expect industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure to grow and for consumer to be about flat to the first quarter. In the industrial markets, we anticipate a seasonal increase in sales and expect all areas within industrial to grow.","After the seasonal low in the first quarter, automotive sales are expected to increase with growth coming from demand for new vehicles in North America and China, enhanced by a strengthening European market. The accelerated builder of CD LTE in China in combination with continuing 4G network densification activities in the U.S., along with anticipated improvement in the CapEx environments in Europe is expected to yield a strong second quarter for our communications infrastructure business.","Overall, we are planning for revenue to be in the range of $660 million to $680 million of approximately 5% to 8%. Gross margin should be up between 50 basis points and 100 basis points on higher utilization and a continued favorable mix. Our utilization is expected to increase in the second quarter compared to the first. It will still remain in the low-to-mid 70s, which indicates that we still have significant gross margin leverage, as sales improve in future quarters and the utilization expands. We estimate that operating expenses will grow approximately 2% sequentially, well below the sequential sales growth we expect to achieve in the second quarter.","Based on these estimates and excluding any one-time items, diluted earnings are planned to be in the range of $0.54 to $0.58 in our second quarter. So the short-term looks good and the long-term looks even brighter for ADI. Over the past several years, we have undergone a successful strategy shift, intensifying our focus on industrial automotive and communications infrastructure, while maintaining our commitment to build the world's best signal processing technologies.","Customers tell me time and again that they need ADI to help them solve of their signal processing systems challenges and cyclical and secular trends continue to improve, we are ready. We have continued to focus investments in line with our strategy. We continue to control inventory and operating expenses, and we're using our cash generation capacity to enhance total shareholder returns.","We are very excited about the future and we will continue to invest, innovate and deliver for our customers, our employees and for our shareholders. Thank you.","Ali Husain","Thank you, Vince. I'd like to remind everyone that during today's Q&A period, please limit yourself to one question, so that we can get everyone on the line. We plan to run today's call until 6:00 PM Eastern, so in case time remains at the end, we'll keep the lines open and give you an opportunity to ask another question. So with all that, operator, we can now start taking questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And your first question is from Aashish Rao from Bank of America.","Aashish Rao - Bank of America","Dave, a question on the capital allocation. I mean you've talked about getting to 80% of free cash flow churned and with the dividend increase that could account for 60% or so. Do you think the pace of buybacks will be sufficient to offset dilution from stock options at a rising share price? Any color on how we should think about thinking the win buybacks versus the dividend?","David Zinsner","So that clearly is part of a complex goal is to keep the dilution at a minimum for the options. And so I do think roughly 60% plus or minus comes from the dividend and the rest of comes from buyback that should be enough to offset the dilution. Although, it's the stock were really to ramp, obviously that might not be the case. But I don't think anybody will complain too much.","Operator","Your next question is from Romit Shah from Nomura.","Romit Shah - Nomura","Dave, just on gross margin, the guidance for April to me seems ultraconservative, just given the strong sales growth you're forecasting better utilization and better mix. Can you just walk us through what maybe some potential offsets? And then as a follow-up, Vince, I was hoping you could talk about the power management business for a second. It's still hovering around 4% to 5% of sales. I know this question comes up from time-to-time. But I'm just surprised at the size of the business, just given how complementary it is to signal path, where you guys dominate. And given that the cash balance is now approaching $5 billion, I'm wondering if you guys are considering potential acquisition to boost your presence here?","David Zinsner","On the gross margins side, the high-end of the range is clearly where everything kind of works in our favor, the mix is a little bit in our favor. Although, we expect most of our businesses to be up next quarter, so there's not a ton of like mixed differential.","But definitely we're going to crank up utilization a bit. Although, I would say, we're being a little bit conservative around cranking it up, just to make sure that we kind of guide ourselves into what potentially could be an improving situation over the rest of the year.","There is an always a chance we could beat the high-end of the range, so I'd say the conservatism for us is really around whether we take a little bit more in terms of inventory reserves in the quarter, and that would kind of mute a little bit of a benefit we get on the factory utilization side to bring it down.","But gross margin is going to be up, there's probably almost no question about that. It's probably just a matter of magnitude. And we thought that between, 50 to 100 was a pretty decent guide, and if it goes, it could potentially be better depending on how things go. And the second part of the question, I think is you, Vince.","Vincent Roche","Well, on the question of power management, so we are a very much signaled processing focus. That's the essence of ADI's business. And over the last number of years, we've been resteering our R&D into the market and the technology that we think are most important to be able to meet our growth goals and profitability goals over the long term.","So we actually have two businesses in power management. One is an area that has a lot of penetration in areas like communications and infrastructure, where we do hot swapping sequencing and so on and so forth. And we have a classical capability in linear regulation, for example, but we use that technology now primarily as a supplement to our core signal chain activities.","And also we're using the capabilities that we have in that space, in that power regulation area to enhance many of the new signal processing technologies that we're developing on very, very fine lithography process technologies. So power for us is really a core capability that we use to strengthen our signal chains and to attach to our core products.","Operator","Your next question is from Christopher Danely from JPMorgan.","Christopher Danely - JPMorgan","Probably a question for Vince, you gave some guidance by end market for this quarter. Can you just give us your thoughts on how you expect the big three end markets to trend throughout the year? And maybe add in a little commentary just on how you feel right now versus how you felt a year ago at the beginning of the year?","David Zinsner","So I think looking out, I mean there are still uncertain signs, I think when you look at many of the economic indicators. But what we know at this point in time is that we've got bookings momentum and from my own discussions with several of our customers across the globe in areas like communications, infrastructure, automotive, industrial, I'd say the sentiment generally speaking is better.","For example, industrial customers believe that is an upgrade cycle coming in manufacturing process control equipment. So I think the sentiment is certainly better. My own belief is that there is an improved CapEx cycle on its way even outside of communications and infrastructure, and that we'll see the benefit of that during the year.","But still, visibility is quite short. Leap times are short. And all we can speak with the facts that we have at our command. So my own sense is that all three of the big areas that now contribute virtually 90% of the company's revenue will see growth throughout the year as it unfolds.","Operator","Your next question is from Blayne Curtis from Barclays.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays","Maybe just from a high level, if you could talk about, it seems like from your commentary maybe comm was the strongest segment for year guide. One, just make sure if that's correct? And two, can you talk about, a lot of people noted that they saw a pickup in January in orders. I think you alluded to that you saw some TV strength in January, but just can you talk about the magnitude of the order and how you see that unfolding this year? And is that business up double-digits in April?","David Zinsner","I'll start, and Vince, probably could add some colors. I would tell you, this is the first quarter communications did surprised us to the positive. We did see momentum that we're stronger than we expected in the month of January. We do expect it to be up next quarter. Although, I'd say, all three of our kind of major focus areas within the business are all going to be up and potentially even industrial could do better, because it tends to be seasonally strong.","From an orders perspective, just in general for the company, we had pretty good momentum through the quarter outside of just three different areas where we normally have weakness. At the end of November, when we have Thanksgiving, at the end of December where we have Christmas, and then the Lunar New Year, which we start to see, but absent that we had pretty good momentum across the business.","Certainly we had it in the communications, really beginning in the month of January, and continue into February. So this is a good sign. We do think that this 4G build out in China is upon us and we're seeing some good momentum because of that. And hopefully, it's the beginning of a pretty significant increase in capacity and bandwidth across a number of different areas beyond just China.","Vincent Roche","Yes, just to add a little bit more color to what David said, the infrastructure business is notoriously lumpy. So my own sense is what we will see is during the course of the year here, a lot more CapEx being spent to rollout 4G systems on a global basis not just China.","And perhaps China, it will be the tail really of the first half of the year. And I am expecting, as the year unfolds here that we'll see the continued build out of the densification of the American 4G network as the demand for 4G devices continues to increase. And the appetite for data continues to explode here.","And Europe requires an upgrade, I think that's well-known. And again, my sense there is that as the year unfolds, Europe will start to elevate in terms of demand. And it will be very much 4G-related as well. So really good position as a company, because we've invested heavily over the past four or five years to make sure that we've got the underlying technologies to be the dominant player in the radio system.","Operator","Your next question is from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank","A bigger picture question for you. If I look at your revenues in calendar '13, excluding the consumer space, you guys grew pretty much in line with your peers, and that consumer space has been down for, I believe, three years running. I know you sold-off part of the sensor business, et cetera, but what are the strategic options for that consumer business? And do you think that's going to continue to be a headwind for overall ADI revenue growth going forward?","Vincent Roche","Well, we've made no secret of it, Ross, that we've done resteering our investments into B2B applications primarily over the last four or five years. And just given the development cycles for those particular products and those particular market categories, and the adoptions cycles, it just takes time in the B2B space. So my sense is over the next year or two years, we will start to see some significant tailwinds in terms of the product cycles in automotive, infrastructure and the industrial market.","Now, consumer is an area where we've been picking our spots very, very carefully. We have purposefully decided that there are parts of portables that are of big interest to the company in terms of bringing sensing and signal processing technology to play. And while all that's been happening, we've taken our R&D percentage five or six years ago from 40% of the entire R&D budget going to consumer to a much, much smaller number right now.","So I think what consumer has given us is very much a headwind over the last couple of years. In fact, over the last five years, we've taken about a $0.25 billion of our topline out of the consumer space. What my sense is now, the investment portfolio targeted the B2B space largely, and the spots that we've picked in consumer will stand the company in good stead. So I think the headwind that has been consumer will be behind us in the next year or thereabouts and we'll start to see the tailwind that is B2B space.","Operator","Your next question is from Steve Smigie from Raymond James.","Steve Smigie - Raymond James","I was hoping you could talk in some more detail about your MEMS business, specifically what sort of growth opportunity do you see in that? And could you break out a little bit for that growth. Is it more likely to show up in industrial versus auto?","Vincent Roche","Yes. We've built the franchise of MEMS in the company around the automotive, the airbag ignition applications. And what we're seeing more and more now is opportunity in the industrial area. So we continue to make automotive the primary consumer of R&D. But we also now have begun to diversify into healthcare and industrial applications, into things like monitoring, for example, for healthcare.","And also areas like vibration monitoring in industrial plants and equipment. So our sense is we've sequentially over the last career three or four years increased every year of the R&D spend in the MEMS business, given our confidence in that technology and its valued-ADI over the long-term.","Operator","Your next question is from Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley.","Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley","Vince, just following-up on the positive customer feedback. I think you had alluded to that last quarter. Can you just talk about from Q1 into Q2 has that kind of changed? Has it strengthened a bit? And any other anecdotes, given that you did say, macro is still mixed, yet it seems customers are a little more positive?","Vincent Roche","I think if you take a longer time window, I would say the second half of '13 saw a distinctly different positive sentiment, let's say, a level of positive sentiment compared to the first half and I think that continues. I think people are on the margins, our customers are more confident and their customers are more confident about the macro situation. And I think what I've seen through the second half of '13 has continued in terms of order momentum as well as positive sentiment.","Operator","Your next question is from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Dave, I want to go back to Romit's question just on gross margin, given that consumers' flat into April, it sounds like comms infrastructure is a little bit stronger than the midpoints and utilization going up, but your drop there is good, but it's still kind of below your average. Is there anything that I'm missing? Is the utilization benefit that you're getting in April really flowing through to July? And how should I think about incremental margins from these levels?","David Zinsner","It could. I mean, the reason it gets a little bit hedged is because we may not get the full benefit and that we may take some inventory reserves, and that could drive the margins a little bit lower. It's somewhat an anomalous moment of a little bit of a reset of the inventory levels.","And so that will happen for one quarter and then not repeat itself after that. That would be the only reason that it wouldn't hedged. I would tell you that virtually every end market, we don't have that kind of disparity of our gross margins between the different end markets. They are almost all like very high.","You think of consumer, and I know a lot of times you have a tendency to look at that as being a really low margin business. But for us because of the quality of our products and where we target them, the margins are actually very good in that space. So there is not a big mix shift like you get in other companies depending on those end markets. They're really good and they all generate high gross margins.","So mix is not quite as bigger driver for us. The bigger driver would be the utilization levels and things that we're doing to improve gross margin over time. The utilization levels, depending on whether we hit them, kind of the low end of our utilization guidance or the high end of our utilization guidance, will probably mostly determine whether we're up 50 to a 100 basis points.","Operator","Your next question is from Craig Ellis from B. Riley.","Craig Ellis - B. Riley","It's a follow-up to, John, just on the gross margin remarks that you had, Dave. When I look at the trajectory of gross margin after the guidance, relative to revenues and look back at historic peak levels, it looks like your gross margins are cracking a little bit better than revenues to get back to past peak. So as we look at that, how much of that is either intra or inter-segment mix dynamics versus any other initiatives that the company might have maybe around pricing or other factors? And where are we in those initiatives? How much is left to go?","David Zinsner","Again, mix doesn't really have a tremendous impact, maybe 20 or 30 basis points, plus or minus. I think the bigger driver of kind of the incremental benefit we're getting off gross margins this year versus last year has been a lot more disciplined around both pricing and cost.","And I think I've talked about in the past that we have a group within the company that is identifying opportunity, both on pricing cost that could incrementally improve gross margins and we've had tremendous success. I report, fairly regularly to Vince on it. And I've been really impressed with the teams' ability to find little nuggets of opportunity and get better pricing and get better cost over time.","So I think that has been a big driver. One thing that we talked a lot about, the gross margin leverage, but I think the EPS leverage is going to be really good this quarter. So I just do want to highlight the fact that we are going to get really good drop-through on the earning side and we're pretty with the performance there.","Operator","Your next question is from Kulin Patel from BMO Capital Markets.","Kulin Patel - BMO Capital Markets","This is Kulin Patel filling in for Ambrish. I had a question on your automated test equipment business. I understand that business is relatively large and pretty soft last year. How should we think about the cycle from that business as that business is ticking up in 2014?","Vincent Roche","First off, the ATE business for ADI, it is not that big. I mean, its part of our instrumentation business, which is a significant chunk of the overall industrial business, but ATE for ADI is a very lumpy business. So it modulates in terms of it's scale relative to the total, but it's a relatively small amount of business, but it has been really, over the last few years, it's all been driven by mobile products. And as the cycle of mobile products go, so will go the ATE business these days to a large extent.","So very hard to read at this point in time extremely lumpy, but there will be cycles during the year here in terms of things like obviously smartphone platforms, variable devices, and I believe those dynamics will drive ATE business. So I just want to make it clear that it isn't a very large part of ADI's business, our instrumentation business is really a very diversified group of customers in the many thousands across the globe who represent the classical long tail of ADI.","Operator","Your next question is from Stephen Chin from UBS.","Stephen Chin - UBS","Given your strong net cash position, I want to get some thoughts on the strategy of building versus buying new products, the example would be the investments in your portables market currently, at least long-term particularly related to that end market. I mean any thoughts on, if there are high quality IPs that might be out there and the asset value out there today, relative the time-to-market, because I understand investments in the frozen market may take some time to generate new revenue?","David Zinsner","I will start. I'm sure Vince has an opinion on this as well. Since I'm doing M&A I can probably just start. We do have a strategy in place to do acquisitions and actually it's been around for quite some time, actually, although I recently have started to take more responsibility over. And I think for the most part, we're looking for technologies, IP as you pointed out, that tucked-in within ADI really bringing greater value to our customers.","So it's generally are going to be very small acquisitions as they have been in the past. Although, there could be one, that's kind of a little bit larger than small over time. And that is the use of some of the cash. The rest, of course, is for funding the dividend and the buyback as well. So we're not trying to accumulate a ton of cash.","We do have a structure in place that does generate a fair amount of cash offshore, which that has to be used for things other than dividends and buybacks for the most part. So in that case, we do look for opportunities to utilize some of that cash to drive growth a little bit further and to enhance our kind of portfolio.","Operator","Your next question is from Terence Whalen from Citi.","Atif Malik - Citi","This is Atif for Terence. Within your consumer business, can you talk about what percentage of it is still DSP camera related and if those sales are still contracting or have stabilized?","David Zinsner","Camera is relatively small percentage of the total and a relatively small percentage of the consumer business. We think we're at a point where it's not in contraction mode. We've kind of leveled-off here. There's still a good opportunity for us particularly in the high performance part of the market and that's where most of our demand is today.","Operator","Your next question is from Stacy Rasgon from Sanford.","Stacy Rasgon - Sanford","Over the last few quarters, you had complained a little bit that your buyback algorithm was too conservative and that you would fix it, and obviously you're buying back a bit more stock now and you raised the authorization. So can you talk a little bit about the kind of changes that you have made to that algorithm in order to fix it? And I guess, overall your stock price today actually plays in determining the amount of the buyback in that new algorithm?","David Zinsner","Well, basically, we used pretty much our rolling average. It was a longer-term rolling average and we've created, I guess, a little bit more of a, call it maybe complex, would be the way to describe it, but different approach, where we use some longer-term and some shorter-term rolling averages, so that when it weakens, it's kind of like, had short-term weakness to it.","The buyback initiates as well. We tuned that I think in October, I believe, or some time around there or November, and this quarter we did have generally strong, but it did have these moments of weakness in it. And when it had these moments of weakness, the buyback executed.","So it's difficult to predict what will happen. Obviously, we want the stock price to go solidly up into the right. But to the extent it doesn't do that and it has some volatility to it, I think we'll do a better job or accumulate more in terms of buyback activity over time.","And we talked to the Board yesterday about that and that we thought that the buyback activity would ramp up a little bit more than it had been in the past. And by virtue of that, we felt like we needed to get the authorization backup to $1 billion as a matter of a housekeeping item. And the board was very supportive of that and agreed with our approach.","Operator","Your next question is from William Stein from SunTrust.","William Stein - SunTrust","You mentioned earlier that you had a book-to-bill book one and that some of your customers had expressed more optimism, it sounded like, and I wondered if that was concentrated in any particular end-market. And to the degree that it is the comms infrastructure end market, which is I think how it kind of came-off to me. I am wondering if you can comment on your ability to predict, forecast revenue in that end-market relative to the very short lead times that your customers have on to their customers?","Vincent Roche","Well, I think it's true to say that the book-to-bill has strength across the board, across all sectors and also our distributors, our largest distributors. I have also expressed the fact that they have seen very, very positive book-to-bills. Their orders are not so quite strong. And the largest part of our industrial business actually moves through the channel. So the strength is across the board at this point in time.","Operator","Your next is from Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs.","Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs","A follow-up to Ross' question from a while back. The question in my mind, how many more quarters -- understanding the real target is B2B and it takes a little while to kind of to get that ramped up, how many more quarters do you think that we'll see the wind down in consumers? Is there anyway to quantify that from a client basis?","Vincent Roche","I believe that during this fiscal year we're starting to bottom out in that business now. So they've said we've got an imaging business, which is beginning to find its true level. We've also got a prosumer business, which is a combination of many smaller customers buying many, many different products, which is very stable business for the company.","So my sense is the worst of the headwinds behind us and I believe during this year we'll find our kind organic level and build off that. And one thing we do have at least from a pipeline perspective, it's somewhat a matter of timing and how could those platforms take off. But we've had some very good design activity in the portable space, which is the area we are primarily focused on with good proprietary technology that we think is sustainable to multiple generations.","It's somewhat a matter of when those platforms take off and when they get introduced. Some of that might happen this year, some of that might happen next year. But I think that the momentum has certainly shifted towards one, where we're starting to focus on the growth side of the consumer story and away from the kind of contraction part of the story.","Operator","Your next question is from Ian Ing from MKM Partners.","Ian Ing - MKM Partners","For Vincent on industrial. It looks for April that segment is still going to be more than 20% below to prior peaks in 2011. So how much of the remaining recovery is going to be in this classic inventory cycle? And how is from new demand opportunities, things like equipment for manufacturing process control?","Vincent Roche","Well, I must say, I can't quantify that for you. But inventories are very lien there. So I think what we're seeing at this point in time is true demand. What we saw in 2011, of course, was a massive supply shortage and an over reaction in the market. So at least we don't have that do at this point. I believe what we're seeing is real demand. So I think the basis in which we're making our predictions is much steadier than it was two, three, four years ago.","Operator","Your next question is from Doug Freedman from RBC Capital Market.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Market","Could you talk to us a little bit about what you're seeing in the pricing environment out there in the marketplace right now?","Vincent Roche","I think for us pricing -- we're of course in the high performance side of the market, which has a lot more stability to it than the general analog space. And of course in the lower more general purpose oriented part of the market, they see massive ASP erosions. But I think partly because we have good proprietary technology. It's generally on the advance side, so we don't see a lot of competitors. It's generally in areas with long life cycles, so there isn't a lot of price competitions, generally lower volumes, so that also helps.","But if I can make one advertisement for my little general fair gross margin counsel, is that I do think that we have made ourselves a lot of improvements in how we approach pricing. We look at it more holistically. We have better analytics around it. We even have a budget around how we approach pricing from year-to-year. And so I think from our standpoint pricing has been amazingly stable, but it's because we've done a lone of work around both on the R&D side to develop good products and on the operational side to just execute really well on pricing.","Operator","Your next question is from Aashish Rao from Bank of America.","Aashish Rao - Bank of America","Vince, just a question on the competitive landscape in wireless infrastructure. Is TI still your primary competitor in converters for base station radios or have you seen some other vendors, any evidence of price cuts spring more design wins. But it seems like TI has that better sales growth in comms, but weaker margin. So any comments would be helpful?","Vincent Roche","I think, clearly, TI is our biggest competitor in the infrastructure space. Albeit, the approach we will take, but there is some overlap of course, but the approach we will take is quite different. We are very much radio signal processing, microwave and RF focused. And that's the area where we've been investing very heavily over a last number of years in terms of building out our capabilities.","We also have by the way a very good business with a leadership position in the optical control space, which is a space that uses again our precision portfolio. So there we have probably 50% of the market and we are growing share. And so I think what's been happening in the wireless part of the business is that share has been concentrating into the two or three big suppliers and I think that's going to continue.","Operator","Your next question is from Steve Smigie from Raymond James.","Steve Smigie - Raymond James","I was just wondering on the general DSP business, could Internet of Things potentially be a driver that gets that going to a more significant rate? And if I could just sneak a next one in, as we look at the gross margin, obviously you had pretty nice guide on revenue. And for a lot of my companies I see that gross margin benefit common subsequent quarters, the utilization benefits inventory. So it would be fair to say maybe the July quarter we could actually get some nice benefit on the gross margin side?","Vincent Roche","Well, the first one's an interesting question. I hadn't actually felt of that connection between IoT and DSP, but I believe that the Internet of Things, whatever it becomes, its many things to different people. But it's largely going to be about bringing lot's of real world phenomena into the cloud brain, so to speak, and designing data preference and building new business models around the information and intelligence.","Now, we're in a good position I think as a company to take advantage. We already play in what is emerging as the Internet of Things with industrial customers, healthcare customers, but it's really about the building blocks of sensing, very ultra-low power signal processing and communication. And those are all in need of digital signal processing, whether the processors we have are relevant to those signal processing task or not is a question. But there is a lot of digital signal processing, which leverages the skills and capabilities that we've got in this company on both analog as well as digital signal processing.","Operator","And so we have no further questions at this time.","Ali Husain","All right. So if we have no further questions, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us here tonight and keeping good time as well. Just to remind you that our second quarter FY '14 earnings call is scheduled for May 28, 2014, beginning at 5:00 PM Eastern Time. So thanks again for tuning in everyone.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Analog Devices Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the opening remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. Please limit yourself to one question to ensure that management has adequate time to speak to everyone. (Operator Instructions)","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Ali Husain, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Ali Husain","Great, thanks, Jennifer. And good afternoon, everyone and thanks for joining our fourth quarter and fiscal year \u201814 earnings conference call. We\u2019ve posted a press release and relating financial schedules on our IR website at investor.analog.com. ","Now, I\u2019d encourage everyone to follow along as we go through our results today. Our agenda for this afternoon\u2019s call will be as follows: First, I will provide a brief overview of our fourth quarter results. Then Dave Zinsner, our Chief Financial Officer, will review our financial performance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year \u201914 which will be detailed further in our 10-K which we expect to file next week as we finalize the purchase accounting relating to the Hittite transaction. Dave will also discuss our outlook for the first quarter fiscal \u201915. ","And then Vincent Roche, our President and CEO will provide closing remarks. Now after these comments, we will open it up for questions. Since we will be discussing both our fourth quarter and our fiscal year results today, our prepared remarks will run for about 20 minutes which should still leave ample for Q&A. ","Today's call will include non-GAAP financial measures that have been adjusted to exclude special items in order to provide investors with useful information regarding our historical results and our outlook. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release, which is posted on our IR website.","The information we are about to discuss including our objectives, and our first quarter outlook includes forward looking statements. These forward looking statements include risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those described in our most recent 10-Q. Our actual results could differ materially from the forward looking statements made on today\u2019s call. Subsequent events and developments may cause our outlook to change and except as required by law, we do not undertake any obligation to update the forward looking statements made by us today to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Therefore this conference call will include time sensitive information that may be accurate only as of the date of today\u2019s live broadcast.","So now let's start the call. ","So as you know, we completed the acquisition of Hittite Microwave in late July. So our fourth quarter was the first full quarter of contribution from Hittite. And our combined performance was very strong with results that were well above the midpoint of guidance. ","Revenue in the fourth quarter totaled $814 million, increasing 12% sequentially and 20% year-over-year. On an organic basis, revenue increased 2% sequentially and 8% year-over-year. ","communications infrastructure applications outperformed our revenue plan while the industrial automotive and consumer end markets were about in line with our expectations for the quarter. Revenue from communications infrastructure customers represented 27% of total sales, and increased 31% sequentially in the fourth quarter with both our organic and acquisition-related revenue growing faster than expected. ","On an organic basis, fourth quarter communications revenue grew 5% sequentially and 23% year-over-year. And for the fiscal year, communications infrastructure revenues totaled $681 million. ","Industrial customers represented 45% of total revenue in the quarter, increasing 6% sequentially and 19% year-over-year. On an organic basis, industrial performed as expected, declining 4% sequentially, primarily in the core industrial applications areas of automation and instrumentation while energy healthcare and defense and security in the aggregate were approximately flat sequentially. ","For the fiscal year, industrial application revenue totaled $1.3 billion. Our automotive business grew in line with expectations, increasing 3% sequentially and 2% year-over-year. And this market represented 17% of our total revenue in the fourth quarter. ","In fiscal \u201814 our automotive business grew 9%, or about two times the rate of vehicle unit growth. Automotive is now a $500 plus million a year business having grown at a 20 plus percent CAGR over the last five years and consequently more than doubling revenues since fiscal 2009. ","Consumer revenue increased 14% sequentially, declined 3% year-over-year and represented 11% of sales in the fourth quarter. Approximately half of our consumer business is within prosumer audio video applications where life cycles and profitability levels are akin to our industrial business. The balance of our consumer revenue or only about 6% of total sales is for more typical consumer applications such as smartphones, tablets, wearables and DSLR cameras where our technology provides a real strategic benefit to our customers. ","In total, we ended the year with revenue up approximately 9% to $2.9 billion of which 89% was from the industrial automotive and communications infrastructure markets. ","And so now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Dave for details of our financial performance in the quarter and for the full-year, as well as for our business outlook for the first quarter. With the exception of revenue, Dave\u2019s comments on our fourth quarter \u201814 P&L line items will exclude special items which in the aggregate totaled $126 million when comparing a fourth-quarter performance to our historical performance special items are also excluded from the sequential and year-over-year results. And reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their comparable GAAP measures are included on Schedule E of today's earnings release. Dave, it\u2019s all yours.","Dave Zinsner","Thanks, Ali. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. The fourth quarter was an excellent quarter across multiple dimensions. Revenue growth and profitability were strong and the strength of our balance sheet enabled us to meaningfully increase stock buyback activity in response to stock price volatility, which reduced our share count by approximately 2 million shares. ","Sales in the fourth quarter increased to a record $814 million, well above the midpoint of guidance, and diluted earnings-per-share, excluding special items, grew to $0.69, near the high end of the range. ","Gross margin at 66.4% of sales was better than our guidance on a better mix of business. Compared to the year ago period, gross margins increased 80 basis points on higher utilization and a better mix. Excluding acquisition-related inventory, days of inventory in the fourth quarter decreased by two days to 215 days and on a dollar basis, inventory increase $3 million compared to the prior quarter. ","We expect to bring utilization rates in our fabs down by approximately 10 percentage points to the low 60s in the first quarter which on an expected lower sales should keep dollars of inventory approximately flat to fourth quarter levels. ","Weeks of inventory in distribution were approximately 7.5 weeks consistent with the prior quarter. Total end customer orders decreased in the fourth quarter as compared to the third, in line with seasonal patterns and our book-to-bill was below 1 which is quite typical in advance of a seasonally slower first quarter. ","Lead times during the quarter were stable with virtually all shipments occurring within our stated lead times of 4 to 6 weeks. We continued to align our investments to critical strategic priorities and during the quarter we streamlined our management structure and took other actions to redirect investments while maintaining operating expense control. As a result, during the quarter we recorded a $35 million restructuring charge. ","Operating expenses in the fourth quarter increased 10% sequentially primarily from the inclusion of a full quarter\u2019s activity with Hittite. On an organic basis, expenses were approximately flat to the prior quarter. As a percent of sales, operating expenses in the fourth quarter declined 90 basis points sequentially and declined 70 basis points year-over-year. ","Operating profit before tax increased to $271 million or 33.2% of sales which is 70 basis points higher compared to the prior quarter and 140 basis points higher than the same quarter in the prior year. Other expense, which is primarily our net interest expense, was $6.4 million in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re expecting net interest expense to be approximately $5 million per quarter in fiscal 2015. ","Our tax rate in the fourth quarter was higher than planned as we adjusted our annual tax rate from 14.2% to 14.5% on higher than planned US income. Excluding special items, diluted earnings-per-share in the fourth quarter was $0.69, near the high-end of guidance and up 11% over the prior year. ","Cash flow in the fourth quarter continued to be very strong. We generated $262 million or 32% of sales in operating cash flow and CapEx was $43 million resulting in free cash flow of $219 million or 27% of revenue. ","Our fiscal 2015 plan is for capital spending to be between $150 million and $165 million, of which approximately $20 million relates to new facilities and upgrades to existing facilities, with the rest relating to our ongoing capital equipment spend. ","The return of cash to our shareholders has been the top financial priority. During the quarter we returned $304 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases which included stepped up buyback activity of $187 million. ","On November 25, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.37 per outstanding share of common stock. This will be paid on December 16 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on December 5. At the current stock price, this dividend represents an annual yield of approximately 2.9%. ","During the fourth quarter, our cash and short-term investment balance decreased by $2 billion to $2.9 billion as we repaid the short-term debt associated with the Hittite transaction. At the end of the fourth quarter we had approximately $900 million in debt outstanding, resulting in a net cash position of $2 billion, with approximately $900 million available domestically. ","As this is our first full quarter of contribution from Hittite, I'd like to give our investors some additional context around this great business. During the quarter, Hittite revenue increased to a record $81 million, which was up 15% year-over-year and delivered strong EPS accretion of 8% excluding special items. ","The transaction closed a little over three months ago and the integration efforts are going extremely well. We have already opened up the Hittite products to our OEM customers and all customers are now covered across direct and indirect channels. Our distribution channel has begun stocking the Hittite parts and within a few weeks customers can place orders for Hittite products with ADI\u2019s global distributor network and all order processing systems will be integrated. ","Now let me take a moment to talk about our performance in fiscal 2014. Revenues of $2.9 billion increased 9% over the prior year. On an organic basis, ADI grew 6% year-over-year with our core business of industrial, communications infrastructure and automotive combining for 10% revenue growth both for the fiscal year and on a five-year CAGR basis. ","Compared to the prior year non-GAAP gross margins of 66% and operating margins of 32% increased 170 basis points and 180 basis points respectively which was a good result in a period when factory utilization rates averaged only in the low 70s. While these are solid results, we are operating at the lower end of our financial leverage model range. As business conditions improve and our strategic investments continue to take hold, we expect that higher factory utilization rates coupled with careful expense management should drive better operating leverage. ","For the year we generated operating cash flow of $872 million or 30% of sales and free cash flow of $694 million or 24% of sales. In addition, during the year we increased our dividend by 9% which represented the 11th dividend increase in the last 10 years. ","During the year we repurchased $356 million of our stock. In total we returned $811 million or 117% of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. ","So in summary, ADI\u2019s fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 delivered solid results. We believe the portfolio and productivity actions we've taken set us up for better operating leverage as sales increase, factory utilization improves from current levels and we continue to tightly control operating expenses. ","So now to our outlook for the first quarter, which with the exception of revenue expectations are on a non-GAAP basis and excludes special items that are outlined in today's call and release. After a strong fourth quarter we are planning for normal seasonality in all our end markets in the first quarter which includes the holiday period and typical calendar year-end inventory rebalancing at customers. As a result, we are planning for fiscal quarter revenues to be in the range of $745 million to $775 million. At the midpoint of this range, revenue would increase 21% year-over-year. ","Based on lower expected sequential revenue, we plan to reduce production levels in the first quarter to the low 60s from their current low 70s levels. As a result we expect gross margins in the first quarter to be approximately 65%. We expect operating expenses in the first quarter to decline sequentially to approximately $263 million or down approximately $7 million. ","We\u2019re planning for our tax rate to be approximately 14.5% in the first quarter which is our planned non-GAAP tax rate for all of fiscal 2015. In total we expect diluted earnings-per-share to be between $0.58 and $0.64 excluding special items. We intend to keep our expenses under tight control in fiscal 2015 holding OpEx flat to fourth quarter run rates. ","For the year we plan to invest the savings of approximately $40 million relating to this quarter's restructuring charge by redirecting investments to strategic growth areas and to a lesser extent regular inflationary items. By fiscal quarter, we expect operating expenses in the first quarter decline and to increase in subsequent quarters but nevertheless excluding special items, we expect operating expense to decline as a percent of sales in 2015 and for our financial model to deliver better operating leverage. ","So now I will turn the call over to Vince to wrap it up.","Vincent Roche","Thank you, Dave and good afternoon to you all. As you can tell from our remarks this afternoon, we had a great fourth quarter and I am very pleased with our execution in what was a strong finish to fiscal \u201914. ","As we approach our 50th anniversary, I want to spend some time talking to you about where we stand today and where we want to take our company. At ADI, we\u2019ve been dedicated to delivering the highest performance signal processing products and solutions over the past 50 years to our tens of thousands of customers and across hundreds of applications. And we remain true to this mission. ","Over the past few years, we've been refocusing our strategy and our organization and directing investments to those areas that we believe will drive sustainable and profitable growth for ADI. As a result, we're in a stronger position today in terms of our technologies, our markets and our customers than we have been at any point in our history. ","This transformation, while difficult has been necessary and now provides us with a strong foundation upon which to continue to build the future of our company. As we have spoken to you many times before about many forces are driving the IT industry such as in the areas of automation and connectivity. ","From time to time I'd like to provide investors with a deeper perspective on key aspects of some of these trends and ADI\u2019s strategy relative to them. Now today I'd like to talk more specifically about connectivity which is becoming as important as electricity in the modern global economy. ","From connected devices to connected cars to connected machines, ubiquitous and secure connectivity is a critical challenge that we believe will help drive growth across our key markets. But what I want to focus on today is specific to our communications infrastructure business. By the end of the decade, networks will need to support 1000 times more data capacity likely on higher frequency bands to support next-generation communication standards. ","Today, only about 4% of mobile subscriptions are 4G, yet they are responsible for one-third of all mobile data traffic. In addition, the number of 4G subscribers is forecasted to increase more than seven-fold to about 30% by the end of the decade. ","Now the expected increase in average spectrum efficiency and the available spectrum is unlikely to keep pace with consumer demand leaving a significant gap requiring additional carrier investments in new base stations and transmission equipment. The increases in the number of 4G subscribers, the bandwidth used per subscriber and the number of base station units deployed is expected to effectively double our served available market in the area of communications infrastructure alone to about $4 billion by the end of 2020. ","Carriers are dealing with enormous challenges in keeping up with data demand. They need flexibility, efficiency and coverage while delivering ever-increasing bandwidth levels. The network must always be on, must be reliably available everywhere and must support new mission-critical applications, all under the envelope of decreasing total cost of ownership. ","In order to respond to these challenges, our customers are turning to new radio and smarter antenna architectures which maximize spectrum efficiency and significantly increase the radio channel count. At ADI, we anticipated these challenges and have invested aggressively to develop the highest performance signal processing products, processes and solutions over the past several years. In radio applications like all signal processing applications, the data converter defines the system performance and ADI is the undisputed converter leader. ","Over the last several years, we've increased our lead in converters and we've also augmented our technology offerings by developing and acquiring RF and microwave technology, high-speed clocking technology and critical algorithmic technology. RF and microwave expertise and the acquisition of Hittite are critical to our strategy to deliver the most advanced radio solutions. ","ADI now has the ability to convert the entire frequency spectrum all the way from digital to beyond 100 GHz which meaningfully differentiates us relative to our competitors. We have engaged with many of our largest customers and they too are very excited about our acquisition of Hittite, as we forge ahead together, re-architecting customer technology roadmaps in previously unimaginable ways. In fact, in the short period of time since we closed the transaction we are very very pleased with the early design activity ramp rate. ","As expected, we have raised the level of collaboration in our customers\u2019 design activities. For example, in key applications in communications infrastructure, aerospace and industrial instrumentation not only are we benefiting in the short term by the combination of the ADI and Hittite product portfolios, but our visibility into longer-term system design needs is dramatically increasing and opening up additional opportunity for ADI. ","So overall we\u2019re extremely pleased with the speed, the quality and results of our integration efforts which have been facilitated by the strong cultural affinity we share across our organizations, from engineering to customer support and of course to management. ","As you may have heard, Rick Hess, the former CEO of Hittite has joined my staff reporting to me with responsibility for not only RF and microwave but also communications infrastructure and automotive, the two markets we believe will be most transformed by ADI\u2019s connectivity solutions capability. ","So to summarize the overall theme of my prepared remarks, in our view the combination of greatly expanding demand for connectivity and limited available spectrum will drive growth for ADI in the infrastructure market. That said, this is just one of the exciting growth drivers that our diversified business is capitalizing on and these are all key ingredients that position us for sustainable earnings growth well into the future. ","So with that, I will turn it over to you for any questions that you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Smigie with Raymond James. ","Steve Smigie","So I was hoping you guys could talk about what you see happening with the gross margin as we move forward into April \u2013 obviously you\u2019re taking down utilization here. So you can talk a little bit about why you\u2019re doing that and how that looks into April?","Dave Zinsner","Now that\u2019s fairly typical that we kind of reduced production levels in the first quarter consistent with what most of our customers do by the way. So we usually take a margin hit in the first quarter, that as you know the second quarter tends to be a very good quarter for us, seasonally a very strong quarter with a lot of production days. And so in the second quarter we start to ramp back up production. And so my guess is we will very quickly step back to gross margins generally in the range that we exited fourth quarter at. And as you know we constantly are trying to make improvements on the gross margin front through the years. And so our goal is to continually drive those gross margins up over time so we get to the high-end of our 65% to 68% gross margin model. ","Steve Smigie","And then just on the revenue side, I guess you talked a lot about the comp opportunity. Can you talk a little bit about how that growth looks near-term, is that going to be your biggest driver over the next couple quarter? And there are some questions about CapEx spend over the next few quarters. Can you talk about how your dollar content gain may differentiate your growth versus that of the telecom equipment market?","Dave Zinsner","So I mean generally as we have looked at the communications business, obviously we\u2019re expecting it to come off a little bit this quarter which is fairly typical for the communications infrastructure space given many of our customers like to rebalance their inventories. But the end demand actually looks very good, and certain areas have pockets \u2013 periodic pockets of weakness but the beauty of our products as they go into equipment that ends up in just about every region of the world and so where some areas might be seeing weakness others are seeing strength. And so we generally think that communications is going to do quite well over the course of the year. And most of that is \u2013 as I think one of you \u2013 either Ali or Vince said in the prepared remarks, there is an overwhelming need for more bandwidth and we don't think that's going to abate anytime soon. So our expectation is that the business will do quite well. ","Our dollar content in 4G is at least 20% to 30% better than 3G and I think a lot of the carriers have indicated that they're going to migrate to small cell technology in a big way over the course of the next couple years, because that just will drive the radio count up over time. That\u2019s going to be very good for us because our dollar content for radio is quite good and if the number of radio increases on a unit basis, that should drive good tailwinds for us in that business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore","Question on the orders, and how the quarter unfolded. I know you said in your press release that the orders were stable in the quarter but there seemed to be some significant volatility amongst many of your peers .Can you just talk about how the quarter trended for you if you saw that volatility and what the cause was?","Dave Zinsner","Obviously the first month of the quarter was a little bit weaker, August. It came back a little bit in September and October finished off strong. I\u2019d say it was relatively stable though, per week it might've been a couple million dollars difference really on a per week basis. So we did not see any perturbation through the quarter. Other suppliers into the space are sometimes targeting different markets and those markets may have behaved differently than the markets that we\u2019re focused in. But I think in general things were very stable through the entire quarter and really continued to be stable in the month of November. ","Ross Seymore","I guess as my follow-up, just you mentioned in an answer to the prior question that you expected comps to be down, any sort of color on the down roughly 7% sequentially than your guidance, how that'll split between the foreign markets that you serve and then maybe in 2015 which would be the fastest or slowest growing of those, then I will go away. ","Dave Zinsner","My gut would say that communications probably will be down a little bit more than the other three end markets, which is definitely seasonal versus what happened in history. Industrial and automotive will also be down. My guess is that the consumer business although down will probably do a little bit better than the other three markets, simply because we have some decent product cycles that appear to be hitting in the first quarter to some extent. And so it might be a little bit insulated from what is typically seasonally down for the first quarter. ","For the year we\u2019re pretty optimistic about every end market I have to say. I think that four end markets are going to do quite well in the 2015 timeframe. We think in each case there's some good macro tailwinds going on and we've made a lot of investments particularly in what we call the B2B space which is the communications industrial and automotive markets over the last four, five years. And my guess is that, that will start to really generate revenue on a go forward basis. ","Operator","And our next question is from Tore Svanberg with Stifel.","Tore Svanberg","Vince, you talked about your connectivity business and thanks for that. I was also hoping if you could update us on your MEMS business and if there is any new initiatives there that we should be aware of?","Vincent Roche","You know, MEMS of course is very much for ADI centered in the automotive space. It\u2019s where we got our traction in that technology. We continue to invest heavily to make sure that we are over the long term a major major player in the MEMS business. It's instrumental in our safety strategy of course in general within the automotive sector. We have as well been developing some very very low-power technologies that are being used in new applications in the industrial space, for example, and also in the healthcare area. So it's a growing strategy for the company, it\u2019s an important strategy for the company, it\u2019s part of our sensor initiative which we talked in some depths at the analyst day. So it is still very very automotive centric but diversifying into particularly industrial and healthcare applications. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. ","Vivek Arya ","I will ask a two-parter. So first, just a very broad question for Vince. How you\u2019re thinking maybe broadly about 2015 because there seems to be a recovery but it varies quite a bit by region, US versus other regions. I am wondering what you\u2019re getting from your customers. And then my more detail question for Dave is that when I look at your Jan quarter guidance on gross margins, you\u2019re guiding sales down 7% but gross margins down 140 basis points. And when I look at the same period last year your sales declined by a similar amount but gross margins only came down by 50 bps and this year you have the benefit of the better mix from Hittite. So I am just curious why you are guiding gross margins down a bit more than they were last year despite having the benefit of mix from Hittite?","Vincent Roche","Okay. I will go first. So on your first question about FY\u201915, as Dave has said we\u2019re feeling pretty good about \u201815 overall. I think for ADI it's really a question of how the macro-economy behaves. Our customers generally speaking, I think \u2013 and I speak with a lot of our customers each quarter. I would say in all segments, industrial, communications infrastructure, automotive, our customers are feeling pretty good about the world and as I said, as long as the macroeconomy holds in play, I think we will have a very very decent \u201815 in across all the market sectors. And as Dave said we have \u2013 we\u2019ve got a couple of product cycles in the consumer space that should add additional revenue. And I think as well, we've gotten be the worst of the headwinds on the consumer business behind us. So I think as long as the market we will do fine.","Ali Husain","Vivek, i think we\u2019re getting something on the line there. Do you have your line on mute?","Vivek Arya ","I have unmuted just to make sure there is no \u2013","Dave Zinsner","Okay. So really when you look at it, rather than look at it kind of on a sequential basis, I look at it kind of on a year-over-year basis. So gross margins in the first quarter 2014 were about 65% and that is around the guidance that we\u2019re giving this quarter .And we are getting the benefit of Hittite. Now Hittite is only one-tenth of the size of ADI. So the margin accretion from that is a little bit but not significant at this point, although I would point out that we do expect the gross margins to improve for the Hittite business as we start to capture the synergies on the cost of manufacturing towards the end of 2015 and then into 2016. ","So really what -- utilization is going to be at fairly similar level in this quarter versus last year at this time. So net, net, those two are neutral. The difference really comes from the mix. The mix is going to be a little bit more negative this time around versus last year, and most of that quite honestly is the consumer business. The consumer business I think as a percent of revenue is going to end up being a little bit higher this quarter versus last year. And that\u2019s going to drive it. So in any event that actually basically is the answer of that question.","Operator","Our next question is from Craig Ellis with B. Riley Caris. ","Craig Ellis","Dave, you and Vince indicated that you're happy with the way the Hittite integration is going. And it sounds like a lot of the work has been done to get the channels to a point where you can start driving sales. You\u2019ve talked about the potential for revenue synergies in the past. Can you quantify what you might be able to realize as you look out over the coming fiscal year from a revenue synergy standpoint as you put the Hittite product into your channel and vice versa?","Dave Zinsner","Well I can't point at this point give you a specific figure on what we have in terms of synergies. It\u2019s a little bit early to tell at this point but I would say that the early traction we have gotten at a customer level has been very significant. Of course it takes a couple years before that translates into revenue for us, because those are the markets we operate in. But there have been several cases where we actually were not going to win the next generation of a product or we were going to get a very piecemeal portion of the product where the entire dialogue between us and the customer changed radically when we had the Hittite products to offer. So we were really starting to go from just talking about some sub-segment of the circuit design to a whole solution that we could provide given our ability to do the microwave portion of the spectrum. ","Vincent Roche","So I think Craig, in terms of timing just to add more color to what Dave has said. Given the design cycles, I think when we announced the acquisition of Hittite, we had said that we thought we should start to see some uptick in revenue, additional revenue beyond the Hittite specific pipeline with the combination of the two pieces in the FY \u201816 kind of area. So that's my sense. We will begin to see the revenue growth benefits through the OEM distribution channels somewhere in the - I think the early part of 2016, late 2015, early part of 2016. ","Operator","And our next question is from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets.","Ambrish Srivastava ","Just one for me. What specific areas are you targeting for the joint products between Hittite which helped the core outlook?","Vincent Roche","The great strength of the franchise we\u2019ve gotten now, that we combine the ADI\u2019s strengths in mixed-signal and the very very high-performance analog signal processing products that Hittite has got, and one of the great attractions to us of course is that it directly lines up with the markets that we really care about. So areas like industrial infrastructure, for example, you know in the instrumentation area specifically, areas like aerospace, Hittite has a strong position in the military area, and I think we'll see additional growth there. Of course communications infrastructure, the backhaul and the emerging 5G networks that require much much higher frequency coverage will benefit from the capabilities that we can bring jointly. ","As you know there are in the area of automotive applications for radar technology, and the frequency levels there get ever higher. So it's very diverse and the good news is that from our customer standpoint we can cover the applications from end to end and that's exactly what we are setting out to do and we\u2019ve made as Dave said very good progress in engaging with our OEM customers and are now really beginning in earnest the movement of our products through the distribution channels, could give us the long-tail effects so to speak.","Operator","Our next question is from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer ","I guess I will ask my question on the auto business. Vince, it\u2019s been a great business for you guys. As you mentioned in your prepared comments, I think a 20 plus percent CAGR over the last 5 years. That growth rate though has been decelerating a bit this year. I think it was up 9% for the full fiscal year but just 2% year-over-year in the fiscal fourth quarter. I am just kind of curious how much of that do you think is just some of the macro uncertainties out there hitting SARS versus timing of kind of content growth? And when you look out to fiscal year \u201915, how do you think about content versus unit growth for you guys and what could be sort of the applications we should be thinking about for content growth going forward?","Vincent Roche","Yeah, it\u2019s a great question. I think from our perspective we've obviously been way out growing the unit volumes of cars being sold over the past five years. My sense is on a steady state basis over the longer-term if we could grow our revenues at 2x kind of the unit volume of cars that would be a good result. And I will give you a little more color. I think \u2013 yeah, we have seen a little deceleration of the business of late, our infotainment business is very strong and growing. We\u2019ve announced some very exciting new products there as well just recently in that area. I think the area where our growth has been little slower of late is safety and specifically in the active and passive safety area where some of the older products have just lingered a little bit longer. But again we have a great pipeline of products that go across the entire safety spectrum, active, passive as well as predictive. ","So my sense is we will be through 15 in better shape in terms of growth assuming again that the macroeconomy holds up. But as I said I think if we could grow this business at 2x the rate of car growth that will be a very good result over the long-term. ","Operator","Our next question is from Ian Ing with MKM Partners LLC. ","Ian Ing ","Yeah, thanks. I\u2019ve got a CapEx question here. So what are the milestones to eventually in-source the Hittite Microwave revenues? It looks like it\u2019s really elevating your CapEx spend right now, and then also, TI talks about being opportunistic to eventually to get low-cost manufacturing assets to meet incremental long-term demand; is that something you\u2019re looking at too?","Dave Zinsner","On the Hittite production, we at this point now plan to continue to do the front end wafers through outside boundaries. They actually were doing their own tests. The real cost savings is we\u2019re going to move that high-volume test activity to our captive facility in the Philippines. So it's really not really moving inside, I guess it\u2019s moving from one location to another internally that drives the benefits in terms of gross margin. What was the second question, Ian? I missed that.","Ian Ing ","Well manufacturing assets on a higher sale, TI talks about being opportunistic in certain situation, is that something you\u2019re looking at too or are you happy with \u2013","Dave Zinsner","We have -- we exited the fourth quarter operating at 70% -- mid low 70s utilization, we\u2019re going to come back down to the low 60s in the first quarter. My expectation is we get back up into the low to mid 70s in the second quarter. So we have quite a bit of headroom before we have to worry about adding capacity and quite honestly we actually have a lot of the clean room space already. So it\u2019s maybe a few pieces of equipment here, there that would actually expand that capacity quite significantly. So I mean we do buy equipment in the aftermarket in general for the front end. But I don't think that we\u2019re going to have any meaningful change in our CapEx approach over the foreseeable future, given that we have so much headroom in terms of our capacity. ","Operator","Our next question is from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Craig Hettenbach ","Vince, in prior calls you\u2019ve given some context on the industrial market in terms of customers and their view, there\u2019s a fair amount of variability by region today with Europe weakening a bit but US still very strong. I\u2019d love to get your take on what industrial customers are thinking going into next year and any particular sub-segments that standout to you from a growth perspective?","Vincent Roche","Yeah, regionally it\u2019s been fairly even, we\u2019ve been -- I think I mentioned before on a couple of calls that we\u2019ve been particularly pleased with the growth rate of our business in Asia in the industrial area and yeah, I think overall we've seen again good growth in Asia over the recent times, Japan included. With just less production days in Europe during the fourth quarter we saw a little bit of a downturn there .But overall I think the strength is quite evenly distributed and from a segment standpoint, energy has been strong particularly the transmission and distribution part of that. Automation has been strong and the instrumentation side of things took a little bit of a breather in the fourth quarter as expected particularly on the ATE side. But as I mentioned a little bit earlier our industrial customers in general are feeling good about the world, generally speaking looking into \u201815 and if the macroeconomy holds up I believe that the CapEx will be spent and we will benefit from that.","Ali Husain","Craig, I would just add that inventory in the channel was about 7.5 weeks this quarter. It\u2019s pretty consistent with prior quarter and deferred gross income was about flat as well the prior quarter. So I think from an inventory standpoint, I think things seem to be in pretty good shape there as well. So appreciate the question and we will move on to the next question, operator.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Chin with UBS.","Steve Chin ","A couple of follow-up questions on the automotive segment if I could. Just looking at the guidance for Q1, that are down seasonal quarter and that\u2019s consistent with the last two years where it was down sequentially in last Q1. But the two year prior to that, the automotive business was up. I was wondering if it\u2019s a function of just the existing part of technology wins that you have currently, where the business there is fairly normalizing and I am imagining a fairly concentrated in the more developed markets or developed market automotive manufacturers. But is there any potential for some of these new technologies like the active safety features and asking more infotainment design wins that may go into mas market vehicles, is there potential to change the seasonality in the business where we see like I guess three up quarters and the typical one down quarter \u2013 ","Vincent Roche","I am not sure we will change seasonality but to give you an example, our advanced driver systems business \u2013 the predictive safety business has been up actually about almost 20% year-over-year. So that part of the business is growing well, it\u2019s still a small part of the safety strategy for ADI but it\u2019s growing fast and as it penetrates, as that modality penetrates more and more car offerings in future we will benefit greatly from that. So I think the powertrain business which is around oil quality sensing, fuel sensing, around battery management that's going well. We have a tremendous penetration particularly on the battery side of things. But we've also got some new product waves coming aside from the advanced driver systems area. We have a new bus structure for processing audio and sound in a car which is gaining a lot of traction particularly in the mid and high-end of the car market. ","So I think as I said overall it's still going to be a -- i think a very good growth space for IC industry. The many, many cars now have got many thousands of semiconductors perf [ph], there is more and more sensing going to take place across many many facets of the car. So I think for the long-term it's going to be a great business. As I said a little bit earlier as well, we\u2019ve seen just some of our safety programs, some of the product cycles that are lasting but longer than we expected. But the design activity is very very strong and our business as well -- we put a lot of focus on trying to make sure our automotive business really reaches into the Asia region as well, so I think during \u201815 we will see some good uptick there with a couple of new customers that are quite significant. So I think overall it will be a great story for many many years to come.","Operator","Our next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein.","Stacy Rasgon ","If you don\u2019t mind, I would like to spend it on restructuring and OpEx. So can you talk about the restructuring you did, what did you -- where you\u2019re repurposing, is this Hittite related or does it go beyond that? And given the guidance with sort of flattish OpEx through 2015, how you\u2019re thinking about your variable compensation in that context? So are you already sort of incorporating it into that guidance or will there be variability depending on the business level?","Dave Zinsner","Okay. So this did not really include much in the way of Hittite restructuring. We think we took that charge in advance of this but most of it was as you might imagine we are heavily focused in the B2B space. And so we have kind of refined the resources necessary to operate successfully in consumer in the areas we want to operate in consumer, that was a meaningful part of the adjustments. And then there were some various product areas and quite honestly we also took a little bit of a more holistic view of the management structure and attempted to more streamline that to enable better decision-making and more align it with the strategic direction of ADI on a go forward basis. And so some of the areas impacted were in the management ranks quite honestly. I'm sorry, Stacy, what was the other part of your question?","Stacy Rasgon ","I am sorry. How are you I guess conceptually variable compensation next year?","Dave Zinsner","So on the variable comp side, that guidance of being flat to fourth quarter run rate contemplated that we would hopefully see variable compensation increasing next year. And so we contemplated that in our guidance for this kind of flattish \u2013 flattish related to the fourth quarter in terms of operating expenses. So that really won't be a headwind on the OpEx side.","Vincent Roche","Just a little more color Stacy and what Dave said, so we have reorganized the company and we have set up two large business units with tighter alignment between strategy and execution I would say. And as Dave said what we\u2019re trying to do is just get more speed in general to make \u2013 we\u2019re trying to make ADI faster everywhere and also get our engineers even closer to our customers. So I think with the restructuring there's been some natural efficiency gain and that's had a large impact on the restructuring of the company. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis ","I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on the softness or seasonality you are seeing in comp, that we\u2019ve seen maybe either by product or geography would be helpful. I think we have seen some weakness in wired, I think wireless has been let's negative in the Q4 from others, just curious your thoughts there.","Dave Zinsner","I mean this is really a standard seasonal, this is I wouldn't call it weakness, I\u2019d call it just kind of the standard seasonality we see given the fact that we have kind of their year ends -- our OEM customers, their year-end is impacting our business as they kind of calibrate inventory levels. But in general we\u2019ve seen that business being very very stable and disciplined. ","Vincent Roche","As you know our business has really two components, it\u2019s got the wireless infrastructure part which is the dominant part of the revenue stream in infrastructure but also the wired portion has behaved very very well over the last couple of quarters. So we've seen evenness in terms of performance in both areas but as Dave said, what we\u2019re seeing now is just a seasonal breather. ","Operator","And our next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust ","William Stein ","I am hoping to just get a clarification on the operating leverage comments. I thought I heard well you certainly guided OpEx for the coming quarter and I thought I heard a comment about 40 million of savings in that category. And I also heard about better leverage through the year. Can you maybe quantify it a little bit as we go through the year, what kind of leverage we can expect to see come in on the OpEx line?","Dave Zinsner","It\u2019s tough for me to predict what the top line is going to do which is what -- the major part of the numbers, to calculate the operating leverage. But what I can tell you is that we think OpEx will be down about $7 million in the first quarter. We will get about $40 million of savings from the restructuring. Obviously there are things that are going to be headwinds next year, one of which is as I already pointed out the variable compensation is expected to increase next year versus this year. Also we will have kind of the normal salary increases and so forth that come into the P&L through the year. But I think the expectation is that on average over the four quarters it should average about $270 million per quarter which is basically what we had in OpEx in the fourth quarter. The first quarter obviously may be 263 \u2013 whatever the number is, somewhere in that range. ","So the second, third, fourth, -- I am adding a quarter \u2013 second, third and fourth quarter will probably be a step function higher than that 270 to get the average to be somewhere in the range. I think it's going to be relatively flattish through the rest of the year though. It might incrementally add $1 million or $2 million per quarter, something in that range but I think in general it's not going to be terribly different from quarter to quarter through the year. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Freedman with RBC. ","Doug Freedman ","Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. If I could move our focus over to pricing and what you're seeing in the marketplace. I know you\u2019ve had some programs in the past that focused on your ASPs. Can you comment on what you're seeing in terms of year-on-year ASP changes in your portfolio or whether you've seen any like-for-like ASP changes in the products that you sell via annual contract?","Dave Zinsner","It\u2019s very relatively stable. I mean we are obviously in a competitive market and certain OEMs are top on us, as they are with all their suppliers. And so we see some erosion in some of the major customers that we see from year to year. But I think in general the margins are the \u2013 rather the ASPs have been relatively stable. We have obviously taken steps to manage the business so that we are extracting the right value on the ASP side for the value we\u2019re providing to the customers, not surprisingly. And so in certain instances that\u2019s enabled us to adjust prices in the opposite direction which has kind of helped I think stabilizing ASPs. And quite honestly that\u2019s been a real focus of mine quite honestly to \u2013 as I think as the key lever to seeing our gross margins expand to be focusing on that particular metric.","Operator","And our final question comes from Tristan Gerra with RW Baird.","Tristan Gerra","You mentioned opportunities in small cell in the next two years and what\u2019s the catalyst given the ramp of this product plan [ph] has been pushed out, and if you could talk about what the competitive landscape is going to look like in small cell relative to what you\u2019re seeing in base station today and how you feel you\u2019re positioned in this market?","Vincent Roche","So the first part of the question about what's driving \u2013 it\u2019s really the densification of the network. As you know carriers have been spending the last few years trying to build out a basic footprint but with the massive demand increase for bandwidth, carriers are now desperately trying to catch up with consumer demand by laying in more capacity to deal with the bandwidth needs. So there is a tremendous amount of performance, all the same kind of performance needs exist in the small cell, as the macro cell in terms of spectrum efficiency, number of channels -- number of radios and frequencies that can be managed flexibly albeit \u2013 in a smaller kind of footprint. But so we focus heavily as a company, as I said, we've been trying to get ahead by anticipating the needs. So we've got a transceiver portfolio that is best in class that has got us into a huge number of sockets across the globe in Asia, in America, in Europe. So I think what it will do it will add a lot more available market and that will be I think a large growth portion of the story as we move towards $4 billion sum over the next six or seven years. ","Dave Zinsner","And on the competitive landscape I think in general, it\u2019s the same dynamics as in the larger bases. I mean this is really hard stuff to do very high-speed radio capability now integrated and so this won\u2019t have I think an opportunity for new entrants at least from our standpoint, because this is just -- this is getting really really cutting-edge quite honestly. ","Ali Husain","And Tristan, what I would only add to that is we\u2019ve seen some of the headlines in the US about $34 odd billion of spectrum being auctioned, that sort of mid-level type spectrum is really centered in some of the more dense urban areas in the US. And so I think that's a very good sign that 2015 could be a good year for small cell as well. So I appreciation the question and I will have Vince to come back and provide us closing remarks before we sign off.","Vincent Roche","Thank you. Thanks Ali. So as we approach \u2013 we are in our FY \u201815 now -- i just want to let you know that we remain true to our core principles as a company.

My name is Samantha, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Analog Devices' Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. Mr. Husain, you may begin your conference.","Ali Husain","Thanks, Samantha. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Ali Husain, Director of Investor Relations. We appreciate you joining us for today's call. If listeners haven't yet seen our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2012 press release, or our form 10-K, both may be accessed through our website at investor.analog.com. This conference call is also accessible from the same page. A recording of this conference call will be available today within about 2 hours of this call's completion. It will remain available via telephone playback for a period of time and it will also be archived on the IR website.","In addition, we've updated the schedules on our IR website, which include the historical quarterly and annual summary P&L for continuing operations, as well as historical quarterly and annual information per revenue from continued operations by end market and product type.","Participating with me on today's call are Jerry Fishman, Chief Executive Officer; Vincent Roche, President; and Dave Zinsner, Vice President of Finance and CFO. During the first part the call, Jerry, Vince and Dave will present our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2012 results, as well as our short-term outlook. The remainder of the time will be devoted to answering questions from our analysts and investor participants.","During today's call, we may refer to non-GAAP financial measures that have been adjusted for certain non-recurring items in order to provide investors with useful information regarding our results of operations and business trends. We've included reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in today's earnings release, which is posted on the IR website.","I'd ask you to please note that the information we're about to discuss includes forward-looking statements intended to qualify for Safe Harbor from liability, established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include risks and uncertainties, and our actual results could differ materially from those we will be discussing. Factors that could contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those described in our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed earlier today.","The forward-looking information that's provided on this call represents our outlook as of today, and we do not undertake any obligation to update the forward-looking statements made by us. Subsequent events and developments may cause our outlook to change. Therefore, this conference call will include time-sensitive information that may be accurate only as of date of the live broadcast, which is November 27, 2012.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to ADI's CEO for opening remarks.","Jerald G. Fishman","Well, good afternoon to everybody, and thanks for joining our call. As the press release said, our revenues for Q4 totaled about $695 million, which was up approximately 2% from the previous quarter and down about 3% from the same quarter last year. These results were within the guidance range that we provided last quarter and are relatively strong results in what has turned out to be a very challenging environment. The diluted earnings per share were $0.58, which was slightly above the midpoint of our earlier guidance.","For the full year of 2012, revenue declined just under 10% to about $2.7 billion, which was a reflection of a poor economic environment for most of our fiscal year, coupled with unprecedented global uncertainty, which severely constrained capital spending in virtually all of our served markets. The only exception was our automotive business, which actually grew 11% year-over-year. But even in automotive, we showed some signs of a slowdown in the second half of 2012. Vince, our new President, our newly appointed President, will describe in much more detail the current trends and the outlooks that we see in each of our end markets.","Despite the lower revenues and the uncertainty throughout the year, ADI still produced a very credible result for the year, with gross margins of approximately 65%, operating margins of approximately 31% and operating cash flow of over $800 million, or about 30% of sales. In addition, we enhanced shareholder returns with dividends and share repurchases that totaled over $500 million during the fiscal year. We also ended the fiscal year with net cash -- or the gross cash we have less our debt, at over $3.1 billion.","Today, it's still a very challenging environment in virtually every region of the world. During Q4, the overall orders decreased at ADI, as customers became increasingly more cautious and our distributors reduced their inventories. We believe in Analog today that our current order rates are below the consumption rates of our products. Our book to bill for the quarter fell below 1, and we're entering Q1 with lower opening backlog than we had when we entered Q4 of 2012.","Given the continuing uncertainty out there, we've taken many actions around the company to protect the downside, while ensuring that we'll be ready for a snapback in order rates, which typically occurs with very little notice in our business. First, we began reducing our production levels in Q4, and we're planning to reduce them further in the first quarter to keep our inventory at appropriate levels. While operating our factories well below capacity will certainly reduce our gross margins in the short term, it will provide significant upside leverage, as it has in the past, when revenue growth resumes.","During the last down cycle, when our factories were being utilized at about 67%, our trough gross margins were about 63%. During the upturn, when utilization rates approached 80%, we achieved gross margins of over 67%. We're confident in our ability to achieve these gross margin levels, as business conditions improve, as factory utilization increases and as our product mix reverts to more typical and traditional levels for ADI. Just as in the previous cycle, we're keeping our lead times very short, providing very high service levels to our customers and remaining ready for any changes in market momentum.","Secondly, we've taken action throughout Analog Devices to reduce our expenses corporate-wide by moving resources to the most strategically relevant programs and away from those programs with less long-term potential. We're also planning to gain efficiencies with our new organization, which more closely aligns our product development programs with our customers' requirements. We're also planning a corporate-wide shutdown over the holiday period to give all our employees around the world a very deserved -- well-deserved rest, after a very challenging year, and this will provide temporary expense relief for Analog during the first quarter.","Thirdly, our variable incentive program that is operating for all Analog employees, which is directly tied to our growth rate and our operating margins, will normally modulate expenses in down cycles as it did in the last down cycle. In addition for 2013, we've increased the margin thresholds for incentive payments to levels more consistent with what we believe the business is capable of producing on the average. So therefore, for the same levels of performance, the bonus or incentive payments will be slightly lower. The effect of this change will likely be to reduce incentive payments in -- of 2013, beyond what would be typical and normal in previous times. We believe that these actions will be responsive to the downside, while also preparing us for the upside, which invariably follows in every cycle for ADI over many, many years.","So now I'd like to turn the call over to Vince, for some more detail on our performance and the trends in some of the end markets that we serve.","Vincent T. Roche","Well, thanks, Jerry, and good morning, everybody. Well as expected, our strongest sequential growth was in the consumer end market, which grew by 28% in the fourth quarter. The increase in consumer revenue was broad-based in what was a seasonally stronger consumer quarter, coupled with a strong product cycle for ADI. Our results were particularly good in audio and imaging applications in the portable space. Consumer was about 20% of total sales, up from 16% in the prior quarter.","Communications infrastructure grew by 3% sequentially and was higher than our plan coming into the quarter, which is a very good result, especially after a 10% sequential increase in the prior quarter. Wireless infrastructure growth -- drove the growth this past quarter, a combination of consumers who are buying LTE, or 4G ready smartphones, from companies such as Apple, Samsung and others, and ongoing wireless network build-outs in developed and developing economies is leading service providers to upgrade their networks. U.S. providers are advertising, as you know, their LTE networks and enhancing increased CapEx spending plans.","We also saw activity in the fourth quarter among our base station customers as they began to respond to China's announcement of TD-SCDMA Phase 6 and the 120,000 sites planned, which is twice the 2011 rollout. While GSM and 3G in particular, are the largest portion of our wireless revenue today, LTE, or 4G, is growing quickly, and will be a very significant growth driver in the coming few years. Communications revenue was 20% of total sales, consistent with the prior quarter. While the first quarter is expected to be steady to the fourth quarter, we expect wireless infrastructure deployments to more meaningfully impact our results towards the end of 2013.","Now industrial revenues, which we expected would be stable in the fourth quarter, actually declined 5% sequentially, in line with lower industrial production worldwide as dictated by the ongoing macro weakness and also as a result of continuing reduction in inventories by our industrial customer base. This market represents a myriad of small and midsized customers primarily served through our distribution channel, as well as many of the world's largest industrial equipment makers, and none of these customers had immunity from the decline. Most industrial application already [ph] declined sequentially, including process control, instrumentation and measurement equipment and medical imaging. Regionally, we saw the most pronounced declines in Europe and Japan. Defense and aerospace and medical instrumentation were relatively flat sequentially. The industrial end market represented 44% of total sales in Q4, down from 47% in the prior quarter.","On the automotive side, revenue declined by 4% sequentially, mostly as a result of lower unit sales of automobiles in Europe and in line with widely reported factory slowdowns at automotive manufacturers. While the declining revenue reflected the general weakness in automotive, we saw continued strength in newer products for Advanced Driver Assistance and powertrain efficiency systems, as our customers continued to deploy our innovative products in these growth sectors. Overall, automotive represented 16% of sales compared to 17% in the prior quarter.","Now on an annual basis, automotive was an obvious bright spot, growing 11% during fiscal '12 compared to FY '11, the third consecutive year of double-digit growth. All major automotive application areas grew year-over-year.","Our mix of business in the fourth quarter was anomalous compared to the rest of fiscal '12, as seasonal growth in consumer was further accelerated by new product adoption of key accounts. Beginning in the first quarter, we expect the business to shift to a more typical revenue mix.","So with that, I'll hand you over to Dave, who'll take us through the details of our financial results.","David A. Zinsner","Thanks, Vince. As Jerry had mentioned, fourth quarter revenue increased approximately 2% sequentially to $695 million and decreased 9.8% for the year to $2.7 billion. Our gross margin was 63.8% in the fourth quarter. This was down 180 basis points from the 65.6% we reported in the third quarter and down very slightly from the same period last year when revenues were higher. While an anomalous mix was the key factor, as Vince just described, we also made a decision to further reduce production levels mid-quarter in response to lower industrial and distributor orders, which reduced utilization below our original plan. Utilization decreased from 74% in the prior quarter to 67% in the fourth quarter.","Inventory on our balance sheet remained approximately flat to last quarter in dollar terms and was down on a days basis from 121 days in the prior quarter to 114 days in the fourth quarter. Weeks of inventory and distribution was down by 0.5 week and stood at about 7 weeks exiting the quarter, down from approximately 7.5 weeks in the prior quarter, which is a very significant adjustment in a short period of time. Channel inventories are now well below historical levels. Lead times for our direct OEM customers remained similar to last quarter and are in good control, with virtually all of our shipments to OEMs occurring within 4 weeks.","Operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $228 million compared to $230 million in the prior quarter excluding restructuring expense taken in the prior quarter. The decrease was primarily due to tight control of our expense and also due to our variable compensation model, which is linked to our year-over-year sales change and quarterly operating profit.","Operating profits before tax for the fourth quarter were $215 million or 31% of sales, down 100 basis points from the prior quarter, excluding restructuring charges taken in the prior quarter and a solid result in the current environment. Other expense of $3 million in the fourth quarter was flat to the third quarter and reflects the ongoing run rate of our net interest expense.","Our fourth quarter tax rate was approximately 16%, which represents an adjustment of our annual tax rate from 22% to 20%. We continuously look for efficiencies in our tax structure and based on current assumptions, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 18% for each quarter in fiscal 2013.","Diluted earnings per share of $0.58 in the fourth quarter was above the midpoint of our guidance and up 4% sequentially from the prior quarter on a 2% increase in revenue. For the year, diluted earnings per share was $2.13.","We generated very strong cash flow in the fourth quarter at 34% of revenue or $236 million in operating cash flow. Capital expenditures were $38 million, resulting in free cash flow of approximately $200 million or 29% of revenue for the quarter.","Our accounts receivable balance was down about $6 million versus the last quarter on lower shipments, and our day sales outstanding decreased to 45 days from 46 days in the prior quarter.","During the fourth quarter, we purchased $21 million of our stock and distributed approximately $91 million or 51% of our net income in dividends to our shareholders. For the year, we repurchased $161 million of our stock and distributed $345 million in dividends to our shareholders. We plan to continue to be opportunistic buyers of our stock and to enhance returns to our shareholders. Since the start of our repurchase program, the company has repurchased approximately 129 million shares, or $4.4 billion of company stock. We have approximately $560 million remaining under our board-authorized share repurchase program.","Our cash and short-term investments balance increased $135 million during the fourth quarter and now stands at $3.9 billion, with approximately $1.1 billion available domestically. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had approximately $822 million in debt outstanding, from net cash on a per outstanding share basis was slightly above $10.","On November 26, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per outstanding share of common stock, which will be paid on December 18, 2012, to all shareholders of record at the close of business on December 7. At current stock prices, this dividend represents an annual yield of approximately 3%.","In summary, fourth quarter and fiscal 2012 delivered solid results during what turned out to be a very challenging period. So now I'll turn the call back over to Jerry, to discuss ADI's outlook for next quarter.","Jerald G. Fishman","Thanks, Dave. Our current expectations for Q1 revenues is for a decline of between 6% and 12% sequentially, which is certainly a larger decline than we'd normally anticipate in a typical Q1 for ADI. The most significant sequential decline in Q1 is likely to be in our consumer business, where our typical Q1 sales decline is exacerbated by inventory drawdowns after our customers prerelease inventory builds in Q4.","Based on the current forecasts from our largest communication customers and our largest automotive customers, we expect Q1 sales in those market segments should remain relatively flat to Q4 levels. So certainly, the big swing in Q1 will be industrial sales, which span a broad customer base in every geography. While the United States and Europe still comprise the bulk of our industrial sales, China is becoming a more important component of industrial sales over the past few years than it's been historically. Over many, many years of observation in our industrial business, it's very clear to us that industrial capital spending continues to drive our industrial business. And certainly, those trends have been, and are today, being negatively impacted by economic and tax uncertainties in the United States and in Europe and government actions in China.","In addition, many of our largest customers have announced extended factory shutdowns in late December and early January in the holiday period and are continuing inventory reductions. And lastly, our distributors have predicted less than seasonal forecasts for their fourth calendar quarter, of which 2 months overlaps our first calendar quarter.","On the other hand, if you want to look at the glass as half full, which some of us do, inventories at our industrial customers and our distributors are at extremely low levels, and our largest customers report that their business levels are stable and in some cases, improving. And that would suggest that they're going to begin to restock. But on balance, we believe at this juncture with the information we have as of now, it's prudent to be very cautious about what ADI's industrial sales are going to turn out to be in Q1, and we're planning for a sequential decline in this market segment in Q1. I think it's very important to note that we could get surprised in this segment. But it's more likely that any real upturn in our industrial business would occur in Q2 rather than in Q1, although it's still early to predict that.","In response to the weak demand environment that we experienced in Q4 and that we're planning in Q1, we're planning to further reduce factory operating levels in our production facilities, as I mentioned in my opening comments. In Q1, we're planning our factory utilization to drop from 67% in Q4 to the mid to high 50s in Q1, and for inventory dollars to be down, but days of inventory to be about flat given the significantly lower sales in Q1. As a result, we expect gross margins to be approximately 62% in Q1, which hopefully will be the low point of this cycle.","It's important to note, I think, that while changing inventory levels at our distributors don't affect our revenues, since we account for revenues worldwide on a sell-out methodology, when our distributors do start to restock to more traditional levels, it does positively impact our factory loadings and therefore positively impacts our gross margins. Given the strength of our position and the high market share that we enjoy in the industrial end markets, we'll be ready when a snapback in industrial does occur, as it always does. This will drive a better product mix, it will drive higher factory utilization and it will drive extraordinary operating leverage, as we demonstrated in previous cycles.","We're planning for our operating expenses to be down approximately 2% in Q1 based on the actions that I outlined in my earlier comments, and earnings to be in the range of $0.40 to $0.48 for the quarter.","In the longer term, we have an increasingly unique position at ADI, in the analog and signal processing market. We have very strong core technology, particularly in converters, in RF components and other linear functions, in MEMS, in power and in digital signal processing; and a very broad customer base, which provides great stability, but also provides the ability to leverage and bundle this technology into a much more complete and integrated solutions for a customer base that more and more depends on ADI to become their partner.","We're now engaging with customers at much higher levels than in the past, and we get consulted and involved in their architectural and system needs at a very early level. And this will certainly pay off in terms of sales growth and higher margins as business levels stabilize in the future.","The diversity of our end markets and of our 60,000 customers around the world where no consumer represented more than 5% of our sales in 2012, provide some measure of insulation from economic headwinds and product cycles and also, at the same time, provides the prospect of above-industry growth when the external world stabilizes.","Now, we at Analog, the management team and the employees of Analog, have been through difficult periods many time in our history, and we continue to make the necessary trade-offs to position ourselves to respond when the market turns, as they always do. Structural improvements that we implemented in previous years give us an added advantage in navigating difficult periods and allow us to protect the downside while standing ready to capture the upside when conditions get better.","Every time we've gone through one of these cycles, we come back better and we come back stronger, and I expect this time will be no different.","Ali Husain","Great. Thank you, Jerry. Thanks, Vince and Dave. [Operator Instructions] With that, operator, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Terence Whalen from Citi.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","The first question is related to gross margin. It seems like based on the utilization numbers that you've given of mid-50s for next quarter, it's a fairly pronounced action you're taking in the fabs. I guess my question is what's the motivation of that, given that inventory isn't too high? Is that more to just to set yourself up for a trajectory of extending gross margin in the April quarter? And if revenue were to grow in April of say 4% or 5%, would gross margin also bounce back then?","David A. Zinsner","So I'll take a stab at it; Jerry can add color if necessary. We're bringing our utilization down to 50 -- mid-50s levels. That is different than what we did last year at this time. We had a kind of a similar decline in revenue. But we allowed our days of inventory to kind of push up to 121 or 122 days last year. This time around, we're really trying to focus on keeping the days of inventory relatively flat, bringing the absolute dollars of inventory both on our balance sheet and the balance sheets of our distributors down. This is a bit different. The idea is it to get the inventories well balanced and then be ready to get the leverage when the business returns to growth. And as you point out, we had a big turn up in revenue in the second quarter. We have a pretty quick acceleration in the gross margins quickly back to the levels you saw us operate in back in a few quarters ago.","Jerald G. Fishman","Yes, I'd say the other comment, Terry, is that we monitor the order input quite frequently. And just like last quarter, as we monitored the orders, we -- turns for factories down a little harder than we had anticipated. If the order input justifies it -- we don't make these decisions once a quarter, we make them more frequently. And if the orders begin to turn up and we see anything that we believe is sustainable, we can ramp very quickly. And with the levels of inventory that we're carrying, we can respond extremely quickly to any upside our customers provide to us. So I think it's all those phenomena saying we want to manage the inventory responsibly. But we also, at the same time, want to make sure that when business does pick up, that we can respond to whatever our customers ask us for, given that on incremental sales, particularly on the stuff that we build internally, the gross margins are extremely high. So we don't want to miss any of those sales and we don't want to hang any of our customers out to dry. So those are our objectives, really, to keep the inventories under good control and yet, be flexible enough that we can respond very, very quickly to any input order rate increase that we see.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Crystal clear. And as a quick follow-up, really on the OpEx line. You guys did a terrific job in the prior cycle, really reducing OpEx to help improve the operating margin. But when I look over the past 8 quarters, on a revenue that's about down 15% from where it was 2 quarters ago, you're right at the same OpEx bogey. So we've seen OpEx sort of creep back up the past couple of years. What's the message to investors in terms of OpEx discipline here, as we've seen OpEx creep up a little bit relative to sales over the past couple of years?","David A. Zinsner","Well, it did creep up a little bit in the third and fourth quarter on a relative basis. But I think if you go back 8 to 12 quarters, we probably were averaging in the kind of the low 220s -- $220 million in terms of OpEx. That's where we're going to go to roughly in the first quarter. So I think what we're doing is prudently reacting to a little bit more difficult environment. I think we've done -- at least, maybe just me, my perception of this, but we've done a very good job just closely managing OpEx to make sure that it doesn't get away from us while revenue is coming off. So I think in the rest of the year, we'll manage it very closely. And Jerry mentioned a number of actions we're taking in the first quarter. We'll continue to look at it every quarter and not allow it to escalate until we see a big recovery on the revenue side.","Jerald G. Fishman","I think the other perspective on that is that if you look at the OpEx over the last 2 years, for last year -- and I mean our OpEx is the same now, on a running rate basis, as it was 2 years ago. And one of those years had a lot of growth and one had declined. So I think what -- the way we're looking at it, it's hard to look at these things quarter-to-quarter because the revenues fluctuate a great deal. But I think we had very significant operating expense controls in the company, and that the evidence of that is that the operating expenses through a lot of different parts of the cycle have been flat for the last 2 years, roughly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","For the first question, you had mentioned about the variable comp and how that'll be a little bit lower, or the threshold to have it kick in would be a little bit higher. In general, should we think of it at a given level of revenues now, you're going to have a lower level of OpEx, I guess is the first clarification? Then the second part of the question is with the shutdowns that you're having in the January quarter, what sort of OpEx increase should we look at in the April quarter, assuming the shutdowns don't repeat themselves?","David A. Zinsner","Yes, the shutdown is relatively modest. It's a couple of million dollars. And I think we have pretty good control over the OpEx; that we won't allow it to go up, unless the revenues start to grow. And even if it does grow, it'll grow at a fairly modest rate. At a given revenue level, there are some other things that kind of crept in that offset some of the decline mostly on the variable comp piece. So some of it's awash and I think OpEx, we're generally trying to get the business to operate in kind of the low 30s, 30% to 31%, 32% of revenue, and that's what we're kind of target to get back to as business kind of grows.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And I guess as my one follow-up, on the cash flow side of the equation. Can you remind us what your expectations are for CapEx in the first quarter and then for the full fiscal year '13?","David A. Zinsner","We're targeting to be somewhere in the neighborhood of $25 million for the first quarter. We have a general goal to be in the kind of $100 million to $125 million for the year. It obviously depends on how the business operates. If it -- if we see more of a flattish environment, we'll probably be more towards the $100 million. If things start to grow a bit, we'll probably be closer to $125 million.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Aashish Rao of Bank of America.","Aashish Rao - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My question, Dave, typically ADI's gross margins are more a function of utilization rates than product mix. But you noted the analogous mix due to the shift towards consumer. Could you help quantify the impact of both these factors on the gross margin softness in both 4Q and fiscal first quarter?","David A. Zinsner","Relative to the prior quarter or?","Aashish Rao - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes.","David A. Zinsner","I'd say most of the margin shift from the fourth quarter to the first quarter is going to be loading related. Very little of it's going to be related to mix. It'll be slightly beneficial actually the mix. But given that industrial will be down, kind of roughly what the corporate average is down, we're expecting that mix won't be a big factor. So that's fairly, for the most part, mostly loading related. The gross margin shift from the third quarter to the fourth quarter was pretty much a 50-50 split between mix and loading.","Aashish Rao - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, cool. And then one question, Jerry, I wanted to talk about one of the businesses that doesn't get much attention, and that's the DSPs. And your DSP sales have held up fairly well for the last several years and have outperformed your large competitors' embedded division, where sales are down 10% to 15% over the last year. What do you think are some of the reasons why your DSPs are holding up better? And any color on that would be helpful.","Jerald G. Fishman","Well, I think one reason, I believe, is that we have our -- we don't look at DSP as a sort of separate business on to itself. We're a signal processing company. We look to gear our DSPs towards integration of digital and analog signal processing into more integrated solutions for our customers. I think that selling stand-alone DSPs, and we've talked about that with investors a couple of years ago, is a very, very tough strategy in the market right now. So the real value of DSP for us -- I mean we still sell plenty of individual DSPs, but we also -- and the thing that's really kept it at the levels we need is we're able, from a market segment and a customer standpoint, to provide more complete solutions of analog and DSP together. And that gives us a great advantage relative to most other players in the market. The DSP business is -- we've gotten down to the right expense levels. And I think the group that manages that business have done a pretty good job at doing that, commensurate with what we see the opportunity to be. But we see many, many applications that have developed and will develop in the future, where integrating DSP and analog, very high performance analog together, provides a very compelling solution to our customers. Do you have any other comments on that Vince?","Vincent T. Roche","Yes, just maybe one other piece of color. In terms of the predominance of the segments in that DSP product revenue basis, really industrial, which is very steady, it's very, very diverse in terms of the number of customers that we serve. And we've also -- in terms of raw growth driver, automotive has been the primary push there. So they're the 2 primary markets that comprise the sales of DSP. And we're pretty well matched, I think, with both of them in terms of the, as Jerry said, a more standard product approach in the industrial space and a more targeted match between our DSP and analog technologies in more complete solutions in automotive.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","If I could follow up, Jerry, on your comment about -- I think you called the order pattern increasingly more cautious. Was that a function of orders went down a lot in the beginning of the quarter and then stabilized? Or did you see a steady decline in the orders over the course of the quarter and into the month of November?","Jerald G. Fishman","Well, we saw the orders decrease early in the quarter and they did sort of stabilize at those levels for the rest of the quarter. I mean that's the general trend we saw, and I think I'd make the same comments about November.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then you made the comment that you thought an industrial -- a recovery in the industrial segment was more likely in Q2 versus Q1. Is that a function of seasonality or what your customers are telling you? Or was there anything to read into that?","Jerald G. Fishman","Well, I think it's all those things. It's that in Q1 for us, particularly with -- the industrial business is 16,000 customers or something out there. So there's a lot of customers that shut down.  It's really a days of sale business for part of that in the broad base, and key account business with the large accounts. So typically, what we see in first quarter and given that there's less sales days is we see a decline in the first quarter. And we see a rebound in the second quarter since it's a quarter that's fully -- that's every day and every week are being worked by our customers. Also, I think given the inventory levels that the distributors are carrying and the customers are carrying, I mean and the amount that our industrial business is down relative to where it was, I mean just -- it's got to snap back. The only question is when it's going to happen. And if historical is a good representation of the future, which in the absence of any information, it is, we could see a snapback in that business in the second quarter. That's what we saw last year when the first quarter was down quite a bit. And in the absence of any other information, at least that's the planning assumption that we have right now in running the business. Now...","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Very helpful.","Jerald G. Fishman","I mean planning assumptions are just assumptions. But that's our assumption.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Danely from JPMorgan.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a quick follow-up on the bookings question that Jim asked. Is there any sort of common theme or common reason why your customers are telling you that the bookings are falling off? Is it pure inventory? Is it demand? Is it a combination? Is anybody mentioning anything about the fiscal cliff or any other economic problems?","Jerald G. Fishman","Well, I think it's all those things. I mean you go out to see the large customers and it was interesting this morning, there was -- the CEO of Honeywell was on TV, or yesterday or something. And he's sort of indicative of the kind of things that we're hearing from customers that their business levels are not dead. They're relatively stable. Some are even forecasting some growth next year, but there's so much uncertainty out there. In Europe and the United States, based on the same things about government tax policy, all of the stuff that's going on in the economies, that people are just standing still, and that impacts their capital spending budget, in a similar way to it's impacting the capital spending budget in Analog Devices, that at the margin, people just stop spending money until they can get some certainty. And that's just not rhetoric, that's what CEOs around the world are doing right now. But the part that's encouraging to us is that when we visit those companies, #1, they're really, really excited about our technology; #2, they want deeper levels of engagement with Analog as a technology provider and a partner, and they're saying that their businesses are not declining and they're either stable or getting just a little bit better. So all those things say there's nothing fundamentally wrong with that business that a good dose of courage out there in the political environment wouldn't solve.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And my follow-up is probably for Dave. Dave, do you remember when your utilization rates were this low? I think you guys said somewhere in the mid-50s, and what were your gross margins at the last time the utilization rates were this low? And do you have any figure on incremental gross margins as sales start to pick up?","David A. Zinsner","I think the last time we had utilization at this level was actually in 2009, so gross margins were in kind of the mid-50s. It was a little bit of a different environment, because we had a lot more capacity and business had really fallen off. Absent that, this is kind of an historic low for us outside of the period of time where it was really difficult. Usually, for every 10% improvement utilization, we get about 100 basis points of gross margin improvement. It can vary depending on -- based on mix and there's also loading that we get on the back end, which could be incrementally beneficial. So it has a little bit of a magnifying effect when business conditions improve. But on a rough order basis, I'd say it's at least 100 basis points.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of P.J. (sic) [C.J.] Muse of Barclays.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, C.J. Muse. I guess, first question, I was hoping to dig a little bit deeper on the operating leverage side. And so I guess the first part, as you think about the higher threshold on incentive pay and some of the other actions that you're taking, what kind of incremental savings you would be thinking about looking into calendar '13? And then as a part of that, how should we think about your target in terms of what incremental operating margins should look like in a more normalized recovery period into calendar '13?","David A. Zinsner","Well, we're roughly saving probably in the neighborhood of $20 million a year with the new bonus structure and equivalent level because, of course, there are other things that go in different directions. I would -- if I were modeling OpEx, I think what I would model is a very carefully managed OpEx growth assuming business recovers in the second quarter, which is one scenario. And then if the business kind of continues to improve, we'll be fairly modest in our growth on OpEx. So we should see leverage on the OpEx side during a recovery. Our operating margins, when we were at kind of peak performance on a revenue basis, were up over the 35% level. I think at its peak, we were up above 37%. And assuming we get back to business levels like that, our operating margins will be at similar levels. It's just a matter of dependent on when the revenue kind of moves in it in that direction.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's very helpful. And if I could ask a follow-up, in terms of the 18% tax rate guide for fiscal '13, I guess, what has changed to enable that to be lower? Are you assuming a greater mix outside of the U.S.? Or is that a tax strategy on your part or reduced expectations for fiscal '13 top line?","David A. Zinsner","Yes, we're assuming a similar mix of income domestically versus internationally and internationally within each region. This really has to do with just some tax planning that goes on all the time. And some of the benefit of that tax planning is showing up in next year's numbers, at least we expect it to.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra from Baird.","Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Where do you think LTE could be as a percent of mix 1 year from now? I understand it's probably still below 10% currently. And any views on the trends within infrastructures, specifically between base station and small cell?","Vincent T. Roche","Yes, the -- I would say in the second half of '12, the proportion of our wireless infrastructure business that was LTE or 4G was around 15%. Now I think as we get to the second half of FY '13, that number will probably move to 25% of total. And given that we have increased content to the tune of 20%, 30% depending on the customer from 3G to 4G, that should bode well in terms of revenue upside for the company. Let me see, your second question was regarding?","Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Base station, small cell opportunities.","Vincent T. Roche","Yes. Well, I think the thing to remember when you look at macro versus small cell, both are going to exist -- co-exist in the network. And our expectation is that macro will continue to grow. That's what our customers tell us. That's what the carriers tell us. And basically, to help densify the network, to fill a network out, particularly in terms of being able to supply data needs in urban environments, what we'll see is a pretty steep increase in the deployment of small cell. So what we're looking at is a homogenized network that will have coexistence of macro and small, more point-to-point units and obviously more backhaul optical and cable networking as well as to be able to support the movement of data worldwide. So that's pretty much it as we see it. So I think what you'll see is a huge increase in the number of radios that get deployed. And what we sell into the small cell area is a trickle-down from what we develop for macro cell and have been developing for many, many years now. So there's tremendous leverage as small cell becomes more prevalent in the network.","Jerald G. Fishman","I think just one color comment on that is that the ADI content in 4G is quite a bit higher than it is in 3G.","Ali Husain","So we have a number of people still waiting to ask questions. If we're unable to get your question within the allotted time, you can reach me after the call at (781) 461-3282, but we will continue and try to get to all the calls that we can. So before we take the last few questions, I'd like to mention that our first quarter 2013 earnings release is scheduled for February 19, 2013, after market close and our conference call will begin at approximately 5 p.m. Eastern Time that same day. So we're ready to take the additional questions now. Operator, may we have the next caller please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of the Doug Freedman of RBC.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","One, could you guys give us a look at sort of the real-time business conditions? I imagine lead times are low right now. And could you give us an idea of what the demand looks like for the month of December, given we're about to start that month?","Jerald G. Fishman","Well, that would sort of be predicting the future, which I mean we're not -- I mean we don't know what demand's going to be in December. We're cautious, particularly in the industrial business because there'll be a lot of shutdowns, as I mentioned earlier. So I think -- our sense and our internal plan is to just treat Q1 and be very, very cautious about what's going to happen because of the holiday period and all the things I mentioned earlier. So we'll have to just wait and see what happens in December. We just don't know.","Vincent T. Roche","On the lead time side of the story, we're shipping within 6-week lead times. We're shipping virtually 99% of the entire portfolio to on-time customer requests.","Jerald G. Fishman","I think the important thing that we're communicating around Analog and I think is worth mentioning tonight is that in the last cycle, when we managed the inventory well, we managed our capacity well and we did very, very well on the upside relative to many of our competitors, who got stuck and couldn't deliver stuff. So I think that's the mantra around Analog is that whatever we do -- and we know we can't predict demand, particularly in these tumultuous environments. But the one thing we can do and that we will do is make sure that we have supply when customers need it, and that's what we're going to do. So we just can't predict in the short term what's going to happen in any month or any week or any -- it's even hard to predict exactly what's going to happen in first quarter. And that's why the guidance range is so wide, and there's so many different factors that would enter into it. Now that's very typical in these cycles because customers know they don't have to give you a lot of lead time, so most of the business again is turns business. It's just the way it is. It's been like that, as you know, for 100 years. It will be like that for the next 100 years.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","All right. Jerry and Vince, I'm sorry, I'm a little confused by that answer, because if lead times are 6 weeks, you would have visibility for the month of December, and that's what I was asking for. I wasn't asking for...","Jerald G. Fishman","Are you talking about shipments...","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I was asking for what you're seeing.","Jerald G. Fishman","Are you asking about shipments in December or orders in December?","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Shipments, what you're seeing from a demand perspective for shipments in the month of December.","Jerald G. Fishman","I think what we're seeing is commensurate with the guidance that we've provided for December. We don't see anything anomalous to the guidance we've provided. That's how we sort of calculate the guidance. The only -- what I was commenting on is the order rate, not the shipment rate.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, understood. If I could, for my follow-up, Jerry, if we look back at the year and we go out to the 30,000-foot level, this cycle was not like any that we've seen in any of the past semiconductor cycles. Can you offer some of your commentary on what you think changed over the last year or 2 that has made it that we really didn't end up with what we would call a normal inventory cycle this year, only really seeing 1 seasonal quarter this whole year?","Jerald G. Fishman","I know, it's confusing, at best. The -- most of the cycles in the semiconductor business are and over many, many years have been based more on supply than demand. And there's always -- the semiconductor industry is always trying to catch up either to the upturn or the downturn and always misses it. So, so many of the cycles are based on just what's low -- how much capacity's there, shortages, double, triple ordering and then a reaction to that. And those cycles, were pretty straightforward and we've seen those many, many times. I think the big difference in this cycle that we've seen is just staggering uncertainty in the customer base, based on partly economic conditions, but also policy issues and tremendous uncertainty of what people are going to do about capital spending, which partially is related to their business levels, but is also related so nobody can figure out what's going to happen in those areas of policy. So I think that that's the difference in this cycle, that I think -- which is why it got shortened from what we'd normally see, why it was very, very to predict in the short term what's going to happen. I continue to believe if the uncertainty gets cleared up and people sort of understand the environment, whatever it is, good, bad or different, I think things will get better. That's our -- that's our sense of what's going on with the market based on what our largest customers and the senior executives at our largest customers are telling us. It's not just an internal theory of Analog. We spend a lot of time out there talking at very senior levels particularly to our industrial customers. And that's what they're telling us, so that's what I believe.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sumit Dhanda from ISI.","Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","[indiscernible] about quantitatively on the turns required for the quarter? Is it similar to what you registered in the October quarter, or higher, lower?","David A. Zinsner","I think you cut off just a little bit, Sumit. But basically, we don't typically quote turns. We don't even calculate them internally, just because a lot of our backlog is associated with orders from distributors, which don't translate into revenue until the distributors ship out the product to their end customers. But I think it's -- just qualitatively, I think it's safe to say that we're in a high-turns environment with limited backlog going into the quarter. And that's been relatively consistent over the last few quarters.","Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just some more detail on the consumer outlook for the January quarter. Is the big hit that you're taking in call it the audio business or the imaging business? Or is it not distinguishable in terms of the impact from one versus the other in the January quarter?","Vincent T. Roche","Well, we've multiple segments or subsegments under the consumer banner, and we typically see a seasonality decline in the 15% to 20% area. So what you're going to see this particular quarter is something similar. It's going to be all the segments and there's nothing really anomalous there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie from Raymond James.","Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Steve Smigie. Just with regard to your comments about your -- I guess, your wireless infrastructure business, you said that you expect them to be more meaningful towards the end of 2013. And I'm just wondering, is that suggesting there's going to be some softness sort of in the middle of the year? Or is there -- are there some specific programs you expect to ramp in 2013 that makes it specifically stronger? It's just your comments on\u2026","Vincent T. Roche","Yes, my comment on the infrastructure and comparing the second half of '12 to the second half of '13 is really in relation to the proportion of our business that is 4G, which I expect to increase and ramp during FY '13. So that was really the comment there more so than the particular order of demand patterns across the infrastructure market in general.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis of Caris & Company.","Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Jerry, I just wanted to take a step back and look a little bit longer term. As you look out over the course of 2013 calendar and you think about the underlying dynamics in ADI's different businesses, industrial communications, auto, et cetera, and the products that you have and the programs that you're involved in, where do you feel most confident that ADI can drive year-on-year growth in the coming year?","Jerald G. Fishman","Well, that's a real challenging question, given where we are and where we're coming from. So I think in each of the areas, in each of the market segments that are now strategically important to us, industrial and automotive and communications and even parts of the consumer market where we could add real value, I mean we're expecting that each of those is going to get better through the year. We'll see how it goes. We're starting off at a very low level, but I think in the long term, there are certain market segments, as I mentioned, that we're committed to strategically that we think we can change the user experience, get paid for what we do. Customers value us. I think those are the segments we're investing in. Ones that we've come to a conclusion, don't meet those criteria, we don't invest. I think we've shown that over the years and I think each year we go back and reassess what's the good, what's the bad, what's the ugly and we made changes in the portfolio mix each year, and sometimes more frequently. So it's very hard sitting where we're sitting today to say which of the segments are going to drive growth. I mean each of the segments has great opportunities. The real question is how does the market unfold during the year? Mostly on the economics side rather than on what product we have side. I think we're very confident about the product portfolio we have and the relations we have with our customers. For that part, we're consistently and increasingly confident about it. Just you just can't predict what's going to happen with aggregate business levels and sentiment out there, and that's the confusing thing out there. In the absence of that, we'd be very aggressive about what we could achieve in 2013.","Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the follow-up for Dave. Dave, channel inventories are at below normal levels. As you think about where you'd like to manage them in a more normalized environment, how should we think about where inventories would likely normalize as we move through the year next year?","David A. Zinsner","Well, the inventories that I mentioned are down kind of close to 7 weeks, which is definitely below our target levels. I think we'd like to see them be more in the range of 7.5 to 8 weeks. And, I think, probably, we'll be at the lower end of that, certainly, in the early part of the year. But as we kind of push forward through the year, I would expect us to normalize back to that level.","Ali Husain","So we are -- we still have a few callers here. So we'll keep going. Operator, can we have the next caller please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Eliscu of UBS.","Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","First of all on automotive, you -- if we look back at calendar 2011, you were growing in excess of 20% year-on-year. That settled down and now it looks to go negative. Should we think of a rebound as we go through the coming fiscal year back to the 20%-plus type growth rate? Or was there something unique in terms of an inventory build or a set of end products that aren't necessarily selling as well going forward?","Vincent T. Roche","Well, the automotive business has grown very fast in the company over the past 5 years. In the last 3 years, the compounded growth rate is somewhere in the region of 14% or 15%. And automotive is now a much bigger portion of ADI's revenue. It's a bigger number. But I would say the way to look at this thing is that the growth impact is more about the market and declining or muted car sales more so than the adoption of the technology. If anything, I would say the rate of designing of our products across the 3 areas of safety, powertrain and infotainment, is stronger than ever. We're penetrating in regions, our customers in Asia, now that we have not been so successful as in the past in a completely different way now, which bodes very well for the future. So my sense is it's more really about the market demand at the consumer level rather than demand for ADI products.","Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And as a follow-up, in the base station market, you talked about a 20% to 30% content increase as we go to LTE. I'm trying to understand, is that a onetime increase in content, because it is showing in your growth rate? Or is there something more long-term secular increase in content as we go to LTE advanced and small cells as we look out to the middle of the decade?","Vincent T. Roche","Yes, between all of the evolution from generation to generation from 2G, to 3G, to 4G, we've typically seen a 20% to 40% increase in the value of the products we sell into those applications, partly because the complexity or sophistication of the products we're providing is greater. The performance increases from generation to generation. And also, we've been expanding our footprints in the -- in all these radio applications. So for example, we're providing a lot more radio frequency technology than we did say 5 or 6 years ago. We're beginning to meaningfully deploy clocking technology as well for timing generation and control. In areas like cable and optical infrastructure, we've a tremendous market share and growing in observation and control circuits. So I think it's really -- it's a function of the complexity of the products commanding a better ASP and also ADI expanding our bond footprint in each of the applications.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shawn Webster of Macquarie.","Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research","Dave, on the change in the tax structure, does that have any impact on your operating cash flow that's generated domestically? And can you remind us what that is?","David A. Zinsner","It does not have any impact on our cash flow for domestic cash flow. It's a -- runs -- it can vary depending on the quarter. But it's probably -- on a rough order, probably about 1\/3 of the total cash flow is generated in the U.S.","Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then on the military part of the business, can you remind us how much of that is -- it is as a percent of sales and what your outlook is for there?","David A. Zinsner","It's marginal; it's in the mid-single digits.","Vincent T. Roche","Yes, it's about -- it's roughly about 6% to 7% of the company's revenue depending on when you measure. And it's been relatively steady over the past year.","Ali Husain","Great. So that concludes our Q&A session. A couple of folks that we will get to after the call. We appreciate your participation and look forward to talking with all of you again during our first quarter 2013 earnings call scheduled for February 19, 2013, beginning at 5 p.m. Eastern Time.

Sir, the floor is yours.","Michael C. Lucarelli - Analog Devices, Inc.","Thank you, Jennifer. And good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our first quarter 2018 conference call. With me on the call today are ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah.","Anyone who missed the release, you can find it and relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com. This conference call is being webcast live and a recording will be archived at the Investor Relations section of our website.","Now on to the disclosures. The information we're about to discuss, including our objectives and outlook, includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.","Our commentary about ADI's first quarter financial results will include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude special items. When comparing our first quarter results to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from the prior quarter and year-over-year results. Available reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release and on our web schedules, which we've posted under the Quarterly Results section at investor.analog.com. And lastly, I'd like to remind investors that our first quarter was a 14-week quarter.","Okay. So, with that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche. Vince?","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Well, the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was another very successful quarter for ADI with momentum continuing across our business, and I'm very pleased to share our results with you now.","Revenue in the first quarter came in at the high end of our guidance as strength across our B2B markets offset the expected decline in our consumer business. Our strong execution as a combined company delivered substantial growth and operating margin expansion compared to the year ago quarter, resulting in a 50% increase year-over-year in our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. And our combined company adjusted free cash flow margins over the trailing 12 months continues to place us in the highest tier in the S&P 500.","So digging into our markets. The industrial end market, consisting of a diverse, highly fragmented set of applications, represented approximately 50% of sales in the quarter. Our sales into this market have been stellar, increasing an average of 8% annually over the past five years, outperforming GDP by 2 times to 3 times.","I'd like to spend some time today now providing a little insight into why we believe we've outperformed in this market and why we remain excited for the future. On a broad level, we believe we've gained market share by targeting the right applications, developing the right products, and bringing our domain expertise to bear as we engage with our customers at a more system-oriented level.","For example, in our instrumentation business, our cutting edge mixed-signal RF and microwave and power solutions are enabling the most advanced test solutions for 5G data center operations and battery formation and deployment for new and existing customers.","The aerospace and defense sector continues to be a strong growth market for ADI also. This business is driven largely by fleet modernization and the development and deployment of complex applications that require the highest performing electronics such as phased array radar. The combination of ADI's mixed-signal Hittite Microwave and LTC's power portfolios enables us unprecedented levels of integration across the signal chain and more than doubles our available market.","Our industrial automation and process control business continues to benefit as factory floors transform to become more flexible and more automated. Customers are striving for higher overall productivity and a higher variety of output. In this changing landscape, our technology breadth and domain expertise is positioning us to win more of the BOM with customers worldwide who are engaged in brownfield upgrades and greenfield installations.","Looking to the future of automation and process control, also referred to as the industrial IoT, we believe that our customer engagements combined with emerging trends such as artificial intelligence-enabled machines, sensor-to-cloud data processing, ubiquitous sensing, and true real-time connectivity will enable consistent content expansion for ADI.","For example, on the factory floor of the future, robots and cobots will increasingly require more sensing modalities such as vibration, proximity and depth sensing as well as the highly-synchronized real-time communications capabilities that we are bringing to market. These developments open the opportunity to expand our dollar content by a factor of 5.","In short, we see continued momentum across our industrial applications, as we move into 2018. And that, coupled with the underlying sector trends I've just described, should position us for profitable growth over the long-term in this area.","So, turning now to the communications market. This sector represented 19% of sales in the first quarter and benefited from strong growth in wireless compared to the year ago quarter while wired demand remained weak. Our wireless business has increased at a high single-digit rate over the trailing 12 months due to share gains from recently released products co-designed with Hittite, strong demand for our integrated transceiver solutions and our position in virtually all emerging 5G and Massive MIMO trials.","We remain excited about our wireless infrastructure business, as we continued to grow share and increase content, despite a relatively flat CapEx environment. ADI's portfolio of RF and microwave, high-speed signal processing and power management is unmatched in breadth and depth. This portfolio, combined with our deep customer focus in the bigger verticals as well as in the broad market, is fueling our success.","Turning now to our automotive business, at 17% of sales, it performed better than our typical seasonality in the first quarter on strength from the infotainment and powertrain application areas. Our powertrain solutions that improved efficiency of both combustion engines and electric vehicles grew stronger than seasonal. We see this business becoming increasingly important for us, particularly as OEMs embrace broad electrification of their fleets.","Our infotainment application area has grown at a high single-digit rate over the past five years, thanks to our market leadership in high performance audio and video solutions that improve the passenger experience. We see continued momentum with our innovative A2B technology, which has secured design wins at major OEMs in every geographical region and is enabling creative new audio architectures that will come to market over the next few years.","So these businesses combined with our organic and technology acquisitions for next-gen sensing technologies necessary, for example, in Level 3 and beyond safety systems for autonomous vehicles, gives me great confidence that we're well positioned to grow at our long-term model of 2 times to 3 times SAAR.","In our consumer business, revenue decreased as expected, both sequentially and compared to our year-ago quarter and represented 16% of sales in the first quarter.","So before I hand the call over to Prashanth, I'd like to give you an update on our LTC integration progress. It's been nearly a year since we closed the acquisition, and we've made tremendous progress integrating and building something that we believe is greater than the sum of its parts by following a best of both approach.","At this point, everyone in our company across the entire organization, sales, engineering operations, manufacturing and so on, is working towards a common goal of delivering long-term profitable growth. And when you look at traditional measures of M&A success, our exceptional employee retention and strong financial results over the past year speak for themselves.","So we're on track to achieve the initial cost synergies we targeted when we announced the deal, and we continue to believe that we can realize meaningful revenue synergies over the long-term given the complementarity of our customer bases and products. As a rule of thumb, we believe that for every dollar of mixed-signal content ADI sells into a system, there's at least an equal value power opportunity that ADI can now more fully address.","With our sales and engineering teams now integrated and working together, our opportunity pipeline continues to expand, giving us more confidence in converting that $1 billion-plus synergy opportunity into revenue.","So to wrap it up, fiscal 2018 is off to a very strong start. Analog Devices' capabilities to effectively and efficiently bridge the digital and physical domains are needed more than ever as the world becomes more digital, more autonomous and more connected. With our ability to address opportunities from sensor-to-cloud, DC to 100 gigahertz and beyond, and nanowatts to kilowatts, we're confident in our ability to create shareholder value for years to come.","And so with that, let me hand it over to Prashanth.","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah - Analog Devices, Inc.","Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone, and let me add my welcome to our fiscal 2018 first quarter earnings call. With the exception of revenue and non-op expenses, my comments on the P&L line items will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release.","Before I get to our results for the quarter, I want to address three items. First, our recent announcement aimed around the streamlining of our global operations; second, the impact from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; and lastly, an update on our progress deleveraging.","Last month, we announced our intention to close our Hillview wafer fab and Singapore test operations. Following a careful and thoughtful analysis, we validated this decision based on the capabilities and overall strength of the world-class supply chain that we have built organically and through acquisition. It will take us about three-plus years to wind down these operations and ensure a smooth transition for our customers.","Once complete, these two factory closures represent a significant portion of the additional $100 million of cost synergies we outlined at our Analyst Day in June 2017. Our current quarter GAAP results include a charge of $57 million, the majority of which relate to this action and will be cash. The overall program, which will include some expenses in future periods, will have a good payback of approximately one year.","Next, I want to summarize the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on ADI, with the caveat that these are our initial estimates and could change as we refine our analysis. Investors should assume no change to our previously discussed long-term non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 12%, a level which we expect to return to in fiscal 2019. This comprehends the benefits of a lower statutory rate offset by a higher rate on foreign earnings.","However, our 2018 non-GAAP tax rate is forecasted to be in the range of 6% to 8% as the higher rate on our foreign earnings does not take effect until our next fiscal year. So let me take a moment to reconcile our first quarter GAAP to non-GAAP tax rate.","In the first quarter of 2018, our GAAP tax expense included a net charge of $47 million related to tax reform. This charge included an approximately $690 million accrual on the tax on indefinitely reinvested earnings, which was almost completely offset by approximately $640 million non-cash reduction in our deferred tax balances. We plan to pay this tax over eight years beginning in fiscal 2019, and we expect to pay approximately $60 million in each of the first five years and the remaining balance over the following three years. The end result from tax reform is that ADI can more optimally utilize the entirety of its cash position and continue to delever and return value to shareholders, which brings me to my last topic, leverage.","We exited our first fiscal 2018 quarter with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.4 times, down from 2.6 times in the prior quarter and down from 3 times at the close of the LTC deal last year. Given our strong cash flow generation capabilities, the momentum across our business, and the benefits associated with tax reform, we have confidence that we can reduce our debt by at least $1 billion annually, and we now expect to achieve our 2x leverage milestone exiting the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018. And once we achieve this leverage ratio, we will revisit our capital allocation strategy to ensure that we continue to optimize shareholder value.","So now, let's discuss the quarter. As Vince mentioned, the 14-week first quarter of 2018 was a very strong quarter for ADI. Revenue was 1.52 billion, above the midpoint of guidance and increased 54% year-over-year while declining 1% sequentially in the seasonally slower first quarter.","Looking at the combined company and excluding or backing out the benefit of the 14th week, our B2B revenue increased 10% year-over-year led by growth in the industrial market, which increased to mid-teens compared to the same quarter a year ago. Gross margins of 71% came in at the upper end of guidance and increased slightly compared to the fourth quarter.","Op expenses in the first quarter were $446 million or 29% of revenue. And on a 13-week basis, op expenses declined about 5% sequentially. We've now completed the OpEx synergies outlined in our LTC deal announcement. Strong revenue growth and operating leverage delivered operating margin of 41.7% at the upper end of guidance.","Non-op expenses in the first quarter were $66 million. We expect our non-op expenses to be approximately $60 million in our second quarter and a decline by $2 million to $3 million per quarter in fiscal 2018. Our first quarter non-GAAP tax rate was 6%. And as previously discussed, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate for 2018 to be in the range of 6% to 8% before increasing to the long-term expected rate of approximately 12% for fiscal 2019.","Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the first quarter was $1.42, and this included a benefit of $0.09 related to our lower tax rate. Excluding this benefit, our non-GAAP EPS came in at the upper end of the guided range.","That wraps of the P&L, and I'll move to the balance sheet. Inventory increased 2% sequentially or $9 million, primarily the result of our decision to keep production levels commensurate with bookings to maintain the customer service levels based on the B2B demand environment. As a result, days of inventory increased to 124, and we expect days to decline over the balance of the year beginning in the second quarter.","Distribution inventory was approximately 7.5 weeks, up slightly compared to the year-ago quarter, but in line with our outlook. We generated free cash of $325 million in the quarter. And in the trailing 12 months, adjusted free cash flow for the combined company was $1.8 billion.","CapEx additions in the fourth quarter were $63 million, and we expect CapEx in fiscal 2018 to run at our model of about 4% of sales. During the quarter, we paid $167 million in dividends. Our board of directors approved yesterday a 7% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.48 per share, which represents an annual dividend of $1.92.","So now, I'll move to the outlook and expectations for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, which with the exception of revenue, are also on a non-GAAP basis and exclude items outlined in today's release. We're planning for revenue in the second quarter to be in the range of $1.43 billion to $1.51 billion, an increase of 22% compared to the year-ago quarter at the midpoint. As a reminder, first quarter was a 14-week quarter and second quarter is back to a normal 13-week quarter.","Adjusting for this, we are planning our B2B markets, which include industrial, automotive, and comms in the aggregate to increase at a high single-digit rate sequentially and thus represent a larger mix of business. We're planning for gross margins to be in the range of 71% to 71.5% due to a more favorable mix and as we capture the final amount of our initial tranche of COGS synergies.","We expect OpEx to be in the range of $430 million to $440 million in the second quarter. And at the midpoint of this guidance, this implies a sub 30% OpEx as a percentage of sales once again. Based on these inputs, we expect operating margins in the second quarter of 2018 to be in the range of 41% to 42.5%, and for diluted EPS, excluding special items, to be in the range of $1.30 to $1.44.","So to summarize, we're off to a great start for the year. Industrial continues to have momentum across all our application areas. We're outperforming in comms driven by our strong position in wireless. In automotive, we're making great progress on putting the combined company on a strong growth trajectory. As Vince mentioned, the LTC integration is going very well, our innovation pipeline is rich, and we are just getting started.","With that, let me turn it over to Mike for our Q&A session.","Michael C. Lucarelli - Analog Devices, Inc.","Okay. Let's get to our Q&A session. Please limit your self to one question and after our initial response, we'll give you an opportunity for a follow-up question. Operator, can we have our first question, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes, thank you. A question for Vince, just your commentary about market share gains, can you provide any specific examples there in kind of how you view where you are in that process in terms of it translating into revenue?","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","Yes. Well, I think we're able to talk about market share gains in several sectors, Craig. If I just go to the industrial sector, for example, I think we've talked before about aerospace and defense being an area of increasing opportunity, system complexity and a place where we're able to combine the rich portfolio of the Hittite Microwave technologies with ADI's mixed-signal. And we're seeing continued digitalization in that space, fleet upgrades, and we're benefiting from that enormously.","And also, in automation, just the sheer breadth of what we have and the focus that we've had over the last several years in tuning the R&D portfolio, resteering our sales force globally into making sure that we keep our leadership position at the large customers is benefiting enormously, the whole growth story.","Also with a combination of LTC, as you know, the market overlaps were quite high between LTC and ADI. But the actual areas where our sales forces were playing were pretty complementary. So we're gaining, I think at the large customers, the small customers, with more breadth and depth in terms of portfolio than we've ever had.","If you look at the communications sector, I think again, the \u2013 we're starting to see the benefit now of the \u2013 particularly in the wireless area of the co-designed products with Hittites combined with ADI's, again, strength on the mixed-signal side in traditional macro base stations.","Our integrated transceivers are becoming, if you like, the standard now for massive MIMO developments in these hybrid macro small cell systems, where phased array antenna systems are being used with traditional antenna systems. So our software-defined transceiver is really being the standard, the benchmark now in that sector.","And as the trials begin for massive MIMO and 5G, we're in virtually all those trials globally. So I think those are just two \u2013 some subsets in the industrial area, particularly in the wireless area in communications where we have demonstrable gains, I believe, in market share.","Michael C. Lucarelli - Analog Devices, Inc.","Thanks for the question, Craig.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. Hi, sorry I'm just running around in a public space, so I apologize a little bit. My first question was can you just help us understand the deltas you had in the business segments? Just help us understand what happened as the quarter progressed in terms of the guidance that you had provided and the results that you ended up with?","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah - Analog Devices, Inc.","Can you clarify that question, Ambrish? Are you asking sequentially how the business did in the reported results?","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. My question is you had guided to certain results for \u2013 expectations for the \u2013 for all the segments, but the results came in different for each of the segment, particularly in automotive and also in industrials. So what transpired that your results were different than what you were expecting initially?","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah - Analog Devices, Inc.","Okay. Yeah, yeah. Thanks, Ambrish. So as a reminder, we no longer give guidance at the segment level, so we did not provide that for the first quarter. We did provide some broad indications on how B2B would do versus consumer. But now that the results are actual, Mike can kind of walk you through how each of the B2B segments -or each of the components of our B2B did on a year-over-year basis, which across the board were very good.","Michael C. Lucarelli - Analog Devices, Inc.","Yes, so Ambrish, we guided the B2B to be down mid single-digits. B2B came down 3% sequentially on a combined company basis, but I think they're pretty good results in the first quarter. And if you look at our automotive business, it was down 2% sequentially, which is a bit better than typical seasonality. We \u2013 Vince highlighted in his prepared comments, infotainment, powertrain application areas were stronger.","Our communications business, it's tough. There's really no seasonality in that business, but I think what's important there (25:58) it grew year-over-year, and it really was led by our wireless growth, which is up double digits year-over-year (26:02). And industrial was down about 3% sequentially on an adjusted basis or up mid-teens percent year-over-year, once again, very good strong growth there. In consumer, we thought it'd be weak. It was weak. It performed as we expected.","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah - Analog Devices, Inc.","Thanks for the questions, Ambrish.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","(26:20).","Michael C. Lucarelli - Analog Devices, Inc.","Do you have a follow-up?","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yes, I did. So, yeah, my question was on the inventory side. Inventories were up. And I think if I look back at the last several years, typically in the quarter, inventories are either flat or down on a dollar basis, but you said that you built inventory, but as you go through the year, you \u2013 in terms of days, you expect inventories to come down. So just kind of help us understand what are you seeing and then why should inventory be trending down as we go through the year? Thank you.","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah - Analog Devices, Inc.","Okay, thanks Ambrish. Thanks for the question. So inventory was up 2% or about $9 million quarter-over-quarter. Most of that $9 million was built for the B2B market, and that was driven by a strategic decision we made to keep the production levels sort of commensurate with the bookings idea \u2013 bookings outlook that we had. Driven by, one, making sure that we can maintain the high levels of customer service that are needed and to target our lead times sort of in that four- to six-week range; B, like everyone looks at inventory levels as a indicator or as a canary in the coal mine of what demand looks like, and I would say that all the other indicators we're following remain very green. Our book-to-bill is above parity, both with and without consumer. Lead times remain stable, and we see no change in cancellation activity.","Part of that $9 million was a small, but relatively immaterial amount due to an accounting policy that we harmonized between LTC and ADI. But in general, we feel very good about where we are on inventory in light of the demand we see for Q2 and we expect days to decline at a normal pace over the balance of the year.","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","Yeah, I'll add one other...","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thanks for all the details.","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","I'll add another...","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah, sorry, Vince.","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","Yeah, (28:16) Ambrish. So, the internal fabs are the largest supply line for our industrial business. And what we're seeing there, of course, is the book-to-bill is positive, has been now for several quarters. And as Prashanth said, we're eager to make sure that we keep our lead times at a level where we can supply the upside demand here. So I think that's worth considering when you think about why we kept our internal fabs running at a higher clip than we would normally do for the first quarter.","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah - Analog Devices, Inc.","Thank you, Ambrish.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, thank you.","Michael C. Lucarelli - Analog Devices, Inc.","Jennifer, next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah - Analog Devices, Inc.","Good morning, Stacy.","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","Go for it, Stacy.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hello. I'm sorry, I was on mute. I'm sorry, I was on mute. My bad.","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","Okay.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking my questions. Could you walk us through puts and takes on free cash flow in the quarter? I know there's a bunch of stuff going on with the tax law and everything else. The number itself was a little lower than I might have expected. And I want to \u2013 I just want to see if you can give us a walkthrough with all the puts and takes. I think there's more going on there than normal this quarter.","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah - Analog Devices, Inc.","Yeah, absolutely. So for free cash flow, the \u2013 we had the hat-trick in Q1. Three items that were sort of buried in there. First, we make our large annual payment to the IRS, so federal taxes were paid in the first quarter. Second, we make our once every two-year payment for the employee bonus program. And then, we also make our once every two-year payment for our interest debt. So some big outgoing items that hit us with some lumpiness. The way to look at cash flow, as we do, is on a trailing 12-month basis, generating $1.8 billion over the last 12 months, continue to see very strong expectations on cash flow. The model has not changed. We convert a high amount of the profitability to cash, and you'll see strength there for second quarter in the cash flow number.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. For my follow-up, I had a question on the longer-term synergies around the fab closures. So you're looking at three to five years to cull these factories. In the past, when you've closed your own factories, it didn't take three to five years. It was more like one to two years when you closed Sunnyvale or Limerick or Cambridge. Why did it take three to five years to close the Linear facilities?","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","Well, it tends to take three years. There's \u2013 given the multiple recipes that we have in our foundries and the back-end operations, it does tend to take about three years typically, and that's what I believe will be the case with the LTC Singapore and Milpitas closures as well. Our job, number one, is to make sure that we keep our service and quality levels high for our customers across the many thousands of customers and hundreds and hundreds of applications and the \u2013 as I said, the myriad of recipes that we've got. So it will take most likely three years, but obviously, we're trying to push as hard as we can for the efficiencies to kick in earlier. But that's the rule of thumb, three years.","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah - Analog Devices, Inc.","And Stacy, maybe just a quick comment I would add is that, the net result is the two closures, but what's going on under the covers is quite a bit of process movement among multiple facilities, internal and external. So, you're seeing the \u2013 we're talking about the net output, but under the cover, it's a lot more complex than just shutting down the two operations.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you, guys.","Michael C. Lucarelli - Analog Devices, Inc.","Thank you, Stacy.","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah. Great. Thanks for taking the question. I had a question on the consumer business. In the past, I think you guys talked about fiscal year 2018, consumer revenues being down somewhere between 20% and 30%. I was just curious, does that range still hold? And if not, what are some of the things that are driving the potential change there?","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","Yeah. So, thank you. Well, look, our 2Q guidance would imply that consumer will be down somewhere in the region of 10% quarter-on-quarter on a 13-week basis. And down about, again, 10% on a year-over-year basis. So our expectations remain unchanged. We believe that 2018 will be down meaningfully over 2017 in terms of, at least, the portable consumer revenue. And the first half is now shaping up within the range of our expectations. And we're expecting weakness in the second half on an annual basis. So the number we've given you of a 20% to 30% overall decline in the business still stands. And as I said, that's driven by our portable business. Our prosumer A\/V, the audio\/video, non-portable side of things is in good shape and continues to go grow for the company.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. And then I had a \u2013 yeah, I had a follow-up for Prashanth. It's \u2013 I guess, it's been several months since you joined ADI. I guess, the question is what are some of the things that you've learned about the company and about the industry during this timeframe that you perhaps didn't fully appreciate prior to joining the company? And what are some of the changes that you hope to drive in terms of the financials of the company going forward? Thank you.","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah - Analog Devices, Inc.","Sure. Thanks. That's a very long question if I wanted to give you a thoughtful answer, but I'll give you a quick item, which I continue to reflect on. The correlation of the ADI business to the B2B markets and the stability that we have in our customer base is something that I'm continuously impressed on. The \u2013 this is not a business that, given how embedded we are and how close we are to our customers and the broad spread of products that we are incorporated in, I think sometimes investors don't fully appreciate that we will follow much more closely to a different set of markets than other, perhaps, semi-companies that operate in the digital space, and that's something that we're going to continue to have to help the investor community appreciate as the strength of this business.","Michael C. Lucarelli - Analog Devices, Inc.","Our next question, Jennifer?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Unknown Speaker","Hey, this is Gerald (35:13) on behalf of Ross. Got two quick ones. First, on OpEx, I see you guys guided OpEx down. I think we're expecting it to be down a little bit more. Understand, it's basically guiding it back to the October range, but other than the 14- and 13-week quarter, what's the trajectory for OpEx going forward?","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah - Analog Devices, Inc.","Right. So the way to think about the OpEx is that for the \u2013 now, starting in the second quarter, you'll begin to see the impacts of some of the normal items that flow in, including our merit increases, which start to come in and the impact of the performance bonus metrics. The second quarter, you'll see, is more aligned to where we were in the fourth quarter if you adjust out some of the noise of the 14th week that we had in the first quarter as well as the \u2013 there's some sort of seasonal slowdown of spending that happens in the first quarter.","So, I would guide you that OpEx in the second quarter, as we put \u2013 we expect kind of be in the sub 30% of revenue, which we think is a great target for us as we continue to drive the conversion of the cash, so conversion of the profit. But nothing more notable really in the OpEx spend.","Michael C. Lucarelli - Analog Devices, Inc.","Yeah, Gerald (26:42) and I get to add one thing there. I mean, if you look at our combined company, Linear and ADI, we're \u2013 our guidance implies a high single-digit year-on-year growth. And the OpEx is flat over that time. That's a good result. And what that is, is we're managing our expenses and we're capturing synergies. If you look in the back half of the year, typically, I would say OpEx is up a little bit in 3Q because of merit increases and maybe it'll flat in the fourth quarter. I think we'll strive to do even better than that this year given the synergies.","Unknown Speaker","Thanks for that. And as a follow-up, I just want to ask a question on auto growth. And I think it's probably safe to say that your auto business probably under grew the industry as a whole last year in 2017. But what gives you confidence that you can grow 2 times to 3 times SAAR? Is that a fall off or a flattening in the declines in the passive safety business? Or what gives you confidence in that regard?","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","Yeah, good question. So, let me parse the business a bit for you. So, we have roughly a $900 million automotive business today across the combination of ADI and LT. ADI is roughly two-thirds of that; LT, a third. The ADI portion of that business has been growing in line with the 2 times to 3 times SAAR target. And in 2017, that part of our business grew in the high single-digits. And also, in the first quarter of 2018, as Mike said in one of the prior answers, our automotive business was actually better than seasonal, typically year-over-year in the first quarter. So the ADI portion is growing high single-digits and the LT piece is growing in the low single-digits.","But we believe, given the opportunity pipe that we're seeing and the opportunity pipe that we inherited from LT, that even though the LT part of the business is growing more modestly, that over the coming couple of years, at least the power piece of that will get into the higher single-digit area, at least into the model. And everywhere that \u2013 as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we use a rule of thumb that for every dollar of mixed-signal or legacy ADI Hittite content, there's at least a dollar of LT power.","I will tell you as well that we're already starting to see revenue synergies on the LT side. We're winning designs for power management. And as we kind of retune the business logic on the LT side, we tune the organization and the business for profitable growth, we're already beginning to see the start of synergies there.","The BMS sector, well, we said before that was a trouble spot for ADI in 2017, the battery management area. But it has stabilized and is now in the recovery phase. So we're expecting to be able to grow the battery management part of our business in double-digits this year. And as I said, that is at the beginning phases of what I think will be a strong recovery during the second quarter.","Michael C. Lucarelli - Analog Devices, Inc.","If you take a step back, I would say 2017 was \u2013 grew about low single-digits year-on-year as a combined business. I think 2018 is shaping up to be better than that, given our book of business.","Unknown Speaker","Thanks so much.","Michael C. Lucarelli - Analog Devices, Inc.","Okay. Jennifer, next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you for taking my question. Vince, (40:31) your industrial sales have sort of been off the charts over the last couple of quarters. What's your level of visibility into the consumption of these parts? In that when you look at this kind of growth, we have not seen that before, but you have mentioned a couple of very strong drivers, aerospace, defense and industrial automation and so forth.","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","Yeah.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","But what are the metrics you look at just to convince yourself that this kind of growth rate is sustainable and then there isn't some kind of inventory or other risk building up somewhere?","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","Yeah, it's a good question. I think primarily, we as a company, pay very careful attention to the end consumption. We look at sell-through in measuring the performance of our business, not what we ship into the channel, but what we sell-through and what customers are consuming. So I would say, first and foremost, that's the case. When you look at the backdrop, our market growth is very broad-based and all applications and geographies are up in double-digits year-over-year.","So again, you look at the PMIs, they're still in expansion phase globally. And GDP is converging across the globe, across all the major geographies into an expansionary phase. So also, we pay a lot of attention to what our customers are saying. And that, I would tell you that our customers across the board in all the regions are pragmatically optimistic. And their belief, given the macro environment, the macro backdrop, the PMI situation and the vast deployment of high-end machinery into the Asia region in particular, that 2018 is going to be another good year and that we'll see momentum continue from 2017, which we are experiencing right now.","Michael C. Lucarelli - Analog Devices, Inc.","Vivek, thanks for the question. I will just add, book-to-bill is looking very good. Lead times are stable and short, and we also are very conscious of what inventory in the channel is and it does not give us concern.","Jennifer, can we go to the next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray.","Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hey, guys. First of all, congratulations on some very strong results.","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","Thank you.","Harsh V. Kumar - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Vincent, and I had a quick question for you. Sort of piggybacking on to what the previous question was, doing extremely well in industrial, could you characterize, I mean, the end markets that you play in, do you think it's a function of that, or do you think it's some other things that you guys as a company are doing to garner over the top growth?","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","Yeah. It's a good question. I think we as a company retooled our strategy several years ago and primarily decided that we were focusing ADI's investments in the B2B space and pointing our sales force at the B2B area. Industrial is one of the first calls on our R&D, and the crop of products that I think, we have now is the strongest that it's ever been. So we are getting more content gain across all our industrial customers, both big and small.","And I will tell you as well that in the areas of aerospace and defense and instrumentation, the combination with Hittite has really \u2013 that's catalyzed content gain. And I think we're able to solve our customers' problems at a level that others can't in these areas. We're able to take a complete system, be it nanowatts to kilowatts, sensor-to-cloud, microwave to bits. So I think a large part is the sheer arsenal of technologies and products that we've got and we bring to bear, the focus that we've got as a company and how we're serving our customers' needs, being able to build more complete solutions for them, and we do that globally.","And as I mentioned earlier, the combination of the LT sales and application force with ADI just strengthens our position and enables to cover ever more customers. So I think it's a case of converging innovation engine working well. Our customer engagements are stronger than they've ever been, and we've been focused and making sure that we are able to gain share and build competitive advantage now for several years in the industrial area.","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah - Analog Devices, Inc.","Thanks for the question, Harsh. I would \u2013 maybe I'll just wrap up saying, we have a very good progress internally on selecting where we choose to invest and where we choose to innovate. And as a Vince mentioned in his prepared remarks, you see that paying off by placing the right bets and where we see the secular trends growing as well.","Jennifer, let's go to our last question.","Operator","And our final question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. Thank you for taking my question and great job on the quarterly execution. Just wanted to kind of take a step back here and look at the underlying demand trends for the business, and just get a sense on how broad-based it was from a geographical perspective. Macroeconomic demand trends remain relatively healthy. Maybe if you guys could just talk about the year-over-year growth trends in the different geographies?","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah - Analog Devices, Inc.","Mike, do you want to take that?","Michael C. Lucarelli - Analog Devices, Inc.","Yeah, sure. First, I'll caution you. I mean, looking at the geography trends for us is not as useful as we base geography revenue on design-in activity. But in general, our strength is broad-based, it's up double digits in every region in industrial. Our wireless business did good across the globe as well. I mean, this is definitely, I would call it global synchronized growth scenario that we are benefiting from. And really, we've been doing better than I would say, given what Vince has talked about, given our share gains, our portfolio and where we're selecting to play. Do you have a follow-up?","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for the \u2013 yeah. On the mil-aero side, the move to phased array radar-based systems for both civil and defense-related applications, your guys' dollar content per engagement goes up there, I think, pretty significantly, and I think that there's only one other competitor in that space. Have some of these programs started to fire or is it more of a 2019 driver? And then if you can just remind us of the dollar content step up relative to prior generation architectures. Thank you.","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","Yeah. Well, look, there's many, many different sub applications within the aerospace and defense area. And I would say the recent history and the prognosis for those sectors remain strong in terms of the digitalization, fleet upgrades, for example, in the aerospace area. And, we've highlighted in past conversations the area of these phased array antenna systems, digitalizing the old Analog radar systems used in civil and commercial aircraft systems.","The content gain there goes from, we believe, the SAM goes from probably $100,000 in the past to probably $2 million in the future, somewhere in between depending on the types of architectures and deployments. So the upside demand we're seeing for these phased array systems and the opportunity is very, very compelling.","A \u2013 [072DK6-E Mike Lucarelli]>: Thank you, Harlan.","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah - Analog Devices, Inc.","Okay. Thank you all for joining us this quarter. As always, Mike is available for those of you who are unable to get through on today's Q&A session.

Sir, the floor is yours.","Michael Lucarelli","Thank you, Jennifer and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our third quarter 2018 conference call. With me on the call today are ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah.","For anyone who missed the release, you can find it and related financial schedules at investor.analog.com. This conference call is being webcast live and a recording will be archived in the Investor section of our website.","Now on to the disclosures. The information we're about to discuss including our objectives and outlook includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors including those discussed in our earnings release and in our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.","Our commentary about ADI's third quarter financial results will also include non-GAAP financial measures which exclude special items. When comparing our third quarter results to our historical performance special items are also excluded from the prior quarter and year-over-year results.","Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most typically comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release and on our web schedules which we've posted under the Quarterly Results section at investor.analog.com.","Okay. So with that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche. Vince?","Vincent Roche","Thanks, Mike and good morning to everyone.","Analog Devices well we had an outstanding fiscal third quarter. Our performance demonstrates the disciplined execution of our strategy as we continue to deliver value for our customers helping them meet their evolving needs in this dynamic market environment.","It also reflects our ability to deliver strong results for our shareholders while investing in growth opportunities to expand market share, continuously innovate and strengthen our position for the long-term.","In the quarter, revenues came in above the high end of our guided range. Our growth was once again driven by continued strength in our B2B markets, especially, in the industrial and communication sectors. These strong results were supported by yet another record quarter from our Linear Tech franchise.","Operating margins expanded meaningfully compared to last year and non-GAAP EPS increased over 20% year-over-year and came in above the high end of our guidance. We also delivered very strong free cash flow generating $2.2 billion in free cash flow on a trailing 12 month basis translating to approximately 36% free cash flow margin.","ADI's cash generating capabilities enabled us to achieve our 2x leverage ratio goal three quarters ahead of plan and we are pleased to announce that we have reinstated our share repurchase program. And given the long-term prospects of this business, our Board has authorized an additional $2 billion in share repurchases.","Now before Prashanth goes deeper into our financial performance, I'd like to continue the discussion around key market trends that are shaping our industry and the steps that ADI is taking to seize these opportunities.","On the last earnings call, I spoke about the transition to 5G for wireless communications and what it means for ADI. Today, I'd like to focus on Industry 4.0, which is driving the next evolution of innovation and investment in industrial automation.","For many industries, the digital factory will bring greater supply chain efficiencies higher quality more flexibility and a safer workplace, all contributing to higher productivity. This manufacturing in which cyber physical systems monitor the physical process of the factory or plant will use additional data for decentralized decision making, human assistance, increased safety and more predictability. This will require a vast deployment of intelligent sensors at the edge.","For many decades, ADI has been viewed as the go-to-edge solution provider, the place where the data is born so to speak. And I'll highlight later how we are enabling this evolution. Although ADI is excited about this emerging opportunity, we expect this transition to take time while the deployment of today's existing sensing signal processing and power architectures will continue to drive growth for many years.","In fact, our core automation business represents a significant portion of our total industrial business today, and we're taking a long view to ensure that we keep at the cutting edge of technology and customer support.","Our domain expertise is unmatched and gives us invaluable insights to understand our customers' challenges and where the markets are going. And we've been investing ahead broadening our portfolio through targeted R&D, collaborating with leading automation customers and leveraging strategic M&A to enhance our offerings to include algorithms and software.","At the same time, we've extended our reach with the addition of the LTC sales force and SAEs. And the complementarity of our customer bases enables us to access more opportunities at current customers and to increase penetration at new customers. We believe that these targeted investments position us to continue to grow our market share and to outperform in the years to come.","For decades our products and solutions have been adopted by many thousands of customers around the world. Their equipment is used at the factory floor level across a very diverse set of end market such as automotive, pharmaceutical, oil and gas, smartphones, food and beverage, and many, many others.","And this is a long life cycle business. Once qualified and deployed to strict industrial requirements, customers keep using ADI's proven products. This makes this business very sticky with high barriers to entry.","With a broader set of technologies and capabilities our customers continue to turn to ADI for the best performance and precision, robustness and safety. The addition of LTC as high performance power to our already extensive portfolio enabling further innovation, and in fact power plays an increasingly critical role in solving more and more of the design challenges of our customers as they further automate in space and energy constrained areas.","For example, we just recently launched a product that enables up to eight analog outputs on a card previously unachievable due to excess heat. We succeeded by combining the signal chain expertise of ADI with LTC's power know-how to maintain an unchanged power density.","Safety is also critical. These systems require essential electrical isolation barriers to protect low voltage electronics as well as humans from high voltages. Traditionally customers have used optical technology to transfer data across these safety barriers. However, frustrated by their lack of reliability and power, we increasingly see customers turning to ADI for our digital isolation technology.","So with the unique architectures and leading process technology, our high coupler isolation solutions are significantly more reliable and can transfer data and power twice as fast as our nearest competitor.","We also removed customers' industry certification pain with ready to use solutions accelerating their time to market. As a result of all that we've shipped over two billion channels and are increasing our market share and driving revenue growth well into the double-digit annually.","Today as manufacturers respond to a more demanding consumer base they are turning to more distributed and flexible architectures. With this in mind, I will focus now on two examples to highlight how innovation at the factory floor is driving new growth opportunities for ADI.","The first is robotics. Across all geographies significant investments are being made to upgrade from a labor intensive footprint to a more sophisticated automated infrastructure. Repetitive tasks are now being performed by collaborative robots commonly known as cobots. These are smaller robots that work in collaboration with humans. While the traditional large scale industrial robotics industry remains healthy and growing the newer collaborative robotics market is in the early stages of growth.","Collectively this market is expected to grow at more than 10% annually adding more than 500,000 systems per year by 2022. ADI is unique in our ability to combine all these key technologies for the traditional large scale robots as well as the fast growing cobots segments.","Along with our traditional precision controlled technology solutions including signal chains and digital isolation we effectively more than triple our constant opportunity with the addition of power management, communications and sensors.","The secondary of innovation is the flexible factory floor. Here robots operate in tandem with many other systems including POC controllers and a vast array of sensors and actuators. These machines or devices are designated as either inputs or outputs. Several years ago ADI took on the challenge of implementing an integrated software configurable I\/O architecture based on our high performance position signal processing portfolio.","With this breakthrough in innovation ADI created a disruptive capability allowing universal selection and configuration of many types of input and output devices. This has opened new opportunities and allows customers to easily install and reconfigure their automation equipment.","In addition to flexibility the big value impact comes in the total cost of ownership at the factory level. Significant savings for customers include eight weeks on average faster installation time savings on engineering and a significant reduction in factory space.","Factory production flows can be adopted more easily and these changes that could conditionally take hours can now be done in minutes. With this new capability we've increased our SAM by an additional $200 million. And since our initial design wins of meeting customers over the past year we've substantially increased our opportunity pipeline.","As we look towards the future with the digital factory, flexible architectures with an increase of robotics will enable the transformation of manufacturing.","With that comes a demand for higher bandwidth, predictability of machine health, robustness and security. Working closely with our customers we've invested to extend our portfolio and ability to solve these challenges.","In addition to offering the most robust industrial wireless network and technology ADI is enabling the transition to newer, secure connectivity architectures. We are leading the path to higher bandwidth industrial ready Ethernet using the latest time sensitive networking standards.","ADI's industrial deterministic Ethernet is a far cry from standard Ethernet and provides the determinism, reliability, robustness and the security required in the hostile environment of the digital factory.","Finally, our sensing and measurement technology provides contextual data enabling predictive outcomes. ADI's depth optical and touch sensors are used to create safe working zones for humans while vibration, electrical and temperature sensors are used for condition based monitoring, predicting the mechanical ware of the machines to maximize factory uptime.","So to summarize at the edge of the factory floor where the data is born, ADI is the leader in industrial automation. This market has grown steadily for many years and we're witnessing a new era of opportunity, innovation and growth.","While our core technologies continue to provide the foundational performance for control and precision, our new investments double our sum and allow us to solve the emerging challenges our customers face. All-in-all, I'm very optimistic about what the future will bring for ADI in this new world.","So with that I'd like to hand over to Prashanth who will take you through the financials. ","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone and let me add my welcome to our Q3 2018 earnings call.","With the exception of non-op expenses, my comments on the P&L line items will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release.","As Vince mentioned, we delivered another record setting quarter. We had 8% revenue growth, 20% higher earnings per share, free cash flow margins at 36%. But before I get into the details of the income statement, let me cover the end markets.","Our B2B revenue increased 13% year-over-year led by double-digit growth in the industrial and communications markets. The industrial end market represented 50% of sales in the quarter and increased in the low double-digits year-over-year. Growth in this market continues to be broad-based with nearly all applications and geographies increasing double-digits compared to the year ago quarter.","As Vince highlighted, the factory automation market is undergoing changes not seen in decades and customers are looking to ADI as the trusted partner to provide next generation solutions to transform their industry and increase productivity.","In the communications market which represented 21% of sales in the third quarter, sales into both wireless and wired applications increased at a double-digit rate compared to the same period last year. Growth in our wireless business accelerated as the market continues to densify their 4G networks, accelerate small cell deployments and begin the transition to 5G massive MIMO.","This better market environment combined with our strong position across carriers with our high performance mixed signal and RF portfolio positions our comms business for continued growth and outperformance.","Our automotive business represented 16% of sales in the quarter. And in line with our commentary last quarter sales increased at a mid single-digit rate compared to a year ago with all applications increasing over that time period. ADI organic revenue performed well once again increasing high-single-digits year-over-year.","And finally, our consumer business represented 13% of sales in the third quarter, and as expected decreased year-over-year primarily due to lower demand for products used in the portable consumer applications.","Now moving on to the P&L. Revenue for the quarter was $1.57 billion, above the high end of our guidance, increasing 8% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. Gross margins of 71.2%, increased 70 bps year-over-year, and given the mix of business were down slightly sequentially.","OpEx in the third quarter was $448 million or 28.5% of revenue. Strong revenue growth combined with operational execution resulted in operating margins at the high end of guidance at 42.7%.","Non-op expenses in the third quarter were approximately $58 million and our tax rate was approximately 6%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third quarter came in above the high end of guidance at $1.53, increasing more than 20% year-over-year.","Moving on to the balance sheet. Inventory increased 2% sequentially, and days were 112 in the quarter, down four days from the second quarter. Disty inventory was just above 7.5 weeks, flat sequentially and up modestly compared to the year-ago quarter.","We generated free cash flow of approximately $570 million in the quarter, bringing our trailing 12 months free cash flow to a record $2.2 billion with associated free cash flow margin of approximately 36%. And during the quarter, we also paid down $430 million of debt, bringing our net leverage to 2x.","Capital additions in the third quarter were $52 million and we expect CapEx to continue to run at our model of approximately 4% of sales. During the quarter, we paid $179 million in dividends with an associated quarterly cash dividend of $0.48, representing an annual dividend payment of $1.92 per outstanding share of common stock.","All-in-all, it was a terrific quarter and the Q4 guide is equally strong, which with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses are also on a non-GAAP basis and exclude items outlined in today's press release.","At a high level, we're expecting the fourth quarter to look a lot like the third quarter. We're planning for the revenue in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $1.53 billion to $1.61 billion. At the midpoint of guidance, we expect our B2B markets of industrial, auto and comms in the aggregate to increase in the low-double-digits year-over-year. This would represent our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth for our B2B markets.","We're planning for gross margins to be approximately 71%. We expect our operating expenses to be in the range of $440 million to $450 million. At the midpoint of guidance, this implies OpEx as a percentage of sales will be approximately flat sequentially, which brings operating margins in the fourth quarter expected in the range of 42% to 43%. We expect non-op expenses to be approximately $57 million and our tax rate around 7%.","And based on these inputs diluted EPS excluding special items would be in the range of $1.46 to $1.58. Now before we move to the Q&A session I wanted to provide some context for last night's press release.","As I mentioned earlier, we achieved a two times leverage ratio during our fiscal third quarter just 16 months post-closing of the Linear acquisition. Over those 16 months we paid down $2.3 billion of debt or nearly one-third of the debt we raised for the deal.","During the same period we also returned approximately $850 million to our shareholders through dividends. With this milestone achieved we can now provide more clarity on our capital allocation plans.","Our first call on capital will always be to invest in the business whether through targeted R&D, smart capital spending or strategic M&A. These investments ensure we continue to have the right technology portfolio to increase our competitive advantage and drive profitable and sustainable growth.","Given the profitability of this franchise the long-term prospects for our business and the benefits from U.S. tax reform we now plan to return 100% of our free cash flow after debt repayments to investors. Under this framework the dividend policy remains the cornerstone of our capital allocation policy. We have increased the dividend 15 times over the last 14 years and remain committed to our goal of a 5% to 10% increase annually.","As you saw in yesterday's press release we are reinstating our share repurchase program and announced a $2 billion authorization from our Board of Directors. We plan to use this approval to offset dilution and over time lower our share count. We believe this capital strategy will continue to deliver value for our shareholders and allow us to continue the investments necessary to meet the evolving needs of our customers in a dynamic growth environment.","So to wrap it up this was another record quarter for ADI across many metrics. The strength in our business resulted in strong revenue growth and profit conversion. We see this momentum continuing for Q4 and the early achievement of our two times leverage goal enables us to reinstate our share repurchase program.","And with that let me turn it over to Mike for our Q&A session.","Michael Lucarelli","Thanks Prashanth. Okay. Let's get to the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Operator, can we have our first question please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Craig Hettenbach","Just a question on B2B, understanding it's double-digits in aggregate there has been some moving pieces between segments particularly kind of autos and comms. So any color as you're looking into the October quarter? Just a little bit more granular between the comms business industrial and autos for the October quarter?","Vincent Roche","Yes. Well look Craig, B2B remains very strong. We've had a couple of stellar years of growth and we remain in a strong zone here. The growth has been led primarily by industrial and comms. And that's as you know 70% of our business today. So I'd say at this point inventory is in very good shape, well-managed on our balance sheets. It's in good shape in the channel. And I'd say lead times are stable as well.","And our overall guidance implies as Prashanth said our second - our seventh consecutive double-digit year-over-year growth in B2B. So I think we said clearly that we see pockets of slowing growth in industrial. It's - I think over the foreseeable future industrial will perform in the 2x to 3x GDP area probably at the higher end of that.","Clearly, comms is ADI's position. 4G systems is good and carriers are spending more money in 4G. And we're beginning to see as well the early stages of deployment in 5G. So given the portfolio we have the penetration we have the key customers and wireless communications infrastructure I think we're poised to see some stellar growth in the wireless comms side of the business.","Also there is a significant upgrade cycle taking place in the kind of the back of the optical back hold. So I foresee see that again given the strength of our penetration and the product portfolio that we have we'll see some decent growth there too. You know, we've talked about automotive many times. My sense is that that will continue to perform in the kind of the mid single-digit growth level. So it's I'd say moderate but very, very important part of what we're doing.","Operator","Your next question is from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.","Ambrish Srivastava","I just wanted to focus on the gross margins side. I get the mixed change, consumer was stronger at least kind of versus what you were modeling. So it came in a little bit lighter versus what you guided to Prashanth? But if you look at the guide that seems a little bit lighter as well. So can you just help us understand the puts and takes across margin please? ","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","Absolutely, Ambrish. Thanks for the question. So recall that our gross margin model is to be above 70% which is industry leading. And we're above that goal for the third quarter and the fourth quarter. But you're right margins were slightly lower. The upside driven by communications and consumer and the result was our industrial mix declined to 50% or about 200 bps from where we were at second quarter levels.","And as we look at the fourth quarter very similar to what Vince just told Craig our strongest growth is going to come from comms and automotive. So that mix in the businesses is driving a little bit of that shift in gross margins but still well above our model. And I will remind everyone that we do have about another $100 million of cost synergies which should start layering in towards the beginning of 2021, late 2020.","So we still expect to be able to continue to drive the gross margins up as the operations team shuts down the facility in Singapore and in California. And then overall, our focus is on expanding op margins. So as long as we can keep driving our revenue faster than our operating expenses we'll be able to continue to drive the profitability for this business. Thanks for the question, Ambrish.","Vincent Roche","Just one quick follow-up to that. Prashanth was talking about the fastest growth sequentially and year-over-year basis the strongest growth is once again the industrial and communications which both grow on the double-digits. We have a next caller please?","Operator","Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer","Congrats also on the strong result, especially B2B. My question is just a little bit on the consumer side. If I back into kind of using the B2B guidance for Q4 to be up kind of low-double-digits, you kind of back into the consumer number which puts consumers down about 20% for the full year which is kind of at the high end of the range of the down 20 to 30 that you guys have been talking about at the Analyst Day - the low end of the range, sorry. I'm just kind of curious. Does that now reflect the new base off of which you guys can grow that consumer business? Or were there some things that happened this year that means that as we move into FY 2019, you might still have some headwinds to work through in that consumer business with that one large customer?","Vincent Roche","So I think what\u2019s implied is just about right John. At this point, it's very, very hard to say what will happen next year. So we've got a good rhythm what the number will be this year in terms of the decline in the portable business. It's very hard to tell what 2019 will look like quite yet, but it's a fast-cycle business.","And we win designs and you can lose designs as well in a very, very short period of time. But I would say to directly answer your question, as it stands today the consumer business hasn't yet trough in 2018, so we'll see some further decline in the portable part I believe in 2019.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya","Vince, your industrial and communication segments are doing quite well, but auto is at kind of this low to mid-single-digit growth remains below the peer group. Can you give us a sense of what has been done so far to, perhaps take some of the issues what needs to be done so that you can get back to the high-single-digit to double-digit growth rates like a number of your competitors are growing at? Thank you.","Vincent Roche","So the numbers that we've talked about are the combined legacy ADI and LTC. The legacy ADI part of the business is growing in the high-single-digit area and the LT part in the low-single-digits arena. So there are two primary components I would say that we are working hard to correct particularly on the legacy LT side of things.","Number one is making sure that our BMS business, the Battery Management business gets back into a solid growth track. And I'm very encouraged by the progress we've made there, particularly in the last two quarters, holding onto the sockets that we've had and finding new sockets across the globe particularly in North America and Europe in the electric power train. And we've also got a couple of new products coming I think that are very, very exciting.","And also on the power side of things, we are more aggressive. We were leveraging the ADI cost base where we've got fundamentally better cost structures to make sure that we take off our unfair share of high performance power sockets across the globe.","So I think it's fair to say that it we'll be in this mid-single digit growth area depending on the market of course for the next year and a half two years. But somewhere in the 2020 area I expect us to see a meaningful bend upwards in the growth curve.","Operator","Our next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.","Stacy Rasgon","Just wanted to get back to the segment growth. Were you trying to imply that everything is actually growing? I know you have some differences in sequential growth versus year-over-year growth across the segments.","But are you still implying that everything is I guess it would come as everything like are you still trying to say everything is flat to up sequentially? Or you still having some B2B segments that could be down sequentially even driving double digit year over year growth?","Vincent Roche","No Stacy. You got it right. Everything as we move from Q3 to Q4 is up sequentially. What you do see is stronger growth up sequentially. And as you know we don't guide by segment anymore. But we what we do see is stronger growth coming sequentially from comms and automotive.","And that is driving some mix impact overall which we expect to - I think it was Ambrish's question.","Stacy Rasgon","I guess my only issue it seems to take above your B2B growth. Although maybe you're suggesting when you say low double digits you're more than like 10% I guess is what you have to be implying with that guidance.","Prashanth Mahendra","Correct. I think if it was 10% we would've said 10% in low double-digits to me means five and we're being at 10% to 12%. So I'll think about it Stacy.","Operator","Your next question is from Tore Svanberg with Stifel.","Tore Svanberg","Yes, thank you and congratulations on a strong results, a question for Vince on the industrial market. You said it's slowing. Is that just a function of getting back to the mean from some very strong year-over-year growth rate? Is it seasonality? Or are you seeing anything else going on in that end market? Thank you.","Vincent Roche","So I think from a global standpoint what we see is that the macro economy is mainly constructive right now. You've seen PMI and GDP remain solid across the globe the PMIs and GDP.","I've spoken with several customers and they remain optimistic as well about the future. So I'd say in industrial business now is good. As I mentioned earlier there have been some pockets of slower growth.","I think driven by the uncertainties primarily in the geopolitical arena as people think through what this tariff situation means for everybody. But I'd say demand is resilient. And as we have in our guidance for B2B we've talked with double-digits growth again here on an annual basis.","So I would say in general the growth is getting back to a more normalized level. In our FY 2017 our industrial business grew in the low 20s low 20%. This year it will be in the kind of mid-teens.","So what I'm implying is that given the tougher compares and given the environment right now the demand is strong. I think we're getting to a more normalized 2x to 3x GDP growth and probably at the higher end of that. ","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Danely with Citigroup.","Chris Danely","I guess just one sort of summary a question on the end markets. So Vince you're kind of giving us the longer term growth of auto and industrial. How about comms? So comms looks like it's going to grow sort of in the mid double-digits this year. What do you think that should be longer term? And then maybe as just a brief follow on given industrial is flowing what should that mean for gross margins over the next several quarters? Should we think of them as part of a flattish type of trajectory? ","Vincent Roche","So at this point, I'd say given the product crop that we have and the penetration we've got and the secular trends in the wireless communications area in particular my sense is that even though it's a very, very lumpy business when you look at the quarter-by-quarter with 4G continuing to deploy with new architectures and 5G coming on board, my sense is that can be a double-digit kind of a 10% growth area for ADI for kind of the next three, four years. That's my sense.","The backhaul market particularly the optical side of that I think is capable of growing as well in the kind of high single-digit area. So a lot of that is driven by the market conditions are better I think in general carriers are more optimistic and are working hard to get new technologies into market as fast as they can.","But as I said we've got a great new product crop. And we have deeper and wider penetration not to mention the fact that we're starting to see the early stages of the cross-selling of LT's power technologies with ADI's signal chain.","So my sense is I feel good about that market. And right now even though prediction is a dangerous game, my sense is that we should be able to grow that business in the kind of the low I would say double-digit area for the foreseeable future.","And I'll turn it over to Prashanth to answer the gross margin implication question. ","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","So Chris the way that I guided to think about gross margins longer term is, I think, sort of flattish from where we are. We are as you know we are still ahead of our long-term model of 70%. Our industrial business has very rich gross margins. Our comms business has great margins but not as strong as the industrial.","And as Vince mentioned, as we see more growth in that comms business which is what we would expect for 2019 that is going to drive a little bit of mix on the margins. So probably more to be in line with flattish to what we're expecting Q4 to be.","On top of that I do want to remind folks we are looking at about $100 million of cost synergies that should be modeled in for future sort of in the late 2020, early 2021 closing both the facilities the one in Singapore and the one in the Bay Area in California. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. ","Jerry Zhang","This is Jerry Zhang on for Blayne. I just have a question on the pace of buybacks. So when should we expect the share count to eventually start trending lower? And also as a follow-up how do you think about the plan for deleveraging going forward?","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","So I guess the way that I would guide folks to think about our repurchase activity. I'll start with reminding everyone, we generate a lot of cash, $2 billion plus on a trailing 12 month basis. And we have one of the highest free cash flow margins in the S&P 500. About $700 million plus of that is committed to the dividend.","And as I mentioned, we're still targeting to grow that in the 5% to 10% annually as we've done for the past 14 years. So the dividend would account for - let's call it, mid to high-30s of our free cash flow. That leaves a fairly substantial amount of our free cash flow available both for buybacks and debt repayments. Our focus will be to be in the market every quarter as an effort to at a minimum work to offset dilution and then opportunistically we're going to look to reduce share count over time.","When you ask about leverage, I think it's a similar answer in that - at a high level, we like to keep a good bit of cash available, so $750 million to $1 billion or so on hand. And then we do have a revolving credit facility in place for about another billion. I don't think about leverage as a specific target for ADI, but more as how do we optimize the balance sheet. And what do we need to do to maintain investment grade, so we have the flexibility that we need.","So given kind of the cash generating capabilities of the franchise, there's probably no need for us to be operating in a net cash position. So going forward, I think you can expect us to always carry some level of debt, and will be mindful of what is the right environment as well as what are the other opportunities for us to invest in, and use that to kind of balance where we maintain our leverage. Thank you for the question.","Operator","Our next question is from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari","I had a question on M&A. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about your appetite for further acquisitions now that Linear is integrated as part of ADI and to the extent you do have aspirations to buy more assets down the line, if you can talk a little bit about the technologies or the conditions that you would look for in a business. Thank you.","Vincent Roche","Well, our overall capital allocation framework, as Prashanth outlined hasn't changed very much. The long-term value of our investments both organic as well as inorganic will continue to drive the long-term profitable growth trajectory for ADI.","Our approach to acquisitions has been and will continue to be very disciplined and at a very high level our strategy is really focused on acquiring assets that improve our competitive moat - the breadth and depth of our competitive boat from an innovation standpoint.","So our goal really is to acquire technologies and engineering capabilities that will enhance us, make our portfolio more complete to meet the demands of the markets and customers in the future, and basically increase our overall ability to deliver increasing value to our customers. That's the path we're on, and that's the path we'll continue to be on.","And I'm not going to talk about specific targets. We've got a successful track record. What we're looking at - we're always looking but our standards are very, very high.","So this was the case when we acquired Hittite and Linear, LTC and also the myriad smaller things we've done over the last three or four years. So I'm very pleased with where we are now in terms of our overall portfolio but we're always on the look. As the markets evolve and customers' needs to evolve. So hopefully that gives you at least a philosophical view of how we think about M&A.","Operator","And our final question comes from William Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein","And congratulations on good results especially with regards to the balance sheet in the buyback. My question is about revenue synergies. Can you update us as it relates to revenue synergies for the Hittite acquisition which is clearly a few years in the rearview mirror but I think you're starting to see revenue synergies kick in there? And what you anticipate with regard to the same issue with Linear. Thank you.","Vincent Roche","And in as much as Hittite can give an indication of what's possible with regard to LT. We've more than doubled. When we took Hittite on board we've more than doubled the growth rate. And we've been able to scale Hittite across a broader range of customers bring a much more sophisticated manufacturing and quality assurance capability to the portfolio.","So we've more than doubled the growth rate of Hittite. And off a $270 million-ish revenue point you can back out what those numbers are. We're in the early stages. It's taken us basically I'd say three years to get to the point with Hittite where we're able to accelerate the conversion of the pipeline.","It takes about - a while to build it takes a while to convert it just given the latencies in the various markets that we attack. I've said before that with LT we are looking to make sure that for every dollar of mixed signal opportunity that ADI has it's a $ 4.5 billion-ish today. Today is kind of revenue levels that legacy LT power should be a one-for-one match. So we're seeing a huge opportunity. We're excited by the areas that we're starting to win.","We're in early production stage for example in communications and automotive sectors which we felt would be the two most obvious places to get revenue synergy in the shorter-term. So my sense is again getting to a doubling of the overall LT legacy growth rate in a period of three to four years is a reasonable expectation.","Michael Lucarelli","Thanks everyone for joining us.

Sir, the floor is yours.","Ali Husain","All right, thank you, Jennifer. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the Analog Devices third quarter FY\u201916 earnings conference call. You can find our press release, relating financial schedules, and our investor toolkit, which includes additional information that we believe will be useful for investors, you could find that at investor.analog.com. As usual, I\u2019m joined by ADI\u2019s CEO, Vincent Roche; and ADI\u2019s CFO, Dave Zinsner.","So, before we start, let\u2019s get through some disclosures. Please note the information we\u2019re about to discuss, including our objectives and outlook, and the proposed acquisition of Linear Technology Corporation, includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Our comments today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which we have reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in today\u2019s earnings release, which we\u2019ve posted at investor.analog.com.","And so with that let\u2019s get started. So revenue in the third quarter totaled $870 million and exceeded our revised guidance. Revenue increased 12% sequentially and increased 1% from the prior year. Our B2B markets of industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure in the aggregate were slightly down sequentially but grew 4% over the prior year.","Now let\u2019s talk about our results by end market. The highly diverse industrial market represented 43% of revenue in the third quarter. All industrial sub sectors were stable to up sequentially in line with expectations, but the timing of customer orders in the aerospace and defense vertical led to a weaker than anticipated performance in this sector in the quarter. The automotive market at 15% of revenue decreased 2% sequentially in the seasonally slower July quarter, but importantly returned to year-over-year growth increasing 3%. We believe the headwinds from the passive safety market have largely abated, and we\u2019re in fact very excited about our prospects for automotive revenue growth going forward.","Turning now to the communications infrastructure market, at 20% of revenue sales to our hundreds of communications infrastructure customers were stable sequentially and grew 23% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, wireless infrastructure decreased while wireline infrastructure applications revenue increased, as customers continued to build out metro and inter-data center network infrastructure for 100 gig and 100 gig plus optical networking.","Turning now to the consumer market, the consumer market typically drives significant ROI and free cash flow for ADI, and this market represented 21% of total sales in the quarter, increasing 131% sequentially. This strong sequential performance was due to better than anticipated portable consumer application revenue.","So now I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Dave for details of our financial performance in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. With the exception of revenue and other expense, Dave\u2019s comments on our third quarter P&L line items will exclude special items, which in the aggregate totaled $28 million for the quarter.","When comparing our third quarter performance to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior quarter and year-over-year results, and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their comparable GAAP measures are included on Schedule E in today\u2019s earnings release.","So with that, Dave, I\u2019ll turn it over to you.","Dave Zinsner","Thanks, Ali, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter was a very good quarter for ADI, with revenue increasing to $870 million and diluted earnings per share growing to $0.82, with both results exceeding our revised guidance.","Gross margin of 66% increased 20 basis points from the prior quarter as cost savings and lower spend in the fabs offset lower utilization rates and mix.","Inventory on a dollars basis decreased $7 million sequentially, and on a days basis decreased 16 days to 122 days. We\u2019re now expecting days of inventory to decline further in the fourth quarter and to be the range of 110 days to 115 days, in line with our model. Inventory and distribution channel on a dollars basis was modestly higher than in the prior quarter, and on a weeks basis remained at seven weeks, consistent with the prior quarter.","Operating expenses increased 2% sequentially, lagging well behind the 12% sequential increase in revenue as we continued to manage our expenses very tightly and gain operating leverage in our financial model. As a result, operating profit before tax of $296 million, increased 24% sequentially, and as a percent of sales operating profit before tax expanded 330 basis points to 34.1%. Other expense in the third quarter was approximately $12 million.","Given our recently announced acquisition of Linear Tech and related financing costs, we expect that our net interest expense will be approximately $20 million in the fourth quarter and remain at that quarterly run rate until we close the transaction. Our third quarter tax rate was approximately 10%, as we adjusted our full year tax rate down slightly to 12%.","Excluding special items, our business delivered strong operating leverage, with diluted earnings per share of $0.82, increasing 28% sequentially on a 12% increase in revenue. Diluted EPS increased 6% over the prior year. At the end of the third quarter, our cash and short-term investment balance was $3.8 billion, with $860 million available domestically. We had approximately $1.8 billion in debt outstanding, which resulted in a net cash position of $2 billion.","Our business strategy and consistent financial execution enabled strong free cash flow generation, which supports investments in our business and the return of cash to shareholders. Excluding a one-time item, over the past 12 months ADI has generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow, effectively converting each dollar of revenue into $0.32 of free cash flow, at the very high end of our free cash flow model range.","In the third quarter alone, free cash flow margins expanded 600 basis points as compared to the prior year. In terms of cash returns to shareholders, over the past 12 months we have returned approximately $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which represents a 90% free cash flow payout.","I want to now take a minute to talk about our capital allocation philosophy in light of the recently announced Linear Tech acquisition. As we mentioned when we announced the deal, the combined company\u2019s pro forma free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis ending April 2016, would have increased from $1 billion to $1.7 billion. After the deal closes, we plan to use our combined cash generation to rapidly pay down the debt associated with the transaction.","As a result, we anticipate our net debt to EBITDA to go from 3.8 times at deal close to approximately two times net debt to EBITDA within three years of the transaction closing, which translates into an approximate $1 billion per year expected debt paydown schedule. In order to facilitate this rapid deleveraging, we have suspended our share repurchase program. That said, the dividend remains a cornerstone of our capital allocation philosophy, and we intend to maintain our dividend policy.","So in summary, this was a solid quarter on several fronts. We executed well in our business, and the diversity of our customers, applications, and markets, coupled with the sustainability of our innovation, enabled both revenue and diluted earnings per share to exceed our revised guidance. We\u2019re also very excited about the acquisition of Linear Tech, which we announced during the quarter, and I\u2019ll invite Vince to come on and say a few words in a minute.","Now turning to our outlook and expectations for the fourth quarter, which, with the exception of revenue expectations is on a non-GAAP basis and excludes special items that are outlined in today\u2019s release. We\u2019re planning for another quarter of sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter. In the B2B markets of industrial, automotive, and communications infrastructure we are planning for aggregate demand to remain stable sequentially, and on a year-over-year basis to increase in the low-to-mid-single digits.","In the consumer market, strong customer demand and increasing dollar content in portable applications, leads us to plan for continued sequential growth in this market.","In total, we are planning for revenue in the fourth quarter to grow sequentially, and be in the range of $910 million to $970 million. We expect factory utilization in the fourth quarter to be similar to its third quarter level as we manage our days of inventory, and so we are planning for gross margins in the fourth quarter to decrease approximately 50 basis points to 65.5% on the expected mix of business. We are planning for operating expenses in the fourth quarter to increase slightly sequentially, but to significantly lag our expected sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter, and for operating margins to expand from their third-quarter levels. Based on these estimates and excluding any special items, diluted earnings per share are planned to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.94.","Now before we move on to Q&A, I\u2019d like to invite Vince to say a few words about the recently announced Linear Tech combination. Vince?","Vincent Roche","Great, thanks, Dave. As you know late last month we announced an agreement to acquire Linear Technology Corporation. This is a transformative acquisition that brings together the two best franchises in the analog industry, and once we combine our highly complementary portfolios, will make us a market leader across all major analog product categories. Following last month\u2019s announcement, I\u2019ve personally heard from many customers, from employees, and shareholders and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. Our customers are excited to gain access to a comprehensive portfolio of the best brands in high-performance analog, the industry\u2019s best design engineers and FAE support, and a best-in-class supply chain all under one roof and with our continued commitment to the long-term support of our customers.","Our employees as well are very excited by the opportunities created by combining our two complementary suites of high-performance analog products and technologies. Beyond that, both companies have long admired the technical expertise and acumen of the other, and our teams are looking forward to the collaboration and innovation possibilities when combining two of the best engineering teams on the planet.","ADI and Linear are two amazing companies with very storied histories and vibrant cultures, and we plan to take the best of both companies to create something much greater than the some of the parts. We have many ties that bind us. We both believe that innovation and a passion for our customer\u2019s success drives superior business results, and we share an intense focus on operational excellence across quality, reliability, supply chain, and of course financial returns.","As a result of this combination, our financial profile is expected to be among the best in the industry with strong margins and free cash flow, which we expect will increase over time as we realize the financial synergies and cross-selling opportunities inherent in this transaction. And as Dave mentioned, ADI\u2019s anticipated free cash flow generation is expected to increase significantly from current levels. We believe that this combination is good for all of our stakeholders. For customers it will create a true innovation and support partner that is unmatched in the industry. For employees it will create a tremendous opportunity for professional growth and the ability to help redefine an industry. And for shareholders this acquisition will further diversify our end market exposure and strengthen our business and financial profile. Notably, we expect this transaction to be immediately accretive to earnings and free cash flow, and anticipate non-GAAP EPS accretion of 10% right out of the gates. There is no other team of people out there who could accomplish what we believe Analog and Linear will accomplish together. And I\u2019m very excited to get started on the next phase of our journey together.","And so with that, we\u2019ll now start taking your questions.","Ali Husain","All right, great. Thanks, Vince. Just for callers on the line, just a quick reminder, please limit yourself to one question. If you have a follow-up, I ask that you please requeue. And again, we do this in the spirit of fairness so that all callers get to ask at least one of their questions. So we plan to run the call until 11. And so I think that\u2019s plenty of time to get to everyone\u2019s questions.","So with that, operator, let\u2019s start the Q&A session. Folks on the line can ask questions of either myself, Vince or Dave.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets.","Ambrish Srivastava","Hi. Thank you very much. I had a quick clarification and then my question. Clarification, Dave, you mentioned on the dividend policy, you have been raising dividend consistently for as long as I can remember. You did mean to imply that you would be raising dividend consistently like you have in the past? And then my question on autos, good to see the headwind from MEMS kind of abating. What are the areas that you are excited about as you alluded to that you should expect to see growth in that segment? Thank you.","Dave Zinsner","Okay, I\u2019ll take the dividend question and I\u2019ll let Vince comment on the areas of automotive that we\u2019re excited about. On the dividend policy, as you know our model is to grow our dividend over time at a rate of 5% to 10%, and that continues to be our model.","Ambrish Srivastava","Okay, thank you for that.","Vincent Roche","Yes. So okay on the automotive side, we play in three I would say premier spaces where innovation really matters. We play in powertrain and there for example we have new sensor technology. We have an ongoing stream of growth in the battery management area. And we have new modalities such as AMR, for example, managing or measuring very, very accurately sensing measuring torque, for example, which is an important modality in the car.","Also, our audio infotainment solutions are becoming more and more adopted across many, many platforms across the OEMs in the global market. For example, recently we saw that \u2013 you probably saw Ford announced our \u2013 we\u2019ve talked to you before about this A2B bus, a very, very efficient high integrity bus that\u2019s being used in the car to move media, audio media. Ford just announced with our brand the inclusion of that technology in two of their particular car models.","We\u2019ve talked before as well about the growth of ADAS. We have a very strong position on 24 gigahertz radar solutions, microwave to bits, and we are starting to move with some very attractive solutions as well in the 77-gigahertz radar area. So I think we\u2019ve a good spread of technologies across the various car platforms using our underlying strength in sensing, measuring, and interpreting in both the precision signal processing area as well as the very, very high speed signal processing area.","Ali Husain","Great. Thanks, Vince, and thanks, Ambrish, for the question. I think, Ambrish, you do highlight a good point which is if you actually look at our automotive business, excluding the passive safety area. We\u2019ve actually grown that business in the high-single digits year-over-year in the quarter. And I think that really speaks to the additional content that we\u2019re getting into vehicles now, as Vince mentioned. And that we are really excited about going forward as well. So thanks for the question, and we\u2019ll get to the next caller please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel.","Tore Svanberg","Yes, thank you, great numbers. So my question is on the consumer business. So up 130% sequentially. Could you just talk about the dynamics there, how we should think about that business here in the back half of the year? Clearly a very volatile business but yes, if there\u2019s anything you can add on the actual trends in the second half, that\u2019d be great. Thank you.","Vincent Roche","So Tore you mean trends in terms of how is going to do next quarter you mean?","Tore Svanberg","Well, just obviously 130% is not the actual growth of that business.","Vincent Roche","Right.","Tore Svanberg","Obviously think about the volatility?","Vincent Roche","Yes, I would say in the fourth quarter it certainly going to be up again. That\u2019s going to be the driver of the sequential growth. Probably in the high 20s, low 30s percent virtually. Then the next quarter, last year we declined about 60%, I think, sequentially. But that was, partially it\u2019s due to seasonality and then the other part of it that, there was a build of inventory last year in the fourth quarter and we had that kind of consumption of that inventory in the channel that affected demand for us.","This year I think we have a closer linkage between supply and demand here on the consumer side. So I would expect us to decline seasonally in the first quarter but only seasonally. I don\u2019t think we would have this kind of ramp down due to overbuild in the inventory side of things in the supply chain. So it's probably going to be roughly half the rate of what we saw last year sequentially.","Vincent Roche","I think the way to look at this market overall, Tore, we take a long-term view to the consumer market like we do to all our markets in which we participate. We're picking out \u2013 with our customers we're picking the hardest problems to solve, we\u2019re pointing our technology at these problems, and we look for areas where we can get sustainability from generation to generation. So we take a long-term view and then the market will do what the market does in terms of generation. But I think in the areas that we're playing, we're executing well, and we've got some very, very exciting technologies in the pipeline as well for the future here.","Tore Svanberg","That\u2019s s great color. Thank you.","Dave Zinsner","Yes. Great, thanks, Tore, that's was a great question. And then I just pointed as I think I mentioned in the prepared remarks that business for ADI drives very strong ROI, very strong free cash flow business for the company; and if you note that certainly consumer grew a 131% or so, sequentially the operating margins for the company also expended \u2013 for the entire company expanded well over 300 basis points as a result, so great business to be and if you pick your spots. All right, we\u2019ll get to our next caller please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tristan Gerra with Baird.","Tristan Gerra","Good morning. Just quick follow-up on the consumer question. You talked about some content increase, can you quantify this a little bit? Is it a mid-single digit content increase relative to what you had last year?","Dave Zinsner","It\u2019s about 30%.","Tristan Gerra","Okay. Thank you.","Ali Husain","All right, thanks for the question. Next caller please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Craig Hettenbach","Yes, thank you. As you work toward the Linear Tech deal, can you give us an update on just the Hittite integration kind of how it\u2019s going versus initial expectation a couple of years ago? And then also just from a cross-selling perspective how that\u2019s performed in the opportunities that you have?","Dave Zinsner","Okay. So I\u2019ll talk about it from an operational standpoint and then Vince can talk big picture about how it\u2019s gone. Just operationally I would say we're pretty much fully integrated. We had expectations to get synergies that would drive the kind of accretion up into the kind of high-teens and we've actually been successful with that, in fact we're actually a little bit ahead of where we thought we would be from an expense perspective. From a revenue pipeline perspective, we have seen a lot of activity in terms of design ins and in some case design wins where we have been either able to take product that Hittite sold and bring them into our customer base.","We\u2019re actually vise versa, for example in the case of the military business, they've actually been able to bring ADI parts into their customer base. And that's going quite well. I would say that\u2019s exceeding our expectations. I wouldn't say that it shown up significantly on the revenue line just yet nor that we expect it to. This is \u2013 these are markets that have long design level, but from everything we can tell just looking at how the activity has transpired from the time we close till where we are today, we think we are ahead of where we thought we would be. I don\u2019t know if you have anything to add.","Vincent Roche","Yes, that\u2019s good color, Dave. I think we're approaching the LTC combination very much as we did with Hittite. We \u2013 I think with both Hittite and LTC, we share the same values essentially, we're very innovation centered, we very, very high standards in terms of how we execute in supply chain quality and financial returns. And that's not negotiable, that's what we strive for in these combinations. Obviously the cultures are different, but I view the cultural diversity as an opportunity to improve both companies.","You know there are \u2013 when you get world-class companies who've been doing things very, very well as they were independently, you\u2019ve got to listen very carefully and understand what each side has been doing and do your best to combine the entities to create something greater than the some of the parts we did that with Hittite and that's the approach we're taking as well with LTC.","And when I look at the combination of Hittite with ADI, for example, with our customers in communication infrastructure, broad-based communications activity, in the instrumentation, the aerospace and defense areas, it's really exciting to see how we are now solving big problems from end-to-end. We\u2019ve got the unique capabilities. I think we are probably the only high performance microwave to big supplier out there that can run the gambit of technologies and solve big footprint radio problems for our customers.","So I think obviously with LTC, we get the real strength that they bring in the power area and some of the mix signal areas in the little niches. So my sense is we will take the very same approaches that we did with Hittite, we've learned a lot as well through the process. And we will \u2013 as I said, listen very, very carefully to making sure that we understand the best practices that we use them across technology, product development, supply chain quality and customer support, of course.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Danely with Citi Group.","Chris Danely","Hey, thanks guys. So if we incorporate your guidance for the individual product segments for the fiscal Q4 for fiscal 2016, I think comm industrial and auto are all essentially flat. So what sort of growth would we expected for those three segments? And you can just do relative if you want for fiscal 2017 and then how much would consumer would up \u2013 would be expect to be up for fiscal 2017?","Dave Zinsner","Difficult to say at this point how all the stuff is going to transpire. We actually haven't done our plan or annual operating plan for 2017 yet, which is due to happen in the next couple of months. I would say that our expectation is that the industrial market grows normally and kind of in the mid-single digits kind of GDP plus a little. So I think that's kind of how we're building it, whether that happens in 2017 probably has more to do with how the macro does than anything, but I think it's a good rule of thumb to think about the growing in those kind of rates.","Automotive I think over time should be back into the levels that Ali talked about with the sub segments which is to grow in the high-single digits, it's been way down a bit obviously by this passive safety business kind of coming off, but that\u2019s kind of running its course. It seems to be the driver for automotive stay flat; it\u2019s still going to be a little bit of a headwind although a smaller headwind into next year. But I think automotive has a chance to start to move, I think it grew a few percent or will have grown a few percent this year, probably grows mid-single digits next year and probably grows up to the high-single digits the following year given all of the exciting opportunities we have that Vince talked about.","In the comm space if anybody guess I think over time we think that our technology which is ahead of competitors will allow us to drive share gains in that market. And so even if the market itself, the CapEx environment of comm infrastructure market is kind of really low single-digit CapEx increases year-over-year, we think we will grow faster than that because of our position in that marketplace.","And then the consumer market, obviously it was down or should be down most likely year-over-year this year as we won't have the same inventory build we had last year which kind of hit us this year. But I think next year as an opportunity to have a pretty decent year because this year was actually way down by the fact that they were digesting inventory in the first half of the year. Next year that won\u2019t be the case, on top of that we will get the full year effect of the dollar content improvements that we got at the end of this year. So we're cautiously optimistic about the consumer business having a decent year next year.","Chris Danely","Great. Thanks a lot, Dave.","Dave Zinsner","Sure.","Operator","Your next question is Craig Ellis with B. Riley.","Craig Ellis","Yes, thanks for taking the question. Dave, I was hoping you could just comment on the ends of the outlook range on revenues. Is the gap between the low end and the high end just allowing for still uncertain macro or is it just related to violence is in any of the segments for different types of build plan assumptions? And any color on what would swing things to the low end or high end would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.","Dave Zinsner","Good question, Craig. A part of it is the fact that consumer tends to have a little bit of uncertainty built in. Come in with quite a bit of backlog but sometimes that backlog can shift around towards the end of the quarter a little bit and that can affect the quarter number even though it doesn\u2019t affect kind of the full build plan over time.","The other piece was you just have to build a little bit of cushion in for kind of a macro uncertainty that might hit us at some point. We don\u2019t expect that which is why kind of the middle of the range is a pretty decent increase. But we did build in some cushion just in case something kind of surprised us. But I would tell you that we come in, in a very good position from a backlog perspective. And so although we give a wide range, we feel pretty good about them hitting the middle part of that range. And if things go better than that, we could hit the higher end of the range.","Ali Husain","All right, great. Thanks, next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC.","Amit Daryanani","Thanks, good morning, guys. Just a question on the industrial side. Sounds like part of the year-over-year decline was driven by this aerospace and defense orders getting pushed out, are the timing getting pushed out [indiscernible]. Can you just talk about what sort of revenue did you end up missing, in July quarter because of that? And is it logical to assume that you picked this backup in the October quarter and you could see a better growth in the industrial segment in that case?","Dave Zinsner","Yes, so the industrial weakness was really, as Ali actually mentioned, it was really specific to aerospace and defense that\u2019s programmatic sometimes in certain particular quarters they may not take as much as we have forecasted just by the timing of the programs. We do expect that to resume in the fourth quarter, come back in the fourth quarter. And that was really the most significant impact. We didn\u2019t really expect industrial to have significant improvement sequentially. So it\u2019s not all together surprising that we were down $10 million. But it was in that kind of range that where the miss occurred.","On the automotive side, I would say we kind of hit where we thought we would. We thought we would be down around 3%, I think we\u2019re down sequentially down 2%. So we did actually marginally better than we expected in the automotive space. So that\u2019s going, I would say better than expected.","Vincent Roche","Yes. And let me just give you a little color on the industrial segment if I can, I mean really everything within the industrial space performed as we had expected, everything was stable to slightly up sequentially. Let me give you a little more color then. In North America we had a good quarter in factory automation. We believe that\u2019s driven by stabilization in the oil and gas space. In China, renewable energy did particularly well. And as Dave mentioned the aerospace and defense area hit a bit of an air pocket this quarter. But I think if you look it on a trailing 12-month basis that business has actually done very, very well for ADI.","And really the acquisition of Hittite has really, as Vince mentioned earlier, reinvigorated that business for us. We\u2019ve got a guy who is running that business he\u2019s doing an amazing job. What I think is a pretty expensive portfolio in that area. So we think A&D is actually a growth market for us going forward. And there \u2013 in there the customers are really looking at these old mechanical systems that are expensive and they are looking to replace them with higher performance cheaper silicon solutions and that really increases our content meaningfully in those systems overtime.","So I think looking at any of these markets in a quarter, particularly in lumpy markets can be fraught with peril. I think if you take a longer-term view, I think these markets are doing pretty nicely for ADI. So well appreciate the question and next question.","Operator","Your next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.","Stacy Rasgon","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess in the third quarter then you mentioning about $10 million offset from the aero, but you had originally guided the B2B business up in the mid-to-upper single digits.","Vincent Roche","Yes.","Stacy Rasgon","$10 million differential still wouldn\u2019t quite get you there. So I\u2019m wondering what other areas in the quarter were potentially weaker than you thought. And I was also hoping if you could give us a little more color on the segment basis for what you expect for the next quarter beyond just the aggregate platform.","Vincent Roche","Right. Well the other area that was little less than planned was the communications market, it declined about 1%, I think sequentially. We expected that business to be up this quarter.","Dave Zinsner","In mid-single digits","Vincent Roche","I would say that was customer specific. There was one particular customer that did quite a bit weaker than expect.","Dave Zinsner","On the wireless side.","Vincent Roche","On the wireless side, and there was some color around India pushing out some of their infrastructure build outs that may have contributed to that. That was the other area that surprised us. And then your other part of your question Stacy is how I expect the end markets to play out in the fourth quarter. I would think that we mentioned B2B was likely to be flat. I think the combination of industrial and auto is likely to be up a bit and I think communications might be marginally weaker.","Stacy Rasgon","Thank you.","Ali Husain","Excellent, next caller.","Operator","Your next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Dave, you got interest income up throughout \u2013 until the close of the deal. Could you just talk about what debt you're adding and at what interest rate? And does that come off the $7.3 billion that you are planning on raising to acquire Linear?","Dave Zinsner","Yes, it\u2019s really just the \u2013 so when we executed the agreement with Linear Tech \u2013 Linear, we had to enter into a underwriting commitment with set of banks to provide, so that the funding was essentially guaranteed. We haven\u2019t drawn any of the money, but banks don't agree to do that without you agreeing to pay them something. So the step up from what was about $12 million a quarter up to what is going to be around $20 million give or take is really that cost of them providing that commitment, even though we haven\u2019t borrowed anything.","That then goes away once we enter into the agreement with or rather close the deal with Linear Tech. And then there\u2019ll be a new financing cost obviously which is actually the drawn down amount, which as I indicated was going to be around 3% pretax on what was sort out being $11 billion but quickly paydown to about $7.5 billion.","Blayne Curtis","Perfect, thanks.","Ali Husain","Thanks, Blayne.","Operator","Your next question is from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore","Hi, guys. Just want to ask a question on the communications area. That in past calls you\u2019ve been pretty bullish about the expectations there. I know you talked about the wireless being weak in both the quarter and it seems like even in the guide you are talking comms being a little bit weaker. Can you talk about any confidence or what level of confidence you have in that communication segment growing going forward?","Vincent Roche","Yes, it\u2019s a good question. So we look at the comms infrastructure market in general, it\u2019s a very important market for ADI. And as always we take a long-term view to how we invest, how we pick our spots and how we invest there. So we\u2019re solving radio problems for our customers, I believe with a level of completeness that is quite unique. And with the addition of Hittite to our portfolio we\u2019re very well-positioned in microwave to bits. And of course with the addition of the linear portfolio we\u2019re able to attach the high-performance power products which will enable us to even offer more complete solutions to our customers.","So I think the way to look at this market whatever happens with the short-term gyrations the challenges that our customers are facing are really immense. The problems are getting harder and harder from generation to generation. They are trying to solve the ongoing problem with spectral efficiency, information integrity, power efficiency and those problems will persist. And we\u2019re in a better position than ever to solve these problems.","So the markets are going to gyrate, its very, very hard to predict its quite a lumpy business as we always say, its hard predict quarter-to-quarter what\u2019s going to happen. But we view the whole comms infrastructure area as, really the electricity of the modern economy and the things that are under our control, how we innovate, how we engage with our customers. We\u2019re doing better there than ever, we continue to make improvements and I believe we\u2019re poised to take share. So whatever the market is we\u2019re poised to take share as the years move on here. So I think that\u2019s the way to view communications infrastructure.","Ali Husain","All right, Ross. Thank you, good question. The next caller.","Operator","Your next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So within your broad-based industrial business, can you just talk about the geographical demand trends you saw in Q3, I know you touched upon some specific product drivers in certain geographies? But maybe just touch upon sort of the broad geographical trends, particularly China since I think your industrial business in China has been a strong driver over the last couple of quarters.","And then maybe touch upon what\u2019s implied within the fourth quarter industrial guidance again from a geographical perspective. Thank you.","Dave Zinsner","Sure. Good question Harlan, let me take that one. Okay so by region I\u2019d say North America and Europe were a little bit weaker sequentially. As I mentioned earlier, even though factory automation was quite strong in North America, our A&D business tends to be more focused in North America. And so as a result of that being weak, North America ended up being a weaker region for us in the industrial space. China was very strong again as you mentioned it is a key area for us in the industrial space. That was strong on instrumentation, applications, smart city and energy type applications. And as I mentioned earlier North America factory automation was pretty strong on stable oil and gas.","As we look forward to the fourth quarter, it's actually an interesting question that you post because generally speaking the fourth quarter for industrial tends to be down in the mid single-digits. This time we\u2019re expecting industrial to be pretty stable to the third quarter level and there's a few reasons for that why we're feeling I guess relatively bullish on that market in the next quarter. The aerospace and defense sector we expect to come back a little bit in the following quarter. And frankly if you look at the orders in distribution, they are currently pretty strong and I think if you compare that to some of the outlooks painted by some of the larger distributors out there, their book-to-bills are trending at parity or above parity so that would support the strong flows we\u2019re seeing in distribution.","So as a result I think when you package up all of those disparate points we come up with a view the next quarter, the industrial market should be pretty stable to its third quarter levels here, so hopefully that answers the question and will get to our next caller.","Operator","Your next question comes from Cody Acree with Drexel Hamilton.","Cody Acree","Hey, thanks guys for taking my questions. With the Linear acquisition what are your long-term thoughts on your capacity needs and how that might impact margins?","Dave Zinsner","What we'll have four fabs on a combined basis and so we'll have plenty of capacity for the future demand of the business. We've had utilization down this quarter expected to be down next quarter, probably would be down again in the first \u2013 at this level in the first quarter again. And then it steps up a bit, their utilization is actually pretty good. So I think that for the foreseeable future, I think we feel pretty good about what our capacity looks like.","Vincent Roche","Yes, I think job number one when you think about fabs and foundry. So the job number one is to make sure, that across the huge breadth of SKUs that we've got that are very, very important to particularly our industrial and B2B customers. Job number one is to make sure we have no supply chain interruptions whatsoever. Both LTC and ADI have, we got very, very high scores for being able to supply a huge diversity of products. Over very, very long periods of time and that's a tremendous value to our customers. So job number one is to make sure that we don't diminish that value in any way. And as Dave said, we manage utilization on a dynamic basis to make sure that we met supply and demand and that will continue to be the way.","Ali Husain","Yes. I think it's worthy of mentioning here this transaction is to better serve our customers so let's not lose side of that.","Vincent Roche","Okay, good question. We\u2019ll move on to our next caller.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Wong with Wells Fargo.","David Wong","Thanks very much. Can you give us some idea in the longer run how 5G might affect your content opportunity and comps infrastructure. Is there any additional opportunity or are the systems essentially the same?","Vincent Roche","Well, apparently the demand for spectral efficiency is going to increase several orders of magnitude. And one of the methods that they're going to use to get there obviously the bandwidth has got to increase but we\u2019re going to be moving well into the microwave area. So the complexity of the problem is going to significantly increase in terms of all the things that we've been talking about, in terms of spectral efficiency, power management, power efficiency, obviously cost per bit and so and so forth. So with each successive generation, there has been more pressure on the technology to deliver ever increasing levels of, as our customers with a productivity, innovation productivity. So our belief, David, is that we're looking at orders of magnitude of complexity increase, which will continue to put pressure on our technology. But that's in our wheelhouse. That's what we like. We like hard problems to solve. That's what we build our business on.","David Wong","Great.","Ali Husain","Thanks, David. Thank you next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer","Yes. Good morning guys. Thanks for let me ask the question. Dave, I wanted to go back to the consumer business. If I look at a year-over-year compare, July quarter consumer was down about 10, the midpoint of your guidance is down close to 20% year-over-year and notwithstanding sort of the inventory issues last year, I would have stopped the July quarter would have been a more difficult compare quarter because my understanding was that July last year benefited from builds beginning early in the quarter throughout the quarter. And this year the July quarter really only benefited from the month of July builds for handsets. And so I'm kind of hoping you can kind of help circle, or square the circle there for me as to why year-over-year growth would be so much worse in the October quarter than the July quarter in the consumer business?","Dave Zinsner","Yes. I mean simply put, John, we just had an inventory build that was pretty significant in the fourth quarter. And we do not expect hopefully to have had happen this time around. It will be more closely aligned with demand. I would say that we do have a range and as you get to the higher end of the range that would suggest a lower \u2013 I guess a lower year-over-year decline, yes I guess would be the way to describe it. So that's obviously a possibility but not what we've built into the plan or the midpoint of the forecast.","John Pitzer","And Dave did the July quarter only benefit from builds in the month of July or did builds happen earlier in July quarter than we thought or than you initially thought on the last conference call?","Dave Zinsner","No, it was definitely more of a July ramp in the third quarter. I would say that probably on a weekly basis, was probably at a higher level than it was last year on a direct compare of the months of July for this year and last year.","John Pitzer","Thank you.","Dave Zinsner","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein","Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. A quick question around the Linear acquisition. First can you remind us of the timing, expected timing to close? And Dave, can you also sort of relate your early experiences coming to ADI and then also your experiences working to help integrate Hittite and maybe string a narrative as to the types of things we should expect to hear around integration when that begins.","Dave Zinsner","Okay, I\u2019ll let Ali talk about the timing piece.","Ali Husain","Okay, all right sounds good. So, yes, I realize that question is top of mind regarding time, but we\u2019re not going to comment on the regulatory approval process at this stage. You see the conditions to the closing the transaction including required regulatory filings, they are all going to be in the Form S-4 registration statement and the proxy statement that ADI and Linear will be falling in connection with the merger in the upcoming weeks. So that takes care of the timing, Dave.","Dave Zinsner","Good lawyered up comment, Ali.","Vincent Roche","Okay, so on the\u2026","William Stein","I'm a good reader\u2026","Vincent Roche","On the integration side, obviously this is going to be different. It's bigger. It's on a different coast so it's not quite as \u2013 it's not in our backyard so we have that aspect of things. But I would say fundamentally it's going to be similar. What I think we do is, we buy really good companies and really good companies don't need to be fixed. And what we try to do is take the best aspects of each company and leverage them in the combined company to make something better than the some of the parts. So that's really what we intend to do. We're just in the initial planning stages as we speak. We\u2019ll probably have a more formalized plan as we work with our compatriots over there at Linear Tech to help to form a good integration plan together.","And I think that will take the better part of the rest of our fiscal year to really kind of come to conclusion on. And then once we do have I think a more clear plan will definitely communicate that to investors and to analysts. But at the moment, I think just our fundamental premises take the best of both companies and make a better company is really how it's going to, the main ethos of the integration.","I think its going to go well. I think we did a great job at Hittite doing those same things and every integration is different but I think the elements of that process are pretty much going to be the way, we approach at this time. And so I suspect it's going to be a really great combination, just the early reads from every customer we've heard from, our employees, as we've been able to talk, clearly about the Linear Tech, we haven't gotten to every Linear Tech employee yet, but the ones we have talked to I think they got the excitement of what this could mean and so I think it\u2019s going be a tremendous combination.","William Stein","Thank you.","Dave Zinsner","Sure.","Ali Husain","Thank you. And I saw Dave dropped a tremendous all of Donald Trump\u2019s through \u2013 all right, a good question.","Vincent Roche","Huge.","Dave Zinsner","All of my Donald Trump\u2019s, that\u2019s scary.","Ali Husain","Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Smigie with Raymond James.","Steve Smigie","Great. Thanks a lot guys. Vince, something you could maybe give a high level strategy comment, ADI obviously been very strong over the years in analog to digital converters, good amplifier portfolios with Linear adding, as you mentioned, fantastic power. Since you've got pretty much the soup to nuts great stuff on Analog, as we think about increasing IoT applications out there which traditionally hasn\u2019t been a big market for you guys, but if you think about that starting to invest more in digital makes sense may be ramping up investing DSP. I was just curious of your high level thoughts on where you go after you got the complete Analog portfolio here.","Vincent Roche","Yes, great question. Good question, Steve. So, yes, we view the IoT, it is the great kind of latest marketing buzz in the world of semiconductors today. But we view IoT has really an extension of the things we already do, so there's a need for precise sensing, precise signal conditioning and conversion at ultra low power levels. And our customers are asking us for, to be able to take some of the bits we generate and develop information to interpret with the bits and give them information which we do in areas for example like reliable healthcare monitoring.","So I think the way to view it is we've got a platform of technologies that we apply to industrial applications, take industrial automation for example. So we've got the conversion technology, signal conditioning amplification, we got processing both on the DSP side. We've fixed function processing that was developed. We're quite a large user of ARM technologies for example a lot of our products now use \u2013 MCUs, very, very low power MCUs, which we traded for our applications. With the RF technologies that we can bring to bear for the connectivity and obviously power management is the core part of the overall solution as well.","So the underlying foundation of silicon technologies will be supplemented over time with more algorithmic technology and lyric for example that we acquired several years ago is a key player in enabling us to bring out algorithmic technology to bear. We're looking at how we make each \u2013 anything that gets connected need security, so as connectivity in the IoT sector is synonymous, it needs security, so that something that we're actually experimenting with. We're looking at possibilities to acquire some technology there as well.","So that's \u2013 what I've described to you is we've got a very, very broad base of technologies that are enabling ADI in our traditional markets, these more connected are IoT markets, where sensing, measuring and interpreting is very, very important. And we're looking for token technologies and organic developments to move to ADI further up the stack for the example into the interpretation using algorithmic technology as well as security and communications.","Steve Smigie","All right. Thank you.","Vincent Roche","So I hope that helps you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.","Shankar Iyer","Hi, thanks for letting me ask a question. This is Shankar on behalf of Vivek. A lot of good question asked about the segments but I just want to ask about the OpEx side of things. You guys mentioned you're having a tight OpEx control right now in Q3 and Q4 just guided to flat go up. But given Linear deal, are you going to be focused on keeping the OpEx at current levels till the deal close? Could you just talk about the trends from Q4 to middle of next year and then how you think about the business long-term?","Dave Zinsner","Okay. So I think when history is written on 2016, we will have been roughly flat year-over-year in OpEx. So I think I'd concur with you that\u2019s a pretty good OpEx control. I think our goal is really to be largely flat next year at the ADI level. And what we'll do is in certain cases reprioritize our investments into areas that we're more confident around the growth levels and shift things around as appropriate and not seek to add a lot of resources particularly as we're going to get a whole bunch of resources hopefully by the middle of next year in the form of Linear Tech in place. So that's kind of the goal \u2013 it likely means that OpEx normally comes down in the first quarter just because the revenue comes down and then it pops back up in the second quarter if revenue is kind of seasonal, but kind of roughly in these kinds of zip codes, plus or minus $10 million from where we are today.","Vincent Roche","Needless to say we're operating as two independent businesses till we close. So we're all the time, we're very opportunity-rich as a company and we're all the time looking to pick the best opportunities, make sure they're properly funded, and we're always looking for talents. So within the boundaries of an OpEx model that is spending 18% or 19% in R&D that's what we intend to do and scale it with revenue growth over time.","Shankar Iyer","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura.","Kristen Shaka","Hi. This is Kristen Shaka for Romit. Congrats on a great quarter guys.","Vincent Roche","Thank you.","Kristen Shaka","Just to go back to the consumer segment for a little bit, how did consumer business outside of your largest North American handset customer performed?","Dave Zinsner","Yes, I can take that one. I would tell you as we enter sort of the back half of the year for ADI the consumer business has some positive seasonality. And so it actually performed quite nicely on a sequential basis and it was about stable to the prior year. So hopefully, that's helpful, and we can get to the next question.","Operator","Your next question is from Ian Ing with MKM Partners.","Dave Zinsner","Ian, are you there?","Ian Ing","Yes. Hi, thanks a lot. I believe at one point you gave a full year CapEx target of $140 million to $150 million, you're running below that. Is that because of the Linear deal perhaps getting accessed to some equipment and factory outputs and maybe there's some spending you won't need here?","Dave Zinsner","No, we're just generally sent a budget that we're going to spend at 4% of revenue in \u2013 I think coming into year we thought \u2013 we didn't suspect this air pocket we'd run into on the consumer side and so we had a higher expectation on CapEx, but given that the revenue was a bit lower, we lowered the CapEx to this so we could maintain the 4%.","Vincent Roche","Yes, and so the new numbers somewhere in the range of $130 million to $135 million for the year or so.","Ali Husain","Thanks, Ian. Good question. Next caller please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephen Chin with UBS.","Stephen Chin","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking for my question. Just given some of the color earlier on some of the growth in your wired infrastructure business because of the 100 gig optical. I was wondering if you could provide some more color on whether that's primarily driven by hyper scale data center customers or if there are some teleco carrier CapEx that\u2019s driving that as well? And related to that is looking forward is set pretty much running in line with demand or is there some big element of capacity build ahead or build out for us \u2013 for consumption around this year? Thanks.","Vincent Roche","Yes, good question. It's driven by demand. I think there's a very, very good balance between what we're seeing in terms of demand and supply. There's obviously a huge amount of activity in the intra data center connectivity, and we're participating in that with our customers, also long haul and kind of metro build outs, and I think there's a good balance between the three, but it seems that the data center is hotter at this point in time and looks like it will be a wave for several years to come. So I think it's a good mix and very good balance between demand and supply here.","Ali Husain","All right, Stephen, thanks. Next caller.","Operator","Next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore.","C.J. Muse","Yes, good morning, thank you for squeezing me in. I guess a quick question around the Linear merger; curious what kind of conversations if any you've had in terms of locking up talent there. And as you think about your compensation plan versus theirs, what are the implications to OpEx going forward?","Vincent Roche","Well, we're operating as two separate companies until we close and obviously when you look at both companies actually we've had tremendous \u2013 we've got tremendously long tenure in both companies and the attrition rates run very, very, very low in both companies. And I expect that to be what it will \u2013 that will maintain its pace for many, many years to come. People remain with these companies because we do exciting things. We solve big, big hard problems. We've got very strong cultures. And I believe that just as it was so with Hittite and ADI, it is our goal to make sure that we win the hearts and minds of all of our engineers, who really create the value for both companies, and I'm very confident about that based on the conversations I've so far had with the LTC leadership and I see that as being a tremendous value and strength of both companies.","Dave Zinsner","And I would say that from an OpEx management perspective we run in this \u2013 into this every time we integrate a company there are always slight differences in terms of how the compensation works and I think we're pretty good at figuring out a way that we can do it that works for employees and keep them energized and engaged and simultaneously doesn't have an impact on our total OpEx and our ability to manage our OpEx appropriately. So we haven't worked out the particulars of that and that will also be done over the coming months. But I feel pretty confident that we'll be able to address employees concerns and shareholders concerns and come up with something that's optimal.","Ali Husain","Thanks C.J. And Okay. So we're past 11:00 AM here Eastern. So that means we have time for one last caller.","Operator","And our final question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari","Hey, good morning and thanks for squeezing me in. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about your content win and consumer. Where are you seeing the design wins? How fast is content this year growing relative to last year? And how sustainable is that rate of growth going into next year? Thank you so much.","Dave Zinsner","Well, as I said the content increases 30%. We can't get into the details. We have confidentiality of our requirements with our customers that don't allow us to go into any more detail other than that.","Vincent Roche","You know the wins are consistent with our stated strategy. We play in really, really high quality problem areas in the user experience and the wins we\u2019ve had are very, very consistent with that stated strategy.","Ali Husain","Okay, great.

Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and in our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.","Our comments today about ADI\u2019s third quarter fiscal 2019 financial results and short-term outlook will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude special items. When comparing our results to historical performance, special items are also excluded from these prior quarter and year-over-year results. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about the non-GAAP measures are included in today\u2019s earnings release.","I also want to point out that during the third quarter we improved our method to more accurate estimate the end market classifications for shipments to distributors. This has opened to some modest changes from historical end market revenue breakdown, but did not changed our total revenue or EPS. We have posted a quarterly end market look back based on this improved method to our investor website. ","Okay. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to ADI\u2019s CEO, Vincent Roche. Vince?","Vincent Roche","Thanks very much, Mike, and good morning to you all. Well, in what continues to be a challenging macroeconomic environment, we executed soundly in our third fiscal quarter and delivered solid results. Revenue of $1.48 billion in the third quarter came in above the midpoint of our guidance. Our B2B markets decreased 3% year-over-year, given the weaker macro conditions and performed well relative to the market. This performance is testament to the diversity of our franchise and investing ahead of secular trends to drive ongoing share gains and some expansion.","Operating margins of approximately 41%, were above our guidance as we moved quickly to reduce expenses given the ongoing market weakness. All told, adjusted EPS was a $1.26. Over the past 12 months, we've generated approximately $2 billion in free cash flow or 33% of revenue. And during the same time period we've returned more than 100% of free cash flow to our shareholders after debt repayments.","Now while there are clearly a number of near-term external challenges we're navigating through, ADI has always been and remains focused on delivering sustainable long-term profitable growth. To that end, before Prashanth covers our financial results in more detail, I'm going to continue our quarterly practice of providing a deeper level of insight into one of our markets. The trends influencing its future and how we are positioned to capitalize on these trends over the long-term.","So today I'd like to discuss the emerging automotive electrification ecosystem that is supporting a number of underlying industries, from energy to transportation to manufacturing and indeed beyond, and paving the way for the transition to cleaner energy sources.","ADI is also focused on making the most efficient use of energy in both our products and operations, and I am proud to say that we are playing an important role in this new wave of electrification. We approach automotive electrification from an ecosystem perspective that is to say the electric vehicle is just one element.","For ADI, the origin of our journey starts with the formation of the battery. It then extends to the ongoing management of an installed electric vehicles battery system and then to powering the supporting electrical infrastructure needed to fuel EVs. The common thread woven through all of these applications is the precision signal processing, control and power management capabilities they require, capabilities indeed in which ADI excels.","So let me explain a bit more. Our value journey starts with battery formation and test, a time-consuming and complex chemical process where extremely precise measurement means the difference between a safe, high quality battery and the low-quality one. The lithium-ion batteries that power electric vehicles represent nearly a third of the entire cost of the vehicle. So OEMs place a high premium on battery quality and reliability.","Our portfolio of fully integrated precision signal processing, control and power products allows ADI to offer customers the highest levels of accuracy, safety and reliability for their battery formation and test process. Our solutions reduce battery formation cost by two-thirds, by shrinking our customers equipment footprint by 4x and enabling up to 95% power reuse, which reduces environmental impact as well.","Once the battery system has been manufactured, our opportunity grows with the electrification applications within the vehicle itself. Here our technology is a key enabler in the transition from combustion engines to cleaner electric vehicles, which are projected to grow from the current 2% worldwide vehicle sales to more than 20% over the next decade or so.","In the vehicle, the battery management system or BMS provide precise monitoring and control of the complex charge and discharge cycles of the battery system. Accuracy and safety in the BMS are critical, since overcharging or undercharging can lead to the battery's destruction and render it useless. The accuracy of the BMS is also a major determining factor in the performance of EV as it directly affects the miles per charge an electric vehicle can safely deliver. And to add to the challenge that accuracy needs to be maintained through extreme environmental conditions and harsh interference over the 10 plus year lifecycle of the car.","Such an application challenge is a perfect fit for ADI where we once again leverage our deep heritage and accurate precision measurement to provide optimized solutions for battery management. We\u2019ve got the industry's broadest IC portfolio supporting all battery voltages from 48 volts to 800 volts, covering the full range of premium electric vehicles right down to the entry-level.","Our products are also designed specifically for harsh automotive environments enabling us to deliver up to 20% more miles per charge than our competition. We deliver the highest level of automotive functional safety, another full suite of powerful safety diagnostics that are easy to integrate and use. So thanks to these advantages, we now have a leadership position across key customers in the U.S., Europe and Asia, giving us confidence that we can continue to grow BMS revenue at a double-digit annual rate, and we continue to push the innovation curve.","Future generations on our BMS roadmap include architectural innovations that will improve the way power density, accuracy and weight challenges are solved, including the ability to wirelessly and robustly communicate. And finally our opportunity extends beyond the car to the charging station infrastructure that sources stores and transfer the energy that powers electric vehicles.","Charging stations represent the unique challenge for electric grids due to their intermittent and substantial demand peaks. And it must also effectively and cost efficiently meet the fast charging requirements consumer demand for their EVs. As a result, charging stations rely on battery powered energy storage systems to accurately and quickly charge a vehicle.","Here the precision of our BMS solution can reduce the total cost of ownership of the energy storage system by a third, by extending the battery life by up to 2x and lowering maintenance costs. As demand for batteries rises we\u2019re beginning to see a push towards extending a battery\u2019s useful life by enabling a second life for EV batteries and infrastructure applications. We believe ADI's best-in-class measurement capabilities will become increasingly important as this market matures and the second life deployments begin to scale.","So in closing, electrification represents a highly valuable market for ADI for the long-term. It presents a number of difficult challenges for our customers, challenges that our portfolio and people are transforming into opportunities every day. Through our battery management, power conversion, connectivity and isolation technologies we\u2019re delivering innovative solutions that position us to capture revenue growth opportunities throughout the electrification ecosystem today and well into the future.","And so with that, let me hand over to Prashanth, who will take you through the financial details.","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone. And let me add my welcome to our third quarter earnings call. My comments today with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses will be on an adjusted basis, which exclude special items outlined in today's press release.","Before I get to the results for the quarter, I wanted to provide some details related to the ongoing situation with Huawei. A few weeks into our third quarter, the Commerce Department added them to the BIS entity list. ADI immediately suspended shipments of all products. After a thorough review of the export administration regulations and the entity list restrictions, we determined that we could lawfully resume shipping selected ADI products to this customer.","We're closely monitoring this dynamic situation and feel that we are well-positioned to adapt as the circumstances evolve. The scope, duration and long-term financial impact of the export restrictions remain unclear and difficult to predict. But at least for the near-term, our Huawei demand has taken a step down from previous level.","As a result, we are planning for sales to this customer to be meaningfully below our previous mid single-digit percentage range, which we discussed with you last quarter. This is reflected in our guidance which is published in our earnings release.","So now let's get onto the quarter. ADI delivered a strong third quarter with revenue, operating margin and EPS, all above the midpoint of guidance. Our B2B revenue was down a modest 3% year-over-year as growth in communications was balanced by ongoing weakness in industrial and automotive markets.","The industrial market which represented 51% of sales in the quarter decreased 4% year-over-year. And while most applications were down year-over-year, we saw continued strength in our aerospace, defense, healthcare and electronic test and measurement businesses.","Communications represented 21% of sales during the quarter and grew 7% year-over-year. While both wireless and wired results were impacted by Huawei, our wireless sales still increased double-digit year-over-year driven by record revenue across multiple customers, a testament to our balanced and market leading position in advanced radio systems used in the 5G infrastructure.","Automotive represented 15% of sales and was down 9% year-over-year, reflective of the ongoing decline in global vehicle sales. Year-to-date, our auto revenue is down [technical difficulty] digits year-over-year, outperforming a declining SAAR due to strength in BMS, which has increased double digits over the time and the ongoing momentum in our power franchise.","And lastly consumer made up 12% of sales and increased 18% year-over-year. So now let's go the P&L. Revenue for the quarter was above the midpoint of guidance at approximately $1.48 billion, down 5% year-over-year. Gross margins came in at 70.4%, down 20 basis points sequentially due to lower back to utilization and in what is normally a higher OpEx quarter due to our merit increases, we reduced OpEx by $6 million sequentially to $438 million.","And as we continue to navigate these challenging times, you can look for us to keep a tight rein on discretionary and nonessential spending. Our prudent OpEx spend offset slightly lower gross margins and resulted in op margins of 40.8% above the midpoint of guidance.","Non-op expenses in the quarter were down $4 million sequentially, driven by lower interest expense as we continue to reduce debt. And the tax rate for the quarter was 14% in line with our outlook. All told the adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter came in above the midpoint of guidance and a $1.26.","Let me comment on the balance sheet. We exited the quarter at 129 days of inventory above the high-end of our target range of 115 to 125. This increase related primarily to weaker quality demand and as we discussed with you in the first quarter earnings call the initial build of our bridge inventory to support the planned closure of two manufacturing facilities in early 2021.","As a reminder, we expect to generate 100 million of cost of goods synergies related to these facility closures. And during this transitional phase we expect to carry an additional 5 to 10 days of inventory to support our customers. Channel inventory was just over eight weeks as we exited the third quarter and CapEx return to a normal level of 4% of sales were $58 million as much of our co-location activities are now complete.","We generated approximately $2 billion of free cash flow over the trailing 12 months and during that time we\u2019ve returned more than 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks after debt repayments. Specifically in the third quarter we repaid $300 million of debt, paid $200 million in dividends and repurchased over 100 million of our stock.","So now let's move to guidance, which with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses will also be discussed on an adjusted basis. Revenue is expected to be $1.45 billion, plus or minus $50 million. And at the midpoint, we expect our B2B market of industrial automotive and communications in the aggregate to decrease low to mid-single digits year-over-year.","And as a point of reference, if we back Huawei way out of our year-over-year Q4 compares, B2B is roughly flat. Operating margin is expected to be approximately 40% at the midpoint and non-op expenses are expected to decline sequentially by approximately $5 million and the tax rate will remain in the 13% to 15% range. Based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be a $1.22 plus or minus $0.07.","So in closing, we are pleased with our quarter results given the current macro and geopolitical climate. And during these uncertain times, we will carefully manage our expenses, while also investing strategically in areas that continue to position us to deliver profitable growth over the long-term.","So let me hand it back to Mike, so we can start our Q&A.","Michael Lucarelli","Thanks, Prashanth. Let\u2019s get to the Q&A session. Please limit yourself to one question. After our initial response, we will give you an opportunity for follow-up question. Sheryl, can we have our first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","John Pitzer","Yes, good afternoon -- good morning, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Congratulations on the solid results given the backdrop. Vince, I wonder if you could help me better understand, clearly I think one of the consequences of the trade dispute between China and the U.S., is that Huawei is more intent to kind of be able to build a base station with non-U.S suppliers. I\u2019m wondering if you can help me understand from your perspective and the sockets you play in, how easily can Huawei do that? Do you view Huawei just a transitory issue for the company, or do you think there could be some long-term real socket share loss as Huawei tries to lessen its dependence on U.S. component suppliers?","Vincent Roche","Yes. Thanks, John. We\u2019ve been as a company we\u2019re in business almost 55 years now, and we\u2019ve been competing with players from all over the globe in all areas of our business, different players in different spaces. But what I will say is, in general, we\u2019ve taken the highest performance position in 5G base stations, in the radio systems. And whether that\u2019s Chinese OEMs that are absorbing our products, European, whatever, Korean, that\u2019s our game. And as these systems become ever more complex, performance matters more and more and more and more when you're trying to really put more information density through every radio, that\u2019s where we play and nobody competes with us at that level. There are perhaps different ways to solve the problem. You can sacrifice performance, perhaps. But if you're looking for the best-in-class 5G radio performance, its ADI, that the OEMs are coming to. ","And one of the thoughts I want to leave you with, John is that whatever happens -- you know, whatever happens the ongoing situation with regard to Huawei, we are very well penetrated as a corporation across the globe with all the OEMs. So no matter what happens, we will grow in 2020. That\u2019s the expectation. So, competition is just a facet of doing business and we're more than well prepared with the portfolio of products we already have, and the products that we have coming. So -- and I want to make it clear as well that the restriction that we're experiencing with regard to shipping into Huawei specifically is around 5G. Our legacy 4G products have been shipping and as far as I understand will continue to ship. So -- also it's an evolving situation and we are doing everything we can to be able to satisfy the needs of all our customers. And in China, specifically, we are in the process of seeking the licenses that we need to support our products in the short to medium-term here. So hope that answers your question, John.","Michael Lucarelli","Hey, John, do you have a follow-up?","John Pitzer","It does. That\u2019s helpful. Yes, just one quick [indiscernible] in your prepared comments, Prashanth mentioned that excluding Huawei your B2B business would be kind of flat year-over-year in the October quarter, which is meaningfully better than your peers. Is that mainly still just a comms phenomenon, which I believe is well understood by investors, or can you talk about bottoms up drivers in the industrial and auto that might be helping you guys drive that outperformance on year-on-year growth?","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","Yes, I think industrial is -- it is much more than comms. I think we are very pleased with how strong our industrial business is, but let me have Mike kind of breakdown how to think about it on a year-over-year basis, if you back out Huawei.","Michael Lucarelli","Yes. So, John, good question. So if you look at our outlook, it kind of assumes, I would say, pretty much flattish year-over-year in industrial. If you move on to automotive, its down about 10% and comms is also down by 10%, but if you have to back out Huawei, comms is up once again year-over-year, that is -- with mark kind of I think our 11th and 12th quarter in a row of year-over-year growth in comms, and that kind of goes as what Vince said about the breadth of our portfolio across customers. And if we move away from B2B and the consumer its down double-digits and it kind of [raise line] [ph] for the year down about 20%. I don\u2019t know, Vince, you want to talk about industrial and kind of the strength we\u2019re seeing there and why we\u2019ve been better than our peers.","Vincent Roche","Yes. So I think if you look at industrial in kind of two pockets, we\u2019ve our more fragmented broader base business, specifically automation. And I would say that business right now given its high-intensity CapEx needs is weaker, pretty much across all geographic spaces at this point in time. I don't think it will be a great surprise to tell you that the memory test business has been weak now almost for a year and that persist remains at least tepid. But I think the areas where we're seeing most strength right now are aerospace and defense. And in fact that's increasing just about 20% year-on-year, given the record defense budget that has just been passed in the U.S. we are seeing good growth across all the sub applications within aerospace and defense. And one of the real point of strength for ADI and what's driving a lot of the growth is the combination of the microwave and RF technologies from Hittite with the mixed-signal products from ADI and we are starting to bring LTC more aggressively into that space as well. So that\u2019s the future growth dimension in that aerospace and defense business. Health care continues to grow nicely. I think, in general, I\u2019ve been pretty public that I think that\u2019s a space whose time has really come and I think this digital health area in general is just an inflection point. It's just at the knee of the curve, so to speak. So that\u2019s doing well for us across the board, whether it's big iron or clinical grade patient monitoring type systems. And given again the growth in areas like 5G, BMS, very, very high-frequency automotive radar safety systems, the electronic test and measurement side of things is performing well also. So I think that helps unpack the industrial story hopefully for you.","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","Thanks, John.","Michael Lucarelli","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Your line is open.","Michael Lucarelli","Good morning, Tore.","Tore Svanberg","Yes. Yes, good morning and congratulations on the execution in this environment. First question is on communications, Vince. You said you expect to grow pretty nicely in calendar '20. I was just hoping you could elaborate a little bit on what\u2019s driving that? I mean, is that when 5G kind of really kicks in, because obviously up until now a lot of the growth has been more 4.5G. So if you could elaborate on that please.","Vincent Roche","Yes. So, thanks, Tore. The -- look, I think the way to think about 5G is one of the most exciting new platforms to be introduced in the world of information and communications technology for several years. So it's very -- I believe, it will be very pervasive. It's in the early stages of deployment and we're looking at a multiyear cycle here. One of the things I think that's important to remember with 5G is that, it's really designed to enable B2B users to modify their business models and their offerings to their customers, whether it's an industrial, whether it's in healthcare, where critical connection to the system is really important. So I think it's less about the consumer, more about B2B. Data is doubling every couple of years, so the need for bandwidth and very low latency is real and its necessary, and that \u2013won\u2019t abate, that will continue to intensify over time. And you know the only way to solve that is by delivering more spatial, or spectral efficiency. So, I think what we\u2019re seeing is very, very early stage deployment and the radio is one of the most critical element in the development and deployment of these new 5G systems. And I think over the next 3, 4 years we will start to see the virtualization of the network and a more aggressive introduction of the microwave technologies as well that will be the next generation of 5G. So I think as you know, as I said in the -- in an earlier comment there, we're very well-positioned technologically. The problems are getting tougher and tougher in the base station from a performance standpoint. So the portfolio lines very well gets ahead of our customers' needs there. And we're very well penetrated across the board in terms of the breadth of our portfolio and the depth of our portfolio. I will also point out that the power portfolio from LT is nicely fitting in as well. So that's another wave of growth that we will begin to see materialize during 2020, 2021. ","Michael Lucarelli","Hey, Tore, do you have follow-up?","Tore Svanberg","Yes. Thank you for that, Vince. As a follow-up, you talked about the electrification and BMS. I\u2019m just wondering when you\u2019re talking to your automotive customers right now and especially given the sort of challenging SAAR environment, are you seeing an acceleration in the designs for BMS and EV?","Vincent Roche","Very definitely, Tore. I think it's -- whether it's European, U.S., Japanese or Asian OEMs, there's a pervasive move towards electrification of the powertrain. So the -- we're very confident that the BMS portfolio that we have, we are on our 5th generation incidentally. And having met several of these OEMs over the last quarter too, I can tell you that there's a level of intensity and urgency to move more towards electrical powertrains. And given that BMS or electric powertrain today represents around 2% of all the vehicles built, that\u2019s likely to increase by an order of magnitude over the next decade or so. So, I think it's very real. I certainly -- growing in confidence that this trends that we're seeing is becoming more intense and it's something that we're very well-positioned to take advantage of. I mentioned as well in the prepared remarks that we're moving on to yet another generation, we\u2019re changing the way the connectivity of the information is rendered in the car with our new wireless BMS architecture, which we\u2019ve introduced to the market and we will start to see, I think significant revenue accrue there in the kind of '20, '21 timeframe.","Michael Lucarelli","Thank you, Tore.","Tore Svanberg","Very helpful. Thank you.","Michael Lucarelli","Sheryl, our next caller, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Mitch Steves","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So I think that one of the more interesting things by ADI is just kind of the ramp in the content you guys are seeing on 5G. So I just want to clarify what you guys are talking about for 2020? So, if we assume that Huawei is entirely banned, do you guys still believe you are going to see, I guess, a notable growth within communications, is that fair?","Vincent Roche","Yes. Yes, absolutely. Yes, Mitch, so -- it goes to, one, we have very good share across the ecosystem, and two, is the additional content we see in these systems. There's two flavors really of 5G out that is the subset gigahertz, and those systems, our silicon content is about 4x that of a traditional 4G. And then as you move to higher frequency millimeter wave, the additional content on top of that 4x, that's also an opportunity for ADI. That's really the ADI Hittite portfolio and also Linear bringing in there as well.","Mitch Steves","Got it. Okay. And then secondly, I kind of want to turn real quickly to the industrial segment. I mean, it looks like you guys are gaining share there. I'm curious again, what you guys think the overall market is doing within industrial, and if you guys think this is something you can sustain over the next few quarters as well? So I'm not saying that the Industrial segment will grow, but more just in terms of you guys being able to continue to gain share against companies like TI?","Vincent Roche","Yes. Well, this is an area where -- I mean, this is the core of area in many ways and it represents about half of the company's total revenue. About seven, eight, nine years ago, we retooled the entire investment portfolio of the company from an R&D and from a go-to-market perspective, just focused more intensely on B2B applications and industrial has been the priority there. So I think what we are seeing now is the benefit of the new product crop that we've been able to introduce there. We\u2019ve a lot of exciting new things coming that are in the pipeline, that are in the cusp of materializing into revenue. So -- also our customer engagements are continuing to evolve from, I would say, seven, eight, nine years ago, we were largely a component provider. Now we are providing different forms of solutions, collections of components, more -- highly integrated products for different types of applications. So I think in many, many ways, what we are seeing now is the culmination of many, many years of very targeted activity to become stronger in industrial.","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","Mitch, I might just add that, remember this particular market is very sticky. So the momentum that we\u2019ve, as Vince talked about, has taken several years to build and once you have it, you kind of roll with it, and I would expect to see that continued strength versus the broader market play out over the coming years.","Mitch Steves","Okay, perfect. Thank you very much.","Michael Lucarelli","Go to next caller, Sheryl, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from C.J. Muse, Evercore. Your line is open.","C.J. Muse","Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Vince, you talked in great deal on the BMS side. I was hoping just to follow-up there. As you think about increasing technology requirements within the portfolio and how you're investing and proceeding there, I guess, two questions. One, I think it's about 5% of your revenues today, where do you think that could be five years from now? And then two, how are you seeing changes in the competitive landscape as we proceed both electric vehicles and hybrid from here?","Vincent Roche","Yes. Thanks, C.J. First and foremost, we are playing on the high-end. Our portfolio is targeted at kind of mid-to-high end applications where the problems are focused [ph] and we're able to leverage our strength in precision signal processing. That really has been the mainstay of the company for the last five decades. I would say, in terms of what you can expect in terms of growth, my sense is this will be a double-digit growth area for several years to come.","C.J. Muse","Great. And I guess, as a follow-up for Prashanth, at what point in terms of outstanding debt would you focus 100% of your free cash flow on buybacks and dividend as opposed to paying down debt?","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","Yes. Good question, C.J. I don't want to lock us into a specific position, but I will say a couple of comments. One, this is a business that generates a tremendous amount of cash flow. So compared to how the Company was run several years ago, we are very comfortable with debt on the balance sheet, and I don't see us ever moving to kind of the large cash surplus that we used to be at. What is -- we are really focused on maintaining that investment grade rating, so we are going to be mindful of what the broader interest rate environment looks like and how the ratings agencies view us to ensure that we are doing what's necessary to kind of maintain that investment grade. Having said that, we're going to throw off a lot of cash. We just did a refi to -- I would say, a quarter ago where we moved some of our 5-year term into a shorter duration. So expect us to kind of continue moving to drive that down. And I'd highlight that we\u2019ve been meaningfully taking down our share count in 2019. I think you can expect us to continue to do that in 2020.","Michael Lucarelli","Thanks C.J.","C.J. Muse","Very helpful. Thank you.","Michael Lucarelli","Let's move to the next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Michael Lucarelli","Good morning, Craig.","Vincent Roche","Okay, Craig.","Craig Hettenbach","On auto electrification, in terms of your positioning and long-term growth drivers, a number of suppliers have noted just near-term weakness in China just from a subsidy perspective and uncertainty around demand. Any color that you have in terms of what you're seeing in the China market on a near-term basis?","Vincent Roche","Hey, Craig. Yes, I mean, we -- in the market, we\u2019ve market-leading position cross geos. China is a big market for us. What I will say is, yes, last quarter we did grow year-over-year, but it was less than 2Q in BMS, we still did grow. But it's a lumpy deployment base business. And if you look over the year-to-date, we're up double digits and we expect to grow year-over-year, again in our fourth quarter even with what's going on in China.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it.","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","And Craig, I do want to maybe reiterate the prepared remarks that Vince mentioned. For us, it is much more than just about managing the battery as efficiently as possible. We enjoyed growth with the processors who form and test the batteries. We have the LTC capabilities that helped drive efficient use of that power to help extend the range and we are also in the charging station. So as the whole ecosystem continues to build out to support electric vehicles, for us it's a much bigger play than just focusing on the batteries.","Michael Lucarelli","Do you have a follow-up Craig?","Craig Hettenbach","Understood. Thanks for that incremental color. Yes, I guess a follow-up, Prashanth, just on the manufacturing and some of the things you're doing with the footprint consolidation. Any update in terms of gross margin impact of when you would expect to see some synergies from that?","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","Yes. Thanks for the question, Craig. So, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, our inventory is a little bit higher this quarter, because we are starting to put the bridge inventory that\u2019s necessary for us to be able to close the facilities in Singapore and California. So we will need that bridge inventory so that we can continue to serve customers, while we take those facilities down. We are targeting those savings to start coming through the P&L in 2021 -- early 2021 and that -- as we\u2019ve been public in several calls, that should be about an incremental $100 million on a run rate basis, that's all flowing through cost of goods sold.","Craig Hettenbach","Great. Thank you.","Michael Lucarelli","Thanks, Craig. Sheryl, next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Vincent Roche","Vivek? Good morning. Vivek. Okay. Vivek, we are going to go to the next caller.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is open.","Vincent Roche","Good morning. Stacey.","Stacy Rasgon","Let's start with OpEx. So obviously, you mentioned being a little more concerned on expenses given the environment. Can you talk a little bit about how you see that OpEx trajectory going into Q4? Are you sort of bottomed at this point given where variable comp is on the metrics, or is there room to still take OpEx down? I guess, what are the implications for OpEx, given the continued weak environment that you\u2019ve seen?","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","Yes. Thanks for the question, Stacy. So I think the way to -- first, as a reminder, we don't guide gross margins anymore. If I answer OpEx question, I am implicitly giving you that guidance.","Stacy Rasgon","But qualitatively.","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","Yes, the way to think about it is, we are -- we have made a meaningful reduction in our OpEx versus our Q2. So we had a sequential improvement going into Q3. We are looking for that to kind of carry roughly flattish for the fourth quarter. We will focus on the variable cost that we can control and continue to exercise OpEx discipline. As we\u2019ve said before, one of the levers we do have is our compensation system, which is meant to act as a flywheel as businesses go up and down and that will certainly be an element of the Q4.","Stacy Rasgon","Got it.","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","Thank you.","Stacy Rasgon","I do. Thank you. So in the prepared remarks, Vince mentioned that obviously the macro environment is still challenging, isn't getting better in the near-term. Would you say that from your perspective versus where your expectations were three months ago? Have things gotten worse versus where your prior expectations had been? I guess, just where have you been expecting things to kind of go into the year-end and are things worse than that are they sort of similar to where you had expect them to be three months ago?","Vincent Roche","Yes, Thanks, Stacy. Well, I would say the uncertainty and the trade tensions between America and China have obviously ratcheted up. I think it's indeterminate. What will actually happen there, in the short-to-medium term, PMI indices as well as GDPs are falling somewhat. So I think that headwind has increased somewhat, I think, since the last quarter. I think when I try to classify how customers are thinking about the world, the world of technology is gearing up. There's more and more innovation, the R&D budgets are very, very strong across the globe in all the sectors. So I think customers remain optimistic about the future, but I would say right at this point in time, the people who commit the CapEx, commit the investments, are probably a little less optimistic about the future than they were, say, a quarter ago. So that\u2019s pretty much the best commentary I can give you Stacy.","Stacy Rasgon","Okay. And I guess, in our conference at the end of May, Vince, you had sounded pretty positive about potentially getting a trade deal, it doesn't sound like were there anymore?","Vincent Roche","Well, who really knows. I think both sides are working on it. I think incidentally, both sides want the deal, but I think it depends on the conditions. And what\u2019s out there in the public domain is that both sides are digging their heels in at this point. So, yes, I would say Stacy, to answer your question directly, the sense of a trade deal by the end of the summer, which is looming very quickly here, is less likely than it was when you and I spoke back in May.","Michael Lucarelli","All right, Stacy. Thank you for the three questions [indiscernible] in there. Operator, we are going to try to go back to Vivek, if we can. And that will be our last question today.","Operator","Okay. Your next question is from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Vivek Arya","Thank you. Can you hear me now?","Vincent Roche","We can, Vivek.","Vivek Arya","Okay. Sorry for the screw up before. So first question, how should we think about seasonality going into your January quarter? Historically, it's a positive quarter, but I know you've had consumer volatility and this time, there's also the Huawei and trade war volatility. So I\u2019m just curious, how is your visibility kind of one quarter out right now?","Michael Lucarelli","I will tell you, typical seasonality. I would say it's not a typical time. I will caveat with that and we are not giving guidance for a quarter out. Typically first quarter is a weaker quarter for us in B2B. Industrial is typically down -- almost typically down. I do think -- and the comms market, we talked about it being weaker here in the fourth quarter. It was very volatile and I think you see a quick acceleration back there in the first quarter and consumer will update you on next call, kind of our outlook for 2020. But I think you can expect this soon to be down again in 2020, but to a lesser degree than '19.","Vivek Arya","All right.","Michael Lucarelli","Do you have a follow-up, Vivek?","Vivek Arya","And then the other -- yes, thank you. The other thing, Vince, I know there's a lot of macro uncertainty right now, but when I look at your automotive and industrial businesses, so they were down kind of 6% year-on-year for the last couple of quarters. If I look at the guidance you're giving for October, it's down about -- I think about 2% year-on-year and you are saying industrial can be actually flat year-on-year, which is much better than what we\u2019ve seen in the last few quarters. So I\u2019m just trying to reconcile all the uncertainty in the macro environment versus the October quarter, kind of, industrial outlook. That seems somewhat more positive when I look at it.","Vincent Roche","Yes, we\u2019ve a couple of specific areas where we\u2019re seeing strength, aerospace and defense being kind of top of the list there. For a range of reasons, it's a combination of budgets being increased in the area of aerospace and defense, and also the strength of the technology portfolio that we bring. And I mentioned earlier on that healthcare continues to grow for the company. It's an area, again, where we've been increasing investments over the last 5, 7 years, and that's an area that I continue to be very optimistic about and think it will be a very good source of growth for the company for many, many years to come. So there are the two areas, Vivek, that are most meaningfully contributing on the industrial side right now to the strength we're seeing relative to the market.","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","And Vivek, I know you asked specifically about the change in trajectory in Q4, but I would want to remind you that kind of on a year-to-date basis, those numbers you quoted have been substantially better than the broader market. So we\u2019ve outperformed, although the industrial market has been down on a year-to-date basis for us. We've generally outperformed the broader market.","Vivek Arya","Yes, absolutely.","Michael Lucarelli","Okay.","Vivek Arya","Thank you.","Michael Lucarelli","Thank you, Vivek. Thanks everyone for joining us this morning. A copy of the transcript will be available on our website and all of our reconciliations and information can also be found there. Thanks again for joining us and look forward to talking to you in 90 days.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s Analog Devices conference call.

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to Analog Devices Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the opening remarks, there will be a question and answer period.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Ali Husain, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Ali Husain - Director-Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, Jennifer. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining Analog Devices second quarter fiscal 2015 earnings conference call. We have posted a press release with relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com and I'd encourage you to follow along as we go through our results today.","Our agenda for today's call is as follows: First, I will provide a brief overview of our second quarter results, then Dave Zinsner, ADI's CFO, will review our financial performance of the second quarter, and finally Vincent Roche, ADI's President and CEO will provide our business outlook for the third quarter, along with closing remarks. And after our prepared remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session.","Now the information we're about to discuss, including our objectives and outlook, includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call and we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Our comments today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which we've reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in today's earnings release, which is posted on our investor relations website at investor.analog.com. And with that let's get started.","Now, as you've likely seen from the press release, after a very good first quarter of fiscal 2015, ADI produced another strong performance in our second quarter. The strength of our innovation, the diversity of our business, and our strong execution drove revenue to a record $821 million, which is an increase of 6% from the previous quarter and an increase of 18% from the same period a year ago. By end market, industrial, automotive and consumer exceeded our revenue expectations for the quarter and offset what was a weak wireless infrastructure CapEx environment.","The industrial end markets, which are typically seasonally strong for ADI in the second quarter, grew 11% sequentially and represented 48% of our total sales. All of the major application areas within industrial grew sequentially with the strongest growth coming from the aerospace and defense, instrumentation and industrial automation sectors. By region, sequential industrial revenue growth was strongest in North America and Europe.","Now the industrial market is truly the lifeblood of ADI, where we developed and deployed our high-performance signal processing technology and system domain knowledge across our tens of thousands of industrial customers and their myriad applications to help create more intelligent, robust, connected and energy efficient products.","Revenue from automotive customers at 17% of sales, increased 13% sequentially, and 3% year-over-year, in a seasonally strong period for ADI's automotive business. Sales increased sequentially across all of our automotive focus applications in powertrain, infotainment and safety with particular strength in both advanced driver assistance systems and in powertrain applications, as car manufacturers respond to consumer demand and pending government mandates that help make vehicles safer and more fuel efficient.","The consumer end market, at 13% of sales, grew 15% sequentially and 40% year-over-year, marking the second straight quarter of year-over-year revenue increases in consumer for ADI. Prosumer audio-video was stable both sequentially and year-over-year with portable applications driving our consumer growth this quarter.","Our consumer strategy remains the same. We plan applications where our high-performance technology allows us to solve our customers' toughest challenges and where we can make a meaningful difference to the user experience.","Revenue from communication infrastructure customers at 22% of sales declined 10% sequentially following a 4% decline in the prior quarter. A weaker than planned wireless infrastructure market, particularly in North America and China drove the sequential revenue decrease.","We believe that these declines are temporary and that ADI will continue to benefit as 4G penetration rates increase from their current low levels.","Revenue from wireline customers represented about a third of our communications infrastructure revenues and was stable to the prior quarter.","So, now I would like to turn the call over to Dave for details of our financial performance in the quarter. With the exception of revenue and other expenses, Dave's comments on our second quarter 2015 P&L line items will exclude special items which in the aggregate totaled $26 million. When comparing our second quarter performance to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior quarter results and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their comparable GAAP measures are included on Schedule E in today's earnings release. So, with that, Dave, it's all yours.","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Ali, and good afternoon everyone. The second quarter of fiscal 2015 was another very good year for ADI and revenue totaled a record $821 million. Gross margin in second quarter of 66.5% was well within our model range of 65-68% and was up 90 basis points from the prior quarter as factory utilization rates increased to the mid-70%s from the prior quarter's mid-60%s level.","Inventory on a days' basis in the second quarter increased by one day to 127 days, and on a dollars basis, increased by $27 million, with approximately half the increase relating to the positioning of inventory for higher expected sales in the third quarter, and the balance of the increase relating to the timing of customer demand.","Deferred revenue on shipments to distributors increased by 5%. Most of the increase related to the Hittite product catalog, which was added to our distribution channel in the quarter. On a week's basis, inventory and distribution was lean at approximately seven weeks, down from the prior quarter's approximately eight weeks.","Operating expenses in the second quarter increased 2% sequentially, lagging well behind the 6% increase in revenue as we continue to gain more operating leverage in our model. As a percent of sales, operating expense in the second quarter declined 140 basis points compared to the prior quarter.","Operating profit before tax as a percent of sales increased 230 basis points from the prior quarter and increased 200 basis points from the same period a year ago, and at 33.7% of sales was well within our operating model range of 32% to 36%.","Other expense in the second quarter was approximately $4 million, and was lower than planned on a small gain on investments. We expect our net interest expense to be approximately $5 million per quarter for the remainder of 2015.","Our second quarter tax rate was approximately 15%, which we expect will be our non-GAAP rate for the remaining two quarters of the year.","Excluding special items, diluted earnings per share of $0.73 increased 16% over the prior quarter and 24% year-over-year, and was near the high end of our guidance range. At the end of the second quarter, our cash and short-term investment balance was $3.1 billion, with $760 million available domestically. We had approximately $870 million in debt outstanding which resulted in a net cash position of $2.2 billion.","During the second quarter, capital additions were $49 million, our capital expenditure plan in 2015 is to be between $160 million and $165 million.","We have a strong financial model that generates solid cash flows, and we are committed to returning cash to our shareholders. For the trailing 12 months we generated free cash flow of $830 million, or 27% of sales, and returned $800 million, or 96% of that free cash flow to shareholders, in the form of a dividend or share buybacks. In addition, our capital allocation strategy supports a regular dividend increase of a 5% to 10%, and last quarter we raised the dividend 8% from $0.37 to $0.40. Today our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.40 per outstanding share of common stock, and that will be paid on June 9, 2015 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on May 29.","So in summary, this was a very successful quarter for ADI, the strength and diversity of our business combined with our strong operating model generated strong cash flows and converted a 6% sequential revenue increase into a 16% earnings growth. So now I'll turn the call over to Vince for our outlook for the third quarter, which, with the exception of revenue expectations, are on a non-GAAP basis, and excludes special items that are outlined in today's call and release. Vince?","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everybody. As we've talked about in today's remarks, the second quarter was as you've seen a strong quarter for ADI on several fronts, and I'm very proud of our execution. As we start our third quarter, order rates continue to be stable across the industrial, automotive, and communications infrastructure markets, which leads us to plan for demand in these markets to be similar to the second quarter levels.","In the consumer end market, we have had good order growth and are planning for another quarter of sequential growth in that sector. In total we expect revenue to be in the range of $825 million to $865 million. The mid-point of this range represents a 3% sequential increase, and a 17% increase on a year-over-year basis.","Given the expected mix in our business, we're planning for utilization rates in our fabs to be slightly lower in the third quarter. As a result, we expect gross margins in the third quarter to be approximately 66%. We anticipate operating expenses to increase approximately 2% to 3%, a modest increase from the prior quarter, primarily the result of a full quarter of annual salary increases that went into effect in April. Based on these estimates and excluding special items, diluted earnings per share is anticipated to be in the range of $0.71 to $0.77 in the third quarter.","Beyond these near term events, our basic philosophy, and the cornerstone of our strategy remains the same: superior innovation drives superior business results. We possess the broadest product portfolio system and manufacturing capabilities and high-performance signal processing to solve our customers' toughest challenges at the intersection of the physical and the digital worlds.","Our product development strategy is to identify the fundamental challenges that our customers are facing in our target-application areas, and leverage our solutions across as diverse a set of opportunities as possible. This strategy is evident in the breadth of our product portfolio and the diversity of our markets, applications and customers, where we harness the strength of our portfolio and where barriers to entry are high and where our innovation can be sustained.","Today, customers are choosing their long-term partners very carefully, and our engagements with them are occurring earlier and earlier in their innovation cycles. And our collaborations are becoming longer term in nature. There is no limit to the level of innovation that they are demanding from ADI, and we're responding by continuing to push the boundaries on technologies, products and systems engineering. An example of this approach in action is our acquisition of Hittite, where we are building an RF and microwave signal processing portfolio that makes ADI even more relevant to our customers, and helps them solve their ever-increasing design challenges.","Our brand remains stronger than ever, and our employees are engaged and passionate about our customer's success, all of which provides us a terrific platform upon which to continue building our strong franchise. Our drive for innovation and engineering excellence, and our deep systems and applications domain knowhow enable ADI to stay ahead of what's possible. We are focusing on the right markets and products that will drive sustainable and profitable growth and superior shareholder returns well into the future, and I firmly believe that our best is yet to come.","Ali Husain - Director-Investor Relations","Great. Thank you, Vince. So, everyone, during today's Q&A session, please limit yourself to one question. We're going to run today's call until 6:00, so after you ask your primary question, please re-queue if you'd like to ask a second question. The reason we do this \u2013 we run our call in this format is that everybody gets a chance to ask at least one question. So with that, operator, let's start our Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from David Wong with Wells Fargo.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks very much. You were talking about how your gross margin will drop a bit because of loading, although, of course, it's difficult to forecast what revenues are going to do going forward. Do you expect to be able to raise your fab loadings going forward after this current quarter? Do you expect your inventory to where you want it to be at the end of this quarter?","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","I wouldn't say that I anticipate inventory to be where we want it to be. But a lot of why our inventory is where it is, is not related to running the fabs hotter than expected. It really is about, in fact most of it is actually wafers we outsource externally. So I think a large part of our kind of utilization is driven off of the industrial business. And depending on how that business goes, that would somewhat determine how our loadings go. But we're obviously expecting that business to do well over time. And we anticipate that our fabs will continue to increase over time, the utilization levels. So I think that would be over time a positive impact to the gross margins.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great, thanks.","Ali Husain - Director-Investor Relations","Yeah, David, this is Ali here. I would just add that look at only the third quarter for us, we tend to do some retooling anyways in our fabs, so it tends to be a slower quarter on the utilization side as a result of that. So I think it's kind of a seasonal thing. And the other thing I'd add is on the gross margin line: we're running our business to run and operate at gross margin model ranges of 65% to 68%, and so that's still the case and that will still continue to be the case going forward. So, thanks for your question, David. And we'll get to our next question, operator.","Operator","This question comes from Chris Danely with Citigroup.","Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, thanks, guys. I guess just as a related question, can you give us your expectations for the relative growth rates of the end markets I guess for the rest of the calendar year? And then if you would maybe talk about your expectations for relative growth rates longer term, say for the next one to three years from the end markets.","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Well, I think it's safe to say, given that the third and fourth quarter are usually good quarters for consumer, that as we sit today with the limited visibility that we always have in the semiconductor space, that we would expect the consumer business to do quite well for the latter half of this year. I think industrial generally sees, on a half year to half year basis generally starts to flatten out for the second half of the year. That's generally true of the automotive space as well. And in the communications business, I would say is a wild card. We do expect this to be a temporary perturbation that we're experiencing right now in the communications market, and that the long-term trends to build out infrastructure around the world still exists, and the need for more data or higher data rates still exists.","So I think it's matter of when on the communications business, but that should come back at some point, and may indeed come back in the fourth quarter. Longer-term, we hope all of the businesses grow quite well over the next three years. And I think as we look at the pipelines in each one of our businesses, and Vince and I just reviewed it a few weeks ago with the team, we're excited about every one of our end markets and the things that are getting done, the incredible innovation that's going on together with our customers. And so we expect all of them to do quite well.","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think as well, Chris, we've put a number out there. We've said that our expectation is that we should be able to grow this business and aggregate it two to three times global GDP, and we stick by that. My sense is if the markets behave, we'll be on the higher end of that.","Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks, guys.","Ali Husain - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks Chris, and we'll get to our next question, operator.","Operator","This question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Dave, you've always said that mix of business doesn't have a significant impact on the gross margin line, but if you look at the strength in the consumer going into the July quarter, and the incremental gross margin in that quarter being relatively weak, I think I understand the issue with utilization. But can you remind us again how consumer influences gross margin longer-term, and I guess, given where it is today as a percent of revenue, how big would you want consumer to be before it got sort of too big?","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Well, on the gross margin front, I think what we're talking about with our guidance is we'd be 50 basis points off the second quarter gross margin level and roughly probably half of that's impacting us from utilization and probably half of that is mix, and so it's again, relatively modest impact that we get off the consumer business in terms of mix. We actually will take all comers in terms of good profitable innovative type revenue streams. So we don't \u2013 we're not going to arrest any market that's going to do well for us and drive revenue growth and, more importantly, earnings growth.","I think that, though, just based on the way we're investing our R&D, which has been very balanced across all of those end markets I think you'd expect that we'll have a very balanced growth trajectory for all of the businesses, and thus you probably won't see significant differences in percentages by end market over time.","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","To add a little more color to what Dave has just said, we're leveraging a platform of technology for the portable space in particular that is based upon our many, many years of developing precision signal processing technologies for many different types of applications within portable devices. So, as always, we're solving the toughest problems that our customers can throw at us, and we're looking for sustainable innovation. We're looking for sockets where we can sustain a position for generations to come. So that approach will give us the kinds of ASP's and the kinds of margins that we find attractive to our business overall.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks, guys, that's helpful.","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","And this next question comes from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the question guys. I wanted to focus a little bit on a follow-up to the points that were just being made. In the consumer business, there have been some tear-down evidence of a marquee design win for your product. Can you talk about your ability to drive your technology across a broader base of both customers and applications?","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, as I've just said, we're leveraging technology that is primarily precision centric. That we, for example, if you look at our philosophy in general, how we do the innovation inside the company, we generate, very often break-through process technologies, break-through circuits, break-through products from which we build platforms, and ultimately those platforms are purposed into industrial automation, into battery management in cars, into portable devices in consumer. So it's very much a platform play, and where we can leverage the quality and the strength of our technology, and solve really difficult problems in those areas, we build products very often that sometimes go into a catalog, and sometimes are purposed for those individual applications.","So that's the philosophy, and our technologies as you know, we've got more than 20,000 product SKUs in the catalog of ADI. We've got about 100,000 customers across many, many different applications. So that's been the approach in the past, it's served us very, very well and I believe that approach will serve us very well in the future.","Ali Husain - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Craig. And let's get to our next question, operator.","Operator","And your next question is from Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. I just actually wanted to follow up on that. As you look at the consumer space, you have been able to put up a good barrier from competition in industrial type markets. When you look at consumer, you are leveraging that precision signal expertise, do you think you can enjoy similar barriers to entry, and if you could kind of highlight the competitive landscape in portable applications?","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, the portable landscape itself has a lot of different modalities within. There's many different sensor types, many, many different types of media. So, as I said, we have very much picked out areas of the portable space where the problems that are really important to our customers to solve, to develop a really high-quality user experience, those problems are very, very tough, and so we are pushing our technology right to the edge. We're living at the edge of the technology. And we're enabling certain features to be provided in these systems. That's where we like to play as a company, whether it's industrial, automotive, consumer, communications infrastructure, and we apply that everywhere we go. That's the philosophy of the company. We like solving tough problems at the intersection of the physical world and the world of digital or virtual.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks.","Ali Husain - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Blayne. Get to our next question, operator.","Operator","And this next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Just a question on the cash return. You guys have done a great job over time doing that, and I think you've laid out clear targets. When we boil it down between the buybacks and the dividends, I think you've said in the past you have roughly a third of your free cash flow generation is onshore, and by that math, it looks like your dividend is actually more than your onshore. I know you have a ton offshore, but just talk about how you balance that with the statement you made earlier in the call about increasing your dividend each year.","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I mean, well, we obviously have a U.S. entity that generates cash flow, and so some of the dividend is supported by how much of the U.S. cash flow is generated. Beyond that, as you've probably noticed, we have added leverage at times. I think we have a couple of bonds now outstanding to bulk up the cash reserves of the U.S. entity, and we utilize that cash as well to fund the dividend and buyback, and of course offsetting that, the international entity accumulates cash, so net-net, we have a pretty good balance sheet, pretty conservative balance sheet, but we do use leverage on the U.S. balance sheet in order for us to fund the buybacks and dividends to create the share \u2013 or cash return that the shareholders want.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","And this next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel.","Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes, thank you. So, I just had a question on your guidance, and I do recognize that most of your end markets are sort of moving into flattish seasonality, but just based on conversations you're having with customers, especially those in the industrial space, I mean, does it feel like they are upbeat, or are they being guarded, cautious? Just trying to understand directionally what your customers are feeling after what was a fairly turbulent March quarter.","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think there's kind of two sides of the conversation with industrial customers: one is the long term, and how we're working together to generate great innovation in industrial instrumentation and so on and so forth. We've had a very, very good industry quarter in the quarter just gone. Sequentially it was strong. It was up considerably year-over-year, and I think it's really going to be a question of how well the macro environment behaves. So, my sense is it's stable. We see it in the order rates and we hear it in conversations with our industrial customers as well.","Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","This question comes from William Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thank you for taking my questions. I'd like to ask a bit about the automotive end market. You mentioned that there were some pending government mandates in autos. Is that Euro 6 or is it something in the U.S.? Any color would be helpful. Thank you.","Ali Husain - Director-Investor Relations","Hey, Will, it's Ali here. So, yeah, I think specifically what I was mentioning in the prepared remarks is certainly around Euro 6. It's also around the CAFE standards in the U.S. that are coming online. But I think I did mention government mandates, but I think it's above and beyond that, right. So, there's NCAP standards, there's five-star ratings, and I think a lot of the car manufactures are really angling to hit those ratings, get those various certifications, because I think it really helps them to differentiate their products with the end consumer.","I think those are the kinds of things that are coming online. And, interestingly, customers are also adding the various options, right? So, something may be part of a particular government mandate, be part of a particular NCAP program, but customers are actually now, particularly in the premium vehicles, are opting for the various functionalities, and so I think that's also been really good in driving our business.","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","To add a little more color there to what Ali has just said. So obviously car companies, it's important for them to comply with government regulations, but car companies are in a massive transformation mode. I mean, they're all trying to become IT centric, because that's how they're really building value into the products that they're developing and delivering. And I think there's many, many years yet of head room to innovate in cars as the OEMs themselves are trying to automate and electrify everything they can inside the car. So I think that's more the driver of innovation than regulation.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And this question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Vinayak Rao - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, this is Vinayak calling for Craig. I had a follow-up on automotive, like solid sequential growth this quarter. And when you look at the portfolio, you're playing in the right applications. When I look at the growth on a year-over-year basis, the growth has kind of slowed down to the low single-digit range from high single digits, double digits in the prior quarter. How should we think about growth like in the intermediate to longer term in automotive?","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, so, look, we've had a very, very strong growth pattern in automotive over last several years. We've been growing at a compounded growth rate of around 20% over the last five years, and when I talked earlier on about the aggregate expectation for growth for ADI, I talked about two to three times global GDP as being kind of a good benchmark. And my expectation in the years ahead is that given where we are now that the higher end of that growth expectation is what automotive will deliver for ADI. So I think that's how to think about it.","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","This question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.","C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","Hey, good afternoon, thank you for taking my question. I guess my question's on the consumer side. Great job in terms of that business finally triumphing and some interesting wins that you've alluded to in the past. Curious what kind of growth we could see for that business here in calendar 2015? And based on that kind of growth, what kind of impact would that be, all things equal, in terms of impact to gross margins? Thank you.","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Well, as I mentioned on the gross margin front, most of these businesses are pretty close to the corporate average. So within 20 basis points, 30 basis points. It's not much different. I think we'll have to defer until next quarter to really give you I think a good sense of the full year of growth rate of consumer. We're just not ready to provide complete guidance out through the year on any of our businesses, because we just don't have that visibility. I think it's safe to say, though, that as we sit today, normally consumer has a seasonally strong fourth quarter, and that's kind of how we're building the internal plans at this point. But we'll wait until the third quarter is behind us. We'll give you some better clarity around the fourth quarter and that'll give you a sense for the full year growth rates.","C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","Thank you.","Operator","This question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had a question on the shorter-term outlook here. So, obviously, very strong, consumer was up 15% this quarter, you seem to be guiding it up more than 20% next quarter. Flat in the rest of the other businesses. You're talking about core industrial and auto again usually seasonally weaker in the second half. Comms is a wild card. You're taking their internal utilizations down, which to me suggest maybe a little bit more caution potentially in those core businesses.","I guess, do you think it's possible \u2013 can we actually see growth in the second half outside of consumer, for the rest of your businesses? And would you say your outlook for the second half in industrial and auto today is maybe better, worse, or the same versus where it was three months ago?","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Well, I mean, even if industrial stayed relatively flat through the rest of the year, they'd be up, because the first quarter was a pretty down quarter for industrial as it usually is. So I guess the answer to your first question is yeah. I mean, I think there is certainly an expectation, or could be an expectation that we could see growth second half over first half of the core businesses. What was the second part of the question, Stacy?","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I'm sorry. Just, would you classify your sort of industrial and auto kind of core outlook into the second half today better, worse, or the same as where it was three months ago?","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I think we generally are in the same range that we expected coming into the year. This is \u2013 obviously there's all these crazy macro indicators, some of which contradict other macro indicators. The best we can do is look at our order flow. And I think recently the order flow has been pretty stable. We did have maybe a weaker February partly due to the Lunar New Year, I suspect. But outside of that those businesses have been pretty stable all the way up until today. So, of course, we don't know how things will \u2013 with 100% confidence how things will look like going forward, but just based on the customer input, what we've heard from our distributor partners, and what we're seeing in terms of the order levels, I think it's a pretty stable environment.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you.","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Sure.","Operator","And this question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura Securities","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Yes, thank you. Vince, given the deployments, the LTE deployments, that we've seen already some of your competitors are a little bit more guarded about their communications businesses recovering over the next year, and I'd be curious why you're more optimistic? Thank you.","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, well, look we're at very, very early stages of 4G build-out across the globe. The penetration rates are still very, very modest. There's a long, long way to go. We've obviously had the short-term wobble, but that is short-term. I mean it's really \u2013 it's centered around a couple of carriers, behavior of a couple of carriers that had a strong ripple effect throughout the entire market.","So I think the long-term prognosis in terms of the build out of hardware infrastructure to be able to deal with the bandwidth, with the data capacity requirements, there's no question about that. I think also we talked on the last call about the emergence of small cells, and we are very, very well positioned in the small cell sector that will compliment the strength that we have in the macro area, so we've a stronger product portfolio than ever, we're very, very well positioned with all of the OEMs across the globe. So I believe the short-term has really been, as I said, a behavior issue with a couple of carriers, but I think in the medium and long terms this is a great space to be. And I think we're going to see a recovery here sooner than later.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","This question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.","Unknown Speaker","Hi, thanks for taking the question. This is Shankar on behalf of Vivek. I just want to \u2013 I have a question regarding Hittite and its contribution for this quarter related to the prior quarter. And can you talk about how the split has changed between the communication and the industrial? My understanding is 40% is in industrial and 60% is in communication.","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Okay. Okay, let me take the first one. The revenue growth sequentially of the Hittite business was basically the same as the total company's. So it performed exactly as expected, and we're very pleased on how they did on a top-line basis. Also we were expecting for 2015, I think when we originally talked about the Hittite acquisition that it would be kind of in the high single digits in terms of accretion. And I probably updated this last quarter, but I would just tell you that it looks more like it's in the 10% ZIP code this year, and we feel really good about Hittite's accretion for next year, which is likely to be in kind of the mid-teens. So from that perspective it's going quite well.","The business had \u2013 I think that's probably fair to say \u2013 had a bit more industrial as a percent of revenue versus communications. And obviously communications wobbled for us, it wobbled a bit for Hittite, the Hittite portion of the business as well, not surprisingly. But one of the areas of the industrial space that did particularly well for us this quarter was the defense business, and that is where Hittite had very good exposure. And so they definitely knocked the cover off of the ball in that category within the industrial space, and, so, it did quite well.","Unknown Speaker","Thank you.","Operator","This question comes from Steve Smigie with Raymond James.","J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great, thanks. Thanks, guys. I just wanted to follow up a little bit on the Hittite accretion question. Dave, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what we should think about OpEx over the next six quarters, if your OpEx grows something maybe half the growth of revenue, does that suggest we should model something even less growth on OpEx. Is that the right way to think about it?","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Well, I think for the most part, most of the OpEx benefits of the Hittite acquisition are kind of in. What synergies we got from an operating expense standpoint, I think pretty much were captured by the time the first quarter ended. There might be a little bit, but it's not enough to move the needle for the total company in terms of OpEx. Where the next wave of synergies comes from with Hittite is in the cost of manufacturing, and that's as we transition their test operations from Chelmsford to the Philippines. And so really where you see the next wave of benefit is on the gross margin line and not the operating expense line.","So personally I think your rule of thumb, roughly, OpEx growing at roughly half of the rate of revenue over time probably makes a lot of sense. Certainly there'll be quarters where that doesn't necessarily happen, and there will be quarters where we do a little bit better than that, as we did this quarter, but over the course of several years, I think that that's a pretty good rule of thumb.","J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up. As I think about industrial, it seems like medical could potentially become a bigger area. You guys talked about some very interesting medical solutions at Analyst Day. Does medical become 5% of revenue sometime in the next year or two, or is it more \u2013 it will still take ten years to get that, to be a big percentage of revenue?","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Well, I'd say we're not \u2013 we wouldn't break it out for 5% revenue. So it's a healthy business today. Where we might break it out as separate category \u2013 thank you. Where we might break it out as a separate category is when it got closer to the kind of 10% category. That would be kind of the reason to bring it out. But it's actually a pretty meaningful part of the revenue particularly of industrial.","J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Great.","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think, just to add a little more color there. It's a space with tremendous potential. It's the one area of our business where technology in many, many ways, IT is going to be the solution to many of the problems to be able to produce the kind of diagnostics that are important for healthcare, even for wellness and healthcare management. And to solve the cost problems that are just really crucifying that industry.","So it's very, very important to the overall delivery of healthcare from a performance and cost standpoint. It's a modest investment for ADI, but we're very excited about many of the things we're doing in delivering photonics solutions, for example, in the area of CT and MRI scanners. So big iron is an important part of what we're doing. We've built some really enabling technologies in digital X-ray that are starting to ramp up into decent sized revenues, and of course there's the vital signs monitoring for kind of consumer plus applications and moving into clinical grade healthcare over the coming years.","So there are several areas with a very modest R&D spend that is allowing us to create tremendous leverage again off the technology platform that we've developed. So it has all of the attributes that we look for in terms of hard to solve problems, multiple generations of sustainability. Good ASP and margins, so I think it's a terrific space. And it's one of these spaces where you really have to take a long-term view to playing in. Because things don't happen overnight, but I think we're very well positioned and excited about the future there.","J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","This question comes from Gabriel Ho with BMO.","Gabriel Ho - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi this is Gabriel calling in for Ambrish. Thanks for taking our question I have a follow-up on the communications end market, I think you mentioned during the Q&A session you are well-positioned in small cells, and I think also you mentioned before that you see 4G has a higher, 20% to 30% higher opportunity than 3G. So how should we think about the opportunity in the small cells as it ramp as opposed to 4G and 3G?","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, it's very hard to say. I mean, there's definitely \u2013 the introduction of these small cells \u2013 by the way, when we talk about small cells, I should make it clear, we are not talking about femtocells. We are talking about high-performance infrastructure-related small cells. So I want to make that clear. The introduction of those small cells, we've said for several quarters now, we believe that the second half of this year we'll see the introduction in a meaningful way of these products, and that indeed now is beginning to happen. So I think second half of 2015 is when we'll see a meaningful introduction of those products.","So, there's no precedent in terms of ASP increase for those products over the prior year, there really wasn't a prior, it's all been macrocell to date. But what we have seen, of course, and macro is an increase of 20% to 30% in bill of materials value to ADI based on the extension of our portfolio, and the integration of functions into our solutions there.","Ali Husain - Director-Investor Relations","Gabriel, this is Ali. I would just point out. I think the long term trends of this market are terrific. I mean, you look at 7.1 billion subscribers out there, 4.5 billion are still on 2G. North America, barring the kind of the short-term perturbation this quarter, mobile data in North America is growing 50% year-over-year, penetration rates here are set to move higher over the next few years, and China is on this multi-year 4G FDTD build. So I think we're in the infancy here. And I think the points that Vince made are absolutely correct. Because you have the macro coming in. You have the small cell layering in on top of that I think it's going to be a great market for ADI for many, many years to come. Thanks, Gabriel. We'll move on to our next question.","Operator","This next question comes from Ian Ing with MKM Partners.","Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC","Yes, thanks. Could you talk about your ability to handle volume ramps in portables? This is something you've done in the past, but not more recently? So, would you say you've been audited pretty well on manufacturing capabilities to fulfill requested lead times? Thanks.","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, we have one of the best manufacturing organizations in the world of semiconductors. We have a manufacturing organization that's been consistently irrespective of volume or market, we've been able to deliver greater than 95% of our products within six week lead times, no matter what the perturbations in markets, with sub-one-part per million quality level.","So we're very, very agile in terms of our manufacturing capability. In the case of the consumer area, we're leveraging external foundries, and external \u2013 backend manufacturing and test capabilities. So, as I said, our supply chain is second to none in the industry, very agile, and we have a lot of experience, by the way, of playing in these consumer markets over many, many years. So, we're very, very much up to the challenge and pleased with where we are.","Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC","Great. Thanks, Vince.","Operator","This question comes from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.","James Vincent Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. I appreciate it. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of insight in terms of how you're going think about the tradeoff between revenue growth and gross margins as you ramp some of your big consumer opportunities. Do you think you'll prioritize the revenue growth or would you prioritize kind of holding the line at a certain level on gross margins as you face the inevitable cost pressures in the second and third generation of these devices that the big customer kind of drives?","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","I think we feel pretty confident that we can stay within the range of our gross margin target, which is 65% to 68%. But ultimately, we're about growing earnings at 8% to 15%. And so we certainly want to be on the higher end of that range if we can. And that's number one priority.","What Vince I think said in the prepared remarks, I think he said \u2013 sprinkled through his answers on questions today, has been that we're very focused on innovation, and when you're focused on innovation, you don't necessarily see the competitive pressures that people see in every market that we participate in, because, if you come out with commodity parts in any of these markets we're in, you're going to find a lot of price pressure.","What we try to do is stay on the innovation curve, ahead of the innovation curve, we get paid for that. We have superior \u2013 what we believe is superior R&D thrown at these problems. And so I feel pretty confident that you're not going to see us wobble away from on the gross margins.","James Vincent Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Very helpful. Thank you. Good luck.","Ali Husain - Director-Investor Relations","Sure.","Operator","And this question comes from Joe Werner with Peter Cannell & Company.","Joseph Blair Werner - Peter B. Cannell & Co., Inc.","Thank you very much for taking my question. I guess I'm turning to the balance sheet, and we all know we have interest rates at the lowest level in our lifetime, yet I see that we have an exorbitant amount of cash at this time. At a time when many companies are borrowing money, we have cash that is earning very little return for our shareholders. So I wonder is there any thought being given to the idea of maybe borrowing a couple billion dollars instead of having a couple billion dollars on the balance sheet?","Maybe \u2013 I remember when it wasn't long ago when the company had about 400 million shares outstanding, today it's close to the \u2013 got down to 300 million shares, now it's been creeping upwards to, well, I see 312 million on a basic number, but 317 million on a fully diluted number. By my calculation it could be down to about 250 million if we took on about $2 billion of debt and it swung the balance sheet. In about $4 billion, we could reduce our share count by about 20%, increase our earnings by about 20%. What type of response would the board have to that type of thinking?","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Well, I appreciate the question, Joe. Obviously we're constantly looking at trying to optimize the balance sheet. Obviously part of the challenge is the fact that a majority of that cash is offshore, and isn't easily accessible, although it can be accessed. And we have to balance, I guess, three priorities. One is, I guess, a two-part priority which is to return cash to shareholders, focus first and foremost on the dividend, but also on opportunistic buybacks. And if you look at our cash balance probably back, I don't know exactly when that was, 2005 or something, I think we have come down quite a bit in terms of cash balances.","The other priority is obviously to augment what we do organically in terms of development, with some inorganic, call it, development, Hittite being a perfect example. So at one point, we were at, I don't know, a year and a half ago, we were probably at $5 billion of cash, and we brought that down to $3 billion. It didn't necessarily reduce the share count, but I think, dramatically improved the earnings leverage within the company by adding incredible technology, very synergistic with what we're doing and also accretive right out of the gate.","So, that's the kind of balancing act that we have as we kind of manage the capital structure. But I think as we look over the long term our goal is not to be accumulating tons of cash. It is to be very judicious, but very shareholder friendly in terms of returning cash, and also to augment that with M&A to continually drive the earnings growth. And so I don't think that we're just sitting here trying to collect the relatively small amount of interest income we can get on this cash balance. That's certainly not our goal. So we hear what you're saying. It's definitely something we're paying a lot of attention to internally. It's definitely something that the Board pays a lot of attention to when we meet with them. And I think overtime you'll be quite happy with the end result of where we're headed.","Joseph Blair Werner - Peter B. Cannell & Co., Inc.","Thank you very much.","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Sure, thank you.","Operator","And this question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah, guys, thanks for letting me ask a follow up. Dave, just relative to that consumer mix, I think there have been a lot of questions about the gross margin impact, I'd be kind of curious relative to the op-margin impact. How do we think about kind of the OpEx around this consumer opportunities that tend to be fairly significant unit-volume opportunities where you're kind of leveraging core IP that you've developed in other areas?","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I mean, I think we'll see in the future as to how the consumer business grows and how fast that can grow, but I think it's safe to assume that if consumer is growing at a reasonable clip, that we'll get very good leverage on that and very good fall through to the bottom line. And that will be accretive to our operating margins number. There's no question that that's the model.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And then Dave if I can sneak a quick one in, on the step-up of $5 million on deferred because of Hittite, is that now the full impact of Hittite? Or should we expect to see more in the July quarter going forward?","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","No, I think that we got all of the inventory generally in the places we want with distribution or with our distributor partners with regards to Hittite products, so I think we're going to see the deferred margin number kind of ebb and flow with how the distributors themselves are managing their inventory and how their point of sales are going.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Perfect.

Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, I just had a follow up on your consumer\/medical business. I mean, right now your medical revenue is embedded in industrial, but if you look some of your consumer opportunities there seem to be like a convergence between medical and consumer. So I'm just wondering as we sort of go down the road the next couple of years, how are you going to be reporting this to the Street, given the convergence that is currently happening?","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, just to be clear, we internally look at the healthcare business in total. And that's how it's managed internally, which is the way Vince was describing it. But when a product is targeted to a consumer customer, we already classify it as a consumer product, and so it is in the consumer category today.","Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, so even though eventually it's healthcare-related, if it sold in the hospital, it's medical, if it's sold to consumer, it's consumer?","David A.

Earlier, you provided some good color around the distribution channel and inventories, and also orders. I was wondering about the other half of sales to your direct customers, and in particular can you remind us what products or end markets are mainly represented in your direct sales? And also any color on order trends, as well as inventory levels at direct customers. That would be great.","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Well, we have all, or we have OEM customers in all of our end markets. I would say that a disproportionate amount of our distributor revenue is sold into the industrial market, and a disproportionate of our OEM revenue is sold into the consumer communications and auto markets.

Similar to the...?","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, yeah, sure. So I think we probably saw the weakest month in February, but as I said, I think that was pretty much as expected given the Lunar New Year. It kind of popped back up in March, it was a little bit better in April, and it's been pretty stable through at least May 19.

Talking about distribution inventory, so they came down pretty hard. Have you, first of all, was that primarily due to the European customers just not wanting to hold inventory? And have you seen them more willing to take on inventory now that currency has hopefully stabilized a bit? And incremental gross margins, should we still kind of think of 80% as the correct drop through? And can you guys talk about the puts and takes, especially as Hittite starts moving their products internally? Thanks a lot.","David A. Zinsner - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, so I wouldn't read too much into the fact that inventory came down this quarter, because I think that generally happens this quarter. It's usually a very strong POS quarter, or ship-out quarter for distributors. And so we generally do see inventory roll off a little bit. I don't think it had anything to do really with currency. And it wasn't specific to any one geography, it was pretty much they all came down pretty much at the same rate.","On the gross margin front, the fall through, it generally is 80% obviously. If you do the math for the third quarter, that wouldn't be the case, mainly because we're bringing utilization down a little bit in the mix impacts. But I think generally, that's rule of thumb that's probably in the range of what we would expect gross margin to follow through as long as the growth rate is pretty balanced across all of the end markets. And so, the products manufactured internally, you know, get as much of a lift as the ones that are manufactured externally.","Deepon Nag - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great, thanks a lot.","David A.

Note that the information we\u2019re about to discuss, including our objectives and outlook, includes forward-looking statements.","Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call and we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.","Today\u2019s commentary about ADI\u2019s third quarter financial results will include non-GAAP financial measures when comparing our third quarter results to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from the prior quarter and year-over-year results.","Available reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today\u2019s earnings release and in our web schedules, which we\u2019ve posted under the quarterly results section at investor.analog.com. Our web schedules also include a historical view of what the combined ADI and Linear Tech would have look like by end markets, by quarter for the last three years.","And lastly, please note that ADI\u2019s first quarter of fiscal 2018 will be a 14-week quarter. So you should adjust your models for an additional week of revenue and additional week of expenses for that quarter.","And so with that, I'll turn it over to ADI\u2019s CEO, Vincent Roche. Vince\u2019s comments are on a non-GAAP basis and excludes special items outlined in today\u2019s release. So with that Vince, it\u2019s all yours.","Vincent Roche","Thanks very much Ali, and good morning, everyone. Well, this was another very successful quarter for ADI. And I'm pleased to share our results with you this morning. Not only were our third quarter financial results stellar, we\u2019re also making excellent progress in integrating Linear Tech from an organization and a synergy capture perspective.","So let's start with our financial results for the third quarter. Total revenue was above the high-end of guidance at $1.46 billion, primarily on broad-based strength in the highly diverse industrial market. And this strong revenue growth coupled with disciplined operational execution delivered gross margins of 70.5% and operating margins of 40.5%.","Importantly, the combined company has generated $1.9 billion of adjusted free cash flow over the past 12 months with associated margins of 34%, which are among the highest in the S&P 500.","Now I\u2019d like to give you some details on our performance by end market during the quarter. The industrial market represented 49% of sales and demand across all industrial sectors and regions was strong. ADI\u2019s industrial business is now nearing at $3 billion annual run rate and we see numerous opportunities to drive additional dollar content and revenue growth as customers increasingly rely on ADI to make their applications more intelligent, more connected and more efficient.","For example, in factory automation, our software configurable I\/O solution is making the factory floor more flexible and configurable. The value creation opportunity is highly compelling. Customers have the potential to save more than $2 million for typical installation and factory downtime during line changeovers can be reduced by more than eight weeks.","As the factory floor further automates ADI\u2019s opportunity in the area of robotics doubles with the addition of sensing, signal processing, power delivery and connectivity, a new application such as in collaborative robotics expand our available market by around $300 million over the next five years.","Switching now to automotive. This market represented 16% of revenues and increased over the prior year. ADI\u2019s dollar content opportunity in a vehicle today is approximately $250. But we believe we can more than double this by 2025 from emerging mega trends such as autonomous driving and the electrification of the powertrain.","For autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles, ADI\u2019s 77 gigahertz radar solution delivers the highest levels of resolution and sensitivity, increasing spatial accuracy by a factor of 8 while making the radar three times smaller.","In addition, the desire to make cars more energy efficient is driving the electrification of the vehicle powertrain. Here ADI\u2019s battery management products are three times more accurate than computing solutions enabling more miles per battery charge. The communications infrastructure market totaled 18% of sales in the third quarter; by application area sequential strength in wireline offset a slower wireless sector.","ADI\u2019s portfolio of RF and Microwave, and High-Speed Signal Processing coupled with Power is unmatched in breadth and depth with products that span the entire frequency spectrum to 100 gigahertz and beyond. For example, our software-defined radio transceivers dramatically simplified the base station radio card through aggressive integration and software configuration. This solution enables higher channel density and reduces our customer's time to market.","Today, ADI solutions are pervasive in 5G field trials and we are well-positioned to benefit from the wave of 5G deployments that we believe will begin in 2019. The consumer market represented 17% of sales in the third quarter, increasing both sequentially and year-over-year across prosumer and portable consumer applications.","We've built a strong consumer franchise that focuses on solving our customer's toughest engineering challenges, providing them with a high level of differentiation and in turn driving very strong profitability and free cash flow for ADI. So in summary, this was an excellent quarter and we believe that we are better positioned than ever to drive long-term profitable growth and free cash flow.","So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ali for details of our financial performance in the quarter.","Ali Husain","Okay. Thanks, Vince and good morning, again everyone. Before we move to the quarterly results, please note that with the exception of non-operating expense, my comments on the P&L line items, excludes special items, outlined in today's release and our web schedules can be found on the IR page.","Okay. So as Vince just outlined, this was another really solid quarter for ADI with all line items of the P&L exceeding the high-end of our guidance range on very strong business performance and operational execution. So total revenue increased to $1.46 billion with a $393 million contribution from Linear Technology.","ADI\u2019s standalone revenue increased 6% sequentially and 23% over the prior year. And this reflected strong and broad-based demand particularly in the industrial market. Gross margins in the third quarter were 70.5% above our guidance range, primarily on a higher industrial revenue mix and cost synergy capture.","Dollars of inventory increased $40 million sequentially as we ramped production to match strong demand, but on a day\u2019s basis, inventory was stable at around 106 days. Deferred revenue for shipments into distribution increased 11% sequentially and weeks of inventory in distribution were again at seven weeks, which has been very consistent over many, many quarters now.","Operating expenses in the third quarter were $437 million or 30% of revenue. And as a result, operating margins expanded to 40.5%, which was above the high-end of guidance. Non-operating expense in the third quarter was $68 million, reflecting a full quarter of interest expense with the financing related to the Linear Tech acquisition in place. Our expectation is for non-operating expense to be approximately $65 million both in the fourth quarter of 2017 and in the 14-week first quarter of 2018, and to decrease to $55 million to $60 million per quarter for the remainder of fiscal 2018.","Our third quarter non-GAAP tax rate was 10.8%. We expect our fourth quarter non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 10% and for it to be approximately 15% in 2018. Diluted share count increased to 371 million shares in the third quarter, primarily due to the equity consideration relating to the acquisition. Excluding special items, diluted earnings per share in the third quarter of 2017 was $1.26 that was $0.05 above the high-end of guidance.","During the quarter, we completed a restructuring of our legal entities related to the Linear Tech acquisition. This resulted in a one-time cash payment of $750 million. Excluding this item, ADI generated $322 million of adjusted free cash flow in the quarter and $1.9 billion for the combined company on a trailing 12-month basis.","During the quarter, we paid down $600 million of the debt associated with the Linear Tech acquisition, which helped reduce our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio up to 2.9 times. We expect to pay down our debt at a rate of approximately $1 billion per year and are planning to achieve a two times net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio by the first half of fiscal 2019. Once we achieved this leverage ratio, we plan to reinstitute or reinstate our share buyback program and target an overall cash return to shareholders of 80% to 100% after debt service.","So moving on to fixed asset additions, which in the third quarter were $64 million for the combined company and are planned to be approximately $200 million for fiscal 2017. And this is probably a good opportunity to also point out that our model is for CapEx to run at approximately 4% of revenue on an ongoing basis.","During the quarter, we also paid $166 million in dividends and earlier this week, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.45 for outstanding share of common stock, payable on September 19 to shareholders of record at the close of business on September 8, and that dividend payment now represents $1.80 per share annualized dividend payment.","Okay. So with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Vince for outlook for the fourth quarter of 2017, which excludes special items outlined in today\u2019s release.","Vincent Roche","Thanks, Ali. After a strong third quarter, we are planning for revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 to be in the range of $1.45 billion to $1.55 billion. By end market, we\u2019re planning for the industrial and communications infrastructure sectors to be approximately flat sequentially and for the automotive and consumer markets to grow from their third quarter levels.","Gross margins are expected to remain stable at approximately 70.5% as cost synergies offset the anticipated mix of revenue. Operating expenses are estimated to be down 3% to flat sequentially. At the midpoint of this guidance, these inputs translates into an operating expense ratio of approximately 29% and operating margins of approximately 42% in the fourth quarter. Based on these estimates and excluding special items, diluted earnings per share are planned to be in the range of a $1.29 to $1.43.","As you likely saw as well, we recently announced our new CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah, who will be joining us at the end of September. I am really looking forward to Prashanth\u2019s arrivals and getting the benefit of his strategic insight and strong operational focus as we continue our long-term customer and shareholder value creation journey. We believe that our organization portfolio and customer relationships have never been in better shape and our technology never more essential to an ever more connected and intelligent world.","Our operating model calls for some of the highest margins in our industry and indeed in the S&P 500. Operating margins that are in the range of 39% to 45% and free cash flow margins in the range of 34% to 42%, and we are only getting started.","So with that, we\u2019ll take your questions.","Ali Husain","Okay. Thanks Vince. So let's get to our Q&A session. Please limit yourself to one question. After our initial response, we will give you an opportunity for a follow-up question. So operator, can we have our first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel.","Tore Svanberg","Yes. Thank you and congratulations on the strong results. My first question is perhaps a bit more longer term for you, Vince. But as we now look at ADI and Linear and Hittite combine, can you give us any examples on how that combination really strengthens your barriers to entry. I mean I know you're obviously working on a lot of new products with the three combined, but if you can give us any insight into how that positions ADI from a competitive perspective, that would be great?","Vincent Roche","Yes. Thanks Tore. Well, if you look across the Analog sector, we've now got all the building blocks focused at solving the toughest challenges that our customers face, across every facets of whether it's sensing, measuring, interpreting, powering the signal chains, and that's the brand that we've been building for several years at ADI. That's the brand that both Hittite and the RF and Microwave space, and LT and the Power and Mixed Signal space were building as well independently.","So under one roof now, we can tackle our customers toughest challenges whether it's in communications infrastructure, in autonomous driving, in making our customers installed factory automation and process control machines more intelligent more connected. And clearly that's the brand that we convey to our customers. That's the brand that our customers are buying and engaging with across all these different areas.","So we're investing around $1 billion of combined R&D across the three enterprises under one roof. So we are all the time looking to broaden and deepen our competitive moat and we believe we\u2019re in a better position now than ever across all these various markets and with larger customers and with the addition of LT as well. We now get the chance to directly address more medium size and smaller customers directly.","Ali Husain","Tore, do you have a follow-up?","Tore Svanberg","Yes. So I have a follow-up on the communications bucket. So obviously that's been more mixed here the last few quarters. I assume that\u2019s more related to wireless \u2013 infrastructure. But you mentioned 5G coming online and it seems like maybe it's coming online sooner at least than I was thinking. So maybe you could elaborate a little bit on when you expect to start to see more material growth in the communications part of the business? Thank you.","Vincent Roche","Yes. Well, Tore we're playing in the field trials with virtually everybody today in the 5G area. My sense is that China and perhaps Japan will be first to market with 5G systems. And there are lots of definitions for what 5G really means, but I think the early systems will be massive MIMO-based, more like 4.5 plus moving up too much higher frequencies over the next five years or so well into the gigahertz, the 20-gigahertz, 30-gigahertz arena. So my sense is that 2019 is when we're going to see the first deployments in Asia in particular, and Europe and America a little bit longer I think to figure out exactly what standards and what frequencies they're going to target and to get into the field trial area.","Ali Husain","Yes, Tore. I\u2019ll just add from a positioning standpoint, ADI is particularly well-positioned to benefit from these 5G deployments, inherently when you're enabling more bandwidth, you're going to need more radios, and that's really where we focus is on the radio. So the more radios that are out there, the better it is for ADI.","And secondly, as you're moving faster \u2013 to faster speeds and higher standards, you need to move up the frequency spectrum. And so with our addition of the Hittite portfolio, we're particularly well-positioned as we move up the frequency spectrum in areas like Microwave and Millimeter Wave. So thanks for your question and we'll move on to the next caller please.","Operator","Our next question is from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","Good morning and solid job on the quarterly execution and margin expansion. In automotive core ADI, I think the team has been driving sort of solid year-over-year growth over the past few quarters and I think combined with Linear, you guys drove sort of mid-single digits year-over-year growth in Q3?","And then if I look at Q4, right, that typically tends to be stronger, you guys are guiding for growth, but that would imply sort of a range of sort of anywhere from low-single digits to mid-single digits year-over-year growth in Q4. Just given the momentum that you guys have, rising content on new model deployments, should we anticipate that embedded within your guidance that auto is probably growing kind of more towards that mid-single digits year-over-year growth range?","Ali Husain","Okay. Let me take part of that and maybe for the longer-term piece, I can let Vince answer that. Okay, so in the quarter automotive revenues were pretty stable sequentially. They were certainly ahead of the guidance range that we provided investors with. And it really was a tale of two cities in the automotive space or two businesses frankly because while the ADI standalone automotive business did in fact decrease in line with seasonality again on a sequential basis the LTC automotive business recovered very, very strongly on a sequential basis, I call that, because of a recovery in the powertrain sector specifically in China. So I think when you look at the tale of those two businesses combined, you see a pretty stable third quarter result.","On a year-over-year basis, the ADI standalone revenue did grow in the high-single digits, but as we point out in the schedules that we provided you, it appears to look like a mid single-digit growth rate, and again it's because of the Linear Tech business that's lower on a year-over-year basis around this powertrain business. Again, we're seeing a pretty good recovery in that space right now. So just wanted to give you a little bit of color on how the quarter turned out.","In terms of the guidance for next quarter, all we can tell you, Harlan is what we see in the order book and the order book supports a pretty seasonal fourth quarter. So it could be on a year-over-year basis anywhere from kind of the mid-single digits or high single-digit rate. The one thing I would point out is there's obviously been a lot of noise around SAR and we obviously look at all that information as well and we have access to that data as well as you do.","And I'd be perfectly candid with you to tell you that for \u2013 we are Tier 2 suppliers in the Tier 1 suppliers who is supplying to OEMs. I think if any semiconductor company sits around and tells you that SAR has a direct impact on their revenue this is frankly very, very hard for us to tell. All we can tell you is what's in the order book, and the order book supports a pretty seasonal quarter in the fourth quarter.","Harlan Sur","Great, and then just a quick follow-up. Same question I had as last quarter, which is obviously you guys talked about distribution inventory is still being very disciplined, on lead times, again looking at some of your peers, there appears to be some pockets of products that are seeing tightness of supply, last quarter you guys talked about being very comfortable, satisfying customer demand within your normal four to six weeks lead times, I'm just wondering if that's still the case.","Ali Husain","Yes, good question. We obviously pay a lot of attention to that particularly because it is a customer service commitment that we have. And so absolutely the lead times have remained very stable at four to six weeks and really not a whole lot of change there. We do have about 3.5 months worth of inventory on our own balance sheet. We have seven weeks of inventory in distribution and I'd say those metrics have been very, very stable.","Harlan Sur","Great, thanks for the insights.","Ali Husain","Yes, thanks Harlan. We move on to the next caller please.","Operator","Our next question is from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.","Ambrish Srivastava","Hi, thank you very much. My question is on the Linear integration and looks like some of the synergies especially on the margin front, they\u2019re showing up earlier. But if I were to pick something that at least to be done with that positive is the free cash flow and I'm not judging you on a quarterly basis. But even if I ex-out the one-time payment, free cash flow margin looks on the lower side. Could you please address that?","Ali Husain","Yes, sure, and again that's a metric that we look at very, very closely as well because even though we're at 34% free cash flow margins on a trailing 12-month basis and again that is probably at the very high-end of the S&P 500. I think the combination of these two businesses and how we think about the future here would suggest that we can really get these free cash flow margins really humming. So even though we're at kind of the high-end of the free cash flow spectrum on the S&P 500 in terms of our free cash flow model, we're certainly at the lower end of that, which is 34% to 42% as the range.","So yes, so I would just point out, as you mentioned Ambrish, looking at free cash flow in any one quarter is obviously has a lot of puts and takes to it. But third quarter tends to be a quarter that's a seasonally weaker quarter for free cash flow generation. We tend to have a couple of things that go on in the third quarter.","So really the compares to last year and I think we were at 25% last year and probably around 22% this year, and there's a couple of items that are incremental I guess this year relative to last in the third quarter. One is, we're obviously in a better business environment and so when you do that, tend to build inventory and ship inventory to customers, your accounts receivable goes up, of course all that converts into cash in the following quarter. But in any event in the third quarter, we basically saw a use of cash in the working capital section of the free cash flow statement as a result of really better business conditions.","And the other item I'd point out relative to last year is we are obviously carrying a debt load related to the acquisition and related to that debt load, there are two really semiannual payments that we need to make related to that debt load. One of those payments falls in the third quarter. So I think you saw a depressed free cash flow number this quarter, it really was kind of the perfect storm free cash flow this quarter. But I think over the longer-term, we're very well-positioned to drive our 34% to 42% free cash flow margin model range. Do you have a follow-up?","Ambrish Srivastava","Yes, I did. Thank you. Thank you for the details. And you addressed the auto question that\u2019s Harlan asked, but similarly on industrial - and on industrial, we don't have any side numbers that we can look at and say, hey, [look size of the basis], so your business would be doing this. How would you characterize what you're seeing in the industrial end market because there's obviously a whole bunch of cross currents there as well?","Vincent Roche","Yes, I think Ambrish, at this point, it's true to say. I've talked with a lot of our \u2013 the executives at our industrial customers over the last several months. I'd say there's generally optimism. I think people are pragmatic in terms of the CapEx environment. But what I will tell you is that there's a general sense that there's a better \u2013 obviously a better economic environment in America in particular for laying out CapEx and improving I would say the efficiency of the machinery, the installed base. So there's \u2013 what our customers would call a Brownfield upgrade in place.","I think as well China is on the track of mass automation, what they call China 2025 and that's having a huge effect obviously in our business in China and Japan. So I think overall there is strength across all the various sectors whether it's automation, aerospace and defense or ATE and all the geo\u2019s are doing well at this point in time. And I think there's a good balance between the consumption of our products and the supply of our products at this point in time.","Ali Husain","Okay, Ambrish. Thank you very much. Next caller please.","Operator","Our next question is from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.","Craig Ellis","Thank you for taking the question and congratulations on the good execution guys. Vincent I wanted to\u2026","Vincent Roche","Thank you.","Craig Ellis","You're welcome. I wanted to follow-up on a comment that you made in your prepared remarks regarding the automotive business and the potential for ADI content to double from now to the 2025 period.","Vincent Roche","Yes.","Craig Ellis","Is investors look ahead to the next one to two years, where should they expect content to start to increase towards that $500 level from what is $250 now? What are the early sign posts that they can look to for an increasing content?","Vincent Roche","Thanks Craig. Good question. So obviously autonomous driving on their various levels of autonomous driving, but we're moving steadily towards a car that is using predictive safety more and more. So our radar solutions are doing well today and we've a great crop of new products at the very, very high frequency level with tremendous special accuracy and very, very high channeled console highly integrated. So that's one area where we will get a lot more penetration.","Obviously we're able to attach the power solutions as well of LT into those areas. So that probably between the radar solution itself and the combination with LT that probably doubles the available market, bringing LT doubles the available socket value for ADI if you like in the radar area.","We're starting to trial a solid-state LiDAR solution that will start to \u2013 hopefully in that period of time, over the next five years, we'll start to see some significant contribution in terms of revenue there. We've already announced a new products that A2B for example that move information around the car very efficiently and very cost effectively and we've more generations of that plus new variants of that coming.","On the electrification side, we built a very attractive sensor portfolio, magnetic sensor portfolio for example for controlling movement in the car and measuring movement in the car with a lot of attached precision signal processing. So those are some examples. And obviously with the \u2013 on the electrification theme as well, the addition of LTs battery controllers is very exciting to our customers across the globe.","And again, there are many ongoing sockets that we've been supplying for many, many years in areas like infotainment, audio, video interface. So all those areas we're building a very, very nice pipeline, which gives us tremendous confidence.","Craig Ellis","Great. Thanks for that list. Ali, the follow-up question is for you. Appreciate the heads up on the extra week in the fiscal first quarter of next year as a backdrop to that. Can you just help us as you look at the combined business, what would normal seasonality be for the fiscal first quarter with Linear Tech in the portfolio?","Ali Husain","Yes. I'd say it\u2019s \u2013 that's a good question Craig. I'd say the ADI B2B markets and the Linear Tech B2B markets probably are pretty similar in terms of how they would behave seasonally. We've also by the way put a schedule up on our IR page, which shows three years worth of data of what the combined company would have looked like by quarter. So I guess go and calculate the seasonality based on that data as well.","The way I think about the first quarter is generally speaking, it's a pretty weak quarter. It's a January quarter for ADI, so not only do we get the December holidays, but we also get the January holidays that impact that quarter. And generally speaking it's weaker for industrial and automotive, and communications infrastructure as well.","On the consumer side, I think if you kind of back into the fourth quarter guidance that we've given you for consumer, the year-over-year growth rate is down actually, so it's \u2013 again I'd expect that weakness to continue in the first quarter and into the second quarter as well as next year.","But coming back to the point about seasonality in the first quarter, because we are expecting an additional week of revenue in the first quarter, I just tucked in an additional week of revenue, additional week of OpEx. And then the second quarter generally you see a recovery in the industrial and automotive market sequentially.","Although this time, my sense is that recover will probably be a little bit more muted just simply because you get the additional week in the first quarter. And consumer generally sees a bit of a leg down from its first quarter levels. And then the third and fourth quarters are again seasonally pretty stable for the B2B markets and consumer tends to recover, so that's probably the way to think about 2018 and the impact of the extra week in the 14-week quarter of 1Q 2018.","Craig Ellis","Thanks guys.","Ali Husain","All right, thanks Craig.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on the good results guys. First question on the Consumer segment, it's good to see that it's now less than 20% of sales. But do you think it at a point way your large portable customer that sort of stabilized somewhat on a content basis. So we don't have to worry about any big fluctuations that are content related. I understand the seasonal swings in consumer, but at what point can we start assigning normal seasonality and not have to worry about content swing that large customers?","Vincent Roche","Yes, as we talked about at the Analyst Day, a while ago, we\u2019re our sense is that \u2013 our position in the portable space is strong in the areas that we care about. Obviously the adoption cycles and the lifecycles are shorter than in the areas like industrial for example. So we have to \u2013 there is a dynamic there where we have to fight for sockets continuously.","But I think as we pointed out at the Analyst Day, we're expecting a level of stability at a lower run rate, perhaps down in the portable area of 20% in the coming year. That's what we're planning for and we're shooting for and obviously there maybe upside to that, but that's how we think about it at this point in time.","Ali Husain","Yes, and I just add Vivek, it's obvious we have no visibility into what 2018 is going to do in consumer. Although we do have a good sense that our content in these devices is pretty platform specific and our sense is that that mix is going to be weaker next year.","As Vince pointed out, frankly we\u2019re asked at the Analyst Day as well, it's hard to model that business and so I've heard estimates from analysts to be down that business 20% to 30%. Our sense is that 30% is probably a worst case scenario in the consumer space for next year.","Vivek Arya","Got it, very helpful. And as my follow-up now that you have achieved your 70% plus kind of gross margin target. What are the next few milestones and how should we think about the impact of mix versus utilization versus cost synergies from here? Thank you.","Ali Husain","Yes, that's a good question. I think Vivek, it's \u2013 these 70.5% gross margins, 70% plus gross margins that were putting up right now are a function of obviously we're pretty well utilized in our fabs given the current business conditions. In addition, the industrial market is really driving a lot of growth for us right now and that tends to drive pretty solid margins as well.","In addition, we moved pretty early this quarter to capture some cost synergies on the gross margin line and that obviously helped as well. I think as we look into next year, if business conditions remain in there, if business conditions are led by the industrial market, we do have more synergies on that gross margin line. We should do better. But again it's all going to be very much specific to the environment that we're in the next year.","Vivek Arya","All right. So even if consumer declines next year and that should be helpful for gross margin, right?","Ali Husain","Well, I mean I would say our margins across all of our businesses are actually quite good. So I don't expect that to be a big needle mover.","Vivek Arya","Thank you.","Ali Husain","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore","Yes, few questions. Vince, one for you back on the industrial side. If I look at your growth year-over-year, I think the combined mix that you guys talked about has it up 27%, I think your guidance is up 10% to 20%, 25% year-over-year. That's really impressive, but almost so much so that I wonder if there's something company specific going on. Is that the numbers really about 2x, what your competition is doing in much higher than anything you have done yourself in the last five years. So I guess given that what's driving such strong growth and how sustainable do you view that growth rate?","Vincent Roche","Yes. Ross, I think there are a number of factors in the response area. Firstly, 2016 wasn't a strong year in particular on the industrial side of things. We have a strong play. We\u2019ve made a pivot as a company several years ago. We pivoted R&D and focus into areas like aerospace and defense. Hittite obviously has helped us a lot in the penetration of that space. Our automation business is strong across the globe.","We've seen China has become a bigger part of what we do in the industrial area. So I think those things have helped us a lot. And obviously with LTs focus as well, the mix of LTs business being skewed towards heavily B2B applications and particularly industrial that helps everything. So I think there are a number of factors that are related to just the stronger market and ADI\u2019s position within the market.","Ali Husain","Yes. And I just add to that Ross, on a year-over-year basis aerospace and defense and automated test equipment were up very, very strongly. And so we do have this broad base of customers and they've certainly done well as well, but we've also got a couple of these more programmatic areas like I just mentioned that really were very strong on a year-over-year basis.","And we look at these growth rates as well, and we say boy, this is really good growth. I would love to keep this going. But our sense is at least from a supply chain perspective that things are pretty stable at least for the things that we can see. And I tend to look at the distribution channels see how that's doing and that's been like clockwork in seven weeks every quarter and we did that again this quarter. So that\u2019s what we can tell you at this stage.","Ross Seymore","Okay. I guess is my follow-up, switching over to the Linear Tech side. I believe last quarter you talked about having $20 million out of the original $100 million in OpEx synergies already captured.","Ali Husain","Yes.","Ross Seymore","Can you give us an update on what you've captured so far? And then at your Analyst meeting, a similar follow-up you added $100 million with a longer timeframe and made it a $250 million synergy target. Is that $100 million incremental more in the COGS side or more in the OpEx side?","Ali Husain","Okay. Good question. So on the initial $150 million synergies those Ross, you point out there was $20 million of public company costs that came out in the second quarter when we combined the companies. In the third quarter there was an additional $20 million of synergies that we realized.","And in the fourth quarter guidance and again all this embedded in the guidance, there's an additional $45 million of cost synergies. So the way to think about it is by the end of the fourth quarter, we would have realized $85 million up to $150 million. And off that $85 million, the split on the P&L would be approximately two-thirds in the OpEx line and about one-third in the cost of sales line.","Now there's still an additional $65 million remaining that we expect to start recognizing ratably in the first quarter of 2018 and ending by the fourth quarter of 2018. And the split on that we expect to be about two-thirds cost of sales and one-third OpEx. So that's the $150 million locked and loaded. We are obviously recognizing and realizing those synergies a little faster than we perhaps pointed to in the past, but I'll take it.","And then the $100 million of additional synergies that we talked about in the three to five-year timeframe, I would say we've identified those areas. I think naturally when you put two companies together, you're going to have efficiencies that take place and some of those are earlier, some of those are later. And in the three to five-year timeframe, we've got those synergies identified is just a question of communicating it to the street and once we have that plan, we will certainly do it.","Ross Seymore","Thank you.","Ali Husain","All right. Next caller.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Craig Hettenbach","Yes. Thanks. I want to follow-up on the automotive side, particularly for BMS, now that you have Linear\u2019s business in-house. Just wanted to get a sense of just kind of design pipeline and how you view in that market over the intermediate to longer term?","Vincent Roche","A lot of the activity Craig over the last couple of years for LT in that space has been in China and Asia in general. There's been an aggressive shift to penetrate the market as well in the U.S. and emerging in Europe as well. So I would say given the pipeline, given the products that we have, and given the penetration that we've got into some new areas as well. I think over the next five years it will be a significant growth contributor for ADI.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. And then just want to follow-up on the CFO hire, understanding Prashanth will be starting at the end of September, but maybe just taking a step back, and Vince, if you can just shed light on kind of your process as you evaluated different types of candidates and why you think he was the best fit for you?","Vincent Roche","Yes. So first and foremost I was looking for a very seasoned CFO with an understanding of the technology environment. In fact, Prashanth ticks all those boxes. He's been in the world of technology for a quarter of a century. He's a chemical engineer by background. So I think \u2013 and his track record has proven that he can run complex financial operations.","And what I'm looking for is somebody to obviously run the financial operations in ADI flawlessly, make sure that we integrate LTC flawlessly, and as well work with myself and the leadership team here at ADI to look for areas of trapped value that we can unlock in the years ahead. So I think as well Prashanth will be \u2013 he'll be a great cultural fit for ADI. And so we're obviously very excited to have him come on board in the next few weeks. And I think we have a world-class CFO now coming on board and we have a great future ahead of us that he will help us unlock.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it. Thanks for the context.","Ali Husain","All right, thanks. And we'll get to our last caller.","Operator","Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani","Thanks a lot. Good morning, guys. I guess a couple of questions for me. One on the automotive side. I realize you guys are guiding towards seasonal recovery or improvement in the upcoming quarter, but given the improvement you are seeing in the powertrain side at Linear which is a legal part of the revenue, why do you think growth is not better than seasonal trends in the upcoming quarter on automotive?","Ali Husain","Yes. Amit, I would just point out, all we can tell you is what we see in our order book and the order book supports the kind of guidance that we provided. Do you have a follow-up?","Amit Daryanani","I do. I guess just on the gross margin side, you guys had really impressive upside on gross margins this quarter in July, but as I look at October, you guys have kind of guiding flat gross margins despite revenues improving and [indiscernible] Linear benefits, so beyond mix I guess, what are the headwinds there might be there for gross margin in October?","Ali Husain","Yes, so I think Vince mentioned it in his prepared remarks. We expect our growth in the fourth quarter to be led by the automotive and consumer markets, and those two markets tend to carry, again very good gross margins, but they're slightly dilutive to the overall company. And so, as a result, actually I think it's a great result that we can keep gross margin stable next quarter despite the mix or the anticipated mix. And the way we're going to do that is to realize more the cost synergies like we talked about before.","Amit Daryanani","Perfect. That\u2019s it. Congrats on the quarter guys.","Vincent Roche","All right. Thanks Amit.","End of Q&A","Vincent Roche","Okay. So everybody thanks for joining us this morning and copy of this transcript will be available on our website and all available reconciliations and additional information can also be found on the quarterly results section of our Investor Relations site at investor.analog.com.

I\u2019d like to now introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.","Michael Lucarelli","Thank you, Sheryl, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our first quarter fiscal 2019 conference call. With me on the call today are ADI\u2019s CEO, Vincent Roche; and ADI\u2019s CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah. For anyone, who missed the release, you can find it and relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com.","Now on to the disclosures, the information we are about to discuss, including our objectives and outlook includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors including those discussed in our earnings release and in our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.","Our commentary about ADI\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2019 financial results and short-term outlook will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude special items. When comparing our results to historical performance, special items are also excluded from these prior quarter and year-over-year results. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today\u2019s earnings release. As a reminder the first quarter of 2018 was a 14 week quarter. In addition this is the first quarter of our adoption of ASC 606 sell-in accounting. We have this data, historical financial statements to conform to this standard and posted a two year quarterly end market look back for revenue on our Investors site. ","All comments during today's call on revenue growth and our commentary during Q&A will exclude this extra week and be on a selling basis unless otherwise stated. In addition as we move to sound accounting and further refined LTC's product mapping in the channel we have adjusted approximately $80 million of annual revenue from communications to consumer. The new mapping does not impact industrial or automotive revenue. Okay. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to ADI\u2019s CEO, Vincent Roche. Vince?","Vincent Roche","Thank you Mike and a very good morning to everybody. The first quarter of fiscal 2019 was another very successful quarter for ADI in what is a challenging macroeconomic environment we're executing soundly and delivering strong results. Revenue of 1.54 billion in the first quarter came in at the high end of our guidance led by our strong year-over-year growth in our B2B markets. This growth was driven predominantly by continued strength in our communications market related to ongoing 4G upgrades and initial 5G deployments. ","Adjusted operating margins of over 41% or above the midpoint of guidance as we balanced our strategic investments with prudent discretionary spend. All told adjusted EPS was a $1.33 also at the high end of guidance. Over the past 12 months we have generated over $2.1 billion in free cash flow or 35% of revenue which places ADI in the top 5% of the S&P 500 and over that same time period we've returned more than 100% of free cash flow to our shareholders after debt repayments.","Now while macro uncertainties continue to exist our strong execution and results enable us to continue to invest in extending our franchise in strategic areas where we see attractive opportunities for future growth. To that end we're investing record levels of R&D to push the boundaries of innovation and expand the breadth and depth of our franchise. In addition we've increased our investments in our go to market activities to further broaden and deepen our customer reach and our engagements. The strengthen and resiliency of our business model allows us to innovate regardless of business conditions. This ability is imperative given the long life cycles in our markets where average product lifespan is a decade or indeed more. And while some competitors pulled back and lose momentum in uncertain times we plan to continuously invest to build upon our virtuous cycle of innovation led growth. ","In my 30 plus year career with ADI I have never been more confident or excited about our prospects than I am today. The third wave of information and communications technology is creating an inflection in the analog industry and we've built a product portfolio aimed at favorable macro trends that I believe will provide tailwinds for years to come.","Now to provide you with some examples of what we're seeing in our B2B markets specifically. Today industrial customers are balancing CAPEX deployments with tariff uncertainty. However, our customers remain focused on digitizing the factory and securing the efficiency and productivity that will fuel their future growth. The move to the digital factory requires more high performance signal processing and power management, additional sensors, and more robust connectivity. These are all areas where ADI excels. ","On the automotive front vehicle unit growth has stalled recently but the real growth drivers electric and autonomous vehicles are in the nascent stages. Electric vehicles represent only 1% of worldwide sales but industry report suggests this will climb to more than 15% over the next decade or so. The power train in an electric vehicle opens the opportunity for us to address up to three times the content compared to combustion engines.","Today we enjoy the luxuries of level 2 autonomous vehicles but the cars of the future will require higher precision and up to four times more sensors per car to provide the necessary level of safety for a fully autonomous vehicle. And it's not just about radar or cameras we expect that these cars of the future will require lighters [ph] and IMUs as well. ADI is uniquely positioned to provide the necessary building blocks across all the sensing modalities as well as the analog and mixed signal processing, RF & Microwave connectivity, algorithms and power management to make the autonomous vision a reality.","In communications carriers are looking to upgrade both the wireless networks and the optical backbone to deal with the ever increasing deluge of data being created and transmitted. This additional data intensifies the need for spectral, space, thermal and cost efficiency and with our comprehensive portfolio of software defined mixed signal RF, microwave and power management technologies we're creating very compelling solutions for our customers as they upgrade 4G networks and begin the introduction of 5G systems. ","An important bridge between 4G and 5G is the introduction of massive MIMO radio systems and ADI software defined transceivers technology is at their core. These upgrades to massive MIMO systems are just beginning today and the increase in the radio account expands our content opportunity by up to four times when compared to traditional 4G systems. This phase will be followed by network expansions to higher frequencies to increase bandwidth as well as the upgrade of the optical backhaul and virtualization of the network to more efficiently move the data. This next wave will once again create the opportunity for ADI to address additional content both in the radio as well as in the optical network. We see these upgrades towards 5G as a multi-year cycle that's just beginning and are expected to provide tailwinds to our business well into the future.","And lastly in healthcare the dual impact of an aging global population and the pressing need to more economically and effectively manage wellness is driving continued investments in our products by our customers. Here we are complementing our high end component franchise with highly integrated subsystems thereby extending our addressable market to capture new levels of value. For example in digital X-ray we're creating highly integrated photons to bits subsystems that enable our customers to deliver high fidelity images at lower radiation dosages. Separately ADI's deep expertise and vital signs monitoring and ultra low power electronics enable clinical grade performance under battery power allowing us to deliver high accuracy, portable monitoring at virtually any point of use.","Now in closing as the saying goes a rising tide lifts all ships. The true test of a company's strategy, execution, and value is its performance during a low tide. Now we've chosen a strategy that focuses on innovation, diversity across technologies, markets and applications, and continuous improvement across every aspect of our performance. And the results speak for themselves. We're confident that our ethos [ph] and heritage of innovation, leadership and high performance analogue, deep relationships with our customers and alignment of favorable macro trends positions us to create, to continue to outperform, capture more value, expand our addressable market, and deliver strong results for our shareholders. And so with that I'll hand it over to Prashanth who will bring you through more detail.","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","Thank you Vince. Good morning everyone and let me add my welcome to our first quarter earnings call. My comments today with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses will be on an adjusted basis which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. As a reminder the first quarter of 2018 was a 14 week quarter and we have now adopted ASC 606 or sell-in accounting. We have restated our historical financial statements to conform and as Mike mentioned we have also posted a two year quarterly end market look back for revenue on a sell-in basis. To normalize our growth rates and give you a like for like comparison my prepared remarks and our Q&A commentary will exclude this extra week and will be on a sell-in basis unless otherwise stated. ","Now on to the quarter, in the face of geo political uncertainty we are pleased to report strong first quarter results with revenue, operating margin, and EPS all coming in above the midpoint of our guidance. Additionally we are delighted to have increased our dividend by almost 13%, the largest increase since 2013 and we also raised our dividend growth target to 7% to 15% annually. This reflects our strong financial results as well as our optimism regarding ADI's future. ","Before diving into the income statement let me first cover the end markets. Our first quarter B2B revenue increased 10% year-over-year led by exceptional growth in the communication market driven by ongoing momentum in 4G and the initial 5G deployments. The industrial market represented 47% of sales in the quarter and revenue was roughly flat compared to the year ago quarter. Within this highly diversified business revenue growth in healthcare, electronic test and measurement, aerospace and defense were balanced by weaker demand in factory automation and memory test.","The comps market represented 22% of sales during the quarter and experienced very strong double-digit year-over-year growth led by strength in wireless. This growth exceeded our expectations and illustrates the strong momentum ADI is experiencing in traditional 4G systems and in the early deployment of 5G massive MIMO. We see 5G as a multi-year upgrade cycle that is expected to deliver continued growth over the coming years.","Our auto business represented 17% of sales in the quarter and based on sell through revenue was essentially flat compared to the year ago quarter. Overall vehicle unit weakness was offset by double-digit growth in BMS, growth in power management as we bring new products to market and extend our customer reach, and ramping sales of A2B. The 6% year-over-year reported growth from our end market breakout is primarily due to sell-in accounting as we moved some customers from direct to distribution during the quarter. And lastly our consumer business represented 14% of sales in the first quarter. As expected revenues declined year-over-year however portables declined less than expected. ","Now on to the P&L, revenue for the quarter was at the high end of our guidance at approximately 1.54 billion up 6% year-over-year. Gross margin came in at 70.3 and lower year-over-year due to end market mix and lower utilization rates. OPEX in the quarter was 448 million down slightly sequentially and below the midpoint of guidance as we balanced our strategic investments with prudent discretionary spend. This translated to an operating margin of 41.2% which was at the high end of our guided range.","Non-op expenses in the first quarter was 56 million unchanged from 4Q but lower than a year ago due to our debt reduction of $1.2 billion over the past year. Our tax rate for the quarter was just above 14% and at the lower end of outlook of 14% to 16%. All told adjusted diluted earnings per share from the first quarter came in above the midpoint of guidance at a $1.33. ","Now moving on to the balance sheet, inventory dollars increased slightly sequentially while days were flat at 117 compared to fourth quarter. As a reminder in the coming quarters we will begin to build bridge inventory ahead of the closure of our front-end and back-end facilities that we expect to deliver another $100 million of cost synergies. So we plan to modestly increase our inventory days temporarily until these closures are complete.","Distribution inventory days were down both sequentially and year-over-year and remain in our target range. CAPEX in the first quarter was $91 million or 6% of sales. For the full year we anticipate CAPEX may run modestly higher than our 4% model due to the co-location of our product and business development teams and additional capacity to support future linear growth. This would be a temporary deviation from our long-term model.","Free cash flow was $2.1 billion on a trailing 12 month basis. Over the past 12 months we have returned 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks after debt repayments. In the first quarter we repaid $100 million of debt, paid 178 million in dividends and repurchased 227 million of our stock or roughly 2.5 million shares.","Now onto guidance which again with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses is also on an adjusted basis excluding items outlined in today's release. As a reminder our guidance is based on sell-in or POA accounting. For context during 2018 the change in channel inventory for the year was minimal as channel inventory increased in the first half and was reduced in the second half of the year. On average over the past three years channel inventory impacts annual revenue by about 1% while quarterly variances could be and have been larger.","Second quarter revenue is expected to be 1.5 billion plus or minus 50 million. At the midpoint we expect our B2B markets of industrial, automotive, and communications in the aggregate to increase slightly year-over-year led by the communications market. At the midpoint of guidance we expect second quarter operating margin to be up slightly sequentially at 41.3%.","Non-op expenses are expected to be basically flat sequentially and we are planning for our tax rate to be towards the lower end of our previously guided range of 14 to 16. Based on these inputs diluted EPS excluding special items is expected to be a $1.30 plus or minus $0.07. All in it was a strong quarter to kick off fiscal 2019 and while we are mindful of the economic uncertainty around us I will echo Vince's optimism and say that we are extremely confident of the long-term growth opportunities for ADI.","And with that I'll turn it over to Mike to start our Q&A.","Michael Lucarelli","Thanks Prashanth. Okay, before we move to Q&A one last reminder from IR, our growth commentary will be on normalized 13 week basis and on sell-in unless we otherwise state it. Now let's get to the Q&A. Please limit yourself to one question. After our initial response we will give you an opportunity for a follow-up question. Operator, can we have our first question please. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Please go ahead. Your line is open. ","Michael Lucarelli","Good morning Ambrish.","Ambrish Srivastava","Good morning. I just wanted to put your guide with respect to what the peers have reported and guided to. Is it fair to assume that it's really the sell-in accounting changes one of the bigger factors in your Q-over-Q guide being different than your peers like Dixon and Maxon [ph]?","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","No Ambrish I am not sure why you would conclude that. Our guide -- we are not, as I mentioned, we are not guiding point of sale anymore. We're on sell-in basis but the guide is at the 15.41 midpoint of growth, excuse me, at the 1500 mid-point. The guide should be on a year-over-year basis. If you were to take an assumption on flat inventory channel you would still see a pretty strong sequential or year-over-year growth number there.","Michael Lucarelli","Yeah, just some context there as Prashanth said in his prepared remarks we built inventory in the first half of the year in 2018 and this year we're not planning to build as much. So that would actually be a counter to what you said.","Ambrish Srivastava","Okay, thanks for that. ","Vincent Roche","Ambrish, if you take our outlook for the next quarter 2Q you know basically our days in the channel are flat. So it's certainly not an inventory build or so an issue. We run the thing on the internet. We run the company on a sell through basis so I want to make that clear. ","Michael Lucarelli","Do you have a follow-up Ambrish. ","Ambrish Srivastava","I did, thank you for the clarification. I just wanted to make sure I cut that right. A bit longer term Vince on the 5G versus 4G, can you just help us understand what are the different dynamics architecture wise and also the content gains that you expect, I know it's multi-flavor roll-out, multi-year roll-out that how should we think about your positioning versus what it was in 4G, thank you?","Vincent Roche","Yes, so the 4G build outs are continuing. I think that will be the story for the next couple of years in terms of revenue contribution to ADI. But of course 4G is being upgraded, we're adding massive MIMO for example to direct the energy and improve spectral efficiency. So, I think we have a very high share at the present time in 4G and in the initial stage of the 5G. And what we're seeing right now is as I said the 4G phase continues, I think there are multiple years left where 4G will be the primary platform. So we are in the initial stages of 5G deployments but really 5G has yet to materialize.","You know when it comes to looking at the content I would say these new generations of 4G create four times more content value for ADI. And of course when we move to 5G with the higher frequency systems, the microwave systems and you know the densification of these massive MIMO systems there is another ump that we expect to get in content there. And that's by the way before we add in the car management portfolio as well. So as I've said before for every dollar of analog content, of mixed signal content there's at least a dollar of power and I'm pleased to say that we are at the early stages of attaching our LT power management portfolio to our 4G and 5G story as well.","Michael Lucarelli","Thank you Ambrish. Our next caller.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel, Nicolaus. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Michael Lucarelli","Good morning Tore.","Tore Svanberg","Yes, thank you and congratulations on the results. First question, I'm intrigued by the investments you're doing in healthcare. I assume that up until now that linear sort of the B2B business but there seems to be a lot of things going on in the consumer side so should we expect ADI to participate both in B2B and annual consumer when it comes to healthcare?","Vincent Roche","It is a good question. Well, most of what we're doing is for example in the -- point of view the clinical grid vital signs monitoring. We're focusing very much on the higher end of the sensing and signal processing activity there. So we're not, you know, true to form with ADI we are focused on really solving the toughest problems and enabling consumers to wear new healthcare sensing technologies to predict and help monitor wellness and indeed recovery from health situations. So I would say that the way to think about the story is that we're going to be focused largely on more B2B type activities.","Michael Lucarelli","Your follow-up Tore. ","Tore Svanberg","That's really helpful. Yes, thanks Mike, question for Prashanth. Prashanth you said as you go through this transition your inventories are going to go up. Could you give us a sense for how much we're talking about here and maybe you could give us a range on inventory days? ","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","Yeah sure, thanks Tore. So, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks we had committed to some additional cost synergies relating to the shutdown of two sites that we acquired as part of the LTC acquisition. And so this shutdown should generate an incremental $100 million of cost synergies all of which is in cost of goods. To help us through that transition we're going to be needing to put a little bit more inventory internally under our balance sheets and hard to kind of pinpoint too much at this at this early stage but we're estimating around five days is what would be necessary to kind of carry us through the bridging, the closure of those two facilities and then once those facilities are up and running we'll burn that off.","Michael Lucarelli","Thank you Tore. Our next question please. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is open. ","Stacy Rasgon","Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. Back to the sell-in accounting, so if I compare the new revenue profile with the old one I noted considerable amount of revenue particularly from industrial that moved from the second half of 2018 to the first half as you said you built in the first and so in the second it shows up in the change. But it was a lot of revenue, was the magnitude of this drawdown bigger than what you would typically see in your ordinary patterns just maybe given the stronger demand environment we have in the first half, I guess maybe just to put in other words, like is the magnitude of the drawdown in the channel that we saw in the second half bigger than what we would see as the channel right now, leaner than what it would ordinarily be in a normal second half?","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","Thanks, let me break that into two pieces. So first if you think back to last year it was around summer that we were one of the first companies to indicate that we were beginning to see some challenge in the factory automation space given what was going on particularly with China. So being proactive on that we began to constrain the amount of inventory going into the channel in preparation of the uncertain times ahead. So yes, last year we did see a more significant kind of correction to inventory in the channel in the second half given the macro environment. As we show now setting that up for this year now that we are on sell-in accounting that creates for some tough comps in the first half and again as we move into the second half now we'll also be lapping the softer business environment as well as the inventory channel correction. So we do feel pretty good that the growth kind of gets better for industrial from here on forward.","And in terms of what's in the channel today we're at about seven and half weeks and that's kind of right in the range that we guide to. As Vince mentioned and this is important we've focused running the business on a POS basis so the inventory in the channel for us is striking that balance in what is necessary to serve our customers and it's less about kind of managing a particular revenue number. It is POS is what drives our decisions on what we put in the channel. ","Michael Lucarelli","Thanks Stacy, do you have a follow-up. ","Stacy Rasgon","I do, thank you. I wanted to ask about OPEX. So, you were kind of flattish year-over-year in Q1, you're guiding kind of flattish in Q2, but at the same time you're talking about continually investing in new opportunities so I guess in particular given the current situation which does seem somewhat uncertain how should we thinking about OPEX growth maybe relative to revenue growth as we go through the rest of the year?","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","I would say that if you think historically there's been a sort of a meaningful change in OPEX when we move from first quarter to second quarter. We told you in the last earnings call that that would not be the case this year, that our first quarter would be a little bit higher and there were some one timers that we talked about on the last call but we are behind that. And as we move through the balance of the year we're expecting OPEX to be relatively flattish. The biggest driver on that frankly will continue to be variable compensation which is designed to adjust the spend in line with the profit and the revenue growth. So, R&D today runs at about 18% of revenue and we really consider that fully funded. So we will work within that envelope to deliver the product development needs that are required.","Stacy Rasgon","Got it, thank you very much. ","Michael Lucarelli","Thank you, our next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Harsh Kumar, Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. ","Harsh Kumar","Yes, hey guys. Congratulations on great results, great guidance. Gross margin came down, I assume that was just mix but sort of B2B sort of hurting a little bit and consumer coming in stronger, how are you expecting to manage the factory or the fab and therefore the utilization and gross margin in the coming few quarters?","Vincent Roche","Yeah, well in the first quarter we had the lower utilization but we expect that utilization will increase in the second quarter and through the rest of our fiscal year here. So we will I think keep pretty high level of utilization. And also the 70.3% margins that we posted in the first quarter, as the mix towards industrial improves we would expect also the gross margin to improve. So I think utilization is in good shape across the company and I think as well we are probably seeing what would be the lower point of the gross margin activity right now. And that will certainly improve as the industrial business improves. ","Harsh Kumar","Thanks.","Vincent Roche","Harsh, your comments are correct just one clarification there, it was growth in consumer but it was also the growth in communications. So short-term we are responsible for the end market mix and do remember that we are left -- this is the current quarter where we have the typical holiday shutdown so utilization are at the lowest point typically over the holiday season. So, with that we'll go to our next caller. Do you have a follow-up Harsh. ","Harsh Kumar","Yeah, thanks. Thanks Vince. So quick question on the automotive. So I got excited looking at your automotive number before realizing that there's a lot of sell-in stuff going on. Could you give us some color on how it held up if you back out the sell-in and if you are unwilling to do that maybe talk about, you sort of laid out some targets when you start to see some real growth mid to high single digit kind of numbers in automotive a year or even slightly more than that out. How do you feel about that number, that timeframe? ","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","Great, great Harsh. Thank you I'm going to do the first part and then let Vince take the second part. So as I said in the prepared remarks we moved some customers who were direct into the channel. As a result there was a little bit of build in inventory associated with that. Normally that would not be revenue for us, remember and the growth if you want to think about what is the auto growth due to sell-in that would've been a flat number. So auto growth in the quarter as we think about it natural demand was flattish and we would say that the for the first half we kind of expect that to be flattish because the second quarter is going to have the corresponding offset from what we -- from the inventory build that we had in the first quarter. Channel inventory overall was kind of a minimal quarter-over-quarter so auto was up but the other markets were down. With that let Vince talk kind of longer-term auto growth.","Vincent Roche","Yeah, so we're expecting to -- through 2018 the ADI specific, the legacy ADI portion of our business grew in the high single-digits. The LTC portion was in the lower single-digits but let me tell you a couple of things that we've been driving hard in our business. Our BMS, the battery management solutions that were legacy LTC where we've been growing that in double-digits over the past three quarters or so. And we're looking at the remainder of this year, the full 2019 as a double-digit growth year in that particular area. And in fact I think Prashanth indicated in his CAPEX remarks that one of the reasons we're increasing CAPEX is to enable us to put the equipment in place to get our products to market faster in that particular area and to put the test coverage that we need as well in our back-end. ","I'm glad to say as well that we're winning incremental power sockets in the automotive sector. We're bringing power to new customers and we've seen just in this last quarter, in fact our power portfolio grew in the automotive sector on a year-over-year basis. Legacy ADI in our infotainment business continues to flourish and we're winning many premium audio sockets and also attaching LT power again to everything that we do in the automotive area. So, we've just launched as well some very exciting high resolution radar technology at the 77 gigahertz level so that's yet to come. But of the early indications are that we're starting to get traction there. So I think we have many technologies and product areas that are well aligned with the critical themes in automotive around autonomy and electrification and we now have the best portfolio in the industry to attack these opportunities. ","Michael Lucarelli","Thank you Harsh. We will go to our next caller please.","Operator","Our next question is from Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. ","Craig Hettenbach","Yes, thanks. The commentary on B2B up slightly can you frame that if you look it between comp, industrial, and automotive just kind of a rough sense of how you expect those markets to trend year-over-year? ","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","Sure, hey Craig. I kind of believe that growth I would say. Industrial will be down year-over-year. Remember last 2Q was a very, very strong quarter. I think we grew double-digits sequentially in 2Q. That's kind of our peak industrial revenue a year ago. It was a tough comp plus we also talk about the inventory change in the channel year-over-year. Automotive is going to be down year-over-year as we talked about the selling for sell through accounting. So for auto I would think look at basically first half 2019 flattish versus first half 2018 and that is flattish auto with unit -- with vehicle unit sales down. So, we do recognize that that is a good accomplishment given the decline in vehicle production. So then comps it will be another strong double-digit growth year-over-year. Put that together it increases slightly sequentially and that's even with what I would call the offset of auto because of the sell-in account. If you took that away B2B is up probably 2% to 3% year-on-year.","Craig Hettenbach","Got it, appreciate the color there. And then Vince just a question understanding there's some near-term cyclical pressure on the industrial market, can you talk through just design engagements with customers and things that once you see some of the cyclical pressure ease how that business could get kind of back on track?","Vincent Roche","You know it's a good question Craig. We have an opportunity pipeline though both on the legacy ADI and LT legacy power products in particular. That is at an all time record high. So we're basically converting that pipeline across the Board and we've a broader and deeper position in the automation sector. We have extended our reach into electronic test and measurements which complements our more vertically oriented memory tests area quite well. And the energy sector as well is doing well for the company and on a year-over-year basis has been growing. So all the things we do around sensing, measuring, interpreting, powering, and connecting those technologies are getting used in more and more places in the industrial sector and in the aerospace and defense as well. So, we have a bigger portfolio, we've got more sales and application resource out there deeply engaging with our customers every day. So my sense is if I were to put a target growth number on it I think we have the opportunity to grow consistently in the mid to high single-digit area over the coming five to seven years.","Michael Lucarelli","Thank you Craig, we will go to our next caller please. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your line is open. ","Thomas O'Malley","Hey guys this is Tom O'Malley on for Blayne Curtis. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Just want to cover something you guys mentioned early in the call, I think you said that you moved $80 million from comp to consumer, could you describe what you're moving over and kind of the growth profile of that chunk of revenue? ","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","So Tom, this is mainly related to prosumer business. So think of like polycomps and that type of stuff for a conference call, those type of things removed from comps related for linear we're in communications, we put those into consumer where ADI puts them. Its prosumer typically at GDP plus business growth lies, with customer mapping as we continue to finish the integration process with LTC. ","Vincent Roche","So it's basically the non-portable stuff and it looks and feels like a B2B business. Lots of customers and products and longer product life cycles when compared to the portable area. So that's the change that's taking place. ","Michael Lucarelli","Do you have a follow up? ","Thomas O'Malley","Yeah, I guess just moving on more towards the comp side, you guys were talking about how 4G is really still strong and you guys are seeing the 4X content increase for massive MIMO ahead of what people are really excited about in 5G, can you kind of talk about the timing of that and how much lays you think are left of that before that 5G transition to that happen in the next couple of quarters?","Vincent Roche","Well, different people have different definitions of what constitutes 4G and 5G. I would say anything that is 4G with a massive MIMO connected to it is 4.5G. Some people call them 5G. So that's already in play and that's one of the strongest growth drivers in our portfolio. And I think that will be the story for at least another 12 to 18 months. I think it's going to be the very advanced 4G technologies that are beginning to utilize that bridge technology to 5G which is massive MIMO. I see through 5G being a 2021-2022 introduction point. So I think you'll see trials of course in the meantime of the classical microwave driven 5G but I think that's still a couple of years out.","Michael Lucarelli","Thanks Tom. Our next question please. ","Operator","Our next question is from William Stein from SunTrust. Your line is open. ","William Stein","Great, thanks for taking my questions. First I'd like you to remind us about the capital allocation strategy for the company. There was a dividend increase. Also you know taking a step back you're now below two turns of net leverage, there was for a time a concern around leverage that's clearly behind us now but the last two acquisitions you did Hittite and Linear I think are proving very successful. And in the context of the broader capital allocation strategy, I am hoping you might comment on your appetite for M&A which has been maybe going a little bit out of style in the last year or so but I would suspect should still be on the top of ADI's mind given the success you've had?","Vincent Roche","Well the first call on our capital is to make sure that we invest to the fullest extent in building the greatest products and getting these products to market. So that's the first call we're investing in fact our OPEX is at a record level this year. Our fixed OPEX and so that's the first call in capital. We've committed to returning all our free cash flow after debt repayments to our shareholders. We -- that's the track we're on. We're very happy with where we are right now as a company with the combination of ADI legacy Hittite and LT. So we're still integrating LT and creating the leverage that we know we can create with that franchise. So that's where we are right now and we've been doing some tuck-in acquisitions over the last the last 12 months. We'll continue to do that but I think that's the way to think about it right now.","Michael Lucarelli","A follow up Will. ","William Stein","Yeah, I'm wondering if you can comment on the degree to which you believe the trade conflict has been hurting your business. I think it's clear there's been some effect maybe not as much as others because in particular the comp strength but, to what degree you see that already embedded in orders and what you think -- what you think sort of the future holds if there is a trade agreement in regards to your backlog and your trend of business, thank you? ","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","Great, let me start and then let Vince add some more color. I just want to get to your question on orders so, I know that's probably on many people's minds. January orders were stronger than December. Now that's not unusual for us but it is a good sign and that was strengthening orders across all of our B2B markets. Now February has Chinese New Year so there's a lot of noise in that. But going into the Chinese New Year orders remain strong. And while it is a noisy metric but we do look at it our four week book-to-bill is higher than both our 8 week and our 13 week. But I do want to emphasize that it is a very noisy metric but for whatever that's worth.","Vincent Roche","I think that's fine Prashanth.","Michael Lucarelli","Let's go to our next caller please. ","Operator","And our next question comes from John Pitzer, Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","John Pitzer","Yeah, good morning guys, thanks for letting me ask the question. But both of mine relative to the comps business I guess Vince when I adjust for the extra week and the change in accounting you know the comps business was up north of 40% year-over-year in the January quarter, just excellent results. But as you start to kind of lap the law of large numbers and hard compares what do you think the sustainable growth rate in the comp business should be over a longer period of time? I guess if you look at the last several quarters you've grown revenue on a quarterly basis by almost 100 million, I'm wondering if you could help us break down the buckets of that growth between sort of massive MIMO, 5G, Hittite and maybe to follow on to Will's question there is some concern out there that perhaps you're seeing a pull in from some of your Chinese customers relative to concerns about their ability to get parts or tariffs, are you seeing any sort of pull-in in these numbers or not?","Vincent Roche","Well, I think there probably is some. And I don't see anything unnatural in the numbers incidentally but there is obviously some pull-in. There's anxiety around the current trade tension situation but also remember there are particularly in China there are planned releases of advanced 4G systems and the trialing of 5G systems. So that's taking place. I think our story is dominated primarily by the fact that we have much more content than we've ever had historically in these systems of ever increasing complexity. It's off the top of my head John, it is hard to give you a breakdown of what the individual pieces are in terms of the contribution from legacy ADI, Linear, and Hittite. But as I mentioned in the prepared remarks and certainly in the Q&A here we're beginning to see the early stages of LTC power being adopted. So the portfolio today is largely dominated by legacy ADI mixed signal. We're at the early stages of adoption of LT and you know Hittite is a tremendous source of strength in the higher frequency connect the -- products that connect to the antenna. And all that said my expectation is with the content and with the expectations of our customers that that business will grow double-digits for the next several years.","Michael Lucarelli","Thanks John and just in time\u2026 Go ahead John.","John Pitzer","Okay you started, we could take it offline. What I was trying to say is 4X content story what percentage of your comps revenue does that content store cover or are you really kind of guiding that at some point in the future we can go back and look at a quarterly revenue run rate that's kind of 4X what it was maybe two or three years ago? ","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","So at a high level John 2018 was really about share gains on traditional 4G, doesn't really include that 4X content. That 4X content comment relates to as you move to more radios and massive MIMO, radios go up by 8X. The content opportunity for us is up to 4X and we're adding Linear power on to that. So that's really in the future. So at a high level 2018 is about 4G share gains, 2019 and beyond will be about moving to massive MIMO in the 4X content.","John Pitzer","Very helpful, thanks guys. ","Michael Lucarelli","Can we have our last question please. ","Operator","Thank you, our last question comes from C.J. Muse, Evercore. Your line is open. ","C.J. Muse ","Yeah, good morning. Thank you for squeezing me in. I guess to follow up on a handful of the previous questions, your industrial business definitely proved more resilient than I think most of us were thinking coming in, and so just curious how much of that do you think was a result of moving to sell-in versus your particular portfolio?","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","I would say none of that was real due to some them. Remember that industrial business largely goes through the channel. We have a very tough compare in the first half because in 2018 we built inventory in the channel so that is primarily the industrial business. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks we saw growth in aerospace, defense, electronic test and measurement which more than helped to offset the headwind we had in automation and memory test which we've signaled some time ago. The book-to-bill is above parity so little bit more than normal but that's already reflected in our outlook. I mentioned orders have gotten better so I think Vince made the comment we think we continue to grow from here","C.J. Muse ","That's helpful, and I guess as a quick follow-up, I guess more limited commentary on the consumer side so I figured would start there, how are you thinking about seasonality and kind of given what you know today design win wise what business can look like through calendar 2019?","Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah","Yeah, and I think [indiscernible] is the low point of the year for that business just given the demand there. And you think about it on last call Vince highly that we think consumer will be down 10% to 20% in fiscal 2019 that's kind of what we're sticking to for outlook.

Sir, the floor is yours.","Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Jennifer. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining the Analog Device's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. You can find our press release, relating financial schedules and the CFO commentary at investor.analog.com. With me on today's call are ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Dave Zinsner.","So before we start, let's get through some disclosures. Please note the information we're about to discuss including our objectives, outlook and the proposed acquisition of Linear Technology Corporation includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call and we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.","With the exception of revenue, our commentary about ADI's first quarter financial results will exclude special items which, in the aggregate, totaled $85 million for the quarter. When comparing our first quarter results to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from the prior quarter and year-over-year results, and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in Schedules E and F in today's earnings release which we have posted at investor.analog.com.","So with that, let's get started and I'll turn the call over to Vince.","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","Thanks very much, Ali, and good morning, everyone. So by any measure, our January quarter results were stellar. Revenue of $984 million was well above the high-end of our guidance, growing 28% over the prior year, and we had broad strength across all our markets. And we expanded operating margins over 700 basis points from the prior year to 35% of sales. Earnings per share of $0.94 was up 68% from the prior year, and $0.16 better than the high-end of our guidance. Importantly, we have generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months.","So this was a terrific start to the fiscal year and we continue to see momentum in our business and in our customer engagements. Our R&D efforts are squarely focused on the most exciting trends in the industrial, automotive, communications infrastructure, healthcare and consumer markets. And I'd like to give you just a few examples of where ADI's technology is making a real difference.","So in the area of data converters, which are in many ways the backbone of our mixed-signal franchise, for example, where we're the market leader, we've once again established new performance benchmarks with our next generation of high-speed ADCs and DACs that exploit 28 nanometer CMOS technology combined with proprietary architectures and algorithms.","By providing four times improvement in critical high dynamic range parameters, these converter platforms are enabling the next wave of gigahertz bandwidth, software defined systems for 4G and 5G communications, for test equipment and also in several aerospace and defense applications. It's the radio or radar equivalent of going from watching television using the old bunny ears to watching high-definition TV. We can now give our customers the ability to see things that they did not know were even there, and this is a real game-changer.","In addition, our previously introduced high-speed signal processing platforms achieved record revenue based on our integrated transceiver platforms, which helped our communications infrastructure customers and beyond efficiently address the challenges of accelerating global data consumption. These solutions are equally well-suited to and are increasingly finding their way into a diversity of applications in the industrial instrumentation, aerospace and defense, and indeed the automotive markets.","In factory automation, our software configurable input\/output solutions are enabling our customers to create flexible and agile platforms that can be readily expanded and reconfigured to support more sensing and control channels on automated factory floors.","In addition, in motor control and robotics applications, our measurement, control and isolation products are driving improvements in motor efficiency, precision and reliability, while maintaining the highest levels of safety and industrial robustness.","ADI's healthcare solutions span both B2B and consumer applications. On the B2B side, we're enabling higher channel counts and throughput in high-performance imaging systems that lower our customers' overall cost per channel but importantly drive higher ADI content per system.","And on the consumer side of healthcare, our vital signs monitoring technology is enabling highly accurate and ultra-low-power measurements of critical health parameters, improving personal wellness and overall quality of life for the end consumer. Healthcare for ADI is now a high-growth business with its annualized growth rate running in the double digits.","In automotive, our 77 gigahertz RF CMOS radar solution offers a robust platform for ADAS and autonomous driving, giving customers the ability to capture objects earlier, more reliably and with greater precision, and over much longer distances. And our investments in cost-effective, high-performing silicon-based LIDAR solutions are turbocharging our efforts in this area.","These are the types of innovations that ADI is bringing to the market to better serve our customers' needs, and our industry and the market is taking notice indeed. In recognition of our overall innovation efforts, ADI received the 2017 IEEE Innovation Award and was once again selected by Thomson Reuters as one of the 100 most innovative companies in the world.","It has been said that innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower, and ADI is very much at the cutting edge of innovation. This value forms the bedrock of our company's culture and belief system, and is shared equally by Linear Technology.","So with that, let me give you a brief update on the status of the proposed acquisition of LTC. Thus far, we have received six out of seven regulatory approvals needed to close the transaction, and our integration planning teams have been hard at work to combine the best of both ADI and Linear Tech in order to present one face to the customer on day one. I also am delighted that Bob Swanson, the Founder and Chief \u2013 the Executive Chairman of Linear Tech plans to join ADI's board after the deal closes.","So we're all very excited about the combination of ADI and Linear Tech, which we believe will create an analog industry powerhouse that will accelerate innovation and revenue growth opportunities in our core markets of industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure markets, which indeed are the most lucrative markets in our industry.","The transaction is expected to be highly accretive to ADI's non-GAAP earnings per share and free cash flow. And it makes ADI the number one or number two player in all the major analog product categories, enabling us to solve our customers' analog system problems from end to end.","So overall, this was a remarkable quarter across multiple dimensions and we see the momentum continuing into the second quarter.","So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ali for some more details on our performance by end market in the quarter just passed.","Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Vince. So just digging deeper in our results by end market, the industrial market was 41% of revenue. It increased 1% sequentially, which was really very strong in what's typically a much seasonal and slower first quarter compared to the fourth. We didn't really see much of a slowdown over the holidays, and I'd say January order rates were also very strong.","Within the industrial business, industrial instrumentation applications outperformed our expectations, and I'll highlight the ATE market as one that was particularly strong. And also the factory automation sector within industrial had a very good quarter.","Compared to the prior year, the industrial market showed considerable strength. It grew 15% and really was broad-based strength across all of the industrial sectors, so that's a very good result.","On the automotive side, the automotive market at 14% of sales was also better than seasonal. It decreased really only slightly from the prior quarter, but grew a very strong 10% over the prior year, led by really content-rich applications such as infotainment, powertrain and ADAS.","On the communications infrastructure side, revenue there in that market was 18% of sales. Again, it was also ahead of expectations, increased slightly sequentially, and was up 4% over the prior year, led by optical networking.","The consumer market was 27% of sales in the first quarter. It decreased 8% sequentially, which was much better than seasonality, as we saw continued strength in portable consumer applications. And consumer more than doubled over the prior year in the first quarter.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Dave for details of our financial performance in the first quarter and our guidance for next quarter. With the exception of revenue, Dave's comments on the P&L line items are on a non-GAAP basis.","So, Dave, it's all yours.","David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc.","Thanks, Ali. Fiscal 2017 starts out on solid footing, with ADI delivering very strong revenue, profitability, earnings per share and free cash flow. Revenue in the first quarter, as we mentioned, totaled $984 million, and diluted earnings per share was $0.94. Gross margins at 66.1% were above our guidance on a better mix of business and higher revenues.","Inventory, on a dollars basis, decreased $11 million sequentially and days of inventory were within our model range at 101 days, down from 105 days in the prior quarter. Utilization rates in the first quarter were in the high 60s and we're planning to increase utilization to the mid-70s in the second quarter. Weeks of inventory in distribution were lean at approximately seven weeks, which was consistent with the prior quarter.","During the quarter, we recorded a $49 million restructuring charge primarily related to a voluntary early retirement program for certain U.S. employees. Excluding this and other special items, operating expenses increased 7% sequentially, with the entirety of the increase tied to our variable compensation program, which is based on year-over-year revenue growth and operating margin metrics. Nevertheless, operating margins at 35% of sales expanded over 700 basis points compared to the prior year on strong revenue growth and prudent expense management by the team.","Other expense in the first quarter was approximately $26 million. The result of a partial quarter with the permanent financing related to the Linear Tech acquisition in place, we expect our net interest expense to be approximately $30 million per quarter until we close the Linear Tech acquisition. Our first quarter tax rate was approximately 8%, which we expect will be our tax rate until we close, again, on the acquisition.","Excluding special items, diluted earnings per share increased 68% over the prior year to $0.94, as I said. The first quarter was also a strong free cash flow quarter. We generated $286 million in free cash flow, which was an increase of 46% over the prior year. And over the past 12 months, ADI has grown free cash flow 20% to $1.2 billion or 34% of sales. Capital additions in the first quarter totaled $28 million, and we're planning for the capital additions in 2017 to be in the range of $130 million to $145 million.","In line with our shareholder value creation strategy, our Board of Directors approved a 7% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.45 per share, which represents an annual dividend increase to $1.80 per share.","Now turning to our outlook and expectations for the second quarter of 2017, which, with the exception of revenue expectations, is on a non-GAAP basis and excludes known special items that are outlined in today's release. After a record-setting first quarter revenue performance, which was also well above the high end of our guidance range, we're planning for the B2B markets of industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure, in the aggregate, to grow in the mid to high digits sequentially in the second quarter and to increase in the high single-digits over the prior year.","In consumer, we're expecting that normal seasonal patterns will prevail and that this business will likely decrease between 40% and 50% sequentially. Nevertheless, we expect consumer to be up significantly over the prior year in the second quarter.","In the aggregate, we're planning for revenue in the second quarter to be in the range of $870 million to $950 million, which at the midpoint represents year-over-year revenue growth of 17% and would represent the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year revenue growth. Gross margins are expected to increase to be between approximately 66.5% and approximately 67% on higher utilization rates and a more favorable mix.","We estimate that operating expenses will be down approximately 3% to up approximately 1% sequentially in the second quarter. Based on these estimates and excluding any special items, diluted earnings per share are planned to be in the range of $0.74 to $0.86, which at the midpoint would represent very strong year-over-year earnings per share growth of about 25%.","So to wrap it up, the first quarter was a very good start to the year. We had a strong year-on-year revenue growth with quality earnings and cash generation, and we expect this momentum to continue into the second quarter.","So with that, we'll take any questions you have.","Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Dave. And so just a reminder for folks on the line, please limit yourself to one question. And again, if you have a follow-up question, we ask that you re-queue. And again, we do this in the spirit of fairness so that everybody on the call gets to ask at least one of their questions.","So, operator, it's all yours.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good morning, guys. Thanks for letting ask a question. Congratulations on the strong results.","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","Thank you.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Guys, relative to your initial guidance, the big upside in the Jan quarter came out of consumer. Just kind of curious what changed throughout the quarter? Was this really just kind of a better mix with your large consumer customer where that would give you more content on a larger screen? And as you think about kind of the opportunity of that customer, how do we think about content going into the back half of this calendar year? Thank you.","David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc.","So, yeah, I would say that in general, with the consumer customer, sometimes it's hard to totally predict kind of the weekly shipment level through the entire quarter, and so we make an estimate based on what we think will turn through the quarter plus what we come into the quarter with backlog. And there's varying scenarios, I would say, related to how that would go, and this was obviously the most optimistic scenario. So it just turned out better.","I would point out though that we didn't expect nearly the strength we saw in the B2B markets either, and so they contributed to the upside as well. So we're really happy that every end market did a bit better than expectation. So that was awesome.","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","So just to add to what Dave has said there, John, we, as you know, have been working hard to diversify our position and decrease dependence on any single socket. And we have more content in these applications today than we had this time last year, so that certainly helps as well. So we've got more ASP per system, and we continue on the track of diversifying to get more and more sockets in that area.","Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc.","All right, John. Thanks for the question. Next caller, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel.","Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc.","Tore?","Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes. Congratulations on the strong results. It looks like you announced a new distribution agreement overnight. Could you maybe elaborate a little bit on that? And maybe this is an opportunity to just talk about the strategy in disty going forward.","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","Yeah, so we've had a three decade relationship with the distribution \u2013 maybe 25 years with the distribution channel in general. And what we're striving to do, Tore, fundamentally, is we're trying to deepen the level of support and give a better breadth of service for our customers, we have many tens of thousands of customers. So the channel plays an important role, I think, in the broad breadth of logistics, services across the entire suite of customers and, particularly, with the smaller customers, providing a lot of design service.","So basically, we've decided to simplify the structure to enable us to bring the level of support that we desire. And we expect basically to be able to leverage the more focused channel team that we've got and essentially draw on a more comprehensive suite of, in a more focused way, end to end support services that could range from design, design help, also prototyping and of course logistics support over the long term.","So we're also \u2013 we've been investing for all our customers, big and small, over the last several years, by bringing on more direct resource and really understanding the role of the channel. So we're in a good place right now. And of course, when we combine with LTC, we will also have the opportunity to bring more field applications and sales resource to a broader breadth of customers. So overall it's about \u2013 it's part of our fundamental strategy which is about innovation, diversity and operation efficiency, and the moves we're making here play to all three of those facets of our business model.","Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Tore.","Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Very helpful. Thank you.","Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc.","Great.","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","Thanks, Tore.","Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc.","Next caller?","Operator","Your next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with Bank of Montreal.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Thank you very much. Thanks for the update on Linear, Vince. And, Dave, last quarter you had given us an update on the accretion and the tax rate. Now that you've spent quite a fair bit of time in rainy California, I was just wondering how should we think about the top line? And where I was going with this was, at CES, we had some early view on how a go-to-market would look like on a board with Linear and with ADI in a auto (20:26) example. So question is really when should we be expecting it to show up and in what end market should it show up first? Thank you.","David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc.","Well, I would say we get more and more enthusiastic about the opportunities for combining technologies of Linear and ADI every time we meet together as a team. We have kind of loosely built in some expectation that we will get several hundred million dollars worth of revenue synergies with the combined business. Some of that will take some time. I think a lot of it's going to be in areas where the design cycles and the time to revenue is quite long. So it might be out in the 2024, 2025 timeframe where you really start to see us hit our stride. But within the first few years, we'll start to hit and see some revenue synergies and I would point out, that's kind of similar to the path we're on right now with Hittite.","We're starting to see it trickle in a little bit in the early stages. We certainly have seen it build up in the opportunity pipeline for the subsequent years here. So we just get, I think, every time we meet, more optimistic about what we can do as a company in terms of delivering technology.","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","Most of the business of LT and ADI combined is targeted at the core markets of B2B, so we see opportunity. I think at CES you saw how ADAS, for example, combines the power technology of LTC with the mixed-signal technology and RF technology of ADI. But we have examples of that in the industrial automation, the instrumentation, the aerospace and defense. So basically, everywhere we play, including communications infrastructure where ADI is much stronger on the wireless side, LT is stronger on the wired side. There's good symbiosis between the companies, particularly in the B2B space.","And I think the first couple of years of the combination of ADI and LTC are really about how well together we take the pipeline of opportunity that's at unprecedented levels in terms of size at this point in time and convert that pipeline and service the heck out of our customers.","David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc.","I'd also point out that just on the expense side, as we've had time to solidify the plans there, I think we feel very, very confident about our $150 million expense synergy. I talked about this kind of restructuring charge we took this quarter related to this voluntary retirement. Part of that is to kind of make some room as we integrate the Linear Tech people within the company. So in the 10-Q, it talks about a $28 million savings for just the salary and fringe related to those employees. But we find that there's some extraneous savings like travel and so forth that also are reduced.","So I think we have made a pretty meaningful down payment on the $150 million already in advance of even integrating and then, of course, the public company expenses go away pretty quickly too, and that's $20 million, $25 million of expense. So we are very confident now having worked on this and really penciled it out that the $150 million is very achievable.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you, guys. Good luck.","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","Thank you.","Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc.","Thanks, Ambrish. Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks. Dave, you piqued my interest on the Hittite revenue synergy side. Can you give a little bit more detail or anecdotes in terms of some of the things you're seeing from a design or revenue ramp perspective on Hittite?","David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc.","Yeah, Vince will probably do a better job of this. But I would tell you that in areas like aerospace and defense where they were particularly strong, we have pulled a lot of ADI content onto those systems and subsystems. That's been a big win for us. I think we did not appreciate how much opportunity we had in the aerospace and defense area until we really acquired Hittite and had that opportunity. There's a lot of radar capability that's required for the automotive space and we're taking a lot of the capability we got from Hittite to be able to drive into that. The next generation which we've talked about in the past is 77 GHz for ADAS, and I think a lot of the capability that we've pulled in from Hittite has helped in that regard.","Also, I think that Hittite really just didn't have an opportunity to really address the larger OEMs given their size. Around the edges, they might have won a little bit of business but they really weren't breaking into those OEMs in any meaningful way. That's all changed since they became part of ADI, and these are $10 million, $20 million, $30 million opportunities if you do them right. So I think we estimate that we probably have filled in the pipeline to the tune of $100 million of opportunities because of having the two entities combined that we would not have won otherwise.","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","Yeah, so we were running, at the time of acquisition of Hittite, which was just about two and a half years ago now, the revenue stream was roughly $70 million a quarter. So we're running on a percentage basis at a substantially higher level than that right now.","And I think to add to what Dave has said, the conversation with our customers has changed over that period of time. I think Hittite and ADI have gone from being very potent component-level suppliers to really now being able to architect our customer systems in these new, for example, digitally-oriented beam steering systems for radar, for mobile communications infrastructure. We're very much now working at the application level in rather than the component level out.","So I think it's been really a win-win. And as our customers in the analog space in general are dealing with thinner and thinner levels of resource and capability in terms of engineering their analog solutions, we're very, very well positioned. Hittite helps enormously on the RF and microwave side of things, and LT will help us on the analog systems side with the power side of things primarily. So that's I think how to look at it.","Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks.","Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc.","Thanks, Craig. Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Danely with Citigroup.","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey. Thanks, guys. Considering the upside in the January quarter and then the guidance for the April quarter, what should we be thinking about conceptually for seasonal revenue growth in the July quarter? And then maybe give us your expectations, if only relative, for the four basic food groups of end markets for revenue growth this year.","David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc.","Well, seasonally, usually sequentially, the third quarter is up. You tend to see a stronger consumer environment and the rest of the markets either are up or flattish. And then the fourth quarter, generally, is sequentially up again pretty meaningfully because you really start to see the consumer hit.","I'd almost say in this case, we love all our children equally. I mean, I think every end market has the opportunity to grow meaningfully from the prior year. We'll have to see how the rest of the year kind of shakes out, but we start off in a great situation. Our expectations for the second quarter as we look at our backlog, look really good. So this continues into the third and fourth quarter, I think every end market is going to do pretty well for us.","Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Chris.","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys, and congrats on the quarter.","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","Hi. Thank you.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Question on the consumer side. It's clearly been better than your expectations. Could you just talk about how do you think about the segment over the next 12 months in terms of portables versus the rest of the consumer opportunity you have? And I think this gen (29:03) with your largest customer, you had talked about picking up 30% more content. Do you think that's possible again as they go through, I guess, a super-cycle product for the next year or do you see opportunity with your largest customer more in sync with the unit trajectory they have?","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","Well, our consumer business is really a tale of two stories. We have prosumer, which is a more \u2013 it's a business more akin to a B2B type dynamic. So with many customers, many, many very high performance building blocks from DSP to mixed-signal in areas like audio and video signal processing. So we saw some downturn of that business over the last couple of years, but we've kind of hit the bottom. We believe we're at an inflection point there. So that's at least giving us stability. And that's kind of the bedrock of our consumer business in many ways. And so we're at an inflection there.","On the portable side of things, we're clearly in a much better position than we were a year ago. We're working hard, as I said earlier, to diversify to get more sockets and things like the image processing control system, sensing in general. And also, we're engaging with many more customers than we did, I should say, on a pretty constrained, highly-leveraged R&D budget. So look, is it possible that we get another 30% increase? Of course it is, and that's what we're working hard to do, to make sure we grab all available high-quality sockets that our technology is well matched to.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the question, guys, and congratulations on the strong results.","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","Thank you.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","You're welcome. I wanted to follow up on a couple of the segment dynamics, and first, just looking at industrial and communications. Industrial looks like it's at record revenues, at least in my model, and it seems like there should still be some incremental strength that would come from areas like energy extraction, which I suspect may not be as strong as it's been in the past. And on communications, the business has been barely stable for the last four quarters. Is the strength that you're seeing now leading to a more material increase versus trailing fourth quarter levels or are we really just seeing a seasonal bump and nothing more than that? Thank you.","David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc.","Okay. Let me take a shot at it. I'm sure Vince will provide better color than I can give. But I would say you're right in that the industrial business, I think, did hit a record this quarter, which is interesting and the fact that it happened in a first quarter, which tends not to be the strongest industrial quarter for us. So we'll likely hit an even bigger record next quarter in the second quarter, since we expect it to be sequentially up.","I think it had kind of a relatively pedestrian last year and maybe not as strong as we would've liked to see it. There was a few things on the macro side that impacted it. I think those have abated, and when you look at every subcategory within the industrial space, all of them are showing good strength. So I think that while it's early and we're always cautious about this, it does look like it's moving into a period of time where we start to see some meaningful growth. And quite honestly we should. We've made a lot of investments in the market, and there are a lot of opportunities for analog content. And so I think we're starting to see the benefits of a lot of development over a lot of years.","On the communications side, that business had been up. It came back down quite a bit in the prior periods. It had somewhat stabilized in the back half of last year, and we're in kind of what I think is a relatively stable period. Having said that, I do think there's a lot of opportunity in the comm infrastructure space for us. We have this new transceiver \u2013 integrated transceiver that I think is doing quite well. I think we will see our performance on the wireless side be relatively better on the macro side than some of the competition. On top of that, we think that this small cell deployment that has been long advertised and late to the party seems to have really started to gain some momentum here. And so we do expect to see some real traction in 2017 from that.","And then lastly, an area that tends not to get as much focus is our wireline business. And with this kind of 100G deployments \u2013 100 gig deployments that are going on right now, we're benefiting from that. And so our wireline business actually did particularly well this quarter. And so I think there's some expectation that for the next \u2013 rest of the year it will do quite well.","So I don' know exactly how the year will totally shake out yet, we always lack a bit of visibility out beyond the quarter. But I think the fact that it was pretty solid in the first quarter and we're expecting a reasonably good second quarter leads us to believe it'll be a pretty good year for the comms business.","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","Yeah, something we don't talk an awful lot about in our wired business as well is cable infrastructure. And a lot of our new mixed-signal and data converter technologies are enabling the carriers there to realize 4K\/8K video. And without our technology, it is impossible, and to be able to do it within constrained physical space as well as power budgets.","So that's an area that's doing very, very well for ADI in the signal path along with, as Dave said, in the optical control chain. So I think our wired business is poised \u2013 as long as the markets behave well, our wireline business is poised for, I think, very decent growth in the years ahead.","Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Craig. Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Wong with Wells Fargo.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks very much. You mentioned you've got six of the seven clearances you need for the Linear deal. Can you remind us which the six are and what the seventh is you're waiting on, and update of when you expect the deal to close?","David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc.","I'll butcher the six, so let me just tell you the one that we don't have. We certainly have the U.S. We have all the Europe ones. We have all of Asia except for one, which is China. So we're waiting for China to approve it. I think it's well documented that that's a long process, which is why we expected this thing to close around the end of April is because we knew that that would be a long process.","It's going very well. They do ask for a lot of information, and we have to go back and pull the stuff together, present it in a way that is in the format in which they want to see it. And so we think it's going fine, and we would expect that we are on schedule to close this by the end of April at this point.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thanks.","David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc.","Sure.","Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc.","All right. Thanks, David. Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you for taking my question, and congratulations on the great results.","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","Thank you.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","My question is, Vince, on the automotive segment. It's very good to see the sales acceleration over the last couple of quarters despite, I know in the past, you've had some headwind in some products. But when I look at some of your analog peers, say Texas Instruments, they grew their auto business by 20% last year. So my question is when do you think those legacy headwinds will start to abate and you can close the growth gap with some of your peer group?","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","Well, we're \u2013 better and better positions with our customers and across the various applications. But just for the record, our infotainment business grew in double digits over the past year, as did much of our powertrain and battery control technologies as well. So some of our segments have performed well in the double digit area.","I think we've talked before very openly about the fact that we've withdrawn from parts of the MEMS-based safety market, but we still have an important role to play particularly with very, very high-end inertial and gyro-sensing technologies for active safety control. And our ADAS technology continues \u2013 the RF and microwave technology there continues to do very, very well, and we're very excited by the 77-gig technology that we're bringing to market as well that we showcased at CES. And that's a whole new level of performance that we're bringing to market there with 77-gig.","So I think we're better and better positioned. We're doing a lot more business in Asia than we used to do. And so that kind of evens out the distribution or the diversity of our business across the globe. So those are the facts and we continue to invest heavily in the space because we think it is a growth driver for many, many years to come for ADI.","David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc.","And I would tell you that Linear Tech's technology in the battery management system is quite good, and they have seen growth probably in excess of 20% probably in certain years. So I think that we bring that into the fold, that certainly will help just organically drive the growth, but also we should get some pretty good synergies. Where they have good customer traction is in places where we don't, and vice versa. So I think we'll be able to pull each other into customers and engagements that we don't have today. So it should be, I think, a really good growth driver for us going forward.","Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Vivek. Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Congrats on the results. I wanted to ask a question about gross margins. In the quarter in the guide and then also a little bit longer term, I was surprised in the January quarter that it was as strong as it was given that the consumer side was so strong. So I would have thought mix, all else being equal, would have been a little bit of headwind.","And then the inverse, I thought, would've been true in the April quarter where the combination of mix being a tailwind and you just said utilization was going to rise, I thought that might actually lead to a little more upside. So that's kind of the near-term part of the question, if you could give details on that. And then the longer-term one, if we just put Linear and ADI's gross margins together, talk about the deltas above and below that, synergy values, anything else you can capture that makes it more than just one plus one.","David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc.","Okay. So let's start with this quarter. Well, I would say that if you remember through all of last year, 2016, we kept utilization relatively in check and really worked the inventories down because we really wanted to get the days down below 110 days, and we did achieve that by the end of the year.","So like normally coming into the first quarter, we're not as well positioned in terms of inventory levels. And so we end up having to bring utilization down pretty meaningfully in the first quarter, and that didn't happen. So that ended up kind of helping the gross margins. On top of that, the industrial business just did really well through the whole quarter, and so there was really hardly any reason to kind of crank down the fabs in any meaningful way.","The mix part, it actually did impact us a little but I would tell you that, that particular piece of business actually has pretty good gross margins, comparatively speaking, relative to other consumer companies out there. And so it's not quite the headwind when we get it and it's not quite the tailwind when it goes away that you might expect. It might impact it 20 basis points or something.","For the second quarter, as you point out, we should have a little bit better mix and we are bringing up the utilization, although kind of modestly, we'll probably be in kind of the mid-70s. There's obviously \u2013 if the mix goes where the consumer kind of comes down as meaningfully as I said, 40% to 50%, and we do get to the kind of mid-70s kind of gross margins, it's possible that we would be at the really high end of that range. And we'd be up to the 67% range. So that's obviously a scenario. I think we're just hedging ourselves a little bit just in case we can't quite crank the utilization up to those levels, because it does require us to \u2013 well, we have the equipped capacity. We still have to crank through the wafers and sometimes that takes a little while to get cranking.","Okay. Oh, on the longer-term side. Yeah, Ross, sorry about that. So then I think on a blended basis, we're kind of in the high 60s gross margins just kind of out of the gate. And then about $50 million of the near-term synergies that we're expecting will be in the gross margin line. So we should expect to get into the 70% range pretty easily, I think, with the near-term synergies identified.","Honestly, I think longer-term we have the potential to get into low the 70s for gross margins. We will get some \u2013 we inherit some processes from Linear Technology that I think are quite strong. I think that will help out in the entire business. I think we will, over time, get more and more efficient in terms of our manufacturing spending. And so I think that will be beneficial to the gross margin line as well. And of course, I think as Vince had talked a lot about, we are really focused in this B2B space and just quite honestly, because of the design cycles and the technology required to deliver what those customers want, it just carries better gross margins. And so I think we will benefit from that as well. So we're optimistic we can get the gross margins into the low 70s.","Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc.","Thanks, Ross. Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, and congratulations on the solid execution. On the aerospace and defense, obviously, that drives very good diversification within your business. Fundamentals here appear to be fairly solid. I think there're some pretty large radar, some sat com programs that are firing both in defense and in the commercial sectors. I know you guys talked a little bit about the synergies from Hittite, but just wondering in general, how is the A&D sub-segment tracking, growth-wise, on a year-over-year basis relative to the sort of 10% to 15% growth trend in the industrial segment now?","David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc.","Yeah, so I'll just take the last question first. So it's been growing, obviously, at a very healthy clip over the last year or two in kind of the high single digits. I'd say in this quarter, it was probably in kind of the mid to high single digits on a year-over-year basis. And then the rest the question was what, exactly?","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","How do you guys see this business going for the full year?","David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc.","Oh. Oh, for the full year this year?","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah.","David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc.","Probably in that range. I think this is kind of a multiple of GDP kind of growth. It'll be very correlated to how GDP grows. So probably mid to high single digits.","Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks a lot.","David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and I'll echo the congrats on the results. I just wanted to follow up on a question. The B2B business is growing high single digits. If you take out comm, it's more like double digits. You've seen a lot of your analog peers see similar, and it's really a function of the kind of really no seasonality and then kind of growing off that base. Just give us your perspective on the broader markets here as you talk to customers. Why is this market tracking at these double digits? And how do you see that affecting seasonality as you go through the year?","David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc.","Well, I'll talk macro and then I'm sure Vince talks to all of these customers, so he can probably give you some more specific color. But I think last year, it didn't grow that much, and so part of it is just rebounding off of a much slower environment in 2016. So I don't think it's altogether surprising that we would see it start to come back. I would tell you though that I think we have \u2013 earlier in the period in which people have been focusing on this, back in the 2009, maybe even 2008, before I even got here timeframe, we really did focus our R&D efforts largely in this space. And I think we made it fairly public that we moved a lot of our consumer R&D into the B2B space to really focus on that market and particularly the industrial markets.","And so eventually all that development does translate into revenue, as promised. And so I think some of what you're seeing in the results this quarter is that, it's the opportunities starting to translate into revenue more than anything.","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","Yeah, also, while America and Europe are very, very important, they're the bedrock, if you like, of our B2B business, we've been particularly pleased on the industrial side with the growth in our business in Asia as well over the last two or three quarters. So it's broad based and strong in Europe and America, but even stronger on a growth basis in Asia at this point in time.","David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc.","The one thing that helps us get some confidence around this \u2013 I don't want to oversell it just yet because one quarter doesn't make a pattern \u2013 but as you look out in terms of the inventory, particularly using disties as a proxy, it's actually fairly lean at seven weeks. In fact we normally run seven and a half to eight weeks. And for the last, I don't know, maybe four or five quarters, we've been down at this seven-week level and we haven't seen a build. So that's good because that's getting consumed in various regions, particularly in Asia.","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","Also, if you look at the PMIs of the big CapEx spending economies, they've been strong and strengthening over the last several quarters. So that certainly helps the B2B business.","Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc.","All right. Great.

Thanks for taking my questions and congrats, especially on the strength in industrial in the quarter.","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","Thank you.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I had a question about the Linear Tech pending acquisition, and it relates to the biggest concern I hear from investors, which is that there's a view that there are significant cultural differences between the two companies. I'm wondering what you've learned as you've built the plan to integrate the two businesses about the differences and similarities culture-wise and what you see as the biggest risks and biggest opportunities now that you're presumably quite far along in that integration planning. Thank you.","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","Yes. So good question. I would say that something I'm very, very clear about is that what we stand for as companies around the notion that innovation drives business success, that we drive diversity. Diversity gives us tremendous resilience in the markets that we choose, lots of customers, lots of products, lots of different applications. And also we're companies that focus really on getting great free cash flows from our business through operational efficiency, good price management. So those things we share together. Those are kind of the core business values that underpin both companies.","So I would say, clearly there are differences in the way we achieve our goals in terms of the behaviors in the companies, the routines to get the results that we get. And our approach to trying to create something better than the sum of the parts really is to leverage the best of both cultures. And that means basically pooling our business and operating processes together, and we're working hard to figure out what is the best of both on the side of manufacturing supply chain. Obviously, day one it's critical that we have a single voice to the customer, so we're working very, very hard on that.","Also, from an ongoing technology and customer management, manufacturing standpoint, pooling our collective knowledge and wisdom and where we're combining the leadership structures, we're going to start combining the organizations to enable us to achieve those goals. And we're also looking for ways to get the blood of both companies flowing in each other's veins through cross-pollination, through physical co-location as best we can.","And I think what will be very, very clear is that our measurement and reward system will emphasize what we both care about, which is long-term, profitable growth.","So that's essentially how we're approaching things. And I would say I'm very impressed with how both companies are leaning into each other and how we're working to truly try to get the best of both.","David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc.","Yeah, if there's anything we're concerned about, which was one part of your question, I would say we were so enthusiastic about this on both sides and now we've got to wait for all this bureaucracy to kind of take care of itself. So we're a bit anxious to get going and it's just painful to wait as long as we've had to wait to get it done. But I think as soon as it closes, we will be off to the races in terms of making the sum of the parts \u2013 or making the combination more than the sum of the parts.","Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc.","All right.

I was hoping you could talk about how its current position stacks up against the competition and how big of a revenue opportunity you think this could be over the next few years.","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","Yeah, so, I mean, at an application level, to be able to realize these future semi-autonomous and autonomous driving systems, you need lots of different types of eyes out there \u2013 they're looking for the signal, so to speak. So today, radar and camera, the image processing from cameras, they're the important modalities, but LIDAR is becoming a very important modality. And today, that's realized with mechanical systems essentially.","Our approach is to \u2013 so we acquired Vescent Photonics, which enables us to bring a more silicon-based technology to bear, which is fundamentally \u2013 it's inherently more mechanically robust and enables us to apply a level of signal processing to the core sensing and actuation technology to get the kind of resolution and the kind of reliability and performance that we need to get.","So I think it'll be a very important part of the realization of these autonomous driving systems. In fact, I believe that semiconductor process technologies will enable this type of technology to become more broadly deployed. So that's I think the way to look at it.","Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc.","All right. Thanks. Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Cody Acree with Drexel Hamilton.","Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Thanks, guys, for taking my questions, and congratulations. Vince, you've talked about the underlying health of global GDP trends. I guess I'm just curious where you see yourself gaining share in some of the sub applications in B2B versus maybe that underlying market support?","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","Yeah, so if you take core Industrial, I mentioned the fact that we were very pleased with our performance in Asia. I think that's been the result of many, many, many years of customer engagement, good deployment of R&D, and that's working well for us. So I think a certain amount \u2013 a rising tide will lift all boats, so a certain amount of what we're seeing is driven by what's happening in the macroeconomy, but another part of it is driven by what we are doing to position ourselves to take advantage of these markets as they strengthen.","So I'm particularly pleased with industrial, particularly in the automation sector. Dave has talked about A&D and how important Hittite has been to that part of our story. Instrumentation, ATE had a good quarter last one as well. So we're well positioned with high margin, high value, high performance products in that area.","Automotive we've talked a lot about, and the foundation of our B2B business is industrial and healthcare. And both of those areas are performing well, driven by our innovation efforts, our customer engagement efforts and the cooperation of the markets","David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc.","And I think there is a belief by us that the industrial markets are going through a change much like the automotive market is already experiencing, this electrification of cars. There is more and more kind of sensor, signal processing, these kind of IoT-like applications going into the industrial space. So the unit volume of the end product, whatever that might be, a robotics system or whatever, may be still the same number of units, but the amount of analog content and semiconductor content, broadly, within those systems is just increasing as they try to sense these things in richer ways, get better data out of them.","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","To that point, our customers are becoming more and more and more software-oriented, which opens up a tremendous opportunity for us as a leader in the application of analog technology. So the dependence on ADI is increasing where we are essentially, if you like, filling the vacuum for our customers and providing a lot of the analog engineering solutions to these customers.","And as they become more software-oriented in areas like \u2013 I mentioned during the prepared remarks here that we have solved a very, very important problem for our customers, where we can take many, many different types of inputs and outputs across various standards where we've been able to do a level of integration in these universal input\/output systems, which enable our customers to leverage their software across a bigger swath of analog input\/output technology. So that's some of the stuff that's going as we move towards smarter, more software-oriented machines and process automation and factory automation, for example.","Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC","All right. Thank you, and congrats.","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura.","Romit Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Yes. Thank you. So I had a question about the B2B outlook for the April quarter. So I thought industrial is typically up 10-plus percent in April, and I think you guys have said that auto's not too dissimilar. So the fact that you're guiding B2B up mid to high single digits with all the momentum that you're seeing today would sort of suggest that you've got some room to do better. So am I mischaracterizing seasonality? Could you just talk about that a little bit? Thank you.","David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc.","Yeah, so it's more a function of when you're coming off such strong numbers in the first quarter, you're probably not going to have quite the sequential improvement in the second quarter. I think it still drives year-over-year growth that's pretty meaningful, so I don't think there's anything really to read into that other than just the growth off of a very strong first quarter drives it to be a little bit lighter, I think, seasonally.","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","And remember, we're at record levels in our industrial business.","David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc.","Right.","Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc.","Okay. Next question.","Operator","And your next question is from C.J. Muse with Evercore.","C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC","Yeah, good morning. Thank you for fitting me in. I guess two quick questions. The first one, can you share on the OpEx side, you did a great job of managing OpEx in a flat revenue environment in fiscal 2016, curious now that revenues appear to be tracking low double digits at least, how we should think about OpEx. And then secondly, now that business is tracking better, free cash flow's coming in stronger, and before you talked about net leverage of 3.8 times at deal close, I would imagine that number would look better. Would love to get an update from you on that. Thank you.","David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc.","Okay. So on the OpEx front, we're obviously going to lag the revenue growth. Probably we'll outgrow it (59:49) at half the rate, maybe we do a little bit better. Of course all this is prior to the Linear Tech integration, and then we'll probably operate in a similar modality after that.","As it relates to the net leverage, we'll probably be a little bit better coming in. Partially we also have accumulated a lot of cash in the last couple of quarters and we expect to have a pretty good quarter next quarter for cash flow. So I would suspect that we will come in a little bit under what we originally anticipated. I think maybe more importantly is we think the free cash flow is going to be quite strong in this combined business going forward. And so I think we will end up seeing a little bit more rapid paydown of the debt than we originally anticipated. And so in that respect, we should see some benefit on the interest expense line over time, and that certainly will benefit earnings as well.","Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc.","All right. Next question. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from Chris Caso with CLSA.","Christopher Caso - CLSA Americas LLC","Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Just the follow-up on a question on industry conditions and obviously, demand appears pretty favorable now that inventory's low. Do you see any evidence, either within your own business or the industry, of tightening supply conditions? Anything that you think would incentivize the customers and distributors to start bringing the inventory levels a bit higher here?","David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc.","Yeah. No, I think when you look across the supply chain as far as we can tell, when we look at our inventory levels in distribution, they're really at the low end of where we would expect them to be. When you look at the lead times, and we have a goal here of delivering product within four to six weeks, and we're still delivering basically the entirety of our orders within the stated lead times. So I think you always have little pockets here and there but I'd say, overall, things look pretty good. So next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephen Chin with UBS.","Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I also had a follow-up on inventories. You guys mentioned the relatively lean level of seven weeks that the distribution channels were running at. But I was wondering for your direct customers' sales, which is I think about half of your business, can you talk about how the visibility on those inventories look?","And also related to it, going back to the distribution channel, I think traditionally, people look at disty channel inventory as a good sort of real-time or lead indicator of how the overall cycle is doing further downstream. But just with the better kind of just-in-time manufacturing methods and ERP systems, do you guys still think that a lower kind of in-line inventory level in the disty channel is still a good sort of a lead indicator?","David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc.","The answer to the second is yes. It's a decent indicator, although at the end of the day, it's the customer's inventory level of the distributors that really matters. We don't have tons of visibility into that. We look at the same data you do, which is what they report in terms of their overall inventory levels, which includes our products but also includes a whole bunch of other suppliers into those customers. And they look in the range of pretty healthy levels. So I think that at least as we see it today, that doesn't seem to be anything that would lead you to believe there's an inventory issue out there.","I think really how we do and how the industry does is more based on how the macro does and how world GDP does over the course of the next few years. I'd say that's a bigger determinant of how things go.","Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc.","Yeah. All right. So next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Harsh Kumar with Stephens.","Richard Sewell - Stephens, Inc.","Guys, this is Richard in for Harsh. Just wanted to touch on the small cell commentary you had. I know that this has been kind of a well-advertised, but it continues to kind of get pushed out. What's giving you confidence that this is picking up? What are you hearing from customers? And then how does your content look compared to your traditional wireless infrastructure market?","David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc.","Well, we're getting orders, so that's how we know that the small cell is starting to deploy. It's more than just commentary. This is actually, we're getting physical orders and forecasts. So I think we feel pretty confident, unless some \u2013 there was some end demand perturbation or something like that. The content is good. It's reasonably similar to what we see on the macro side on a per-radio basis. The difference is that a macro base station could have 16...","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","A lot more (01:04:33) channels.","David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc.","24 channels, and there's only one channel usually for one small cell. So the idea there is that there'll just be a whole lot more of them deployed in a given region or given area, and that's where we \u2013 we make it up in volume.","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","Yeah. I'd say the ramp up of small cell is really beginning to happen now. But I think it'll hit a different pace over the next year or two years. So it'll be a bigger factor in two or three years' time, but our business is still pretty much dominated by macro cell right now. But as Dave said, the channel ASP, the per-channel ASP is about the same, whether it's a small cell or a macro small.","Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc.","Yeah, and I'd just add, as Vince mentioned in the prepared remarks, we did have a record quarter this quarter in our software defined integrated transceiver platforms. And actually, a lot of that was driven by these small cell deployments there are taking place, I'd say particularly in China right now.","Okay. Looks like we've got one more caller and then we'll close it down.","Operator","Our final question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel.","Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, thanks. I just had one last follow-up and this is on automotive. So instead of looking at sort of the relative growth rates the last year, is there a way for you to talk about dollar content, especially with the Linear acquisition? So what I'm trying to get is, perhaps, maybe now, the content is sort of in the tens of dollars, but then with all these new technologies, you'll eventually be in the hundreds of dollars.","Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc.","Well, the LT, again, look, we have a huge range of ASPs per car given the type of technology we deploy and how much of it gets deployed per car. LT, so we have \u2013 ADI's business is spread across basically gas-driven cars, combustion engines as well as EV and hybrid. LT's is largely electric and hybrid. So it gives us greater diversity, but it depends very much on the type of car, the brand of car. So it's very, very hard to put a number on it, Tore, but it certainly \u2013 we get more diversification, more ASP, on average, virtually in every car that we supply technology to.","David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc.","I would say we did like a quick back of the napkin on it. And I think on a low end, we would get somewhere in the $55 range per car; and on the high end, we could do as well as $500. But if we add Linear to the mix, they should add about $100 worth of content, at least from a SAM perspective. Now obviously, we don't win all that business at every car, but \u2013 so it's quite strong.","Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc.","Great. All right, Tore.","Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc.","All right. For sure. Okay. Great call, great quarter.

Sir, the floor is yours.","Ali Husain","Great, thanks, Jennifer. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the Analog Devices second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. You can find our press release, relating financial schedules, and the investor toolkit, which includes additional information that we believe will be useful for investors and all that is at investor.analog.com. As usual, I\u2019m joined by ADI\u2019s CEO, Vincent Roche; and ADI\u2019s CFO, Dave Zinsner. So, before we start, let\u2019s get recent disclosures.","Please note the information we\u2019re about to discuss, including our objectives and outlook, includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Our comments today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which we have reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in today\u2019s earnings release, which we\u2019ve posted at investor.analog.com.","And with that, let\u2019s get started.","Revenue in the second quarter totaled $779 million, which was up 1% sequentially and down 5% from the prior year. On a sequential basis, our business to business or B2B markets of industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure experienced broad-based demand, growing 9% sequentially and more than offsetting a weak consumer market.","So, let me give you a little color on our performance by end market. While overall macro trends were fairly mixed during the quarter, ADI\u2019s highly diverse industrial markets grew 11% sequentially and represented 49% of revenue. All of the major application areas within industrial such as factory automation and industrial instrumentation grew sequentially in the seasonally strong second quarter and we also had a particularly strong performance in the aerospace and defense vertical. The automotive market at 18% of sales grew 9% sequentially in the seasonally strong April quarter; growth was broad-based across all of our automotive focus applications of safety, ADAS, powertrain and infotainment.","Turning now to communications infrastructure, last quarter we talked to about a nascent recovery in this market and we\u2019re happy to report this trend continued during the second quarter. Revenue from communications infrastructure customers at 23% of sales increased 4%sequentially, with both wireless base station and wireline applications revenues increasing over the prior quarter. After troughing in July of last year, communications infrastructure revenues have grown at a slow and steady pace, and we believe we\u2019re still in the early stages of a recovery in this market. So, in total, ADI\u2019s B2B markets of industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure grew 9% sequentially in the second quarter.","In the consumer market, revenues decreased 37% sequentially. At current quarterly run rates, we believe that our consumer business is at trough levels. In total, consumer represented 10% of revenue in the second quarter.","So, now, I would like to turn the call over to Dave for details of our financial performance in the second quarter. With the exception of revenue and other expense, Dave\u2019s comment on our second quarter P&L line items will exclude special items, which in the aggregate totaled $33 million for the quarter. When comparing our second quarter performance to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior quarter and year-over-year results. And reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their comparable GAAP measures are included on Schedule E in today\u2019s release.","So, with that, Dave, it\u2019s all yours.","Dave Zinsner","Thanks, Ali and good morning everyone. Our strategy to focus on diverse products, customers and markets enabled really good performance in the second quarter. We also repurchased $214 million of our stock in response to price volatility, which enabled the third consecutive quarter of share count reduction. Revenue in the second quarter totaled $779 million, and diluted earnings per share was $0.64 with both results above the midpoint of guidance.","Gross margin of 65.8% increased 360 basis points from the prior quarter, primarily on lower inventory reserves and on factor utilization rates that increased to the low 70s. Inventory on a dollar\u2019s basis decreased $5 million sequentially and on a days\u2019 basis increased to 138 days, as we staged inventory for an anticipated consumer of revenue ramp and manage Hittite related last time buys. We expect both dollars and days of inventory to decrease over the next two quarters.","Turning to inventory in the distribution channel, inventory distribution on a dollar basis was modestly higher than in the prior quarter, and weeks of inventory in distribution decreased to seven weeks from the prior quarter\u2019s seven and a half weeks. Operating expenses increased 3% sequentially to $272 million, in line with our plan. Operating profit before tax of $240 million increased 12% sequentially and as a percent of sales expanded 300 basis points to 30.8%. Other expense in the second quarter was approximately $13 million and that represents the run rate of our net interest expense. Our second quarter tax rate was approximately 12%. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate for the remaining two quarters of the year to be approximately 12.5%. Excluding special items, diluted earnings per share of $0.64 increased 14% over the prior quarter.","Our business franchise forms the foundation of our strong balance sheet. At the end of the second quarter, we had $3.8 billion in cash, net cash of $2 billion and a leverage ratio of 1.3 times EBITDA. We also have $1.7 billion of liquidity in the U.S. which we plan to use for investments in our business and for general corporate purposes including dividends, share repurchases and acquisitions.","During the second quarter, free cash flow as a percent of revenue increased 190 basis points from the prior year to 37.8%. Excluding a onetime item, over the last 12 months, ADI has generated $1 billion in free cash flow. And over this period, we have also returned that $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, effectively returning a 100% of free cash flow, over the past 12 months.","During the quarter, we paid $130 million in dividends to shareholder. And earlier this week, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.42 per outstanding share of common stock. This will be paid on June 7, 2016 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on May 27th. At the current stock price, this dividend represents an annual rate of about 3%.","M&A is a key part of our strategy to accelerate technology leadership and revenue growth. During the quarter, we acquired SNAP Sensor, giving ADI the ability to provide very high dynamic range industrial imaging solutions in smart city and smart building applications.","So in summary, this was a good quarter on several fronts. The diversity and breadth of our business coupled with strong execution enabled revenue and diluted earnings per share results that were above the midpoint of guidance, and our capital allocation strategy enabled a significant return of cash to shareholders.","So, now turning to our outlook and our expectations for our third quarter, which with the exception of revenue expectations is on a non-GAAP basis and excludes special items that are outlined in today\u2019s release. We are planning for another quarter of sequential revenue growth in the third quarter. In our B2B markets, we are seeing stable order rates across the industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure sectors. And as a result, we are planning for aggregate sequential demand in these B2B markets to be largely seasonal in the third quarter. Importantly, we expect our B2B markets in the aggregate to grow in the mid to high single digits on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter.","In the consumer market, good design traction in the portable sector leads us to plan for sequential revenue growth in this market, although it is likely that this revenue growth will be back-end loaded and occur late in the third quarter.","In total, we are planning for revenue in the third quarter to increase sequentially and be between $800 million and $840 million. We expect gross margins to remain stable to their second quarter levels, despite utilization rates in the low -- in the 60s range, as we expect lower spend levels and manufacturing efficiencies to offset the lower absorption. We estimate that operating expenses will be up slightly in the third quarter but that they will lag our expected sequential revenue growth, and we expect even greater operating leverage in the fourth quarter. Based on these estimates and excluding any special items, diluted earnings per share are planned to be in the range of $0.66 to $0.74.","We firmly believe that our future success is within our control. To that end, we are partnering with customers and innovating with impact to drive business success and more importantly, shareholder return. With a strong business model and a focus on the right end markets, we are confident that we can drive ADI\u2019s non-GAAP EPS to up to $5 by 2020.","Ali Husain","Great, thanks Dave. All right, folks, before get to the Q&A, let\u2019s run through the format. Please limit yourself to one question. If you have a follow-up, we ask that you please re-queue and again, we do this in the spirit of fairness that all callers get to ask at least one of their questions. And we plan to run the call until 11. So, I think we\u2019ve got plenty of time to get to everyone\u2019s questions. And so with that, operator, let\u2019s start the Q&A session, and folks on the line can ask questions of either myself, Vince, or Dave or myself.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel.","Tore Svanberg","Just a question on your communications business; you said it\u2019s been steadily improving since I guess almost a year ago now, but that was still in the early days of some good momentum there. So, can you just elaborate a little bit on that, perhaps maybe both on the wireless and on the wireless side please?","Dave Zinsner","Yes. So, Tore, as you point out, I\u2019ll start and Vince maybe finish up. But, we troughed around the third quarter of last year and obviously a lot of the weakness last year was related to China investigation. That seem to run its course and we\u2019ve been steadily improving up to the levels that I think we saw right around in the second quarter of last year. I think our position in the marketplace is quite strong. We literally have any OEM that\u2019s building base stations or wireless infrastructure communication equipment users or radios. We also expect that over the next few quarters, we\u2019ll start to see a more meaningful rollout of small cell activity in China. We think that will be a good growth driver. We have the lead position from a technology perspective in integrated transceivers, which is going to be the technology of choice in that space. So, I think we are in great competitive position. The smart cell activity is going to help drive the momentum just aggregately in the marketplace. And then this whole headwind that we saw in China has started run its course obviously and we\u2019re starting to see the recovery there. So, the momentum and the wind is behind ourselves at this point in communications space. Obviously it can be lumpy at times. But, right now, based on the order flow, we are quite optimistic about the comm space.","Operator","The next question is from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.","Ambrish Srivastava","I had a question on the guidance, and I\u2019m just trying to understand the consumer guidance and we\u2019re notoriously bad in trying to predict Apple [ph] units. But if you look at the guide, it looks like it could be a factor of either lower units than what most of us were modeling for or lower ASP or just the overbuild looks so high that it\u2019s taking a longer time for all that to bleed through the channel; what\u2019s the right way to think about it? Thank you.","Dave Zinsner","I think the way to think about -- I guess you are talking about the third quarter. I think really the third quarter, as you compare it against the third quarter of last year, is really the dynamics around when the buildup is going to occur this year versus when it occurred last year. I think because we were new player in that particular application with a new product, our customer ramped a few months earlier than typical for their semiconductor vendors in an effort to make sure they had everything in the pipeline they needed. I think now, we\u2019re going to be more consistent with most of the other semi-vendors out there that supply into this particular application. And really that means that we really don\u2019t see the demand pick up until the July timeframe. So, it\u2019s probably going to be more of end of third quarter and more into the fourth quarter this time versus last year where it was more of a ramp in the third quarter.","I would point out that we have -- or I should say, we suspect we have more dollar content in that particular application this year versus last year. And so, from a form perspective, we will actually be in a better position. And so, it obviously again depends on how this demand of the end product goes. But, assuming that goes fine, we will actually see pretty good growth.","Operator","Your next question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.","Jeriel Ong","Hey, this is Jeriel on behalf of Amit. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I guess looking to industrial business; it\u2019s been down year-on-year for a few quarters now. It looks like, given guidance, you might grow year-on-year in July quarter. Will we see the growth accelerate, as you get into the back half of 2016 and then into 2017?","Dave Zinsner","Well, industrial is hard to predicted out four weeks. So, I don\u2019t know that we are ready to predict what it\u2019s going to do out several quarters. I would say that yes from our guidance, you can interpret that we suspect the industrial business is going to be up year-over-year in the mid single digits or so, Ali? Yes. And as a result, we think we are back in a recovery phase there. It has been weak probably related to kind of the phenomena around oil and gas weakness and maybe some currency issues; that seems to have run its course. And as a result, we think we are back on our recovery trend in the industrial space. The one area of that business has actually beaten the kind of the macro headwinds has been the aerospace and defense business. That\u2019s done very well for us, even despite the weakness we see out there on the macro side. And as it looks out into the future, it looks like that business will continue to be a pretty strong business for us.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer","Dave, I just want to talk a little bit about the gross margin guidance for the July quarter. If I look on a year-over-year basis, gross margins are going to be down a little bit, year-on-year, despite the fact, that I think you said in your prepared comments that the B2B business should be up actually kind of high single digits year-over-year. Can you just help me kind of square that circle and help me better understand, why margins wouldn\u2019t perform better if B2B is showing such good year-on-year growth?","Dave Zinsner","It\u2019s a good question, John. We\u2019re actually going to bring utilization down in the third quarter into the kind of 60s level; it was actually I think in the 70s last year. And that\u2019s really -- when we look at our inventory levels, even though most of the inventory build was related to things within our control like ramping up or the consumer ramp and also for build up related to some foundry transfers that are going to occur related to our Hittite business, we really wanted to keep inventory in check. And so, we thought it would be a good idea to bring the inventory down in the products to get -- or related to the products that get manufactured internally. So, that\u2019s really why we approached it that way. We\u2019re probably going to bring it down -- I don\u2019t know somewhere 10 percentage point range at least. And that normal would have a 100 basis-point negative impact on us but what we\u2019re going -- what we think we can do is take some of the cost out of the factory in the third quarter. And we think we will make some improvements from an efficiency perspective. And those things combined will offset a lot of that headwind. And as result, we think it will be generally flat.","Operator","Your next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.","Stacy Rasgon","Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to dig a little bit on automotive. Over the last couple of quarters, you sort of talked about expecting a bit of a second half lift in that business, but now you\u2019re sort of talking about seasonal in aggregate for Q3. Frankly, given the rest of the guidance you\u2019re talking about, if industrial\u2019s up like in the mid single digits year-over-year and the overall B2B is up in the mid to high, like I\u2019m coming up with auto probably flat to down year over year, and probably down decently sequentially, which I think would be seasonal. But neither of those seem consistent with a lift in the back half. So you\u2019re sort of backing off on that statement you made previously, or like how should we be thinking about automotive as we move through the rest of the year?","Vincent Roche","Stacy, we\u2019ve had stellar growth. We\u2019ve pointed out before that there is one particular area that we\u2019ve had a headwind. We believe that headwind has a basis. We\u2019ve had good growth in areas like infotainment, advanced driver assistance; in the powertrain area, we\u2019ve had good growth. Specifically in active and passive safety, we\u2019ve had some issues. And as I said, I believe the headwind has abated there. So, my sense is that with the programs we have in place, we will start to see -- we have bottomed out in the auto MEMS area in terms of the decline. So, we will be back on a growth track over the coming months and into the, during 4Q. So, I think the worst is behind us there and will get back into a decent growth pattern from here on in through FY17.","Stacy Rasgon","Is it, your Q3 outlook for auto was probably flat to down year over year then?","Ali Husain","No. Stacy, let me just point out -- let me just make a slight correction here. I think when Dave was talking about mid to high singles in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis, I think the comment was specific to the B2B market. Industrial, we expect to be up on a year over year basis in the very low single digits. And so, as a result, I think when you look out to the third and fourth quarter, what we\u2019re expecting to see the automotive business, it is to see some modest year over year growth that we think we can accelerate through the back half of the year here. It hope that helps; does that help?","Stacy Rasgon ","Yes, thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Craig Hettenbach","Thanks. Just a question on the increase in cash return, just really setting up the last couple of quarters, I mean clearly you guys are generating a lot of cash and have a very strong balance sheet. But, just wanted to kind of get your sense of how much is opportunistic versus how much may be providing a read on the M&A side, what might be out there and how you\u2019re approaching that?","Dave Zinsner","We still have $3.8 billion of cash. So, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s massively influential to how we\u2019re thinking about M&A. We\u2019re still interested in acquisitions and that part of our strategy. Obviously, we have a high bar on those acquisitions, so they don\u2019t come every quarter. But, we do want to have some dry power available to us, to make those opportunistic acquisitions that A, can be very strategic for us in terms of driving growth and they are very synergistic with what we\u2019re doing from a customer perspective but B, also deliver a very good financial performance and hopefully accelerate our earnings growth.","As far as, just the level of buyback that we had in the last couple of quarters, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a couple of things. One, it\u2019s somewhat programmatic, in that when the stock has these dips in the stock price, we take advantage of that and buy stock back. And so, I\u2019d say over the last couple of quarters, there were those periods of time where that happened and on the average, we bought a bit more back than we had been in the past. And also, we just fundamentally believe that best is yet to come for us. And we think that $5 target is a doable target for us. And if that\u2019s a doable target, then buying at this price is a pretty attractive price. So, those two things combined drove us to be a little bit more aggressive with the buyback over the last couple of quarters, kind of in response to both the stock as well as our expectations on value.","Operator","And your next question is from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.","Craig Ellis","I wanted to follow up on the increase on both automotive and industrial. Those businesses in the outlook look like they are back to nice year-on-year growth. So, my question is since those are both businesses that have significant application diversity, where are you seeing the strongest year-on-year gains? And where within those businesses do you still have sub segments that would be below last year\u2019s level and what\u2019s the prospect for those to reach new highs? Thank you.","Vincent Roche","Well, specific to the industrial area, we have seen tremendous growth in the aerospace and defense area over the last number of quarters. That\u2019s been also both through the acquisition of Hittite; that\u2019s helped us a lot. We have been able to combine the franchises of both companies and keep more growth up there. I would say broad-based instrumentation across the globe has done well. And if you extract oil and gas from the factory and process automation sight of things, we have seen good growth there too. And geographically, I would say in the recent term here, both the Europe and China have seen particularly strong growth. On the kind of the muted [ph] side there, I would say, on the slower growth side of things, the automotive test equipment and energy sectors have been more turbulent. Energy is flatter but the ATE things are quite turbulent. So that\u2019s kind of the picture in terms of the puts and takes on the markets, the sub sectors and geographies there.","As I said earlier in terms of automotive, we have seen stellar growth in infotainment, in powertrain and advanced driver assistance. And we have been dealing with this headwind on the automotive safety, the passive safety and active safety side of things. Geographically, if I look at automotive, again, America has been very respectable, Europe has been stronger, and China and Japan have been relatively flat. So that gives you, I think a picture of both of those sectors from a sub segment and geographic standpoint.","Operator","Your next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.","Vivek Arya","Just on the Q3 outlook, I think you may have addressed it at different parts of the call, but could you just give us some more color on each of the B2B segments, how you expect them to trend on a sequential basis? And more importantly, how that compares to what you thought say two or three months ago about those segments? Thank you.","Dave Zinsner","Yes, sure I can take a crack at it. So, industrial, I would say sequentially is probably going to be up in the low single digits. Automotive is likely to be down in the low single digits. I would point out that that\u2019s probably better than what you normally see seasonally, even we have July in our quarter and that tends to be a soft month for the automotive market. And then comm is probably close to mid single digits, somewhere in that range.","I would say, it\u2019s pretty consistent with where we thought we would be a few months ago. Nothing has changed. The macro is hanging in there nicely. The water flow in all three of these markets has been pretty good. We are obviously always running the business cautiously, any event that something in the macro gives us a hiccup, but that hasn\u2019t happened. And we are I guess pleasantly surprised or happy that that\u2019s how things panned out for us. And so hopefully this continues.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Smigie with Raymond James.","Vince Celentano","This is Vince Celentano on for Steve. I had a question, has there been any more progress in gaining your force touch technology adopted at OEM, either within mobile or other end markets? I guess in general, what\u2019s your plan going forward with this technology?","Vincent Roche","That product source is based on a core technology that we use in multiple applications and industrial automotive and so on and so forth. So it\u2019s not a case -- the product sector is specific to one application but the technology is usable in many, many different applications. It\u2019s based on our precision signal processing expertise that we have been developing for decades. So, as I said, we are all the time looking to diversify, be it consumer be it industrial but whichever sector, all those products are based upon the core high performance precision signal processing platform that we have been developing for decades.","Ali Husain","Vince, just as a point, we don\u2019t comment on individual customers or products. So, appreciate the question, but will move on our next.","Operator","Your next question is from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. ","Ross Seymore","Hi guys, you gave great color on the wireless side of your comms business. Can you just give us a similar update on what you are seeing in the wireline side? And maybe remind us what the split between those two portions of your comms business end up being these days.","Dave Zinsner","Yes. So, two thirds of our business is wireless and then the other third is wired. There are several applications within wired but probably the most prominent is control that goes into the optical signal. Obviously that market is doing quite well because there is a move towards 100G and that\u2019s obviously beneficial for us. So, it\u2019s been on a pretty steady -- so, good news on this one is it hasn\u2019t had the lumpiness that the wireless business has had. So, it\u2019s been on a pretty steady growth trajectory. It moves around based on seasonality but year-to-year, it\u2019s been pretty steady and solid.","Vincent Roche","Yes. We\u2019ve been successful moving between the various generations of optical transceivers from 2.5 gig right up to a 100 gig now and beyond. So, we\u2019ve built a nice franchise, again based on our signal -- our position signal processing portfolio where we are providing sophisticated very, very precise control of the optical signals. So that\u2019s the primary part, as Dave said, of our wireline business. Other aspects in which we have a good position are in the data packs and control packs in cable infrastructure, but far wireline is dominated by the optical technology that we -- the optical products that we provide.","Operator","Your next question is from Romit Shah with Nomura Securities.","Romit Shah","I just wanted to talk about consumer -- my understanding is January 2015 was the last quarter before you guys started booking force touch revenues. And in that quarter consumer was about $95 million; this last quarter consumer was down to $80 million. So, it implies that the business overall has got about 16% from that January 2015 baseline. And I guess excluding force touch, your legacy consumer business is down even more than that. And so, hoping that you can guys talk about the performance of that business and legacy consumer in particular and your expectations going forward.","Vincent Roche","Legacy consumer has been for -- it\u2019s a huge number of different applications. We have a steady strong business in areas like high-end digital consumer for home and for enterprise and that\u2019s been doing well and continues to do well. It\u2019s a very, very modest investment for the Company. So, my sense is that\u2019s been growing at kind of low single digits for many, many years. My expectation again given that it looks a lot like our B2B business in terms of design cycles, product cycles, that will continue to be a modest growth story for ADI in the years ahead. And it leverages; we do very, very little specific product development for that sector. In terms of the remainder of the business, it\u2019s lumpier by nature. And we have a good -- as best we can tell, we read the signals pretty well and we\u2019re managing supply and demand on the basis of what we\u2019re reading in those more volatile portable consumer applications.","Romit Shah","I appreciate the comments. I don\u2019t that I\u2019m coming away with the clear understanding for why the legacy business has contracted this much over what\u2019s been about five or six periods.","Dave Zinsner","Well, it has been a headwind for six years or so, six or seven years, so, mainly because of the digital still camera business which has been kind of -- obviously everybody is using their phones to take most of their pictures. And so that business is waned a bit. It\u2019s down at this point now as we sit in 2016, pretty nominal level at this point. And so, I wouldn\u2019t anticipate it being much of a headwind going forward. There is a certain amount of people that will always buy new digital SLR cameras. I\u2019m looking at Ali because he\u2019s one of them. So, I think at this point now it\u2019s probably stabilized.","Operator","Your next question comes from Doug Freedman with Sterne Agee. ","Doug Freedman","If I could ask a question regarding the consumer business as well, when we look at sort of the business coming back in with handsets contributing materially here, how do we think about the incremental margin, both up but as well as when it ramps down, especially given the actions you seem to be taking as far as managing the factory, which may be not coincident with the fab with the ramp up that you are going to see in revenues?","Dave Zinsner","So, this -- all of this product gets manufactured in a foundry, a third-party foundry. So, it doesn\u2019t necessarily affect utilization levels. So, really, it comes down to what we price the product at and what we pay the foundry in the back end to produce the parts. And the margins are respectable margins. And there is a little bit of mix degradation by having that business, but it\u2019s not significant. I think it runs in the tens of basis points, up or down, based on whether we have it in a quarter or we have a meaningful amount of a quarter or not a meaningful amount of quarter. But other than that, I don\u2019t would expect we have much volatility gross margins from it.","Doug Freedman","I guess another way, Dave, just to ask the question, if you were to exclude the impact of this business year on year, do you expect gross margins to be up next year?","Dave Zinsner","Excluding consumer, would we expect gross margins to be up?","Doug Freedman","Yes, to exclude the impact of the consumer ramp up and ramp down, would I expect some gross margin improvements year on year?","Dave Zinsner","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Danely with Citi.","Philip Lee","Good morning, guys. This is Philip Lee calling on behalf of Chris. You guys have mentioned just the inventory was down seven week this quarter. How was this versus may be last year and how do you expect it to turn for the rest of the year?","Dave Zinsner","Typically, the second quarter tends to be a trough of the inventory levels just because it tends to be a really big quarter for ship out and we\u2019re kind of on a ship in basis kind of running it pretty consistently. So, I wouldn\u2019t glean to much from it, other than the fact that it\u2019s at a healthy levels, seven weeks is exactly where it should be in the second quarter and not very healthy. My guess is that in the third quarter, it will start to trend back up to seven and half weeks and stabilize until next year second quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. On the strength in industrial, you mentioned aerospace and defense as an area of particular strength. Was this segment up year over year and was it more commercial or defense related programs that are driving the strength? I know that there are some programs, both in commercial satellite and radar, there is also some defense program initiatives like some fighter jet upgrades and so on, and what the program pipeline looks like for the reminder of the year? Thank you.","Dave Zinsner","Okay, I\u2019ll take a little bit of crack at that and anybody can join in. It was up year-over-year in the second quarter like we will be up year over year for the full year, unless something changes significantly. Most of the growth that we\u2019ve seen has been in high performance RF specific to military applications. We\u2019ve got a lot of that technology obviously when we acquired Hittite; they were already servicing that market in a relatively meaningful way. And their design wins over several years ago are starting to translate into revenue. And that\u2019s obviously driven the growth in that business. The expectation over the next three to five years is quite positive. I think the areas that where radar applications are deployed are areas where the military is spending more in. And so as a result, that coupled with the fact that how we have a really commanding position in that marketplace, we thus assume that this market for us is going to be a nice driver of growth over the next three to five years.","Vincent Roche","Commercial aircraft, another space where more and more of our technology is being used for all different kinds of signal processing radio upgrades, control and so on and so forth. And also satellite, commercial satellite is an area that\u2019s becoming more and more dominant, if you like and particularly for commercial application. So, I think overall when you look at what\u2019s been happening and what will happen, that aerospace and defense business will continue to grow for the company at good rates.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.","Mark Lipacis","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Perhaps for you Dave; you were successful in the past in finding tax efficient ways to use overseas cash for M&A. And I was wondering if you would describe the M&A environment today as being a target rich one and of the targets that you\u2019re looking at, is there a good potential to use overseas cash tax efficiently, like you have in the past? Thank you.","Dave Zinsner","Good question. Well, I mean there are lots of ideas in the pipeline; it goes through a number of stage gates. And as it gets closer and closer to the point at which we\u2019re going to pull the trigger on it, those bars get higher and more difficult to get through. So, I think that from an ADI prospective, I don\u2019t think anything has changed in terms of whether you see us to a kind of acquisition on a very frequent basis; I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s our model. But, there are areas that we think make a lot of sense in terms of acquisitions and those are the areas we\u2019re focused on. And so, I expect, we\u2019ll be doing them from time to time to help augment what we\u2019re doing organically. From a tax perspective, it\u2019s always that specific as to which cash we can use, it depends on where it\u2019s located and where their operations are and so forth. But, the extent that it checked all the boxes, I am sure we could do something similar to what we did with Hittite.","Operator","And your next question comes from Ian Ing with MKM Partners.","Ian Ing","I had a question on Hittite. I mean what was the magnitude of the last time buys in the April quarter? What are the expectations in subsequent quarters? And as customers start looking at developing 5G infrastructure, are there some opportunities here for Hittite and microwave products? I know largely microwave is for back haul at the moment in communications? Thanks.","Dave Zinsner","Yes. Hittite will help us a lot in the 5G space. And given our strong position in 4G and our strong relationship with all the OEMs who are developing 5G application, we think we are in a great position to really take a commanding position in the 5G space. On the -- I don\u2019t have the number off the top of my head, unless you know Ali off the top of your head, but second quarter represent a peak amount of builds that we were going to have associated with Hittite. And so as quarters progress now, it should slowly be coming down. I am going to guess it added somewhere between 7 and 10 days to our inventory levels because of those transitions. And as I said, you\u2019ll see a kind of a steady progress. So, one thing is we built up a lot of inventory for stuff that has long lifecycle. And so, it will take some time for us to get all the way down to zero, I think five years, maybe even seven years to get down to zero. But the good news is that the headwind expect of the inventory build is behind us and that will become the tailwind going forward.","Operator","Your next question is from Stephen Chin with UBS.","Stephen Chin","A question on the communications wireless business; I was wondering just given some of your comments around small cells, I was wondering if you could talk little bit about your revenue sensitivity to deployments regarding small cells versus base stations, just given the different levels of content and also the unit deployment? And also, do you have any visibility to put beyond the current quarter, regarding CapEx for either small cells or macro base stations?","Vincent Roche","Yes, I think we are in a very good position in both macro cells and small cells. There is -- more and more of the usage of seller equipment is in building, there may be a switch to small cells over time, but it\u2019s not going to be a gross switch from macro to small. I think there is always going to be a mix of both. So, we are very well positioned, irrespective of whether our customers are deploying macro or small cells. And in terms of content, obviously the small cell has less content than the large cell but we have in terms of the radio we\u2019ve got almost the entire radio in the small cell, given the strength of our software defined transceivers technologies. So, I think what you will see is the deployment will be -- will continue on the macro side, there will be an upsurge in small cell over the remainder of this year into next year. And we are very well positioned irrespective of whether it\u2019s macro or small. What was the second part of the question?","Stephen Chin","CapEx.","Vincent Roche","CapEx, I think the way to look at the CapEx discussion is in terms of innovation. Innovation in play stations is really happening at the radio level to increase spectral efficiency and flexibility. So, there is an increasing amount of the hardware spend going into the radio over time. And with the strength that we have in the franchise, we have got in terms of mix signal and RF and microwave technologies, I think we are very well positioned given the strength of our relationships and the fact that we skewed R&D over the last five years more heavily towards wireless applications. Irrespective of what happens, I believe it will be a fairly stable CapEx environment in terms of the ratio of services software and hardware. But, I think we are well positioned as a Company to grab additional share there, given, as I said, the strength of our technology and customer positions.","Operator","Your next question is from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.","Ambrish Srivastava","I just had a couple of follow-ups. Just on the A&D strength, is this more primarily a Hittite benefiting from your channel or is it more a result of the last time buys? And then, a little bit longer term, when do we expect to see jointly developed products between Hittite and ADI? And I realize it takes a while for that to pan out. And then a second quick follow-up, Dave, you mentioned that in consumer you will have more content. Is that because you are -- imagine ASD going up, are you designing out sockets from that somebody else had?","Dave Zinsner","So, on the aerospace and defense side, I would say -- I would characterize the growth as product design back in the Hittite days in lot of cases, some on our own products back many years ago that now -- it takes a while for that stuff to turn around and become revenue. And so that\u2019s really what\u2019s driven the performance at this point. It hasn\u2019t been related to Hittite being a part of ADI yet. The opportunity pipeline has significantly expanded because of the acquisitions of Hittite and because of our ability to both sell more of what Hittite sells or makes into that market and also what we make and drive that into that market. And so, I think that we\u2019ll start to see some revenue synergies next year and probably relatively modest next year but begin to ramp significantly over time. And it\u2019s probably on the opportunity side of peak revenues; it\u2019s probably $100 million of opportunity, so not all of that will close on. But, it\u2019s a significant amount of synergies that we were able to get by combining to Hittite and Analog Devices.","Vincent Roche","Yes, in terms of your product development question, the combination of Hittite, maybe on the design side of things, we acquired the technology to enable us to broadly apply microwave technology and build a real leadership franchise in the high end of communications infrastructure, general communication, even industrial instrumentation. So, we already have very, very good synergy between the design teams and looking at the next 5G application; in the 5G application, the next generation of defense driver assistance where there is a lot of microwave technology needed. So, we will start to see the first combined products hit the market over the coming year. And beyond there, I think you will see more complete solutions from ADI, the combination of the old ADI and Hittite together in many, many different markets.","Dave Zinsner","Okay. So, then on the consumer side, we can\u2019t comment specifically on whether or not we are displacing somebody, and if so, who. But I can tell you that we have more sockets in the next generation than we did in the last generation. And that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the bomb to be higher at this time.","Ali Husain","And Ambrish, just slight housekeeping note from me. When you talked about the last time buys, those are last time buys that we made on foundry. So that didn\u2019t impact the revenues really in the aerospace and defense side. So, okay, thanks for the question next caller.","Operator","The next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.","Stacy Rasgon","One more quick follow-up on consumer; you said that the ramp was going to happen late in Q3, which seemingly would imply potentially a fairly big Q4 sequential ramp, as you annualize that or can you give us some feeling for what the trajectory of that consumer business into Q4 ought to look like? And do you think that it could be -- would it be up or would it be down year-over-year versus last year, because I think Q4 of last year was the peak?","Ali Husain","Yes. Definitely, hard to predict exactly how the trajectory is going to work out. But, I would say, it\u2019s going to be -- you could, if we end up shipping in the last, say two or three weeks of July, we are going to probably be shipping at that level through the entire fourth quarter. So, you can interpret that what you want, but it\u2019s going to be a meaningful ramp in the consumer space in the fourth quarter, at least as things have lined up so far.","On a year-over-year basis, I think given the fact that there was probably a shift in I think you can safely say in the fourth quarter versus what was consumed and that drilled a lot of inventory in the channel. I think on a year-over-year basis, we\u2019re likely to be down in the consumer space. But, I think from a sequential basis, it will look quite nice.","Stacy Rasgon","And so just to clarify, so we\u2019re talking something like $30 million sequential increase in Q3, all of which maybe happening potentially in last couple of weeks? So, I think if we are annualizing that for three months in the following quarter, if you are shipping at that rate, I mean this could be -- you were talking something like a $100 million and maybe more sequentially into Q4 that we could see in terms of increase. Is that the right way to think about that?","Ali Husain","It\u2019s obviously tough to predict but you are probably in the zip code at this point.","Stacy Rasgon","Okay, thank you.","Ali Husain","And by the way, if that did happen as Dave mentioned I think in the prepared remarks, the operating margin leverage we expect to see in the fourth quarter would be pretty strong.","Alright, thanks Stacy. Next caller?","Operator","Your next question is from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer ","Just staying on the topic of consumer and for both Dave and Vince, investors have been somewhat critical about your exposure here over the last two or three quarters, because it tends to be volatile, it tends to be commoditized; we always worry about how long you can hold on to the business. You guys have done sort of a great job talking about the trajectory for this fiscal year. And when you initially got this business, I think you talked about two years of visibility. I\u2019m wondering if you could just talk longer term how we should think about the consumer bucket. And Dave, you\u2019ve talked about in the past your need just to be strategically engaged with certain customers to broaden out your footprint. Maybe you can talk about your ability to have broadened out that footprint with this customer as we go into FY17?","Dave Zinsner","Yes. So, obviously, they don\u2019t give us a ton of visibility, but next year, it\u2019s as much as we can tell looks to be in pretty good shape for 2017 for this customer. And as I said, we actually got more socket this time around and healthy prior socket all of which are high performance parts that -- and that\u2019s really we are trying to focus on with that customer or any customer, quite honestly not only in the consumer space, but outside of the consumer space in the B2B markets. And that we\u2019re going to maintain that strategy going forward. And I think there is enough to win at that customer in the consumer space to drive growth in the consumer business. And as you point out longer term, there -- and it\u2019s not even just this particular customer but there are a handful of customers that have certainly consumer exposure, but that are more broadly focused in other markets, because a lot of this stuff is conversing. And so, we want to be attached to those customers as they think of new ideas that we can come up with new technologies to help to find their parts and make them better. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. And so that\u2019s where we direct our research and development dollars. It worked out for us here. And like I say, there will be other things that we do for this customer and other customer and other markets that will help them and help us.","Vincent Roche","As the user experience becomes more and more sophisticated in these applications; that\u2019s in our wheelhouse. We play on the edges of physical and the digital. So, it gives us more opportunity. But, as Dave pointed out, we\u2019re looking for the really hard to solve problems in these applications were we can, hopefully get multiple generations worth of momentum and where we can get the kind of margin performance ratio that we expect.","Operator","Your next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for letting me ask another question. Just, Vince, longer term, is the current top line growth rate acceptable to you, and if it is not, do you think it\u2019s time to consider larger and more transformative acquisitions? And how do you think about whether it\u2019s accretion metrics or anything else that we should keep in mind, because the macro environment stays somewhat sluggish, and you managed to navigate through that quite well. But, I\u2019m just curious whether even with this navigation, is the top line growth acceptable to you? And if not, what can you do about it?","Vincent Roche","We\u2019ve said publically that we are committed to generating over $4 of EPS by 2020; we remain committed to that. And when we first offered that target to the investor community back in \u201814, we said that we expected our revenue, our top line to grow at the rate of two to three times GDP, whatever that is. And we remain optimistic about that. We\u2019re investing at a level in terms of R&D and field engage -- customer engagement, and given what we see in terms of the design activity, the customer engagement activity, we remain committed to that top line target. Another component of obviously being able to get towards that EPS target over time is to do careful M&A. And so that is the mix. And we\u2019re committed to our targets; we believe in the growth story. And as I said, we\u2019ll use our balance sheet wisely to get some more high performance technology that will enable the Company to grow at an even greater rate over time. ","Dave Zinsner","As far as the acquisition measures we use, there\u2019s probably 15 of them that we use. Obviously accretion plays a factor in it. We look at kind of the relative valuation of the cash flow of a business that we\u2019re looking at to determine whether we\u2019re paying a good price for it. We want businesses that grow and that help us drive our growth faster than we are growing today, so that\u2019s a key component that we believe that that can happen. And obviously we think -- we\u2019re looking for things where we can get synergy, sometimes that\u2019s cost, sometimes that\u2019s cost and revenue. And so those are things that kind of influence us. Sometimes when we\u2019re doing tuck-ins like SNAP Sensor, which we talked about in the prepared remarks, there isn\u2019t much in terms of financial to hang your hat on in the early stages. And so then it really comes down to whether or not the technology really moves to make a difference in our customers\u2019 applications and ultimately the user experience. And that tends to rule the day, when it comes to those tuck-ins.","Vivek Arya","Is there any push from customers to have more integrated solutions? That\u2019s where I was coming from, that is you\u2019re the leader in converters, does it help to gain access to other areas, because that\u2019s what your customers might be asking you to do?","Dave Zinsner","Yes, it\u2019s integrating all the time. We\u2019re developing -- we\u2019re moving in more and more to a system\u2019s levels solution. And so that requires us to have more and more technology, some of which we do acquire, a lot of which we actually build internally.","Vincent Roche","I think what we acquire depends very much on the type of segment we\u2019re addressing. The reason we bought SNAP Sensor was to help us move up the stack to make our solution more complete. We\u2019ve got a very strong DSP high performance signal processing technology platform and product base on to which we needed to add some algorithmic value in that particular imaging application. So, what we acquire and what customers are asking us to do very much is application and market segments dependent.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Smigie with Raymond James.","Steve Smigie","Great, thanks for the follow-up. So, last quarter you mentioned that orders were positive but that customers were a little bit worried about the overall weaker macro. Have you seen any changes in their in general outlook since the last call?","Dave Zinsner","No, I think they are pretty much the same; they are cautiously optimistic. The macro is held in there, the order flow has been good. Customers think they are going to -- I think in aggregate think they are going to see modest growth this year. But, they\u2019re obviously very cautious; they are keeping their inventory levels lean. We see obviously that at the [indiscernible] level as well. So that\u2019s -- I think it\u2019s pretty consistent through the whole year really.","Operator","Your next question is from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore","Dave, one follow-up to a question you answered earlier on the gross margin side. I know you said you are taking utilization down by roughly 10% sequentially in the third quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about why you are doing that considering that you said that the comms business is in the early stage of recovery; you\u2019re now past the headwinds on the auto side where you had the design loss on the passive safety et cetera. If everything in your core is starting to grow year-over-year, what led you to the decision to cut utilization that substantially?","Dave Zinsner","I mean I know that\u2019s significant, but we had a 138 days of inventory and we want to get that level down, and we felt like we should address it now rather than wait. I would -- like I said in the prior question or answer to the prior question, I think a lot of the inventory is related to product that was manufactured in foundry, but nevertheless, we\u2019ve got work all of the levers to get the inventories to where want them to be. And it seems like an appropriate place to pull it down.","The comms one doesn\u2019t influence us a ton because there isn\u2019t much of that that gets done in internal foundries or internal fabs. Really, it\u2019s in the industrial space, which is kind of plugging along kind of a low growth rate at this point. So, it seemed like we weren\u2019t taking a big risk by adjusting the production. I would say that, I think it\u2019s a one quarter event. When you take down inventory levels, you take down the utilization rates generally, you shut the factory down. And so we will be taking I think on average two weeks of shut down in our internal fabs. I would suspect that we will be back to not doing that in the fourth quarter. And so utilization should come back up again in the fourth quarter.","Ross Seymore","And one other housekeeping one. You were gracious enough to say your content is going up with a specific customer. Relative to what you had in the prior generation, did the content increase just order of magnitude a similar amount ass the prior socket, half, double; any sort of color directionally would be helpful.","Dave Zinsner","Yes, I probably have to avoid these kind of pricing and things. It\u2019s not to the level of the prior socket; let\u2019s put it that way. ","Ali Husain","Well, it looks like Ross was our last question, so that will close out the call. As a remainder, our third quarter 2016 results will be issued on August 17 at 8:00 a.m. similar to this quarter, and we will have the earnings call at 10:00 a.m. So that does it for us here. Thanks for joining us this morning, and look forward to talking you soon.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s Analog Devices conference call.

I\u2019d like to now introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Mr. Ali Husain, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.","Ali Husain","Alright. Good morning and thanks, Jennifer. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining the Analog Devices second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. So let\u2019s get through our disclosures. Note the information we are about to discuss, including our objectives and outlook, includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call and we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.","Our commentary about ADI\u2019s second quarter financial results, are adjusted for special items. When comparing our second quarter results to our historical performance, special items are also adjusted in the prior quarter and year-over-year results. Available reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today\u2019s earnings release and on our web schedules which we have posted under the quarterly results section at investor.analog.com.","As many of you know, we have completed the Linear Tech acquisition about halfway through our fiscal second quarter. And so we have included reconciliations in our Investor page that provide a greater level of detail into our standalone and combined results for the quarter. But at a high level, I will say that Linear contributed $208 million to our non-GAAP second quarter revenue. This number includes $60 million of purchase accounting adjustments that were made for U.S. GAAP purposes and relate to Linear Tech inventory that was in the distribution channel in North America and Japan when we closed the acquisition.","At the end of the second quarter, there remains an additional $30 million of Linear inventory in the distribution channel, which we expect will be sold in its entirety in the third quarter. We have included this adjustment in our non-GAAP revenue expectations for the third quarter and no such adjustments are anticipated starting in the fourth quarter. And then the last point I will make and its information you should be mindful of is that the first quarter of our fiscal 2018 will be a 14-week quarter.","Okay. So, with all that behind us, about to get the show on the road, I will turn it over to ADI\u2019s CEO, Vincent Roche. Vince\u2019s comments on the second quarter are for standalone ADI unless he specifies otherwise. And our business outlook for the third fiscal quarter relates to the combined company. Okay. Vince, all yours.","Vincent Roche","Thank you very much, Ali. Good morning, everyone. Well, it\u2019s been a very busy period for ADI and I am pleased to share our results with you. Not only were our second quarter financial results stellar, but we completed the acquisition of Linear Tech in March and our integration work is going very well.","So, let\u2019s start with our financial results for the second quarter. ADI\u2019s standalone revenue came in at $1 billion, a 2% sequential increase and a 28% increase over the prior year. These results were above our revised guidance on broad-based strength and we continue to see signs of a good business environment, particularly in the industrial market. Gross margins expended to 67.6%, which was above the high end of our guidance and the combination of higher sales, higher gross margins and tight control over operating expenses helped to expand operating margins to a robust 36% of sales. In addition, free cash flow margins, as a combined company, were also strong at 39% of revenue in the second quarter. As Ali mentioned, Linear Tech was part of ADI for about half the quarter and contributed $208 million in sales on a non-GAAP basis. And we are looking forward to a full quarter\u2019s contribution in our third quarter.","Now, let me give you some details of our performance by end market during the quarter and note that my remarks relate only to standalone ADI. The industrial markets at 46% of sales grew 15% sequentially in the seasonally strong second quarter and continued its year-over-year growth trajectory, increasing 20% over the prior year. Sequential revenue growth was broad-based across all industrial sectors and indeed regions.","While business conditions are certainly more positive than they were at this point last year, our success is also the result of smart R&D investments across diverse industrial applications within factory automation, instrumentation, aerospace and defense and healthcare. Over several decades, ADI has carved as a leadership position in high performance signal processing, serving our tens of thousands of industrial customers where applications demand the highest levels of performance both in terms of signal chain and in terms of power optimization.","In the near-term, our industrial customers are excited to gain access to the highly complementary portfolios of ADI and Linear Tech and are even more excited at the future of value creation opportunities made possible by our combination. The automotive market represented 15% of our sales in the second quarter and grew 8% sequentially and 9% over the prior year. Both sequential and year-over-year growth was broad-based across all automotive application areas and was strongest in safety and ADAS applications, while powertrain revenue increased, but at a slower pace. We supply thousands of products into dozens of automotive sub-applications and are gaining more dollar content as we further automate and electrify.","The combination with LT dramatically strengthens our technology offerings in this market and expands additional dollar content opportunities across our very complementary customer base. The communications infrastructure market, at 18% of sales, grew 5% sequentially and 4% over the prior year. Sequential revenue growth in this market was led by wireless infrastructure applications where we are making very good progress with our RF and microwave and high-speed signal processing and integrated transceiver solutions. While we are, of course, only in the very early stages of 5G cellular infrastructure deployment, we believe that our optimized radio signal processing and power management solutions will be a very key driver of growth as channel counts increase and customers moved to phase their antennas to make the most efficient use of available spectrum with the highest reliability and performance. Of course, the wireless infrastructure market is one where Linear largely didn\u2019t play and thus this market represents an opportunity to drive revenue synergies in the medium term.","On a year-over-year basis, communications infrastructure growth was led by the wireline sector where ADI\u2019s customers are benefiting from our position clocking, timing and control technologies in the 100-gig and beyond optical networking applications. And finally, consumer market revenues at 21% of sales decreased 24% sequentially as prosumer applications revenue increased and portable applications revenue came in better than planned. Compared to the prior year, both prosumer and portable applications revenue increased.","So while our combined financial results were excellent, our near and long-term outlooks are equally bright. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Linear Tech, creating the high-performance analog market leader. As we said from the beginning, we are taking a best of both approach combining the best from ADI and LTC to come up with a new operating system to drive long-term profitable growth for our combined company and I am very pleased with the progress we have already made. We are optimizing processes across our selling, new product development, manufacturing and operations activities.","On the sales side, the integration of our two sales forces has brought with it a tremendous degree of excitement and we have already identified many sales synergy opportunities. On the engineering side, our teams have come together at remarkable speed and have begun identifying product roadmap combinations that we expect over the long-term will accelerate our growth. On the manufacturing side, our teams have been focused on ensuring that we meet the upside demand and continue to deliver the highest quality products to our customers. Overall, our $150 million cost synergy target within 18 months of the acquisition is firmly on track.","To give you some background, during the integration planning phase, the vast majority of actions needed to realize the synergy target were identified. And while many of the related actions have already been taken, we are only in the early stages of seeing the benefits of those synergies in our P&L. In addition we expect non-GAAP EPS accretion in our first full quarter as a combined company to be 15% and we expect earnings accretion to accelerate into fiscal 2018 as we begin to more fully realize the synergies from the transaction.","So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Ali for details of our financial performance in the second quarter.","Ali Husain","Great. Thanks Vince. Good morning everybody. Since the acquisition of Linear Tech occurred about half way through our second quarter, Linear Tech\u2019s contributions to ADI\u2019s results were limited to approximately seven weeks and my prepared remarks will exclude Linear\u2019s results and other special items unless I specify otherwise. Note that a schedule reconciling our standalone and combined performance can be found in our Investor page at investor.analog.com and a reconciliation of our combined GAAP performance to our combined non-GAAP performance can be found in schedules E and F of today\u2019s earnings release.","So revenue in the second quarter increased to $1 billion growing 2% sequentially and 28% over the prior year and was above our revised guidance. Sequential revenue growth was led by our B2B markets of industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure, which in the aggregate grew 11% sequentially and importantly 14% over the prior year. Gross margins in the second quarter were 67.6%, up 150 basis points from the 66.1% we achieved in the prior quarter, primarily the result of higher utilization rates. Days of inventory increased 3 days to 104 days and dollars of inventory increased $12 million sequentially as we increased production to match strong demand. Deferred revenue for shipments in the distribution increased 6% sequentially and weeks of inventory in distribution were at seven weeks, which was consistent with the prior quarter.","Operating expense of $318 million increased 4% sequentially due to the natural lift from higher activity in the second quarter and as compared to the first and higher variable compensation in the second quarter as our bonus program responded a better year-over-year revenue growth and operating profit in the quarter. As a result, operating margins of 36% of sales expanded 500 basis points compared to the prior year on strong revenue growth, higher gross margins and prudent expense management by the team.","So now for P&L line items below the operating margin line, I will talk to results on a combined company basis, excluding special items, outlined in today\u2019s release. Other expense in the second quarter was $59 million, the result of a partial quarter with the financing related to the Linear Tech acquisition in place. We expect our net interest expense to be approximately $70 million in the third quarter and approximately $60 million per quarter thereafter. Our second quarter non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 10% and that\u2019s the rate we expect for the remaining two quarters of the year. We are also planning for a non-GAAP tax rate in 2018 to be approximately 15%, so note that will be higher than the 10% rate this year. Our diluted share count increased in the quarter due to the equity consideration related to the acquisition. Since this is a weighted average calculation, the diluted share count in 2Q increased to 346 million shares and we expect diluted share count in the third quarter, which will be our first full quarter as a combined company to be approximately 375 million shares. Excluding special items, diluted earnings per share in the second quarter of 2017 was $1.03.","The second quarter was also a very strong free cash flow quarter. As a combined company, we generated $475 million in free cash flow in the second quarter. And for the reported trailing 12 months, the combined company has generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow, which translates to free cash flow margins of 37%. Now this level of free cash flow generation is noteworthy for several reasons. First, it reflects the strength of our business model and our brand. Second, it means that our EBITDA generation was also very strong. And this means that we are better positioned from a leverage ratio standpoint at the current time than we had \u2013 than we have communicated to you earlier. So as a result, our net debt to EBITDA ratio based on reported combined company results is in fact approximately 3x, which is significantly lower than the 3.8x net debt to EBITDA number that we had estimated when we announced the deal.","So moving to capital additions, which in the second quarter were $47 million for the combined company and are planned to be in the range of $200 million to $220 million for the year in 2017. During the quarter, we also paid $139 million in dividends and earlier this week, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.45 per outstanding share of common stock, payable on June 20 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 9. And that represents an annual dividend payment to shareholders of $1.80 per share.","Okay. So with that, I will turn it back over to Vince for our outlook for the third quarter of 2017, which again is on a combined company basis and excludes special items outlined in today\u2019s release.","Vincent Roche","Thanks Ali. After a strong second quarter performance, we are planning for a continued sequential and year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter and for revenue to be in the range of $1.37 billion to $1.45 billion. By end market, we are planning for continued sequential revenue growth in industrial and for the communications end market to remain stable to the prior quarter. In automotive, we anticipate that seasonal trends would prevail, which would suggest a mid single-digit sequential decline in the third quarter. In the consumer market, we are planning for modest sequential revenue growth in the third quarter. We expect gross margins to be between 69% and 70% as we keep utilization levels stable to their second quarter rates and benefit from higher industrial revenue mix. We estimate that operating expenses will be between $430 million and $440 million. Notably, this translates into an operating margin range of 38% to 40% in the third quarter. Based on these estimates and excluding special items, diluted earnings per share are planned to be in the range of $1.07 to $1.21.","While we continue to see good business conditions, we are always pragmatic and cautious in how we manage our business and in how we convert our precious resources into free cash flow. On this point, with the combination complete, ADI\u2019s free cash flow margin now ranks within the top 5% of the S&P 500. At our Investor Day on June 20, we will outline our plan to drive the long-term profitable growth for ADI, leveraging the customer value creation capabilities of our innovation and business diversity and our focus on best-in-class operational efficiencies to continue to drive our free cash flow to even higher levels.","So with that, we are ready now to take your questions.","Ali Husain","Alright. Thanks Vince. So before we get to the Q&A session, just a couple of quick housekeeping items for me. So note that we will be hosting an Investor Day on June 20. It\u2019s accessible via live webcast. I invite you all to tune in on June 20 to hear more about our long-term strategy and the new financial model for the company. And so let\u2019s get to the Q&A session. We will try our best to get to all of our callers, so please limit yourself to one question. After our initial response we will give you an opportunity for a follow-up. So operator, can we have our first question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.","Ambrish Srivastava","Hi, thank you very much for letting me ask questions. I had a medium-term question Ali and maybe you could answer that and then I had a longer term follow-up for Vince. So for the medium-term, could you please help us frame the consumer business, how \u2013 and when I say medium term, I am thinking how should we be thinking about this over the next 6 months to 18 months? And then I had a follow-up for Vince.","Ali Husain","Okay. Sure. Thanks Ambrish. Look I guess what I would tell you is our strategy in consumer is no different than our strategy in any of our markets. We focus on very tough problems that our customers have. We work to solve those for them. We try and create as much value as possible for our customers. And in turn that tends to generate a lot of free cash flow for ADI. I would say the only difference in consumer, relative to our other markets is that the product life cycles tend to be a little bit shorter. But apart from that, I would say the strategy at ADI is very, very consistent across all of our markets. Now you have seen that strategy play out over the last couple of years. We have grown our consumer business nicely. It\u2019s generated a lot of free cash flow for the company. We have diversified our position in consumer both at our large customer. We have diversified our position across many other customers and into new vectors of growth that we think will drive consumer free cash flow and revenue growth over the long-term. All that being said, you know as well as I do that the consumer market tends to have shorter lifecycles. And so as a result, you can\u2019t have periods of time where you have got some older designs that are rolling off and there is a bit of a pause between that happening and newer designs rolling on. My sense is that we are likely in one of those periods at the current time. I expect as a result, our mix of B2B markets to expand as a percentage of our revenue as we get into the back half of 2017. And I would expect that to continue into 2018 as well.","I guess, the only other point I would make is just to provide a little bit more context, Ambrish, is we manage a very complex mix of portfolios and businesses at ADI. Each one of them have different lifecycles. Each one of them have different revenue growth profiles. Each one of them have different profitability profiles. But what I would tell you is as long as ADI is focusing on very tough solved problems to solve for our customers and we can drive a lot of free cash flow. And frankly, if we are meeting our hurdle rates and we can drive really good long-term profitable growth in free cash flow, we will play, because ultimately that\u2019s the measure. Vince mentioned it in the prepared remarks we are now a top 5% S&P 500 free cash flow generator. And our goal is to drive that even higher from here.","Operator","Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore.","C.J. Muse","Yes, hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. First clarification, in terms of the revenue guide, was that combined or did that exclude old Linear? And then I guess as my main question just to follow-up on Ambrish\u2019s question around consumer. Is that a business looking into calendar \u201817 and \u201818 that can grow given that you have brought on diversification increase to customer or is that something that we should be thinking about declining over the next 1, 2 years?","Ali Husain","Okay. So I think that was your first question and a follow-up. So, I think on the revenue side, we have provided combined company guidance for both companies and the range is $1.37 billion to $1.45 billion that would imply a midpoint of $1.41 billion. And I guess if you were just to think about how that flows by end markets, C.J., we expect the industrial market again had a very good second quarter. We expect that strength to continue into the third quarter. As a result, we are expecting industrial to grow somewhere in the low to mid single-digits sequentially in the third quarter, which again would be better than seasonal. Automotive, we are expecting a pretty seasonal quarter. So, as a result that would decline kind of in the mid single-digits sequentially. Communications is implied to be relatively stable. And on the consumer side, we are expecting modest sequential growth relative to the second quarter. And Vince, did you want to take the question about consumer implied growth in 2017 and 2018?","Vincent Roche","Yes. I think as Ali said, we experienced fundamentally shorter lifecycles in the consumer markets. And we have been working very, very hard over the last couple of years to diversify our product base and our customer base, the application base within consumer and we are making good progress of that. I think as we look into the third quarter, as Ali said, we are seeing modest sequential revenue growth, but nonetheless below what we would consider to be seasonal norms. So we are probably in a slower growth environment in the consumer business for the near-term here.","Ali Husain","And I\u2019d say, C.J., if I could just add two points. One is we do expect as a result, our B2B markets to expand as a percentage of total revenue. And I think as you look into 2018, the accretion from the Linear Tech deal is very strong here in the third quarter, about 15%. And given some of the synergies that we have talked about, we expect that EPS accretion to accelerate into 2018 and I think that would be a very strong result. So, can we get to our next caller?","Operator","Our next question is from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","Good morning. Congratulations on the strong results. Given the stronger industrial demand flow and outlook for continued growth, just wondering if you guys are seeing any component tightness or lead time stretching out? I know a few of your peers have highlighted some tightness. I am just \u2013 it sounds like you guys still have more room to grow on utilization, but wanted to get your views on the supply side situation?","Ali Husain","Thanks. Good question, Harlan, one that we obviously think about a lot as well. But I would tell you, we are delivering the vast majority of our products within our stated lead times of 4 to 6 weeks. That frankly hasn\u2019t changed all that much over the last several quarters. I guess, what I would tell you is that ADI we are very focused on providing the highest levels of customer service and support and part of that service and support model is to deliver products when we tell our customers that we are going to deliver them. And so we tend to keep our lead times pretty short, 4 to 6 weeks delivering the vast majority of our products within those stated lead times. And I guess, I would also tell you that we are carrying 3.5 months worth of inventory in our balance sheet, which I think is a fair amount of inventory to help supply our customers with the products. The only one other point I perhaps make in this front is that if you recall back in 2016, we did bring our utilization rates down pretty hard. And the reason we did that is we wanted to manage our DSI or days of inventory down. And we managed the impact on gross margins by making permanent improvements in our cost structure. And I think as you now look out to 2017 and 2018, I think what investors should expect from ADI is a nice benefit on the drop-throughs, because as we are building the inventory, the drop-throughs are certainly better. But I guess, just coming back to your earlier point on the lead times, vast majority delivered within 4 to 6 weeks and we are keeping up high levels of service to our customers. Did you have a follow-up?","Harlan Sur","No, I\u2019m good. Thank you.","Ali Husain","Okay.","Operator","Our next question is from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Craig Hettenbach","Yes, thank you. Question for Vince, I just wanted to follow-up on your comments around automotive with Linear Tech. And more specifically, can you talk about how expansive your opportunity set is, so if there is any examples of things that you think they will help you expand the content within automotive?","Vincent Roche","Yes. So automotive for us is a story of continuing content gain here for both LTC and for ADI. So, we see it as a key growth market for the combined companies. So I think we have talked before about ADI having great strength in emerging applications like, for example, 77-gigahertz radar, LIDAR infotainment with our A2B technology, for example, bringing new technologies into the powertrain, such as the rotationals and Linear sensing, magnetic devices. And as the powertrain electrifies being able to get our battery management technologies in there as well. So, I think both LTC and ADI have a lot of complimentary capability, for example, to the ADI signal chains that I have just talked about here, we are adding LTC power management capability. And the outcome of that is we can architect an optimized solution for each of the sub-applications here for the automotive customers. And there is great complementarity between the signal chain and the power chain. So I think that\u2019s looking very, very good. And also, there is a lot of new power management things that we are looking at independent of signal chains that LT will be instrumental in helping us nail down over the coming few years. So, there is a tremendous amount of benefit in coupling power management with the signal chain. And every single application which we play within the transportation automotive sector requires both signal chain and power management. And what I am seeing so far is the tremendous level of collaboration between the applications teams, the design teams and really grabbing the opportunities here with both hands.","Ali Husain","Great. Thanks, Craig. Did you have a follow-up?","Craig Hettenbach","Yes. I guess just a brief one, just on the integration, good to hear that it\u2019s on track and kind of good start out of the gate. Just any comments in terms of culture, key people and kind of milestones we should be aware of?","Vincent Roche","Well, we have known that LT is a very, very high-quality company. And I have been obviously hands on involved in the integration of the two companies. I am very, very impressed by the quality of the people throughout LT and I am also very impressed with just how fast both companies are coming together to create something better than the sum of the parts. So right now, we are laser focused on leveraging the combined strengths of both companies to generate this long-term profitable growth possibility that we know is there. And we are taking our time to really figure out \u2013 we have been very, very patient at figuring out how to combine the leadership \u2013 we have combined the leadership teams, but we have been very patient in trying to figure out what the best of both really means here. So I think to answer your question, very directly here Craig, we are culturally I think in good shape. Our values as I have talked about many times before, the values around technology and business and customer are very, very similar. And in creating this best of both, we are actually leveraging the differences in the way the operating routines of both companies to draw from, to create something greater than some of the parts. So we are focused as I said on delighting our customers, ensuring that we are capturing the upside demand here. And I think overall the \u2013 once the values are compatible, as I said I am using the cultural differences to create something greater than the sum of the parts. And the LT leadership is playing a key role. I have got two members of the senior LTC staff and my staff. And the LT leaders are contributing to this new company multiple levels down at this point in time.","Craig Hettenbach","Great. Thanks.","Ali Husain","Thank you. We will get to our next caller.","Operator","And our next question is from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.","Vincent Roche","You are back, good.","Ambrish Srivastava","Hi. Thank you. I had my follow-up keyed up. For some reason I got dropped off. Thanks for accommodating me back. I wanted to get back to the capital allocation and the free cash flow, it seems like the free cash flow generating ability might be higher than at least what our models were suggesting. So could you please remind us just in terms of capital allocation and the timing for the pay down, obviously the leverage ratio was lower than what you had communicated and what it was at the deal close, so any light on that would be very helpful? Thank you.","Ali Husain","Okay, fair enough. I will leave the key take away for next month when we present to you at the Analyst Day, because I think we want to save a little bit of dry powder for that. But what I would tell you is since we announced the acquisition, there is a couple of things. One is we set out this target of 3.8x net debt to EBITDA. And then a typical ADI fashion, we put out targets and we had executed extremely aggressively against those targets. And part of it is just coming out at a lower leverage ratio is just a function of the mindset at ADIs. We execute extremely aggressively against the targets that we lay out. Part of it is like business conditions have been better and as a result, we have generated more cash flow. And part of it frankly is just having a laser focus on operational efficiencies. And so that\u2019s driven a lot of good cash flow as well. The good news I guess from a leverage perspective as we have talked about is we are certainly well ahead of schedule in terms of the de-leveraging plan. The bogie we are shooting for is 2x net debt to EBITDA and I would say we are probably ahead of schedule in trying to hit that number. Once we get to that number, I think we have been pretty public in terms of saying, look we are going to turn the share buyback program back on. In the meanwhile the dividend remains a cornerstone of our capital allocation strategy. And then the only other last point I would make is and again this kind of supports the notion of that we are ahead of schedule is after the quarter ended, we did pay $200 million down on the $5 billion term loan balance. So I think we are certainly ahead of schedule and in very good shape on that front.","Ambrish Srivastava","Okay. Thank you very much.","Ali Husain","Okay, great.","Operator","Your next question is from Tore Svanberg with Stifel.","Tore Svanberg","Yes. Thank you. So the industrial market is growing very strongly, I believe you mentioned 20% year-over-year, how much of that is the market coming back versus perhaps more electronic content or even some share gains?","Vincent Roche","Yes. Thanks Tore. I think it\u2019s true to say that first off we are recovering from a relatively weak environment in the prior year. So the compare is kind of easy from that perspective. From everything that we can tell right now, the growth is broad based across all the industrial sectors and in fact across all the geographies as well. And I think that\u2019s just a function of the better business environment versus last year overall. And if you just paying attention to our own customers as well, they are all guiding for low to high single-digit growth in 2017. As a company, several years ago, we made a strategic pivot in terms of where we placed our R&D, putting more into B2B applications. And industrial has been a great beneficiary of that. So I think just given the cycles in the industrial sector in general, we are beginning to see some of those products really contribute in a meaningful way across factory and process automation, aerospace and defense, the instrumentation ATE business. And so I think the business environment is overall better, but we are also doing better in terms of grabbing share through the effects of our new product investments over the last several years.","Ali Husain","Did you have a follow-up?","Tore Svanberg","Yes. Thank you. Vince, you also mentioned earlier that you plan to leverage Linear Technology into the wireless infrastructure market, I was just hoping you could elaborate just a little bit more on that because certainly, that\u2019s a market that\u2019s been weaker the last 2 years, but I assume with 5G coming on, your plan is to leverage both entities to participate in that market?","Vincent Roche","Yes. Thanks Tore. Well, we are \u2013 as ADI organic, we have been doing better and better in terms of building solutions for our customers from antenna right down to bits, leveraging the strength of ADI and Hittite combined. And we know that as customers put greater and greater pressure on for more integration, to be able to solve the noise problems more effectively in these radio systems, that power management is going to be a great help to us. And already, I think in the shorter term, we are being actively engaged in discussions to use existing products with ADI solutions, for example, in the transceiver space, in 5G systems, leveraging LTE\u2019s power technology. And that\u2019s only the beginning because over the coming generations when we can start to architect the radio solutions now with the new advances in power management technology that LT has been making, I think we can have several generations here of success in both the wired and the wireless business in the years ahead. And there is no doubt there is tremendous symbiosis between the signal chain technologies that ADI has been so strong in over the years with the power technologies that LT now brings to the table. So the conversations with our customers are very active and with existing products and we are now plotting the next new architectures based on the combination of the two companies.","Tore Svanberg","Alright. Thank you.","Ali Husain","Thank you very much. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question is from William Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein","Great. Thanks for taking my question. I am hoping you can expand on something you touched on earlier, the cultural differences, however may be they are not as great as some people perceive, but I think one of them is that Linear was known for having an intense focus on gross profit margin and perhaps that limited that business\u2019 revenue growth and I think ADI has a more growthy sort of outlook. So I am wondering if you can sort of highlight any initial opportunities to expand the growth rate on the Linear business?","Vincent Roche","Yes. It\u2019s a good question. It\u2019s true that both companies have had very, very strong focus on gross margin. I think it\u2019s a great kind of proxy for the quality of the innovation that you are developing, the price you can command and ultimately, the gross margins that you can get. So what I will say is that ADI has probably just \u2013 given our buying power, their operational focus. We have combined now with LT we have got more buying power. So we can be more flexible in terms of taking some market share with products already available without sacrificing the margins, just giving the signings of the so called bill of materials that we are now sourcing across both companies. So we don\u2019t intend to drop our standards, but we do intend to be aggressive in terms of leveraging all the available products and technologies that we have to grow our business profitably. I think that\u2019s the way to think about it.","Ali Husain","And did you have any follow-up, Will?","William Stein","I did. One of the issues from the integration that\u2019s always important in any of these transactions is ERP, and by the disclosure around end markets that sort of lumps the Linear Tech revenue in its own category maybe a sign that perhaps that\u2019s going to take a bit of time to reflect their revenue across your end markets. Any guidance or commentary as to when we should see that disclosed sort of on a combined basis and just in general the update on that aspect of the integration?","Ali Husain","Yes, fair enough. I can take part of that. Look, from an ERP\u2019s perspective and frankly from an integration perspective, we are generally keeping Linear Tech on a standalone basis for the first year. And then we will converge. With regards specifically to the end market question, we actually have the data. I just didn\u2019t feel like it was that meaningful for a stub quarter and I can certainly talk to it right now in the call. But you should expect from ADI next quarter that we have all of the disclosures by end markets mapped out and that\u2019s absolutely no issue to do. What I would tell you in the quarter, had Linear been part of ADI for a full quarter, they would have seen their industrial business grow and they would have seen their automotive business decrease sequentially given their exposure to the powertrain market, specifically in transportation in China, which has been a weaker market. But the good news there I\u2019d say well is that, that market is actually pretty stable right now and that gives us a fair amount of confidence guiding into the third quarter, then automotive will be pretty seasonal.","William Stein","Great. Thank you.","Ali Husain","Yes, no problem. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Danely with Citigroup.","Chris Danely","Hey, thanks, guys. Congratulations on the good quarter and good guidance. Now that Linear is kind of lumped into the mix, how, if you could, frame the October quarter for the combined company just in terms of where combined OpEx could go? Could it go down again? And then also what should we expect for seasonality for revenue for the combined company for the October quarter?","Ali Husain","Yes. Okay, so let me try and parse that out a little bit and may be Vince can help me as well. But look from a \u2013 Chris, we have absolutely no visibility into the fourth quarter, the October quarter at this stage. So in the absence of any orders, all I can rely on is what seasonal trends tend to do and seasonally speaking industrial tends to be a little weaker in the fourth quarter. Automotive generally increases. Communications is always a wildcard just frankly depending on how the builds and the deployments are going. And then consumer generally has a pretty good growth quarter sequentially, because you start to see more of the builds taking place. So, that\u2019s all I can tell you today, with absolutely zero visibility into the fourth quarter. What I would tell you on the OpEx side and I\u2019d say it\u2019s a fair point is on a standalone basis this quarter ADI had OpEx of $318 million. Linear Tech contributed $62 million in the quarter. I guess I would caution you on that number. One is obviously it\u2019s a stub period and so it\u2019s a partial quarter. And number two, there were public company costs that did come out of that number, which we have always talked about public company costs being somewhere in the range of $15 million to $20 million annually. And so the quarterly run-rate that we have guided to for operating expenses in the third quarter of $430 million to $440 million already includes those synergies embedded. Now to your other point, there are more synergies on the comp. We will start to see some of them. It will be very back end loaded there, Chris in the third quarter, but you will start to see more of them play out in the fourth quarter. And I would expect them to be then pretty linear back into the fourth quarter of 2018. If you recall, we have always talked about $100 million of OpEx synergies achieving that run-rate by the fourth quarter of 2018. I guess, what I am saying is $20 million of that is now baked into the third quarter run-rate number and there is still another $80 million to come, again on an annualized number as we go into the fourth quarter of 2018.","Chris Danely","Great. Do I get a follow-up?","Ali Husain","Of course.","Chris Danely","Thanks. Any update on the CFO \u2013 new CFO?","Vincent Roche","Yes. Well, let me tell you, Chris, we have \u2013 obviously we have retained a search firm. And what I can tell you is that we are making excellent progress right now. My expectation is that we will have the replacement named by the end of the fiscal year at the latest. But I am quite optimistic that we will be able to announce something quite well before then. So in the interim, I am taking a very hands-on approach with the integration of LT. And I am also relying with a terrific bench of people at ADI across all the facets of the management of the finance function of ADI. So, we can \u2013 we are very, very well positioned to ensure that we hit our targets in terms of the ongoing operation as well as the synergies. So, synergies are on track and we will update you on where we are at the Investor Day in the latter part of June here.","Chris Danely","Great. Thanks, guys.","Ali Husain","Thanks, Chris. Next caller, please.","Operator","Your next question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani","Thanks a lot. I guess just a question on the Linear side you have had this under your belt for a few months now. So I am curious when it comes to revenue synergies, where are you guys more focused on to drive revenue synergies, because I would imagine consumer might be the easiest place to get it or the quickest place to get it, but perhaps not the most ideal one for you. So, how do you think about the end markets and revenue synergies as you go forward?","Vincent Roche","Yes. Well, I think as we have talked about earlier on, the various markets, all of different cycles in terms of uptake, design cycles and adoption cycles. But I think obviously every sector in which we play, including consumer, has an opportunity for ADI to draw Linear Technology power management for additional revenue opportunity and growth. I would say it\u2019s a medium-term to see the effect anyway of leveraging existing products and getting any meaningful revenue growth from those products is probably a 2 to 3-year proposition as we have experienced as well with Hittite. But I think the areas that we will see meaningful growth in the medium-term here will be automotive for sure. I think the communications sector will see a good uptick in the medium-term. Very judiciously as well, we are looking at some consumer opportunities. So obviously, those hit probably sooner than any other sector of the portfolio we manage. And I think industrial is 3 years plus from here. So I think that\u2019s the way to think about the adoption of existing products and new sockets and the effect that we should see on revenue growth here.","Ali Husain","Did you have a follow-up?","Amit Daryanani","I do, sir. I guess your consumer guide for July, modest sequential growth. I think last couple of years it\u2019s been triple-digitish kind of number in the July quarter. The delta, do you think it\u2019s due to later product launches in that segment or a change in the content that you guys have or maybe the OEMs that have more comfort around your ability around these products of asking you to do it a little bit later? It seems to be a fairly big delta, which we have seen the last 2 years at least. So, perhaps help us explain what\u2019s driving that?","Ali Husain","Yes. So, I guess I will take that. I think we answered the question earlier in the call. I think this is definitely something that is, I would say more related to ADI. And we just have our content in various products are very much SKU dependent and we just think we will have a different kind of a mix this year relative to previous years. But I\u2019d say as we progress into 2018, my expectation is that our B2B mix \u2013 our B2B markets expand as a percentage of total revenue as a result.","Amit Daryanani","Perfect. Thanks and congrats on the quarter guys.","Vincent Roche","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.","Craig Ellis","Yes, thanks for taking the question and congratulations on your execution as you get started in the new area with Linear Tech. My question is regarding the synergies for the combined company. It\u2019s clear, Vincent, that the company is quite happy with the way the early combined work is going. The question is does the progress on synergies thus far cause you to think differently about the linearity with which you expect to realize the $150 million in cost gains from the two companies?","Vincent Roche","No. I think when we have talked about synergies, we have been very clear that we have acquired LT for all its capabilities in terms of technology and customer management channel, channel management, operations and so on to drive revenue synergy over the long-term. But no, I think as I said in the prepared remarks, I am very pleased with the progress that we are making. We have \u2013 we had actually executed a lot of the decisions on the $150 million of synergies in advance of combining the companies. And the synergies are well-identified and the actions are in place to get the synergies executed. So my sense is it will take us, during the coming year, to really see the effects of the synergies in our P&L from a cost perspective. And a little bit longer than that I think as I have just been talking about to get the synergies from the cross-selling opportunities.","Ali Husain","Right, Craig, another follow-up?","Craig Ellis","Yes. Thanks for that Ali. And I follow-up on an end market, communications Vincent, I think you have mentioned 5G a couple of times and it seems like relative to 4G, the bigger picture is that, that seems to be more on track or maybe pulling in a little bit earlier versus what we had seen with some of the prior interface changes, but with regard to that opportunity, when would ADI expect 5G related infrastructure revenues to start to become a material part of its communications segment? Thank you.","Vincent Roche","I think your point is well taken. I think originally when we began talking about 5G, we were talking about it being a facet of our business in kind of 2020-plus. It now seems that we are obviously in trials right now with 5G, all the major application areas, all the major customers globally. So my own sense is that we will begin to see, I think a meaningful ramp in revenue in the 2019 kind of area. Maybe it\u2019s a little sooner, maybe it\u2019s a little later, but that\u2019s my sense at this point in time that there is an aggressive pull in at the carrier level as well as the OEMs to make faster progress in deploying 5G.","Ali Husain","Alright. Craig, thank you. And we will get through our next caller.","Operator","Your next question is from Tristan Gerra with Baird.","Tristan Gerra","Hi, good morning. You had mentioned that you recently that you have seen the small cell business finally picking up, what\u2019s your market share in that business, which I am assuming has been fairly small and what type of growth are we looking and what type of revenue contribution can we get in the next say \u2013 in the next 12 months to 18 months?","Ali Husain","Yes. Hi Tristan, let me try and take a crack at that. I am sure Vince would be much more eloquent than I could ever be. But in any event, I would say on the small cell side, it\u2019s been a relatively small contributor to our growth. I guess what we are particularly proud of are our integrated transceiver solutions that are picking up content both on macro base stations and in small cell base stations. So to be perfectly candid with you, we are pretty agnostic as to where these platforms end up. What is really important for ADI is the channel count. And so as long as you got more and more things that are connecting up, we tend to do extremely well when that happens. And so that could be a small cell, that could be a macro base station, but we are doing extremely well in the marketplace. We had another record quarter on top of our record quarter in the prior quarter in our integrated transceiver solutions that are just sucking up a lot of bill of materials and allowing us to gain share in this market. So interestingly you saw our results this quarter. And again it speaks to the diversity of our communications infrastructure market and our business. But our sequential revenue growth was led by wireless infrastructure and our year-over-year growth was led by wireline infrastructure. So you can see the diversity there. The other point I would make is with the addition of Linear Tech, our communications infrastructure business is more diversified than ever. In the past, about two-thirds of our calls business was wireless. At the current time, it\u2019s more like 50-50. So I think we have the full suite of technology and we are pretty agnostic as to form factor. We have got the products and I think really it\u2019s a question of as the market percolates, we are going to do extremely well.","Vincent Roche","Yes. I think just to add a little bit of color to what Ali has said, small cell is still a small activity from a market perspective. We are very, very well positioned. And I think it will start to accelerate so much during the course of the next 12 months to 18 months and become a more meaningful part of the overall wireless story in communications infrastructure.","Ali Husain","Alright. So you answered it better than I would. Thanks Tristan, do you have a follow-up?","Tristan Gerra","Yes, if I could. And thanks for the very useful answer. It looks like your Hittite business has grown fairly significantly since the close, could you provide some color on what\u2019s been driving that growth, has it been share gain, new products or just distribution synergies and the question really relates to how should we look at Linear Tech in terms of the experience that you have gained with Hittite and the revenue growth achievement that you have done with Hittite?","Vincent Roche","Okay. Well, let me try and unpack. There were a couple of key questions there. I think with Hittite, we knew that the technology was very, very strong. And ADI, one of the big synergies we got from acquiring Hittite was just the channel reach, the customer reach and the channel reach that ADI had, that Hittite didn\u2019t have. So we have been able to leverage that to tremendous effect. We knew that the portfolio products, was very, very strong. So, that\u2019s been a huge help to us. Obviously, we have been able to architect. We have been together now almost 3 years and we have been able to architect some really new creative solutions in areas like aerospace and defense, phased array antenna, for example, these new radar systems that are being deployed as radar systems digitize across the globe. Even in instrumentation where a lot of the high-frequency systems require the combination of mix signal and microwave technology. Obviously, in the automotive sector where all these microwave technologies are being deployed, we are having the combination of ADI and Hittite there has been really, really powerful. So, I think it\u2019s \u2013 it was a case of a lot of products that needed a new channel and a lot of re-architecting of customer systems based upon ADI\u2019s signal processing mix signal strength and Hittite\u2019s microwave strength. So what was the second part of that question?","Ali Husain","How would you leverage that to Linear?","Vincent Roche","So, leverage to Linear, I think the approach we have on the best of both was also true with Hittite. We tried to figure out how to be patient, understand the world class capabilities that Hittite had in terms of people and technology. And we have taken the very same approach with LTC. LTC is obviously a world class company as well. So just being patient, listening to create something greater than sum of the parts, build a whole new operating system across the company for speed and simplification. That\u2019s what we did with Hittite and that\u2019s what we are doing with LTC x5.","Ali Husain","Great. Thanks for the question. And we are zooming into the 11 o\u2019clock hour here, so we are going to do our best to get to everybody. In case we can\u2019t, feel free to call our Investor Relations phone at 781-461-3282. So we will continue until 11:00. Next caller please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.","Stacy Rasgon","Hi, guys. Thank you for squeezing me in. You talked a bit about the trajectory of synergies on OpEx. What about on the $15 million in COGS? Can you give us fueling for how much of that, if any, is embedded in the Q3 guidance or where might we see that by the end of the year and should we expect a different trajectory of capturing those gross margin synergies versus what you are suggesting we should think about for the OpEx side?","Ali Husain","Yes, I know I\u2019d say on the gross margin side, we are very early in the process. I\u2019d say those are all very much on the comp. I wouldn\u2019t expect to see those in Q3 or Q4 this year. Did you have a follow-up?","Stacy Rasgon","I did. On the OpEx or just on the cost synergies, in general, it doesn\u2019t sound like you are quite ready to take the target up. But can you give us a feeling given how far you are in the planning phase and which areas have proved maybe easier than you might have thought initially as well as more difficult? And if we were looking for potential upside, where do you think it might be easiest to squeeze more out?","Vincent Roche","Well, clearly we have been able to reduce the public company cost of the combined company. That\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s been executed pretty much straight away. I think we had talked before as well about an early retirement program that we had put in place at ADI and we begin to see the benefits of that fettering in over the next couple of quarters. But the \u2013 and obviously, distribution channel optimization as well that we had talked about before that will start to show benefits to us, I think towards the back end of this year and the early part of the coming year. So, there are just three or four examples of the things that we have already got in play that we will start to see the benefit of. And all the other synergies are identified. And we have got the actions in place and we are now just ready to realize them.","Ali Husain","Yes. And Stacy, I will just add we have talked about it before, but the EPS accretion in the third quarter is expected to be 15%. And I think if you start baking some of these synergies in the 2018, I think you get a number well north of that. So, we look forward to updating you on the model and any potential updates on the synergy target next month at the Analyst Meeting.","Alright. I think we just hit the 11 o\u2019clock hour.

Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us today for our second quarter 2014 earnings call. As you can tell from the press release, the second quarter was a very good quarter for ADI.","Revenues of $695 million grew 11% sequentially and our operating model showed very good leverage converting the sequential revenue increase into a 20% increase in diluted earnings per share, excluding special items.","On a year-over-year basis, revenues grew 5% with the corresponding 13% increase in diluted earnings again, a very strong operating results. Both revenues and earnings in the second quarter were above the high-end of our guidance.","During our last earnings call, we spoke about our largest customers becoming more optimistic about their growth prospects and overall improving order rates on ADI, and I am happy to report that these trends continued in our second quarter.","In addition to continued optimism at our largest customers, total orders were higher than in the prior quarter across all our end markets and we finished the quarter with a book-to-bill that was above 1. These trends coupled with inventories that are in good position and recovering demand for capital goods, we believe are positive signs for our business in the third quarter \u201914.","Turning to our performance by end market in the second quarter note, our revenue growth was broad-based and it was led by seasonal and secular strength in the Industrial, Communications Infrastructure and Automotive markets, which represented 89% of our total sales. Our Consumer business grew sequentially also.","The Industrial end markets, which are typically seasonally strong for ADI in the second quarter, turned in an even better performance than we had planned and grew 13% sequentially and represented 47% of our total sales.","All of the major application areas within Industrial grew sequentially with the strongest growth from the instrumentation sub-sector, which was up significantly, driven by increased demand across our broad base of instrumentation customers.","But also by higher than anticipated demand from wireless and semiconductor test equipment, areas which benefit from our very advanced analog and mixed-signal capabilities, industrial, automation, healthcare, energy and defense also were up in the second quarter. On a year-on-year basis, our industrial business grew 5%.","By region industrial sales in Europe and North America which together account for over two-thirds of our industrial sales grew in the double digits in the second quarter. Industrial sales in China, Japan and the rest of Asia also registered strong sequential growth.","The Industrial sector is indeed the backbone of ADI with a very diverse customer base of tens of thousands of customers and long lifecycle products with sustainable profitability. We believe the Industrial sector has the potential for both market growth rates driven by the need for more intelligent, connected and energy efficient products.","Revenue from Communications Infrastructure customers increased 11% sequentially and 25% year-over-year, well, ahead of our plan for the quarter. Wireless infrastructure sales surge in the second quarter driven by strong base station deployment in China and the capacity buildouts in the U.S.","ADI\u2019s technology in this wireless applications is focused on the radio signal chain where the spectrum is digitized and where innovation in radio architectures not only leads to higher ADI content per system but also its critical to improving the coverage, capacity and efficiency of wireless networks.","The wireless networks are already strained and the burden placed on them is set to increase with the adoption of more and more 4G enabled devices. In addition, consumers typically are engaging in very high bandwidth application on the 4G devices with activities such as video, music and gaming.","Therefore, the demand for data is growing at a much faster clip than the rate of device unit growth, compounding this issue our newer nodes that we are connecting, for example, in the area of machine-to-machine communication and even in 4G enabled wearable devices. As a result, carriers continue to invest in their networks and are benefiting from increased per user revenue to help fuel that CapEx spend.","Moving forward, we believe that demand in the networks will continue to out pace supply and that the limited availability of spectrum will continue to drive the need for more advanced radio solutions where ADI has been focusing its RF and converter R&D.","The fundamental demand for increased wireless traffic, full time connectivity and more and more connected nodes we believe should drive growth in this business for ADI in 2014 and well beyond.","Moreover, several opportunities exist for ADI to leverage this core technology into other areas such as industrial devices, instrumentation equipment and healthcare applications, so that anything that can be connected to the club vein will be connected safely and securely.","Our wireline business also grew sequentially, primarily as a result of our strong pipeline of designs and 100-gig optical applications, where customers are benefiting from our precision plucking, timing and control technologies.","In automotive, revenue increased 9% sequentially, with all three of our focus application areas experiencing growth. At combination of increasing content and vehicle unit growth helped to fuel our automotive growth this quarter. Safety revenues improved over the prior quarter as new vehicles accelerate adoption of radar-based advanced driver assistance systems for collision avoidance.","Powertrain revenues also grew as our battery monitoring technology and start\/stop applications continue to gain wider adoption in high volume vehicles. Recently, Ford announced that it plans to offer start\/stop technology on 70% of its U.S. model range by 2017.","And in Europe start\/stop technology is already found in 45% of the latest model vehicles with demand in that region also set to rise as consumers off for the technology and indeed government mandates kick in.","By region, demand for premium vehicles in China and the U.S continued to be strong and the European vehicle market has also begun exhibiting modest growth, combining to deliver stronger revenue for ADI.","On a year-on-year basis, our automotive business grew 10%, which was the fifth consecutive quarter of year-on-year revenue increases in this business. We see plenty of runway ahead for ADI\u2019s automotive business as we work with the leading OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers to develop safer, smarter and more fuel efficient vehicle as car manufacturers accelerate the use of silicon to further differentiates their offerings.","And finally, Consumer revenues, which accounted for 11% of total sales in the second quarter, grew 5% over the quarter prior, which was the first sequential revenue increase in this sector in five quarters and it\u2019s the culmination of a very purposeful shift in the mix of our investment profile.","This quarter sequential revenue performance was largely due to an increase in prosumer audio\/video applications with digital cameras and portable applications flat to the prior quarter in the aggregate.","So overall this quarter we had a very good performance across the broad diversity of markets we serve due in large part to the significant investments we are making at ADI to be well ahead of market trends, but also as a result of a very purposeful reshaping of our product portfolio over the last several years.","So, with that, I'll turn it over to Dave. who will take you through some of the details of our financial results and after he does that, I\u2019ll come back and provide our outlook for the next quarter and give you some of my thoughts on where ADI stands today. Dave?","Dave Zinsner","Thanks, Vince, and good afternoon, everyone. As Vince mentioned, our second quarter was a very good quarter for ADI with both revenue and diluted earnings above the high-end of the guidance. Revenue in the second quarter was $695million, which was up 11% sequentially and up 5% year-over-year. Gross margin in the second quarter was 66.1%, up 100 basis points from the 65.1% we achieved in the prior quarter.","Factory utilization in the second quarter increased to the mid 70s from the prior quarter\u2019s mid 60s level. Our plan for the third quarter is for utilization to be approximately flat to the second quarter which on higher expected sales should further decrease our days of inventory.","Inventory in the second quarter on a day basis decreased to 115 days from 121 days and on a dollar basis increased by $8.5 million to $298.4 millions as we positioned our inventory for higher expected sales in the third quarter.","Turning to inventory in the distribution channel, inventory distribution on a dollar basis was modestly higher than in the prior quarter and weeks of inventory in distribution was at 7.5 weeks consistent with the prior quarter.","Overall, orders were very strong for ADI during the second quarter and customer orders increased sequentially and our book-to-bill was above 1. Our flexible and robust manufacturing and supply chain operations executed very well responding to the increase in orders flows while maintaining lead times at four to six weeks.","Excluding special items operating expenses in the second quarter increased 5% sequentially lagging well behind the 11% increase in revenue and in line with our model to constraint the rate of operating expense growth to no more than half the rate of sales growth.","Most of the sequential dollar increase in operating expenses was the result of higher variable compensation which is paid to ADI employees based on year-over-year revenue growth and operating profit targets and also due to more days of business in the second quarter. Headcount in the second quarter remained essentially flat to the previous quarter\u2019s level.","Excluding special items as a percent of sales, operating expenses in the second quarter declined 180 basis points compared to the prior quarter. During the past 18 months, while uncertainty was the prevailing sentiment in the global economy, we continue to increase investments in areas we believe represents significant growth opportunities for ADI over the long term.","And we did so primarily by tuning our product and technology portfolio and redirecting existing spending. With generally improving sentiments and positive sign from our customers, we are prudently increasing our spending in strategic high performance signal processing markets while staying true to ADI\u2019s financial model.","We believe we can make these investments while keeping tight control of our expenses. And we expect expense growth to continue to lag sales growth. Excluding special items, operating profits before tax increased to $220 million or 31.7% of sales, which is 270 basis points higher than in the prior quarter and 170 basis points higher compared to the same quarter in the prior year.","Other expense of approximately $3 million was flat to the first quarter and is primarily reflection of the ongoing run rate of our net interest expense at current debt level. Our second quarter tax rate was 13.8% slightly higher than our plan resulting in an adjustment to our anticipated full year tax rate to 13.5%.","We expect our tax rate to be approximately 13.5% for the next two quarters. Excluding special items, diluted earnings per share of $0.59 increased 20% over the prior quarter and 30% year-over-year and was above the high-end of our guidance. Cash flow in the second quarter continued to be very strong. We generated 34% of our revenue or $238 million in operating cash flow. CapEx was $44 million resulting in free cash flow of $194 million or 28% of revenue.","We returned approximately $138 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. On a trailing four quarter basis, dividend payments and share repurchases totaled 81% of our free cash flow and compared to the prior quarter, our share count was approximately flat.","Our 2014 plan is for capital spending to be approximately $180 million, of which about two third relates to ongoing capital equipment spend and about one third relates to new facilities and upgrades to existing facility which is all part of our long-term investing for growth strategy. Our cash and short-term investment balance increased by about $106 million during the second quarter and now stands at $4.8 billion with $1.3 billion available domestically.","At the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $870 million in debt outstanding, resulting in a net cash position of $3.9 billion. In line with our capital allocation strategy, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.37 per outstanding share of common stock. This will be paid on June 10, 2014 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on May 30, 2014.","At the current stock price, this dividend represents an annual yield of approximately 3%. Our total shareholder return, which is calculated as the change in stock price plus cumulative dividend paid on a one-year basis was 17% and on a three-year average growth rate basis was 12% through the end of the second quarter.","In summary, this was a very successful quarter for ADI. The leverage in our model was evident throughout our results, which were better than planned. On a year-over-year basis, revenue growth of 5% generated diluted EPS growth of 13%. We believe that the investments we have been giving and we have been making give us a strong design win pipeline that sets us up well for good growth and good profitability going forward.","So now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Vince who will discuss ADI\u2019s outlook for the third quarter.","Vincent Roche","Thanks Dave. Well, we begin our third quarter with a higher opening backlog than at the start of the second quarter. Our order rates remain solid and inventories are in good position. As a result, our plan for third quarter revenues -- we have planned for third quarter revenues to grow sequentially in the range of 1% to 5%.","We're expecting our industrial and communication markets to grow and for automotive and consumer businesses to be approximately flat to second quarter levels. And in industrial, we believe that the improving macroeconomic picture and more positive sentiment is translating into higher capital spending, which is driving robust order activity throughout our industrial customer base.","And communications infrastructure which is likewise tied to capital spending, we expect the 4G deployments in China and the U.S. to continue in the third quarter contributing to our plan for sequential growth in this end market. And in automotive and consumer, we expect that normal seasonal patterns will prevail and for revenue from these markets to be approximately flat to second quarter levels.","Gross margin should increase approximately 50 basis points as utilization stays at the mid 70s level, which is flat to the second quarter. Accordingly, we expect gross margin drop through on incremental sales to be in the mid-70s, again similar to second quarter levels.","In line with our model, we are planning for operating expenses to increase at half the rate of sales growth. As margins improve and we grow our revenue year-over-year, our variable compensation expense will increase. In addition, in the third quarter, we\u2019ll have the full quarter of the annual salary increases, which went into effect in April.","With OpEx growth lagging our anticipated revenue growth in the third quarter, operating margins are planned to expand to the 32% to 33% range, delivering additional leverage. Based on these estimates and excluding any one-time items, diluted earnings per share are planned to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.64.","So in closing, we had a strong quarter in the second quarter of our fiscal \u201814 and we have a solid outlook for the third quarter. We continue to expand margins as factory loading increases and expenses remain under tight control. And we will continue generating strong earnings leverage and strong free cash flow, which we will use to further improve shareholder returns.","Our investments are well positioned in signal processing applications where we believe we can gain more share of wallet with our customers as they look to collaborate with ADI to embed sensing, processing, connectivity and increasing levels of control and monitoring into their diverse products. Over the past few years, we've made great strides in retargeting our strategy to focus on industrial, communications, infrastructure and automotive applications and carefully selecting consumer entry points.","We've been redirecting our investments accordingly, all the while increasing investments in advanced technologies to seed our future growth. We have the highest quality technology and the best people positioning us very well for the favorable macro trends and energy efficiency, safety, health care and ubiquitous sensing and connectivity.","Now it really comes down to execution and harnessing the power of our innovation to meaningfully impact our growth rate. We have the talent, the right strategy, the heritage and the perseverance it takes to be successful and to continue generating strong financial performance for our shareholders. Thank you.","Ali Husain","Thanks Vince. I'd like to remind everyone that during today's Q&A period, please limit yourself to one question, so we can get everyone on the line. We plan to run today's call until 6 p.m. Eastern, so if time remains at the end, we will keep the lines open and give you an opportunity to ask another question at that time. So with that, operator, we can now start taking questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first quarter question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo.","David Wong - Wells Fargo","Noting that your planning to keep utilization unchanged even with the expectation of rising sales in July. Do you expect to be holding that projection in future quarters too or should we expect production and utilization will rise after the current quarter if sales keep going up?","Vincent Roche","Yeah, I think if sales keep going up, we\u2019d expect utilization over time to rise.","David Wong - Wells Fargo","Okay. Great. So how do you make the decision about when you\u2019re going to increase production. Are there specific parameters that you\u2019re looking at?","Vincent Roche","Yeah, really, you got to remember that half of our production is actually bought through outside boundaries. So some of it is a mix element that the operation guys take into account, some of it is that we\u2019re trying to move our days of inventory down from where we started the year at 121 days and try to get it down to where we\u2019d like to be which is a 110 days. So that plays into it.","And then there is some anticipation around what distributors are going to do in terms of keeping their inventory carry and how much inventory we have to carry for certain customers that require us to hold inventory for them at their location and depending on that dynamic, it can play into it. So there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces obviously David to this that go into it. We found that the manufacturing team here is excellent. They had a really good deed on this and we pretty much followed their queue in terms of what utilization should be in any one quarter.","David Wong - Wells Fargo","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Ali Husain","Thanks, David. We will move on to our next question, please.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Danely with J.P. Morgan.","Chris Danely - J.P. Morgan","Hey. Thanks, guys. Can you just give us a little color commentary on the sales upside? Was there some sort of hockey stick during the quarter? Was it just a gradual sort of linear increase and then maybe talk about the goes little bit? I think you mentioned that Europe showed some modest growth, was that better than expected, just little bit of color there?","Dave Zinsner","Now every one speaking in two questions, okay. So, I will take the first part and maybe, Vince you can talk about the geography. So, I would say that in general, thing strengthened through the quarter and we saw a good strength, really pretty much across the board in areas that we care about like in the automotive space, in the industrial space and in the comms space. And so I don\u2019t think there was anyone end market that surprised us. It was pretty much the entire business, just performing better than perhaps we anticipated going into the quarter. And then I will let you answer, Vince, the geography question.","Vince Roche","Yeah. So as we said, Chris, we had great strengths virtually 90% of our business now comes from the core markets of industrial communications infrastructure and automotive and Europe is a very strong player in all three of those sectors. So, we saw good linearity through the quarter and good strength in all those areas with both large and small customers.","Ali Husain","Thanks, Chris. And I guess, we will move on to our next question.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.","Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. My one question would just be around -- you mentioned within industrial in particular instrumentation and then semi-test within that. That business has been kind of depressed for a while. Some of the customers there saw big order recoveries this quarter. Any visibility on the sustainability or the continued pickup there, which you guys have very good and unique exposure to? Thanks.","Vince Roche","Well, Jim, our business in instrumentation has really two sectors to it. It\u2019s got the multi-product, multi-customer which is the classical, very, very distributed instrumentation business and then we have the many product, few customer business which is the ATE related sector. So, I think we expect to see the first part of the business be very diverse part of instrumentation continue to grow really steadily, I think towards this next quarter. And who knows on the peer ATE business which is very-very lumpy. But it's driven by or has been driven by the automotive and semi conductor test areas and we think as well at some point, it\u2019s going to be a raise in the building out of equipment for the mobile space, so very-very hard to read that piece of it. But I think overall the instrumentation business will be steady in the third quarter.","Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs","Thanks very much.","Ali Husain","","Thanks, Jim. We will move on to our next question, please.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley","Yes. Thank you. I had a question on business and distribution and I know you guys recognized revenue on sell-through, but it looked like deferred income to distribution was up 9% sequentially. So just trying to get a sense of your inventories still feels on the lean side yet, that's a decent size increase sequentially. So, kind of, what you are hearing from distributors and what that might suggest in terms of the pipeline of business there?","Vince Roche","Yeah. Good question. So as you point out, deferred margin was up 9%. Sometimes, I would point out that that moves around not only from a -- because of revenue changes but also because the cost of units change, so that does have an impact. We did see a little bit of rise in inventory in distribution, but it was kind of in line with the revenue growth. So as a result, the days of inventory stayed pretty much the same as it did in the prior quarter. There was towards the end a pickup in their shipments to distribution and so we did have some amount of distributor revenue that was in transit. So it isn\u2019t counted in our days of inventory but nevertheless, left our docks and kind of moved over, or is in process of moving over to the balance of the distributors.","And that did kind of raise the deferred income a bit higher and probably it was more a result of holidays and so forth that cause that. I do think though, the fact that distributors are growing inventory in line at least with their revenue growth that suggests that there is some optimism about in the next couple of quarters in distribution or at least, the next quarter in distribution. And as they do see the next quarter being pretty strong, outside of the next growth kind of hard to predict but they will do. But I do look at it as a favorable sign.","Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley","Got it. Thanks a lot for that color, Dave.","Ali Husain","We will move on to our next question, please.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley.","Craig Ellis - B. Riley","Thanks for taking the question and nice job on the quarter, guys. My question is more longer term. When I look at the guidance, it looks like the implications of the end market growth means that communications will be at record revenues and you\u2019ve been knocking that out pretty consistently with automotive as it goes higher as a percent of mix. But when I look at industrial, we are still about 10% to 15% below the peaks for that end markets. So as you look at the different in-demand drivers and the products that ADI has, what do you think it takes from here to get that particular end market back to the levels that you saw again in the mid-2011 timeframe?","Vince Roche","Yeah. Remember, in 2011, there was the whole Tsunami situation which dramatically over inflated demand. So that was a big-big factor. But I think we\u2019ve had a lot of talk with a lot of industrial customers over the past six months and I think the general consensus is that there is going to be a steady improvement in the spend of CapEx, in industrial plants and automation equipment in the years ahead here, because particular in U.S. the age of manufacturing equipment has began to really creek.","It\u2019s getting old and there is a natural replacement cycle that is going to starting to take place here, at least in the U.S. and I believe Europe as well. But I think as the macro situation continues to kind of gently improve, that bodes well for the industrial business. So, I think, you\u2019ve got to look at that business as well over a very, very long period of time. So we're bullish based on the product crop that we have, the customers we are engaging with across the globe and what we hear, the sentiment we hear and the evidence that we see in terms of increasing CapEx spend.","Craig Ellis - B. Riley","Is that really the factory automation and industrial process control part of that business, Vincent or I assume you are not speaking of the medical part of industrial so. I was just trying to know that down and understand what sub-segments you are referring to here?","Vince Roche","Yeah. It\u2019s really industrial automation and I think the instrumentation business as well will continue to improve. So, energy too is a fairly modest business really. I believe we\u2019ve seen some improvement in latter months as well in that area.","Craig Ellis - B. Riley","Thank you.","Vince Roche","I\u2019m specifically not talking with healthcare, when I talk about the industrial sector here.","Ali Husain","","And the instrumentation and automation pieces of that industrial business clearly take up a good chunk of what we do in industrial so. Thank you, Craig and we will move onto our next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets","My question and congratulations on the strong results as well, guys. Dave, a question for you, when we look at the variable comp now starting to kick in, how do I think about the way in which that program works, when you're going to probably feel maybe a seasonal decline in the business starting off next fiscal year? Will we see both OpEx numbers come down? I know you just -- if we look back at the January \u201814 quarter, there was a small decline. But I don't know that the variable comp was a big part of that.","Dave Zinsner","Well, Doug, I think the key component -- well, there are two components to it. One is and it\u2019s 50-50. Half of it is driven off of year-over-year revenue growth. So to the extent that the sequential decline, if there is one from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, still drove a year-over-year revenue growth but probably no impact to that 50%, depending on what year-over-year growth rate we are talking about.","To the other piece, the other 50% is kind of the self-correcting piece, that\u2019s related to operating margin percentages and that does obviously come down if revenue were to decline because of some pressure on operating margins and that if it self corrects little bit on the variable comp. So, I guess net-net, the variable comp should come down in a situation where we have a sequential decline which is typical in the first quarter. But it probably won't be to the magnitude you might think of.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Great. Thank you for that color.","Dave Zinsner","Sure.","Ali Husain","Thanks, Doug. And we will move on to our next question, please. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein.","Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to delve a little bit into the communication infrastructure. So it sounds like you seem to be seeing both cyclical as well as potentially secular strength in this. I was wondering if could give us a feeling for how much longer you believe the 4G build out that we are seeing right now are going to take place and maybe give us a little more color on the secular aspect of this in terms of content increase, how much is your content for base station increasing as well migrating? And how much is left in this com infrastructure leftover we are seeing right now has?","Vince Roche","Yeah. Let me take your second question first, Stacy. So, increase per system per antenna basically in terms of the overall content that we ship into these base stations.","Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein","For 4G systems.","Vincent Roche","For 4G systems. And when it comes to what we see in terms of demand here, so as I\u2019ve said before, the infrastructure business is very, very lumpy, but I think what we\u2019re starting to see and playing that was, obviously China is very, very strong, very hot at the present time, but America also continues the densification of the network and we are seeing companies like Sprint up their CapEx and continue to build the infrastructure there.","There are also trials taking place in Europe. Now Europe is at long last beginning to wake up to the need to replace and upgrade its network to 4G. So I think what we\u2019re seeing is a major shift towards 4G. In fact, it will be we think towards the end of this year probably be 50% of our total unit shipments into those particular base station units and that likely be the trend. We see continued growth in that business throughout the year and we will take next year as it comes, but I think at least from the signs we see at the present time we have lot of cost for optimism.","Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. So my follow-up, I just wanted to ask quickly, you said you were building some of our CapEx was being spent on new facilities, could you give us some color on that, what if it, is that assembly in test, is that wafer fab, what are you building out?","Vincent Roche","Good question. So of the $180 million or so that was spent this year about $60 million of it is related to plants and equipment I guess or plants rather. The most significant piece is a new design center in Ireland that we agree to put in. We are actually getting some systems from the Irish government as well. There is another couple of pieces that are, we have a small building getting build in facilities, that\u2019s related to -- that is related to manufacturing, so that is back end test. And then we have an upgrade of the building in Greensboro which is also design related so that\u2019s more of an engineering building.","Ali Husain","Thanks Stacy. And we will move on to our next question.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura.","Romit Shah - Nomura","Just want to get back to the April results, which were clearly much better than your comps reported in with the March quarter end. And it just seems like the reversals from what we\u2019ve seen in prior periods. I was kind of curious how much of this is one month lag versus new product traction that could be dragging something that\u2019s more sustainable?","Dave Zinsner","Well, I think it\u2019s a combination of many things. Obviously given that our business is very, very CapEx centric, that as the macro environment gently improves that helps. I think pretty clearly in the automobile, communications, infrastructure sectors in particular we\u2019re getting a lot of new product growth traction. So I think it\u2019s a combination of those two things really.","Romit Shah - Nomura","Okay, thank you.","Dave Zinsner","Thanks.","Ali Husain","Thanks, Romit. Move on to our next question.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank","Congrats on the strong quarter and guide. It is high level question for you. In the last couple of years we\u2019ve seen a good strong first half of the year in semiconductors and then the second half is slowed down whether for macro reasons or otherwise. You definitely sound a lot more confident while book to growth is looking like this year. Can you give us a little bit more color on why you are confident, any sort of data points, duration of backlog, anything along those lines that helps us understand the longer-term confident that you guys are displaying now? Thank you.","Vincent Roche","Ross, thanks for the question. So what we see I think the facts are we have very, very little visibility on the quarter, I mean that\u2019s a fact, but I can tell you that our customers in CapEx areas in the automotive customers are seeing good backlog right through the significant portion of the year coming. I have said before that from talking to customers across the globe, particularly industrial customers who involved in plant automation and process control very, very sophisticated process control systems.","There is just a general improvement in the sentiment and their confidence to actually lay out CapEx. So our customers select CapEx on them. So I think it\u2019s a combination of the gradually improving macro environment, the stability there and I think as we said our business is so CapEx sensitive that we pay very, very close attention to what our industrial customers and infrastructure customers tell us and things are just generally better know than they were last year let\u2019s say.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank","Great, thank you.","Ali Husain","Thanks, Ross. Move on to our next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Steven Smigie with Raymond James.","Vincent Sgherza - Raymond James","This is a Vince filling in for Steve. I was hoping if you can go into a detail as far as what the size and growth of your MEMS business currently is?","Vincent Roche","We don\u2019t typically go into more detail than we provide in the -- on the earnings release and the in the K or in the Q.","Vincent Sgherza - Raymond James","Okay, all right. In that case could you go into a little detail about on you front end solutions as far as how much is currently done in-house and what incremental target would be?","Dave Zinsner","In total or related to MEMS?","Vincent Sgherza - Raymond James","In total.","Dave Zinsner","In total, okay. So we do about 50% of the wafers internal and the other 50% we source from outside foundries, and that\u2019s actually been pretty consistent almost since I have been here it feels like. So I wouldn\u2019t say we had a particular target in mind, although we do like to keep our internal fabs as full as possible. Lot of it\u2019s based on the particular process that product has been designed in depending on whether it\u2019s very fine line or CMOS running at some (indiscernible) generally it usually goes outside and through the other processes and things that kind of go above 0.18 or 0.25 micro, we generally do insight. The way things have been trending and the way our products have gained traction, it just appears that we seem to be on this kind of normalized level of above 50% internal and 50% external. So I don\u2019t see any reason why that would change.","Vincent Sgherza - Raymond James","Great, thank you.","Vincent Roche","Thanks, Vince. And I guess we have some events on the call tonight. So we will move onto our next question.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee.","Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee","Hi, guys. A good quarter. Just a question on the comp side, it\u2019s up nicely 10% sequentially. But when you look at China, how much of that 400,000, 500,000 base station rollout is done and do you see an acceleration -- reacceleration of comp going to the second half?","Vincent Roche","Yes, I really can\u2019t answer, I just don\u2019t have the -- I really don\u2019t have the number in terms of how much of the original contract has already been spent. The indications are that we will have another good quarter in the third quarter in China. So that\u2019s pretty much in terms of the evidence I can give you. I don\u2019t have any more granularity than that.","Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee","Got it. And on the consumer side, you mentioned strength on prosumer. Is that mostly power management that you are doing in the -- what are you driving on to the consumer side?","Vincent Roche","Yes. So it\u2019s a mixture, it\u2019s actually a mix of many, many different things, it\u2019s DSPs, we have high end DSPs in there. We sell a lot of converters into connectivity products, linear products, in areas like studio broadcast, in media systems for enterprises for example. So it\u2019s a great mixture, it\u2019s a lot like horizontal business with lots of customers and lots of different products.","Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee","Got it. Thanks.","Ali Husain","Thanks, Vijay. And we will move on to our next question Operator.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays","Thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could going back to the consumer segment, you saw rebound off the bottom but then flat, I would assume July and October be seasonally stronger quarters. Because wondering if you just talk about what\u2019s going on there and then address the opportunity for some of these as you call biosensors or heart rate sensors obviously when to watch small volumes but can you just talk about the longer term opportunities there for you?","Vincent Roche","As we\u2019ve always said, we pick our entry points in the consumer markets very, very carefully, particularly the portable area. So we participate in areas where we can find audio, sensor, and the imaging type application where we leverage our core technologies that we are purpose for those applications. So my sense is, yes, the beginning of the year will be better. And I again that\u2019s a business that\u2019s very programmatic and very hard to predict quarter-on-quarter, but overall I think we are playing in the right places with the right customers and right technologies. And I believe as I have said before I believe the bottom of the re-profiling of our consumer business and things will improve gradually. I think, we\u2019ve got a good base of business now. And with some of these newer applications that we\u2019re playing in, we\u2019ll see some decent growth in future, including the vital signs monitoring application, where again we\u2019ve developed technology for clinical applications that we have repurposed for some of these vital signs monitoring in consumer areas.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays","Got you. And then just a quick one for Dave, I just want to make sure your inventory levels, are you getting get your target this quarter based on the revenue guide that you gave and then we can think about utilization in terms of revenue for October and beyond?","Dave Zinsner","I think it will come down. I\u2019m not quite sure that we\u2019ll get down to a 110 day target. I would say that we\u2019re looking for a glide path 210 days by the end of the year.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays","Got you. Thanks.","Ali Husain","Thanks, Blayne. Move on to our next question Operator.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of CJ Muse with ISI Group.","CJ Muse - ISI Group","Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess specific to industrial segment, curious what impacts recovery in Europe has had on that business? And then if I could sneak in a second question, was hoping you can talk bigger picture about your strategy for power management. You guys clearly a leader in data conversion and amplifiers, curious, kind of think about your focus on that business? Thank you.","Dave Zinsner","Okay. I\u2019ll take the second one which is the power management question and I\u2019ll pass it on to Vince to answer the first one. So, on the power management side, our strategy is somewhat kind of selective. What we try to do is develop power solution that fit along side our signal processing solution in an effort to provide kind of a complete holistic solution to the customer. ","So, we\u2019re not trying to be a broad-based supplier of power. We\u2019re trying to pick our spots where we\u2019re very strong on an application spaces in signal processing and then pull along the power. And quite honestly, it\u2019s a situation where customers are actually asking us for that. They want to complete kind of the out of the box solution and powers the important part of powering and signal processing. And so in those instances when they want us to marshal all the resources to bring forth the solution, we leverage our power capability to do that.","Vincent Roche","Yes. So with regard to Europe, the areas of primary strength for us over the last quarter or two really has been the areas with an industrial automation, instrumentation. Our healthcare business is healthy, doing quite well, but the standard performers really at this point in time right now are automotive and communications infrastructure not surprisingly given the strength of Europe in those particular areas.","CJ Muse - ISI Group","Great. Thank you.","Ali Husain","Thanks, C.J. And we\u2019ll move on to our next question, Operator.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS.","Stephen Chin - UBS","Hi, thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the solid results and guidance.","Vincent Roche","Thank you.","Stephen Chin - UBS","Vince, I just wanted to get some more color on the future R&D or these investments in the future growth areas. Can you provide some color on how you are prioritizing those investments and whether you are looking at more from further enhancing, expanding gross margins or is it operating margins that you\u2019re looking at, or is it maximizing the investment that you have on the internal wafer front-end fab investments and so forth?","Vincent Roche","Well, our investment strategy really is to find as many attractive opportunities as we can in the B2B space, which is industrial communication infrastructure and automotive and very selectively fix spots in the consumer area, where we can play and really make a difference. We\u2019re a signal processing company. We think there\u2019s a tremendous future for ADI in the signal processing space.","And as Dave said, we\u2019ve increased our OpEx and specifically trying to find ways to increase the strength of our portfolio and converters. We\u2019re picking every spot. We\u2019re really pushing performance there. Our linear products, we\u2019ve been increasing spend in areas like RF and microwave, increasing our spend in our MEMS technology, which traditionally has been very, very strong in the automotive area.","We continue to see a lot of upside there. We are also diversifying our MEMS technology now into industrial application. That just gives you a sense for how we\u2019re viewing things. So, number one job for us is to make sure that we keep our core, we defend our core and growth, so that\u2019s job number one. And we\u2019ve increased our impetus as well in looking for new ways of growth that can leverage our technology in new and exciting applications in areas that maybe connect our tech, the real world to the cloud for example. So we see signal processing as a great space to be and we\u2019re focusing more and more and more in the B2B area in that technology space.","Ali Husain","And as you mentioned Vince, that\u2019s now about 89% of our total sale. So, I hope that answered the question, Stephen. We\u2019ll move on to our next question.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ian Ing with MKM Partners.","Ian Ing - MKM Partners","Yes. Thanks and I share in my congratulations. So, for Dave, you have a nice capital return strategy, 80% of free cash flow return to investors. Any room to re-visit that or do you have new product investments? It looks like TI is running close to 100%, Maxim has been running above 80, perhaps they talk about something tomorrow at the Analyst Day.","Dave Zinsner","I think what right now, we\u2019re going to kind of stick with the 80%. We\u2019ve already been doing it for about a year. I think Vincent announced that at this call last year, so I want to see how that goes for a while. There is, I think a desire on our part to put some of the cash to use in other ways and tuck in M&A and so forth. So, I just want to keep something available to that purpose.","And quite honestly, I think, 80% is a pretty good return on cash in my opinion, particularly when a good chunk of that is coming in the form of the dividend, which is consistently paid year in and year out and actually grows year in and year out. So for now, we\u2019ll stick with the 80 and we\u2019ll revisit it perhaps at another date.","Ian Ing - MKM Partners","Excellent. Thank you.","Ali Husain","Thanks Ian. Another question Operator.","Operator","Yes. Our next question is from the line of William Stein with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions and again, congrats on the good quarter and the outlook.","Vincent Roche","Thank you.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Understanding that you have a mix of what you manufacture internally and externally. Can you give us an idea at what revenue level and utilization level do you think you likely start seeing lead time stretch and kind of bumping into point where you need to add more fundamental capacity, not just kind of design capacity that you\u2019ve discussed earlier?","Dave Zinsner","Yes. So the wafers we manufactured internally, we\u2019re obviously rolling into mid 70s. We have pretty decent runway before we run into a challenge just in a quick capacity. We have actually more clean room space than that. And so equipping it is relatively inexpensive and can be done relatively quickly, such that if you say that right now roughly $350 million or so of our revenue comes from internally sourced wafers.","I think we could easily double that, if not more before we ever have to worry about something on the front end. So I\u2019ll love when that problem arises but I don\u2019t see that problem coming forth anytime soon. On the external side, we have a pretty focused set of foundries that we use and because of the volume that we purchase from them, we tend to have a lot of clout.","So we\u2019ve been in the situations where in the past where things have upturned quite significantly. And in fact, this quarter being an example of one. And we get very, very good reaction from our foundry partners in order to meet that demand. So again, these are foundries that have very, very good capacity. And we tend to be a lagging edge node for them. So we get -- I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to run into an issue there.","And then on top of that, one of the reasons we carry -- right now 115 but hopefully gliding down to a 110 days of inventory, which is not an insignificant amount of inventory is because we want to make sure we keep lead time short. So we have a lot of buffer inventory both around our balance sheet and with the distributors to make sure we keep lead time very short.","So I think in the last, certainly in the last time, I\u2019ve been here which is five years and I\u2019m going to guess in the last 10 years. I think we\u2019ve ever had lead times stretch out beyond four to six week that we\u2019ve been operating in. So I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s going to be much of a risk for us.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Great. Thank you.","Dave Zinsner","Thank you.","Ali Husain","Thanks Will. And looks like we\u2019re a few minutes short to the hour and I look at Christina here and she tells me there\u2019s no one left in the queue. So with all that I would like to thank you for keeping very good time. And just a reminder again, ADI will be hosting our Analyst Day on June 17th in New York. I invite everyone to listen in. Links to the webcast and presentations will be available at the adiinvestor.analog.com webpage. And secondly, that our third quarter FY \u201814 earnings call is scheduled for August 19, 2014 beginning at 5 p.m. Eastern. So thanks again for tuning in everyone.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Analog Devices' Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the opening remarks, there will be a question and answer period. Please limit yourself to one question to ensure that management has adequate time to speak to everyone.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Ali Husain, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Ali Husain - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Jennifer, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining Analog Devices' third quarter fiscal 2015 earnings conference call. You can find our press release and relating financial schedules at our Investor page at investor.analog.com. Before we begin, I want to call your attention to two new items. Number one is about a change around the timing of our future earnings conference calls and, number two is about increasing the level of information we provide investors.","So, first, starting next quarter, which will be our fiscal fourth quarter, we're going to move our earnings conference call to the morning. After speaking with many investors and analysts, we believe a morning call is a more convenient time for all stakeholders.","As a result of this change, starting November 24, 2015, which is our fourth quarter 2015 earnings call, and for every quarterly earnings conference call thereafter, we will issue our earnings release at 8:00 A.M. Eastern Time, and the earnings conference call will take place two hours later at 10:00 A.M. Eastern Time. Secondly, we've introduced an investor slide deck, which we call the investor toolkit, and this slide deck, or tool kit, has been designed to provide investors with even more clarity around our results. We've posted the tool kit on our Investor page at investor.analog.com, and this is something we plan to prepare and post every quarter to our website.","So let's get back to today's call. As usual, I'm joined by ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche, and ADI's CFO, Dave Zinsner. Our agenda for today's call will be as follows. First, I will provide a brief overview of our third quarter results. Then Dave will review our financial performance in the third quarter and provide our business outlook for the fourth quarter. And finally, Vince will capstone the scripted portion of today's call with his closing remarks.","Now, as is customary, after our prepared remarks, we'll open up the lines for Q&A. So please note the information we're about to discuss today including our objectives and outlook includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.","Our comments today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which we have reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in today's earnings release, which we've posted on our IR page at investor.analog.com. So with all of that behind us, let's get started.","So as you've likely seen from our press release, ADI had another very strong performance in the third quarter of 2015. The combined power of our franchise, our commitment to innovation, the diversity of our business and our continued strong execution delivered results that were at the very high-end of our guidance range. Revenue in the third quarter of $863 million increased 5% sequentially and 19% year-over-year, once again, establishing a new high watermark for ADI. By end market, the industrial and automotive sectors were about in line with our expectations while consumer revenue exceeded our plan, and more than offset the impact from a weak wireless infrastructure CapEx environment.","Now, I'd like to give you some color on our performance by end market during the third quarter. At 44% of total sales, our highly diversified industrial business was about even to the prior quarter. Strength within industrial verticals, such as aerospace and defense and the renewable energy sector, was offset by weaker industrial automation sales. End customer bookings in the industrial market were generally stable during the quarter. We believe that there's currently a good match between supply and demand in our industrial business, which is largely serviced through distribution where we recognize revenue in all regions of the world on a sell-through basis.","Now, turning to automotive, after growing 13% sequentially in the second quarter, automotive decreased 7% in the seasonally slower third quarter and represented 15% of our total sales. At the current quarterly run rate, automotive represents a $500-million-plus annual business for Analog Devices.","Revenue from our hundreds of communications infrastructure customers at 16% of sales declined 22% sequentially, which was the third consecutive quarter of sequential revenue declines in this sector. Revenue from wireline customers represented about one-third of our communications infrastructure sales, and was approximately flat to the prior quarter. A weaker than planned wireless infrastructure market in North America and China combined with customer inventory draw-downs impacted our performance in the third quarter. We believe that current wireless infrastructure revenue run rates for ADI are artificially low, and that our strong position in the sector will allow us to recover rapidly when this market snaps back, as it usually does without much notice.","Consumer revenues at 24% of sales grew significantly over the prior quarter. While prosumer audio\/video was stable sequentially, portable applications continue to drive our consumer growth. Our strategy in consumer remains strikingly consistent. We participate in those applications where we can leverage existing core technology to solve our customers' toughest challenges where we believe our innovation is sustainable, and where our technology makes a meaningful difference to the user experience. And by leveraging existing core technology, we further increase the ROI on our R&D investments.","So now I'd like to turn the call over to Dave for details of our financial performance in the third quarter. With the expectation of revenue and other expense, Dave's comments on third quarter 2015 P&L line items will exclude special items, which in the aggregate total $30 million. When comparing our third quarter performance to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior quarter results and year-over-year results and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their comparable GAAP measures are included on Schedule E in today's earnings release.","So with that, Dave, it's all yours.","David A. Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Ali, and good afternoon, everyone. The third quarter of 2015 turned out to be another strong quarter for ADI, with revenue increasing to a record $863 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.77, both at the high-end of the range. Gross margin in the third quarter of 66.1% was down 40 basis points from the prior quarter and was well within our gross margin model range of 65% to 68%. Factory utilization in the third quarter was about even to the prior quarter. Inventory on a day's basis in the third quarter increased by one day to 128 days, and on a dollars basis, increased by $30 million, primarily related to the positioning of inventory for higher expected consumer revenue in the fourth quarter. Deferred revenue on shipments to distributors on a dollars basis increased by 6% from the prior quarter and distributor inventory on a week's basis was at 7.5 weeks, which is within our model range and consistent with the prior quarter.","Operating expenses in the third quarter increased 2% sequentially, lagging well behind the 5% sequential increase in revenue as we continue to manage operating costs very tightly, allowing us to gain more operating leverage in our model. As a percent of sales, operating expenses in the third quarter declined 90 basis points compared to the prior quarter and declined 210 basis points compared to the same period a year ago. Operating profit as a percent of sales has been on a steady march upward starting in the first quarter of 2014 when it was 29% of sales. In the just completed quarter, operating profit was approximately 500 basis points higher at 34.2% of sales, increasing sequentially and year-over-year and well within our operating model range of 32% to 36% of revenue.","Other expense in the third quarter was approximately $6 million. We expect our net interest expense to be approximately $5 million in the fourth quarter. Our third quarter tax rate was approximately 15%, which is also the rate we expect in the fourth quarter. Excluding special items, diluted earnings per share of $0.77 increased by 5% over the prior quarter, and 22% year-over-year and was at the high-end of our guidance range.","At the end of the third quarter, our cash and short-term investment balance was $3.1 billion, with approximately $700 million available domestically. We had approximately $870 million in debt outstanding, which resulted in a net cash position of $2.2 billion.","During the third quarter, capital expenditures were $35 million. Our capital expenditure plan for fiscal 2015 is to be between $155 million and $160 million. Our financial model generates strong cash flows, and we are committed to returning cash to our shareholders. For the trailing 12 months, we generated free cash flow of $822 million, or 25% of sales, and returned $784 million, or 95% of that free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Today, we announced that our board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.40 per outstanding share of common stock, and that will be paid on September 9 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on August 28. So in summary, the third quarter was another very successful quarter for Analog Devices.","So now, I'll turn to our fourth quarter outlook, which, with the exception of revenue, is on a non-GAAP basis and excludes special items that are outlined in today's call and release. While order trends in the industrial market are stable, we're entering the seasonally slower fourth quarter for our industrial business, and as a result, expect this sector to decline somewhat from the third quarter levels. In automotive and communications infrastructure, order rates are also stable. And we, therefore, expect these markets to remain about even to the third quarter levels. In consumer, we expect to benefit from strong seasonal and cyclical trends, leading us to plan for continued strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter.","So, in total, we're planning for revenue in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $880 million to $940 million, which represents an increase of approximately 2% to 9% sequentially. At the midpoint of this range, revenue of $910 million would represent an increase of 12% year-over-year. We expect gross margins in the fourth quarter to be approximately 65.5%, given a likely mix of business. We are anticipating operating expenses in the fourth quarter to increase between 1% and 3% sequentially, lagging our expected sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter.","One line item that we expect to exclude from our fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expenses is a special charge of approximately $220 million, associated with the conversion of our Irish defined benefit plan to a defined contribution plan. This conversion will give people employed by ADI's operations in Ireland more ownership in their own retirement assets, and will benefit the company by eliminating a growing, long-term liability while reducing expense volatility that is typically associated with these defined benefits plans. Based on these estimates, and excluding this and other special items, diluted earnings per share is anticipated to be in the range of $0.79 to $0.87 in the fourth quarter. At the midpoint of this range, diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 20% year-over-year which would be a great result relative to our EPS model of 8% to 15% growth.","So now, I'll turn the call over to Vince for closing remarks.","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everybody. As we've talked about in today's remarks, the third quarter was another excellent quarter for ADI, reflecting the combined power of our strong execution and our balanced approach to growth, profitability, and shareholder returns. At ADI, we continue to focus on superior and sustainable innovation, and we leverage our investments across diverse applications and customers. Today, ADI's 20,000 strong product offerings are in thousands of applications at over 100,000 customers, helping them sense, measure, interpret, and connect the physical world.","It is quite true to say that wherever the toughest signal processing challenges lie, be they on a factory floor or indeed at the outer edge of our solar system, customers are increasingly relying on ADI's product and applications knowhow to help navigate the new intersection between the physical and the digital worlds. Just this past quarter, for example, ADI's mixed-signal processing capability was onboard the New Horizons deep space probe, providing critical measurement and conversion capability to the spacecraft as it navigated past the surface of Pluto.","In industrial applications, we see factory automation and control, or as some call it industrial IoT, as the next driver of industrial revitalization. Other industrial applications that fall within this umbrella include smart agriculture and smart cities. All these applications leverage our current product offerings as we help our customers carve out new ways of using our technology and, in many ways, helping them unlock new sources of value in this emerging industrial IoT.","One of the areas that most excites me about the impact of our innovation is in healthcare where we have been investing for some time now. Here our focus is on critical care imaging applications and clinical-grade vital signs monitoring. Today, ADI's working with several of the world's leading research institutions and systems OEMs to drive game-changing advancements in the performance, impact, and affordability of medical electronics devices, helping shift healthcare delivery to point of care and greatly improving the lives of countless patients.","In automotive, active, predictive, and passive safety systems, precision power train control systems, and high quality multimedia systems require a proliferation of sensors and actuators, which in turn place ever-increasing demands on signal processing technologies as do government mandates. These are an excellent match for our offerings.","In addition, while we continue to have a strong position with U.S. and European manufacturers, we still have opportunity ahead as we increasingly serve the Asian market. The near-term volatility in communications infrastructure gives us no pause about the long-term upward trend in this market. The facts are that 4G penetration is low, data consumption is increasing exponentially, and radio density is also increasing. But in order for carriers to continue densifying their networks, our customers must solve the significant challenges associated with making the most efficient and flexible use of available spectrum, while at the same time reducing power and systems cost. ADI's software defined radio and transceiver technologies help solve these very tough challenges, while also delivering a lower total cost of ownership to our customers and in the process driving growth for ADI.","In wireline infrastructure, we focus primarily around the timing and control of the signal path and optical communication systems where the engineering challenge requires very high performance timing and precision processing. The move from 10G and 40G to 100G systems to satisfy burgeoning data demand further creates strong growth opportunities for ADI. Overall, our mixed-signal, RF, and microwave technologies are in increasing demand for many thousands of customers. And we are continuing to invest aggressively to capture the growing opportunity available to us.","So, in summary, we remain committed to growing our revenues at 2-times to 3-times GDP, to grow diluted earnings per share by 8% to 15% annually, and achieve our EPS goal of $4 to $5 by 2020. Finally, let me end by saying that the uncertainty in the macro environment is not new to any of us. At ADI, we take a long-term view, and we believe that innovation is the cornerstone of business success. While we manage our investments conservatively, we execute our strategy aggressively. So we are confident that our ethos of innovation, our leadership in signal processing, and our alignment to favorable macro trends will allow us to outperform and continue delivering strong returns to our shareholders.","Ali Husain - Director-Investor Relations","Great, thanks, Vince. Thank you. All right, folks, during today's Q&A session, please limit yourself to one question. We're going to run the call until 6:00 P.M., so after you ask your primary question please re-queue if you'd like to ask a second question. And the reason we do this, is we run our call in this format, and the callers \u2013 all the callers get a chance to participate on the call and get to ask at least one of their questions. So we try to do it in the spirit of fairness here.","So with that, operator, let's start the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Chris Danely with Citi.","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, thanks, guys. Just a question on the, I guess, the consumer end market. Obviously this is a pretty strong performance this quarter and the previous quarter. For the January quarter, do you think consumer can continue to increase, and what would be the factors there?","David A. Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Good question, Chris. Typically, the first quarter for consumer is seasonally down. So I think we would expect, year-over-year, it would be up, but my guess is sequentially it will be down because that's typically what happens seasonally in that business as kind of the Christmas season gets behind us.","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Do I get to follow up?","David A. Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","No. Re-queue.","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","All right. You don't ask you don't get it.","Ali Husain - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks for the question, Chris. This is Ali here. I think this is a good opportunity to remind folks, on the line here, about the ADI story and why we believe ADI offers investors, what we believe is a unique combination and a fairly balanced approach to all three things, revenue growth, operating leverage, and shareholder returns. So in terms of revenue growth, we believe we're tied to the right end markets with the right technologies and products. For example, about two-thirds of our sales are from industrial and automotive and over two-thirds of our sales are from products and technologies where we, in fact, lead the market. So we believe that forms a pretty good wide, sustainable moat around the business.","Number two, in terms of operating leverage, as Dave mentioned in his prepared remarks, we've marched those margins up about 500 basis points over the last several quarters, and we still have about 200 basis points of operating margin leverage remaining in our model. And lastly, in terms of shareholder returns, as you all know, we've committed to returning 80% of our free cash flow to shareholders. We also have a target to increase our EPS by 8% to 15% annually. We have an EPS target of $4 to $5 per share, which when you look at the trailing 12-month number here, we've been kind of in the $2.80 ZIP code. So we believe that $4 to $5 EPS target is a meaningful one for investors.","So, all said, we believe we've got a pretty good balance of revenue growth, leverage, and shareholder returns going. So thanks for the question, Chris. Feel free to re-queue. And we'll get to our next question. Thanks.","Operator","This question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I guess, Dave, I want to get a little bit to the margin profile on the consumer business both on the gross and operating line. I'm assuming that all the gross margins declined in the October quarter is because of increase in consumer. I'm just wondering, it seems like consumer is up a lot in October but not up as much as July. But the impact to gross margins, sequentially, is about the same. I'm just wondering if there's anything going on within consumer mix. And I guess, more importantly, how do I think about operating margins in that consumer business? Because clearly, there's not as much SG&A expense to that incremental revenue. So is it sort of diluted to kind of gross margin, but accretive to op margin? Is that the way I should think about it? Thanks.","David A. Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Well, there's a lot of puts and takes in both the third and fourth quarter. Gross margins are a little bit dilutive in the consumer business, obviously, but it's relatively modest compared to the corporate average, but there are a whole lot of other businesses that are going up and down, and so collectively I think mix was actually pretty flat for the third quarter. We think the fourth quarter probably mix will impact it a little bit negatively. I think the gross margins really were down in the third quarter mostly as a result of inventory reserves we took, again, some last-time builds related to Hittite as we transitioned some of the production away from one foundry and into another foundry.","The old parts we took a reserve on for the levels that were beyond, I think, about a year. On the operating margin side, the incremental consumer business is accretive. That's why we saw gross margin expansion this quarter, and that's why we think the midpoint of our guidance will see operating margin expansion in the fourth quarter as well. So it's obviously, we were leveraging a lot of existing technology that we've invested over the course of a decade, probably, to be able to serve the consumer business. And so, as a result, the ongoing R&D expense isn't terribly significant.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","That's helpful, Dave. Thank you and congratulations on the strong results.","Operator","This question comes from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the question, guys, and congratulations on the performance. The question is a follow up to the two earlier, with regards to the consumer segment. Can you speak to the degree to which you're seeing application and customer breadth with the platform technology that's favorably impacting the third and fourth quarter's results? And from here, what's the opportunity to grow customers and application exposure as you look out to fiscal 2016?","David A. Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Well, precision technology, we're attempting to leverage that across all of our end markets and all of our customers. The specific product that is driving some of the demand for next quarter is specific to one customer, and in a lot cases, we work with those customers to customize the technology for their needs, and obviously as we do that, we don't give that to another customer to be able to utilize. So, I mean, I don't know if this answers your question, Craig, but our fundamental tenet is to take our technology and leverage it to as many customers as we possibly can and as many end markets as we possibly can.","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Craig, we have a 40-year-plus heritage of developing silicon, precision silicon, high-speed silicon. But the precision silicon is \u2013 the industrial market is largely about control type applications, which is precision oriented. So that's the primary market for that technology. And as you get different markets driving technology at different rates and you get a ping pong between one market and another. So there's good leverage from the industrial type applications into consumer for that technology, but also vice versa. So many, many thousands of customers, and we have \u2013 the business there is largely about many thousands of customers, many thousands of products. But in some cases, we customize products for markets and indeed customers. So it's a very, very complex diversified space.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Thanks, guys.","Operator","This question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes, thank you. Great results. I want to ask a non-consumer question. So some of your peers have talked about the slowdown here in the last couple of months in order rates especially in the industrial market. I'm just wondering what you're seeing. I do realize you're guiding for the industrial business to be fairly flat this quarter, but just really from a macro level what are you seeing on your order rates?","David A. Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","I would say, so, in general, our order rates were pretty stable. They were stronger, obviously, in the consumer business. They were a little softer in the industrial business. But not atypical for this period of time given that July and August are months in which a lot of industrial customers take the opportunity to shut down their production for some period of time. And so, we normally see a little bit of a softer patch in terms of order levels. But it was very typical relative to other third quarters, so we didn't really see anything anomalous in the order patterns that would suggest there's macro weakness out there or anything like that.","Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks.","Ali Husain - Director-Investor Relations","And the only thing I'd add to that, Tore, is when you look at generally some of the outlooks provided by some of the large distributors out there for their components business, they're generally operating in some level \u2013 some seasonal range. They may be operating at a lower end of that seasonal range. But I think for folks like ADI where we don't have a lot of PC exposure. In fact, our PC exposure is probably nil. And we're levered to the kinds of markets, particularly in the industrial space for example, that do play, I guess, in \u2013 I guess, fairly closely, I guess, with some of the distributors are also exposed to, number one.","Number two, our revenue recognition policy is extremely conservative. We only recognize revenue when distributors sell through, so we believe we're probably a little closer to end demand than maybe some of the other folks out there, so. And then lastly our weeks of inventory in the channel are still at sort of 7 weeks, 7.5 weeks. And our sense of it is that we're operating in some kind of a seasonal range here. The bottom hasn't dropped off, I'd say, as maybe some of the competitors out there have maybe spoken about. But I think generally our sense is that what we're seeing is generally in line with probably what you've heard from some of the other distributors out there.","Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","That's helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","This question comes from Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yes, thank you. Just a follow up question with regard to the automotive market. And that was also a market that looked like it was a bit weaker than perhaps you had planned coming into the quarter. Would you consider the order rates there also to be stable? Obviously there's a lot of macro concerns in there. What are your customers telling you with regard to the market?","David A. Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","At this point, that business is stable. I mean, the third quarter is generally a softer quarter again for the automotive space. Again, it's for the same reasons that the industrial business is generally sees some weakness in the summer months, automotive guys tend to take some production downtime particularly in July. It was kind of on the lower-end of our normalized range that we would have expected, so it wasn't out of the norm, maybe just a little bit weaker. And of course, this is always tough to call with any form of certainty. But the order rates were stable in auto. My guess is they will be at least flat in terms of shipments next quarter if not a little bit better, and so I think that business is behaving as we would expect.","Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And this question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking my question. It's related to the automotive space. When we look at the growth so far this year, it's sort of been flattish. And the question is, is this just tied to some specific customer patterns? Or is it just lumpiness? Or do you think some other consolidation or M&A might be required to get growth rates up to what a lot of the peers are reporting.","David A. Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","I mean, I think we have a really good pipeline of opportunities in that business. And Vince and I have spent the last several weeks really kind of going through their pipeline with them. And we're excited about really in every sub-segment within automotive and infotainment and in safety, in power train, the opportunities we see out there in the future for automotive. Every so often you get a year where because of the way the models kind of roll out and the timing of where our products get designed into those customers. Sometimes you get a year that is a little softer.","And that's made up usually by another year where things are very strong. One year I think we grew 25% year-over-year. Another year I think we grew 4%. So this is pretty much in the norm. Our goal is to grow this business kind of high-singles, maybe even into the double-digit range over time, and we'll have certain years that do better than others. But if you look at the pipeline, we think we've got the opportunities to allow us to drive good growth in that business.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks and congrats again on the execution.","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","This question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Can you go into a little more detail on what's going on in the comm side? We know that China was weak for others and you split out the wireline versus the wireless side, but the confidence you have that you're under-shipping demand and any sort of guess as to when that might snapback?","David A. Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","I think communications, as you know, has seen some weakness particularly in China, given what we think is kind of a stoppage of rollout of macro base stations while they do some investigations. We think we've kind of reached the bottom of what we might experience, and that it's unlikely to get any lower from here on the wireless space. But it's anybody's guess as to when that kind of resumes. We have gotten \u2013 and Vince can probably add more color to this \u2013 we have gotten input from our OEM customers that it will resume, and it's really just a question of when at this point getting the answer.","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think Dave is right. At least the demand from the OEMs and ADI is stable. And as Dave said, I believe we've hit the bottom. So I think we're \u2013 let's say, we're primed and ready to go in terms of supply line when the demand kicks back, which I believe will be much sooner than later here.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Ali Husain - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Ross. And the only thing I'd add to that is the bookings are \u2013 as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, the bookings are stable, which is always a good sign in this business. And we did go back and look to see when the last time we were at these kind of revenue levels in the comms infrastructure space, and it's been a long time. So it's very, very low. And our sense is that things are at least stable here. And if you can call the recovery on it, let me know. But it's always harder for us to do it. So, all right, well, thanks for the question. We'll get to our next caller.","Operator","This question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, thanks for taking my question. And I'll offer my congrats as well. Dave, I was just curious, you came in at the high-end of the range, but the other segments are weak. So, consumer is up even more. To the extent you can talk about it, I know it's hard, what drove that upside? Was it more timing? Maybe the ramp happened earlier? Or was it just the sheer volume? And then as you look to October, it's the wider range than usual, particularly given it looks like it's mostly consumer. Can you talk about what the puts and takes there are as well? Is there other products or is it just you're being taking a more conservative angle on the ramp? Any help there? Thanks.","David A. Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, sure. Thanks, Blayne. So the third quarter did come in within the range. Clearly, it was at the high-end of the range. So we did have a scenario in which we were going to get to this level. It doesn't come as a complete surprise. I would say that that was our kind of best case scenario, and that, that actually played out. And, obviously, that had a lot to do with the consumer business and the fact that these ramps can be dynamic in terms of how the production gets rolled out. And you get input from the customers, but that is changing week-to-week. And you never know really how things are going to progress.","And so we take a couple of different scenarios that might occur, and it just so happened that this one ended up being the more positive outcome. We, again, do that for the fourth quarter, and that is why we have a wider range. There's obviously a scenario in which the production ramps fast and stays stable within the quarter. There's a scenario obviously in which it ramps up, but then they get to their inventory levels that they need, and things pause for a little bit. So we hope that we've been conservative enough in the forecast to make sure that we stay within this range, and I think we have tortured this quite a bit, as you might imagine. And we feel pretty confident that we've got the right range in there.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Perfect. Thanks.","David A. Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Sure.","Operator","This question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hello?","Ali Husain - Director-Investor Relations","Hey, Ambrish.","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi.","Ali Husain - Director-Investor Relations","You're on.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Sorry, I'm on the road. Just wanted to make sure I could be heard. Just a question on the overall business mix, what is the right way to think about longer-term the business would look like? Clearly, consumer is doing great for you, but, as we all know, the investor base is also attracted to the balanced \u2013 Ali, as you were pointing out, the balanced business model, no real concentration to a customer. So longer term, what's the right way to think about \u2013 what is the mix that will make you folks feel comfortable, \"okay, this is kind of how the business should look like?\" Thank you.","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, the strategy's playing out as we've designed it. We have, let's say, over the last five years or six years, been steering more and more of our R&D towards what we consider to be business-to-business applications, like industrial, healthcare, automotive, and communications infrastructure. That's where the lion's share of our R&D is placed. And that's where the lion's share of our sales force works as well to ensure that we grab the opportunity by covering the broadest base of customers and applications that we can. We've always said, in the consumer area, that we have a very, very targeted, focused play in terms of R&D and customer engagement, and that we play only in spaces where our technology makes a huge difference to the user experience, and where the technology we believe is sustainable over time.","So, clearly, the consumer markets are more volatile than, let's say, the B-to-B markets, but we've got a good blend, I think, as a company in terms of being able to invest in the areas that give us the longer product lifecycles, the more sustainable businesses and I think a good bet and a very sustainable investment in the consumer space. So, yeah, over time, as demand moves between one sector or the other, B-to-B versus consumer, so will go the fortunes of the business. But I think overall what you've got to look at is the commitment that we've got to delivering 2-times to 3-times GDP, gross margins in the 65% to 68% range, and getting our EPS well above $4. So that's our goal, that's our mission, and that's what we're delivering.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you.","Operator","This question comes from Steve Smigie with Raymond James.","J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks a lot, guys. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about China, and specifically, can you talk about if industrial orders for China were any different from other regions. As you look more longer term, obviously, there's been a lot of talk in the news about this China shift to a different economy where they're not just the manufacturing hub of the world and investing more in the service economy, et cetera. So does that suggest you that maybe there's some lower opportunity for industrial growth for you guys into the future?","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, it's a very good question. So, clearly, as you said, China's shifting from we make it to we design it and build it, so we've benefited. This will be, actually, when history is written on our fiscal 2015 here, we will have had \u2013 we will have posted very, very strong double-digit growth in the industrial sector in China, across the board, in fact, in healthcare, in energy, transmission and distribution of energy in particular and also industrial instrumentation and automation. So, clearly, China is in the process of indigenizing the tech industry there, so we're benefiting from that in terms of our engagements with emerging OEMs in way outside of the consumer \u2013 communications infrastructure and consumer businesses. So industrial's emerging, automotive's emerging, healthcare's emerging. And we're doing particularly well, and pleased with the progress we're making in building out our business there.","J.

Thank you.","Operator","This question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Yes, thank you and congratulations on what looks like a very solid fiscal 2015. Vince, ADI has this history of being in and out of the consumer market, and if I look at the October quarter it looks like consumer will be roughly 30% of sales. And my guess is that portable will account for a substantial portion of that. So my question is, what's your confidence, or visibility, into sustaining your position here in this high-volume program?","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we have in the past, I think, in many cases, we have at one point in time about five years or six years ago, we were spending about 35% or 40% of the entire R&D budget of the company in many, many different applications within consumer. I think the way to think about this time, the spend is quite constrained. It is in an area that is very, very close to the core capability of the company, and we're playing with market leaders. We're playing with the leaders and defining really exciting opportunities together that we think have really got legs over the long-term. So it's a very focused engagement, and we are really concentrating on uncovering those problems that give us the opportunity to apply the best of our technology over the long-term. I think that's how to think about.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","I guess my question is how do you manage the risk associated with mix given that consumer is now a larger percentage of sales than I think we've seen in the last five years, 10 years.","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, the foundation of this company is the business-to-business space, it's the communications infrastructure, it's the industrial business, automotive, healthcare where we have many, many thousands of customers, hundreds and hundreds of applications, 20,000 product SKUs, and the R&D is largely pointed there. So that is the core business of ADI, and will remain so into the future. So, in terms of how \u2013 I'm telling you how we're strategically viewing it, how demand patterns evolve over time will depend on macro markets, will depend on the success of our technology, and so on and so forth. But I think we've got the right strategic mix here, and the rest is down to how well we execute in the markets.","Ali Husain - Director-Investor Relations","Okay, thanks, Romit.

Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","I think it's, yeah, roughly one.","Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Roughly one?

Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Just a question on Hittite, just a couple quarters in now. Just how the integration's going? And then just bigger picture, as you think about capital allocation and your appetite for M&A versus buybacks and dividends.","David A. Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Okay, well, the Hittite integration is going fantastic. The business has done great, and we are exactly on plan in terms of our synergies. And really \u2013 I'd be interested to hear Vince's take, but I would say it's almost as if that whole, prior Hittite aspect of the company's completely gone away. They're part of the ADI family. They operate \u2013 in a lot of ways you can't tell the ADI employees from the Hittite employees in the RF part of our business. So it's been a tremendous success.","Our intended use of capital does include acquisitions going forward. And we continue to look at different opportunities in that space. As you know, we're looking for technology that is highly differentiated, that's really synergistic with what we're doing with our customers, where our customers will see value in us having that capability or where we think that will integrate with some of the things we do in a way that just kind of elegantly provides a solution to the customer. And so we continually monitor what opportunities are out there. I wouldn't guarantee that we're going to do an acquisition in the next year, but I think it's a reasonable probability that there will be some tuck-in kind of opportunity for us over the next year that could be just as dynamic as Hittite was for the ADI business.","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think just to add a little bit of color to what Dave has said, in terms of Hittite, I mean, we were always very, very confident in the technology, the market position of Hittite. So really if there was a risk, it was going to be around the cultural integration of the two entities. So we knew that the value system at Hittite was very, very similar to ADI's in terms of the belief that innovation drives business success, that engineering excellence is really what matters in that business to customers.","And that's exactly how it's played out. And I think when you watch as I do the interaction of our engineering teams with our biggest customers out there and across the board in many, many different applications, not just in communications, but the leveraging of that technology into areas like aerospace and defense instrumentation, satellite communications, it's really tremendous. So I have enormous optimism and confidence about the combination of the RF and microwave talents across the entire company and what it means to the future growth prospects of ADI.

I'm wondering if you can dig a little bit more into the wireless part of the business? Understanding that we're seeing a pause in China and the business is down quite a bit from its prior peak, I'm wondering what gives you confidence that we're at the bottom and that you see a snapback in relatively short order? Thank you.","David A. Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Well, I think, it's two reasons. One, the order rates have stabilized over a fairly long period of time, and usually when things are weakening, you see it in the order rates pretty quickly. And then the other thing is Vince and some of the business unit leaders, they're regularly going out to the larger OEMs that supply into this space, our customers, to get a pulse of what's going on.","And the feedback from those customers is that they have obviously reduced their order flow to us to this level for reasons that we're all well aware of. But their expectation is that they're going to turn those order levels back up at some point within the next couple of quarters. So we don't know exactly when that'll happen. It could happen in the late part of next quarter, it could be first quarter before it happens. But given that the OEMs are telegraphing that to us, that gives us some confidence that we're at the bottom and that, in all likelihood, we'll see it turn back up at some point here.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great.

Good afternoon, guys. I guess a question on your free cash flow conversion numbers. It was around 19% this quarter as a percent of sales. The last four quarters it's been around 25% I think. What do you think it takes it to get to within your target of 28% to 32%? And as consumer gets bigger, does that have any impact to your free cash flow generation as you go forward?","David A. Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Well, that's a good question. I think, really, when you look at this quarter because of the ramp in the consumer business, that requires us to lay out a fair amount of cash to our foundries to build up the inventory to be able to support that demand. And so our working capital number, I think, if you looked at it relative to the past several quarters, you'll see it's actually quite a bit more negative than in most quarters. I think that's part of it. We were in the trailing edges of spending a bit on building infrastructures. That's mostly behind us now. And so I think that starts to improve.","And then lastly, we pay our variable compensation every other quarter. It just so happened to be this quarter we paid out half a year's worth of variable compensation. And so that hit us as well. So this was, like, the perfect storm of all the things kind of going against us on a free cash flow basis. But we analyzed this quite a bit particularly recently, given that the number was a little bit below our benchmark. And we feel pretty confident that we will be within that range in relatively short order once we kind of get to a normalized state in terms of working capital, in particular related to the consumer business.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Perfect.

Muse - Evercore ISI","Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. I guess curious in terms of the macro demand picture and whether or not you're seeing any softness geographically?

Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Do you want to take the geographical question?","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, let me talk about the geo thing a little bit. So I think, overall, just to give you a little bit of color there, so Europe, I would say, not surprisingly the industrial sector's a little weak. Europe tends to take a pause. And I'd say the industrial sector in particular was maybe a little weaker than we had expected. So I think as well North America, industrial was also relatively weak, some sectors were better than others. And I think when you look at China and Asia-Pacific, automotive was quite soft, and it's well publicized that the communications infrastructure was weak, but at least the patterns have stabilized there.","David A. Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","And then in response to the 10% customer, we did have one customer for the quarter that was greater than 10%.","Ali Husain - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, C.J.

How close to full factory utilization are you in the October quarter? And with the consumer mix, has your view changed on managing factory utilization and internal inventory throughout the year? Is it possible to get \u2013 have a steadier utilization throughout a normal year?","David A. Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","We were in the mid-70%s for utilization this quarter. That was similar to where we were last quarter. I don't remember if I said it before, but we're probably going to take utilization down a little bit in the fourth quarter. All of the ramp in revenue for the fourth quarter at least from a front end perspective will come from foundries. So it won't affect utilization in any way on the front end.","Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC","Thanks.","David A. Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Now ideally, over time, we're working to get that utilization up, and it has been \u2013 I think if you look at it on a year-over-year basis, it has been steadily kind of moving up a little bit, and it has been helpful to gross margins. So that is our goal to make better use of our existing factories to drive gross margin expansion.","So next question.","Operator","This question comes from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.","James V. Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Congratulations on the terrific results. Kind of a philosophical question going forward. I wondered what your approach will be for folks who have won a lot of consumer business or ramped a lot of consumer business in particular with one big customer, over time, some of your analog peers, someone like a Linear. When that product comes up for invariable price declines or ASP declines, some analog companies have kind of walked away from that business, like Linear. Others like NXP have said, \"look, as long as we're maximizing gross profit dollars, we don't care if it hurts our gross margin a little bit.\" Obviously either approach is fine, both companies have been incredibly successful with those different approaches. But I wonder what your philosophy will be on that as we go forward?","David A. Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Well, our goal is \"we won this business, our goal is to keep it.\" And the good news is we think it's technology that has a lot of legs to it, that it's highly differentiated. And as a result, the customer values it and pays a premium for it. So our anticipation is that we will not lose it, nor will we have massive ASP erosion as a result. But that'll be borne out over time.","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, look, I think another aspect of the strategy here is that a lot of technology trends center around these types of consumer systems being able to see, being able to hear, being able to feel. And I think there's some great macro trends there that speak very well to the types of technology that we have, that sit at the intersection of the physical world and the world of the digital. So, and as the performance goes up, the space is getting tighter and tighter, battery-powered efficiency has got to become greater and greater. There's some really chunky problems to be solved there, and not just one type of problem, there's many, many different problems.","So we seek as we do across all our businesses, we look for diversity in each application in terms of the types of technology that we can apply, the number of products that we can develop. And so it's not a tale of one product, one customer, it's a tale of many, many different types of technologies across many, many different modalities there in terms of that intersection of the physical and digital worlds.","Ali Husain - Director-Investor Relations","Next question.","Operator","This question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel.","Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes, thanks for letting me ask a follow up here. Just coming back to the seasonality part of the business. So with consumer being about 30% in the next quarter, how should we think about not just the January quarter, but maybe even the April quarter? So you've had some seasonality in the past. I'm just trying to figure out how that's going to play out going forward.","David A. Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Well, Tore, you're asking me to whip out the crystal ball here, which, I don't know, might be on the fritz. I would say that sitting here today, with almost no backlog to really tell for certain how things are going to progress, that the first quarter, which is typically down mid-single-digits. Given that there's a more significant percentage is likely to be in the consumer space in the fourth quarter, and that that has normally a more dramatic seasonal decline in the first quarter, we're likely to be more than mid-single-digits down sequentially in the first quarter, but I'm not certain of that. And then in the second quarter, generally consumer seasonally is relatively flat first quarter to second quarter. But we have this lift in industrial, this tends to be our best quarter for industrial in the second quarter, and that gives us a good lift for the second quarter sequentially. And so that is how I would model it out right now having limited information as to how things kind of behave.","Ali Husain - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Tore.","Tore E. Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","That's very helpful. Thank you, Dave.","David A. Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks.","Ali Husain - Director-Investor Relations","Next question, please.","Operator","This question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a follow up. Dave, just real quickly, when you look at the October run-rate on the consumer side, does that now represent kind of your full opportunity on the mobile side, i.e., multiple platforms with a certain customer, or and hence from here, it's more of a unit story or there's actually potentially other platforms that you guys could penetrate within the consumer space?","David A. Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","I don't think I would suggest that the back half of the year we're going to have any specific additional platforms, but our goal over time is to expand in every end market in terms of opportunity. So, over time, I think, there is an opportunity to do that.","Ali Husain - Director-Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, John.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you.","Ali Husain - Director-Investor Relations","Next question, operator.","Operator","This question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for letting me ask a follow up. And sorry to beat this dead horse about macro and seasonality, but is there something that is company-specific, outside of consumer, that you think is helping you provide a more sort of stable\/seasonal outlook versus a more cautious outlook that we have heard from, say, a Linear Tech or Microchip or Texas Instruments.","David A. Zinsner - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Well, I do think that the industrial business for us is made up of these kind of broader market \u2013 end markets, and then these more ASSP oriented markets. I think it's safe to say that the broader markets were a bit weaker and that the ASSP or vertical markets did a little bit better. And I think somewhere in Vince's remarks he talked a lot about diversity. I think also Ali talked about it as well. I mean, that's the benefit of diversity is we're in so many different parts of the industrial space, both the broad market and very interesting verticals and some do better than others, depending on the quarter. But I think that really, if I had to, like, line our performance up in the third quarter relative to what I saw from some of the other players, I would say where we outperformed seemed to be in some of the specific verticals like aerospace and defense and energy and so forth.","Vincent T. Roche - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","As you know, we're on a sell-through basis across the globe as well, so the transparency that we have around demand and supply is very, very strong. So our sense is that there's a good balance between consumption and supply at this point in time. And we, as a company, measure only end customer bookings. So that's what we base our understanding of demand on. And so what we're reflecting to you is what we see.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Very helpful.","Ali Husain - Director-Investor Relations","All right, great. Well, looks like we have reached the 6:00 o'clock hour here. And we appreciate everybody dialing in.

Roche","Thanks, Ali, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. Before we talk about our operating results and the outlook for the coming quarter, it is true to say that a lot has happened since our last earnings call at the end of February. Many of you sent deep condolences upon learning of Jerry Fishman's sudden passing, and we thank you very much for those.","I worked beside Jerry for many years and while, of course, we all miss him greatly on a personal level, Dave and I, along with our senior management team, and the many talented employees of ADI, will continue to do great things together.","Our employees are engaged, our customers rely on us more and more as a preferred partner, and the market opportunities for us are vast. Our business priorities remain the same: leadership innovation in our core signal processing technologies; continuously assessing where we play, how we win and aligning our resources accordingly; and emphasizing strong profitability as a measure of the quality and sustainability of our innovation.","We believe that our operating performance, supplemented with cash dividends and share repurchases, will continue to drive strong returns for shareholders. As you've seen from our press release, our results for the second quarter were solid. So let's take a look at what actually happened in more detail.","Revenue totaled $659 million, up 6% from the previous quarter and down 2% from the same period a year ago. Diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.52, up 18% from previous quarter. Both results were at the midpoint of the guidance we have provided.","Our end markets, the revenue growth this quarter was led by Industrial and Automotive customers. Our industrial end markets, which are typically strong in the second quarter, grew 11% sequentially and made up 47% of our sales. The increase was broad-based across all regions and all major application areas within that segment, but was particularly strong in instrumentation and industrial automation applications.","A significant portion of our Industrial revenue is serviced through our distribution partners, and during the second quarter, order momentum through the channel was strong and higher than in the prior quarter. It appears that orders and shipments were in good equilibrium as the inventory in the channel remained low.","Now while we cannot predict with certainty regarding the short term, these order trends and low inventory levels are positive signs for our Industrial business. Longer term, we are driving innovation to higher levels to ensure that ADI increases our share of the industrial market.","Over the past few years, we have been focusing more of our investments toward industrial applications, where mechanical and electromechanical systems are increasingly integrating electronics to provide intelligent sensing and control, connectivity and energy efficiency, which are all themes that we believe will drive growth for this broad and diverse market over the long term.","In the automotive sector, revenue increased 14% sequentially and 3% year-over-year, reflecting strength in North America and China for the auto sector, and growth in worldwide luxury vehicle sales for ADI is especially well represented. This end market was 19% of our total revenue in the second quarter.","Sales increased sequentially across our focused applications in powertrain, infotainment and safety, with particular strength in active safety, advanced driver assistance systems. These systems are seeing accelerating adoption rate, not only in premium vehicles, but also in mainstream vehicles as these new safety features become standard equipment, whether due to consumer demand or indeed government mandate.","We also experienced strong growth from start-stop powertrain applications for internal combustion engines and also battery control for hybrid electric vehicles. These features improve fuel efficiency and reduce carbon emissions and are also driven by growing consumer demand and government mandates.","The automotive industry premium brands are the drivers of innovation, and these are the brands that have adopted our MEMS gyroscopes, accelerometers, converters, RF and other analog and DSP technologies. We continue to distinguish ADI as an innovation partner and a high-quality supplier with industry-leading reliability ratings. As electronic content in vehicles continues to grow, ADI is well positioned, as demonstrated by our results over the last 5 years with our automotive business growing at a 16% CAGR while vehicle unit growth averaged a 3% CAGR over that period.","In communications infrastructure, sales were down 2% after being down 12% in the prior quarter, and this business represented 19% of our total sales in the second quarter. Communications networks, both wireless and wired, are transitioning too, and these transitions present a strong long-term opportunity for ADI's broadband radio, optical and cable infrastructure technology.","In wireless infrastructure, the major transition everyone is watching is from 3G to 4G and TD-LTE. In wired infrastructure, new equipment with higher levels of throughput such as 40- and 100-gigabit optical and emerging standards, such as cable DOCSIS 3.1, will form the core Metro and EDGE networks in the future and create growth opportunities for ADI.","As our results in the last 2 quarters have shown, we are in the early stages of these transitions. For example, the transition to a new wireless standard happens in a couple of phases. Initially, carrier capital spending is focused on coverage more so than capacity, and subscribers upgrade their devices and their service agreements. But the need for increased capacity soon becomes clear as networks become overloaded, and carriers find it difficult to deliver significantly higher data rates and increased capacity with their existing equipment. Increase in capacity is highly dependent on high bandwidth, spectrum efficiency and network densification, where ADI's considerable wideband radio technology brings significant competitive advantages for our customers and in turn, for the carriers.","Now in wired applications, our focus is primarily the design challenge around signal integrity, as well as the data path, transmit and receive. Our interface clock and data recovery, and power management solutions, are used to control and monitor signal propagation in optical and cable infrastructure, which are being upgraded to support 40-gig-plus speeds.","And finally, the Consumer business was 15% of sales in the second quarter, which was down from 17% of sales in the prior quarter. We saw sequential growth in line with improving seasonality in the applications where ADI's technology has been well established over many generations, such as digital imaging and prosumer audio\/video applications.","Portable devices declined sequentially but were up significantly year-over-year, in line with customers' new product cycles. As we've mentioned before, there are many good opportunities ahead in portable devices and consumer audio and imaging for ADI. We continue to be highly selective in our engagements, focusing on applications where customers value our innovation, and pursuing engineering challenges where we can leverage our existing core technology and make a demonstrable difference to the user experience.","So with that, I'll turn you over to Dave who will now take you through some of the details of our financial results.","David A. Zinsner","Thanks, Vince, and good afternoon, everyone. As Vince mentioned, second quarter revenue increased 6% sequentially and declined 2% year-over-year to $659 million. Our gross margin was 64% in the second quarter. This was up from 62.7% in the first quarter due to higher factory utilization and lower manufacturing costs.","As has been the case now for several quarters, we again carefully managed production levels in our facilities. Utilization increased from the mid-50s in the first quarter to approximately 60% in the second quarter, while our inventory declined on our balance sheet by $8 million.","Inventory on our balance sheet on a dollars basis is now at its lowest level in 5 quarters. On a days basis, inventory was down from 121 days in the prior quarter to 115 days in the second quarter, in good position relative to our model. Our plan is to increase utilization in the third quarter to the low 60s. This should keep our days of inventory approximately flat to second quarter levels.","Inventories distribution on a dollars basis was approximately flat in the second quarter compared to the prior quarter, but inventories distribution on a days basis was lower than the prior quarter by about 0.5 week at 7.5 weeks.","Lead times for our direct OEM customers remained similar to last quarter and are in good control, with virtually all of our shipments to OEMs occurring within 4 weeks.","Total end customer orders, which include both OEM and distribution, increased in the second quarter compared to the first quarter, and our book-to-bill was slightly above 1. On a regional basis, orders improved across all regions, with particular strengths in North America and Europe. Overall, order patterns improved throughout the quarter.","Regarding operating expenses, we recorded approximately $6 million of additional expense in the second quarter related to the onetime accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation. Excluding this special item, operating expenses were $224.5 million compared to about $223 million in the prior quarter, which as a percent of revenue, is 170-basis-point improvement.","We continue to be very watchful of operating expenses and plan on reducing operating expense ratios by constraining expense growth to rates that are less than our sales growth rates in the coming quarters. Operating profits before tax for the second quarter, excluding this onetime expense, were $197.7 million or 30% of sales. This was about 300 basis points higher than the prior quarter's operating profit of 26.9% of sales, excluding a special charge in that quarter.","Other expenses of $3.7 million in the second quarter was flat to the first quarter and reflects the ongoing run rate of our net interest expense at current debt levels. Our second quarter tax rate was 16.5% excluding onetime items, and we expect our tax rate to be at that level for the next 2 quarters. Diluted earnings per share of $0.52, excluding special items, was at the midpoint of our guidance.","Cash flow in the second quarter continued to be very strong. We generated 38% of our revenue or $252 million in operating cash flow. CapEx was $26 million, resulting in free cash flow of $226 million or 34% of revenue.","Our cash and short-term investments balance increased about $185 million during the second quarter and now stands at $4.2 billion, with $1.2 billion available domestically. At the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $760 million in debt outstanding.","Our accounts receivable balance was up $4 million versus the last quarter on higher overall shipments in the quarter, and our days sales outstanding decreased to 46 days from 48 days. During the second quarter, we returned approximately $109 million or a 49% -- 48% of free cash flow to our shareholders, primarily through cash dividends.","On May 20, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.34 per outstanding share of common stock, which will be paid on June 11, 2013, to all shareholders of record at the close of business on May 31, 2013. At the current stock price, this dividend represents an annual yield of approximately 3%.","I'll just take a moment to talk about our long-term shareholder return strategy. Since 2004, we have paid a quarterly dividend and increased it 10x over that period. In addition, we have repurchased approximately 129 million shares, driving shareholder returns even higher. In total, over that period, we have returned over $6 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","So over the last 3 years, we have returned to shareholders an average of approximately 60% of our free cash flow. And what I'd like to say today is that over the next 5 years, we plan to increase that ratio to average approximately 80% through a program of both increasing dividends and disciplined buybacks. Of course, quarter-to-quarter, we'll be above or below this, but over the 5 years, this is our new target.","In summary, the second quarter delivered good results for ADI. Our operating model turned a 6% sequential increase in revenue into an 18% sequential increase in diluted EPS at relatively low levels of utilization. We have plenty of leverage ahead as sales increase, factory utilization improves from its current low levels, and we continue to tightly control operating expenses.","So now I'll turn the call back over to Vince who will discuss ADI's outlook for the third quarter.","Vincent T. Roche","Thanks, Dave. Our lead times continue to be short, which limits our visibility somewhat and, as you know, the world economy remains uncertain. In addition, the last month of our third fiscal quarter is the July month, which can sometimes be weaker due to summer shutdowns. Having said that, order momentum is positive, and if this positive momentum continues, we are likely to see sequential revenue growth in the third quarter, which could be, we believe, as much as 4%. However, if the macro economy weakens, we could be approximately flat.","Therefore, we're planning for revenue to be in the range of $655 million to $685 million. The midpoint of this range would be in line with the average third quarter growth rate we have seen over the last 5 years. By end market, we expect our Communications, Automotive and Consumer businesses to remain approximately flat to second quarter levels. We're planning for our Industrial business to grow sequentially, given low channel inventory and good end-customer order rates.","We are forecasting gross margins to increase approximately 50 basis points from the 64% we achieved in the second quarter. Though factory utilization is planned to be higher in the third quarter, it will still be quite low, yet if we achieve the midpoint of our revenue guidance, we will generate more than 90% gross margin drop-through on incremental sales.","Our plan is for operating expenses to be approximately $226 million, a slight increase from the prior quarter, primarily as a result of a full quarter with the annual salary increases that went into effect in April. Based on these estimates and excluding any onetime items, diluted earnings are planned to be in the range of $0.51 to $0.56 in the third quarter.","So in conclusion, we see momentum, order rates are solid and inventories are low. We are well positioned to expand margins as factory loading increases and expenses remain under tight control, and also to continue generating strong earnings leverage and strong free cash flow, which as Dave discussed earlier, we will use to further improve shareholder returns.","Ali Husain","Great. Thanks, Vince. [Operator Instructions] So with that, operator, we are now ready for questions from tonight's participants.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Guys, is there anything notable about linearity of orders in the quarter? And is there any different -- difference in segment relative to that linearity?","David A. Zinsner","Actually, I think I even mentioned in the prepared remarks. Actually, the orders strengthened through the quarter, so that was obviously a positive sign. Clearly, Industrial was stronger than the others, which is why in Vince's outlook, he suggested that, that one had the best likelihood of being up in the third quarter.","Vincent T. Roche","Yes. We've also seen a little momentum in the latter part of the quarter in the communications infrastructure segment. So coupled with the industrial area, they were the 2 sectors that produced most momentum through the quarter, particularly in the latter part, as Dave said.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Helpful. And then any turns assumptions differences relative to previous quarters or similar kind of turns being assumed to get to the midpoint of the guidance?","David A. Zinsner","Jim, it's -- I think I've mentioned probably every quarter since I've been here it's tough to use the turns calculation, in that backlog includes orders from the distributors on us, and the revenue isn't necessarily the same as it's shipped through to the end customer. But having said that, we're in a very short lead time environment. We've been in this lead time environment for many quarters now. I'd expect that the turns will be pretty similar to what they were in prior quarters.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terence Whalen with Citi.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wanted to drill into your capital return target a little bit more. Clearly, I think you said 80% is going to be the rate which you target going forward. Can you provide us just your sort of qualitative context for deciding between buyback and dividend yields? And in general, what's the appropriate dividend yields or free cash flow payout for ADI?","David A. Zinsner","Yes. We generally don't look at cash or -- yes, we generally don't drive the dividend based on yield. We drive dividend based on looking at our earnings and giving out a percentage of those earnings in the form of a dividend. It just so happens that it translates into this 3% yield, although we're mindful of it. It's certainly something that we pay attention to, but it isn't the major driver of how we drive the dividend. Our goal is dividend is our primary means of returning cash to shareholders. We want it to continue. We want it to grow as earnings grow. And we look at the buyback as more of our opportunistic opportunity to enhance the cash going back to shareholders, albeit at different intervals depending on the stock price relative to kind of historical levels. And then what was the second question, Terence? I missed that part.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So I wanted to just understand what the trade-off was in terms of you thinking about allocating toward dividend, but I think you may have answered that question. If I could actually ask a different follow-up question, Dave. As I look at the second half of the fiscal year and also looking at context of last year, we saw really Consumer accelerate quite a bit and really outgrow Industrial. I was just wondering, for purposes of considering gross margin, as we look at the second half of this year, should we, again, expect another acceleration in Consumer in the second half?","David A. Zinsner","Well, generally -- and Vince, feel free to chime in, but I think that we would normally expect, and we'll just have to kind of wait and see how it goes, that Consumer generally has a seasonally strong fourth quarter. And so there's, at this point, no reason to expect otherwise, although it's early and we don't have any bookings yet. What we're hoping is that also Industrial continues its momentum. Last year, there was a bit of a redirection on the Industrial business in the back half of the year as kind of overall economic sentiment started to deteriorate through the back half of the year. And so Industrial's mix kind of came down, but we're hopeful that this is the start of recovery and we don't see that. But again, it's early. We'll have to kind of be watchful of both. The good news is that the margins -- the gross margins if that's kind of the lead in to the question, does mix change? I don't think the mix changes too dramatically because all the margins in all our end markets are actually pretty good and pretty close to the corporate average. So regardless of what happens, I think we'll do a pretty good job of seeing gross margin leverage through the back half of the year, assuming conditions continue to be strong.","Vincent T. Roche","Yes, to add a little color to what David said. We're in the transition between 3G and 4G in wireless infrastructure, and as that gains pace, we're very well positioned as a company with good market share, a lot of good design coverage and extra bill of materials value in 4G compared to 3G. So as that starts to gather steam, which we hope is sometime in the second half of the year, albeit -- so far, the carriers have been fairly skittish. But somewhere, we believe, in the fourth quarter into the early part of the coming year, we do expect to see the carriers start to accelerate the buildout of their networks in terms of capacity rather than coverage. So I think that will help the margin structures and the growth overall for the company.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shawn Webster with Macquarie.","Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research","Hey, Dave, on the new -- the cash flow guidance on the 80% of your free cash flow, can you remind us what your normal domestic operating free cash flow is? And can you help us thread together how you get to an $0.80 -- 80% payout over time. Because I think, if I remember correctly, that your domestic cash flow is something around 1\/3, so just trying to get some clarity on that.","David A. Zinsner","It certainly can be -- it's a little bit lumpy so some quarters, it can be as much as 50%, some quarters, it could be lower than 30%. What we have is we have $1.2 billion or $1.1 billion of U.S. cash. We'll certainly utilize some of that cash to ramp up the cash flow to shareholders. And then on top of that, I would expect we would be able to add leverage, if necessary, to augment the cash we have and the cash flow we're getting from the U.S. entity to enable us to get to the 80% level. We've stress tested this level to make sure that under different scenarios, based on what happens from an economic perspective over the next 5 years, we would still be able to achieve the 80%. And we feel more than comfortable that we can get there.","Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research","And no change to your longer-term tax outlook in terms of incentive?","David A. Zinsner","No -- yes, this will not influence the tax story.","Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then just another final one. On the Automotive side, you had very good growth in Q2, it's flattening out in Q3. What are some of the signals you're seeing as we get into the back half of the year from the Automotive end market as it relates to how you think that's going to evolve for the back half?","Vincent T. Roche","Well, I think there's been brisk building of demand in the first and, particularly, the second quarter. We've seen a little tapering in demand from the automotive customers. And also when we get into the summer period, you very often get just the seasonal vacation cooldown. So overall, the long-term growth, we're very, very bullish about, we're very confident about. But in the third quarter, we're just a little cautious based on immediate demand pattern.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Aashish Rao with Bank of America.","Aashish Rao - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A question on communications. Sales, was disappointed in the April quarter, and you had a couple of quarters of year-on-year growth earlier. And it seemed to have turned the corner, but now it's down again year-on-year. So first, what caused the miss in April quarter? And second, I would have assumed that the shift in CapEx towards 4G and 3G would've helped offset some of the spending sluggishness. Just wondering why hasn't that been the case in your comps business for the last 2 to 3 years?","Vincent T. Roche","Well, I think we've had, over a 5-year period up to our fiscal '13 year, we had growth in our wireless business of around 9% compounded. And I think what we're seeing is a certain level of caution on the CapEx layout by the carriers, that's for sure. There's been a delay in the rollout of the next generation of the Chinese system, it's been delayed. Europe, in general, I think has been very slow. Our growth has been largely driven by American -- our OEMs who sell to American carriers. That's been quite strong, and America's been aggressive in building out the 4G network. But largely, again, as I mentioned in the script, really just building a coverage footprint rather than densifying the network or building a lot more capacity, which is going to happen. So we're still reliant very heavily on 3G, and I think what we expect to see is 3G will start ramping down over the next 12 months. We expect to see 4G ramp up, and at that point, I think we'll be very well positioned to take share, see growth and get back into the high single-digits, low double-digit compounded growth rates. I think it's more -- it certainly it is how the market is performing rather than our technology -- certainly from a technology standpoint. From a competitive advantage standpoint, we're in better shape than we've ever been. As you know, we've been steering a lot of R&D into building the underlying technologies in the products over the last 3 or 4 years, and we're starting to see the benefits in terms of design ins. And our engagements are stronger than they've ever been with the key OEMs. So it really is more about how the market performs than ADI.","Ali Husain","Aashish, do you have a follow-up question?","Aashish Rao - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes. The only one would be on Automotive. I think you highlighted North America and China being strong this quarter. And I think some of the European data points have been somewhat weaker. So just any color on what your current exposure is and how you see that changing over the next couple of years?","Vincent T. Roche","Well, we're strong in -- with all the major players, when it comes to safety, infotainment and powertrain applications, we have tremendous share in all those applications. So my sense is our business has been largely based on strength geographically in Europe and America over the last 5 or 7 years. We continue to gain share in these regions. But over the last couple of quarters, we've had some very good breakthroughs as well in Asia, in particular in Japan. So one of the things I think we mentioned, we've talked about it various times is that we've been very heavily focused on expanding our reach into Asia, and that's beginning to really pay dividends for the company. So again, I think it's more about how the market performs than ADI. We're in good position from customer penetration standpoint and the technologies we have are being adopted more and more into the applications that I've outlined here.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just want to follow up more on the guidance, Vince. It seems like your commentary was that the order book was relatively okay. You made some comments on the Auto order trends falling off. Just more broadly, was it just in Autos where you saw a little bit of weakness and kind of where are you adding the conservatism?","Vincent T. Roche","Well, we're expecting the third quarter, we're expecting momentum from the Industrial business. As I said, up to now, the order patterns have been strong in Industrial. That gives us a lot of encouragement. And as long as those order patterns continue, as I've said in the script, we believe that our revenues in infrastructure, Automotive and Consumer will be relatively flat in the third quarter. So I think I see Industrial order patterns continue. I would feel bullish about hitting the upper end of the range that we've presented to you today.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then I just wanted to better understand the comments in Consumer. It seemed like you mentioned you were trying to be selective, and that's understandable given that segment with the gross margin profile and such. I just wanted to understand that you also said that you expected a ramp in the back half. Is -- can you just talk about how you've approached business selection there? And you had a very strong ramp last year. When you say a ramp this year, are you talking similar magnitude?","David A. Zinsner","So I think, since I answered it, I guess I have -- should answer this one. I don't want to suggest that we think we have some massive ramp. I mean what we're just -- in the context of mix, normally, Consumer has a better fourth quarter, and that's all that I was suggesting. We're not going to get into guidance, really, for the fourth quarter because that's what we do in the third quarter.","Vincent T. Roche","Yes, so when we talk about. We have we -- I might have explained before, our Consumer business has a few different components to it. We have a very horizontal or a very diverse business in areas like broadcast and prosumer, as we call it, audio\/video imaging applications, with a more kind of catalog","type products that are very diversely used across all the major regions of the world with companies who build broadcast equipment, professional equipment for enterprises and so on. That's a good foundation business for ADI. When we talk about picking our spots carefully, we are really referring to the portable areas, all types of equipment, be they tablets or smartphones. We still have a business in the digital camera space. When we talk about being careful, we try to define the end application very carefully from a user standpoint to be able -- and we try to describe that application over multiple generations, so that we can be sure from an application standpoint that we're really delivering value that consumers ultimately will be excited about. So we -- also, when you play in the consumer space, the -- obviously, the life cycles are very, very short. You've got to be able to play through multiple generations. And for each application that we play in, typically, we have to have a couple of concurrent design themes in play to be able to get the generation sequentially synching, so that we exit from one generation but we have the next generation ready to play straightaway. So it's -- sure, it's an expensive place to play from an R&D standpoint, but the returns are great when you pick the applications carefully and get with the right customers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of William Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","It relates to gross profit margin and the contribution margin on the gross line going forward. Can you remind us of the manufacturing strategy in terms of which end markets are more heavily outsourced versus made internally, so where we could think about getting operating leverage on the gross line?","David A. Zinsner","Yes. I mean, there's products manufactured internally that target all end markets, but I would say there's a bias, a slight bias, towards the Industrial end market. So as the Industrial grows, that does utilize the internal facilities a bit more.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","That's great. And then one that I think you answered at least partly before but I'd like to just dig into it again. It sounds like you're telling us that while Automotive was very strong, the order pattern fell off at the end of the quarter. And we've also heard of some less robust end market data points, and notwithstanding the content growth story that we all understand is going on in semis, I think there's some concern that there's been a lot of strength, in particular in the most recent quarter, that you set yourselves and others have demonstrated in this end market. But the OE demand doesn't look as robust. Can you help us understand whether there might be an inventory build going on in that market?","Vincent T. Roche","I think the way to look at that market, Europe has been very, very muted from a car sales standpoint, although there are indications that I've seen over the last few weeks that new car registrations in some of the European countries are starting to pick up again. So I think it's more about how the geographies are playing out rather than anything underlying in the consumption patterns, demand and consumption patterns. So my sense is that certainly from our standpoint, I think the inventories are quite lean in that area, the automotive area. And it really is more about how the market is behaving at the geographic level than anything else.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of the Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee.","Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just on the same Automotive line, I was wondering -- I mean, Europe is, obviously, a big portion for you, 40%. It's been a little slow in the first half. Do you see it picking up in the second half? And also in China, there's been some concern about tariffs coming back on China because -- is that how you see? I guess, some more color on both those regions.","David A. Zinsner","So the first question is whether you see European car sales coming back. And I think you've answered that, which is that is an area where we released our early read from external sources and that registrations appear to be growing in that space so there is some reason to be positive. Having said that, I mean, the European car manufacturers end up selling all over the world. And there's some big consumption in other markets for some of the premium brands that are manufactured in Europe. So we're not necessarily at the mercy of the economy over in Europe. So that's, I think, one significant point. The other question was -- what was the question?","Ali Husain","It was tariffs and...","David A. Zinsner","Tariffs, yes. I mean, I'll -- Vince can answer that if he wants to, but I don't think we have enough clarity. We're not selling cars. So I'm not sure we have enough visibility into what's going on with the Chinese government and how they're going to manage internal versus external manufacturing of autos. Did you have a follow-up question, Vijay?","Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Yes, sure, sure. In Industrial, what were the key markets there for you? And what signs are you seeing that gives you optimism on the second half on Industrial?","Vincent T. Roche","Well, the strongest 2 sectors -- I mean, we grew everywhere. All of the sub-applications in Industrial grew for ADI. The strongest were instrumentation, as well as industrial automation, things like factory automation, process control. They are our 2 biggest subsectors in Industrial, and both of them grew very, very well during the quarter. So typically anywhere in the second quarter, we see good -- very good seasonality in the industrial area. But -- and as we said, the order patterns that we're seeing in the industrial area at large, big customers, small customers, all regions are performing quite well today. So based on that, based on what we hear from our customers, we believe inventories are very, very lean, by the way, and that there's a good match between supply and demand in that area. So turns rates are quite high at the present time as well. Our distributors have also told us the same thing, at least our 2 major distributors, so the -- and there are good macro trends in place as well that we've discussed from time to time around safety, connectivity, efficiency, productivity that make this a very -- a more and more attractive space for ADI, given our breadth of technology and given our reach across the globe with large and small customers. So I think at the present time, what we're seeing is primarily a seasonality effect, but demand continues, at least in the short term, briskly in the industrial area.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sumit Dhanda with ISI.","Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","First question on the wireless infrastructure piece. Vince, you noted it strengthened at the end of the quarter but you're guiding the quarter flat in that segment into July. I'm just curious as to how we reconcile sort of the momentum at the end of the quarter versus the flat guide? And your comment on the delay with respect to the transition in China, is that a new comment or is that still implying that we should start to see some kind of a ramp in the...","Vincent T. Roche","Yes, well -- first off, the delay, our business is -- the largest part of our business in wireless communications infrastructure is still 3G, it's about 70% of our total. So the transition to 4G creates a new opportunity for ADI, and that's just taking a bit longer than we all had anticipated. So it's also a bit of a lumpy business. It's very hard to read. At the end of the day, our customers' customers, they're the carriers, are -- I think there's no great momentum, there's no great pattern in their spending at the present time. So it's just very hard to read. So that's why we're being cautious.","Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, my -- as my follow-up question for...check that [ph]. As a follow-up question, Industrial has done well. It was up double digits last quarter, implied in the outlook as something like 4%, 5% sequential growth, given that it's half the business, and the other businesses are flat sequentially, which brings it sort of back to the peak run rate you had in the Industrial business last year. So I guess, my question is do you feel, at this point as you exit the July quarter, you'd be caught up with consumption, understanding that this is hard to ascertain with finality but what's your best sense?","David A. Zinsner","I'll take this one. I think it's obviously very difficult to read 60,000 customers to know for sure what their inventory levels are. Having said that, we do seem to be, at least as you look at distributors running at levels that are pretty consistent with their end demand. My best guess is that we are somewhere around where end demand or end consumption is. But I think what really is driving this kind of similar levels to last year is more around just kind of a lot of economic uncertainty that continues to overhang the market. So hopefully, as the year progresses, there is more confidence around the economy globally, and things continue to improve throughout the year. But at this point, it's hard to say. I mean, I think we're at least hopeful, given that the outlook at the moment is that Industrial will be up, as you said, reasonably well. That we're on the course of a recovery. But again, we're just going to have to wait and see how it goes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie with Raymond James.","Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Vince, with regard to the products, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about converters from the perspective of the fact that it looks like that's up 1% year-over-year. I guess, probably the best-performing category, and I think that's -- the growth there is better than overall company revenue growth. So obviously, you guys continue to do well in that category. Can you talk a little bit about strategy there? How do you go to market versus, I don't want to say specifically TI, but obviously they're a big player in that space than the other guys. How do you continue to sort of dominate the market?","Vincent T. Roche","Yes, it's a good question. So converters for ADI are pervasive in every application in which we play. Every one of those segments that we've talked about today use converters, either high-speed or precision. We -- when we think about allocating our R&D, we think first and foremost, that the underlying core technologies and products and make, we insist on making sure that we have adequate coverage in terms of R&D to be able to develop the underlying technologies and products. The converter space is an area where we have the broadest portfolio. If you look at any federal [ph] converter, any particular performance dimension of converters in precision, in high speed, we cover the entire thing. We have teams working on new generations of technology that we haven't even introduced to the market yet, so we are pushing innovation in the core products that are critical to ADI's prosperity in the short term. We're also pushing very, very long term new architectures, new process technologies and combining converters also in many new ways in new applications. So the -- in the infrastructure space, for example, in communication, the wireless part of communications infrastructure, our converters form the heart of these wideband radio transceivers that we developed that have a lot of RF technology onboard. That are more and more linking up with the power management solutions that we have, linking up with the clocking solutions that we have. So it's a vast portfolio of standard products, products that are more highly integrated with converters at their core. And as I said, we, first and foremost, make sure that our core technologies are getting adequate investment to ensure that ADI keeps leadership position and keep -- we keep gaining share. We have been gaining, by the way, over the past number of years, just about 1% market share per year versus the competition on a compounded basis. So 1 point per year. So we're in good position, we've lots of new applications. For example, I would like to point out that in the automotive area, when you look at -- we talk about battery technology and intelligent battery systems. Again, that's a great example of where our converters, our precision converters, are being used in new ways and new applications in a critical application in the car. So there are many, many new areas where we play. And then if you look at the industrial area, we have -- perhaps, we've thousands of products that are selling thousands of converter products with very, very long life cycles. So we have a tremendous mix in terms of the market that we cover, the types of technology that we're developing and the types of customers to whom we sell.","Ali Husain","I think these are called converters with attitude right, Vince? Steve, do you have a follow-up question?","Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes, sure. Dave, with regard to the 80%, how do you decide 80% is the right number versus some other? And if you were to, say, use some cash to pay down debt, is that in that 80% or is that something different?","David A. Zinsner","So first of all, just to clarify the 80% number, make sure that's crystal clear, that's 80% of total free cash flow, not 80% of domestic cash flow. Hopefully, that was clear. But how do we come up with it? We ran -- it's like I said, we ran some scenarios around business conditions. We added in some other potential uses of cash on top of that, which in some cases does include the financing side. And what it told us was, given our capital structure and our rating, we could easily manage 80%. I think we're very comfortable with the debt level we have. And so there's no reason when instruments mature that we need to pay them off. We can kind of refinance them assuming rates are attractive, which they clearly are today. We could -- we even feel comfortable going up in debt from where we are today. So we kind of balance all those things together and kind of -- and given Vince's -- one of his stated priorities is to deliver good shareholder return, we thought that this was a pretty reasonable number that we thought investors would appreciate.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just one more question on the increased payout ratio. And by the way, I think I speak for the entire buy side when I say kudos for upping it from 60% to 80%. Just a question on the buyback. Your share count has crept up, I think, over the last 4 quarters. Can you just remind us of what's been allocated for the buyback? Has that increased? And is your methodology for buying back shares going to change at all?","David A. Zinsner","So we have, I think, roughly $500 million plus, maybe it was $540 million or something like that. Ali, do you know the number off hand?","Ali Husain","560","David A. Zinsner","$560 million of authorized -- our authorization on the current buyback, although it's pretty simple to get that increase to support the 80%. I think it will need to be increased, candidly, to get to the 80%. But let's see how earnings go, we don't -- the dividend, how that ramps, too, because that certainly an area that we want to increase over time as well. What was the other part of the question, Chris?","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, Dave, I think we've talked about this before. One of the -- I guess one of the good problems that you have as your stock has steadily climbed up, you haven't really...","David A. Zinsner","Yes, yes. Yes, so that has been the case. I think in my prepared comments, I used the word disciplined repurchases or something of that nature. And that's kind of the way we're going to approach it. So it's not going to be 80% every quarter. In some quarters, it's going to be higher than 80%. Some quarters, it's going to be lower than 80%. But over the 5 years, it will average 80%. But we still intend to be pretty disciplined around the buybacks. And hopefully, buy back when the stock is at least on a historical basis at relatively low levels. So I wouldn't look for us to come right out of the gate and start turning a buyback. But I think over time, you'll see us be pretty good disciplined buyers of the stock, with the idea that we don't want to see that share count creep in general.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley.","Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I remember last quarter, you had talked about distribution inventories being extremely low in dollar terms at a multi-quarter low, and so I was a little surprised that they stayed flat. And just can you talk about that dynamic? And then I feel like the end customer inventories that you've been describing is low. We've all felt that way for several quarters. What do you think it's going to take to change that?","David A. Zinsner","So I think a much more robust demand picture will certainly get distributor -- and a lead time stretch-out will certainly get distributors to begin to stock. We generally keep our lead times tight so we won't be the driver of it, but some of our peers sometimes allow their lead times to extend. And during those periods, distributors generally across-the-board raise their inventory levels. But it's 7.5 weeks. It's a pretty good -- it's certainly at a low level but they've certainly been below that. So it's what I think is a healthy level in a period of recovery.","Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just on the industrial customer side, on their inventory, I mean, as I said, you've described it as low for, I think, 4 or 5 quarters and I felt the same way. Do you think it's isolated at all in retrospect? As you look back, there's build up in the first part last year then come down or has it been generally lean throughout?","David A. Zinsner","I think in the second quarter, based on hindsight, they probably did start to build inventory, and then over the third and fourth quarter, potentially even the first quarter, started to bring it back down.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. Just a question, a follow-up, Vince, to something you said earlier about the comms business. With 70% of that being 3G-oriented, what sort of substitution effect do you guys see because to be frank, we've been waiting for quite some time for you guys and many other companies that have promised a big infrastructure spend increase. And it seems to me there's a risk that the 3G comes down as the 4G goes up and the total really doesn't move as fast as people have hoped. Can you walk us through the transition and the puts and takes to ADI, please?","Vincent T. Roche","Yes, I think what we see between the generations is more sophisticated solutions being required from ADI. We get more content. I believe, in 3G systems, we're seeing an average ASP increase for a radio transceiver of somewhere in the region of 20% to 30% depending on exactly who we're selling to and what the feature set is. So I think that chunk of what we expect is primarily due to the ASP increases. We also have -- we've mentioned before that we've greatly increased our R&D in the wireless sector in the past 4 or 5 years to make sure that we can extend our reach, our competitive advantage, in each of the critical macro applications. So I think it's more about -- for ADI anyway, we're very well positioned with our customers, we have stronger solutions than we've ever had, so we're just depending, Ross, on the markets more so than anything else at this point. But everything we hear from the carrier discussions we've had, from our customers, somewhere in the region of -- just to be able to meet the data capacity needs that mobile subscribers are requiring now all across the globe. It's going to require a revamping, an aggressive revamping of the network towards 4G towards the back end of this year and into next year.","Ali Husain","Ross, did you have a follow-up?","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. Just really quickly, a couple of housekeeping ones, and I apologize if I missed this earlier. Dave, your expectations for utilization and internal inventory as you go into the third quarter?","David A. Zinsner","Yes, I think we'll be kind of low 60s in utilization next quarter. Inventory levels on an absolute dollar basis may be kind of flattish, but they should come down in days.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura Securities.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I think most of us recognize ADI's high-quality franchising. You guys are tied to some pretty attractive markets. But when I look at the growth, at least on a year-over-year basis, it's been -- this quarter and the July quarter will be the eighth consecutive quarter that revenue is down year-over-year. And my question is would you guys just chalk that up to a tough end market environment or, Vince, in your new role, are you looking at perhaps some different strategies to improve top line growth?","Vincent T. Roche","It's a very good question. I think what we're seeing at the present time is really just no real momentum but it's driven by just the macroeconomic everywhere, I mean, across the globe. Even China has not been immune to the macroeconomic malaise in the past year, year plus. We, as a company, we're an innovation-centered company with -- where engineering excellence really, really matters to us, where we have a lot of very, very -- people who care passionately about our customers. So we're going to do everything we can to extend our -- the impact and the speed of our innovation, and just to execute better everywhere to speed everything up in the company and just improve ADI in every dimension of innovation. So I believe that the franchise we have is one of the very, very best in the semiconductor world. And myself with the 9,000 employees are going to make it an even better franchise in the future. So we're working on a lot of things internally to make everything better.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A couple of questions just quick. David, I'm a little confused by the opening comments. Utilization is going to be up or down in the July quarter, and ditto on OpEx. It just sounds like you guys are still keeping things pretty tight. And I guess, my question is if things were to pick up or does the lack of utilization growth or OpEx growth in July quarter give us a poker tell into how you guys are viewing the October quarter?","David A. Zinsner","Well, utilization is going to be up next quarter. And I think it was like around 60%, I think it's going to be in the low 60s, consistent with our expectations around the Industrial business for the most part. I wouldn't read too much into our OpEx for next quarter as some indication of the next few quarters. What we're trying to do is really lag the revenue side a little bit because leverage is pretty important to us. And quite honestly, we think we're spending enough money to drive revenue growth. So we're going to just be careful about where we add, make sure we're adding it in the right places that we think will drive good ROI.","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then quickly, David or Vincent, can you guys give us a little bit of insight on what big buckets or sub-buckets there are within the Consumer? Is this mostly handset or how do I think about kind of the sub-buckets within that category?","David A. Zinsner","Okay. We'll answer this one, but we got to like, we've got to stop the follow-ons because we're going to run out of time here. But there's about 4 or 5 subcategories, portable is one of them. It's one of our areas that we think will drive growth but it's by no means a dominant part of that business. We have a digital camera subcategory in there. We have a home entertainment system, which includes, I think, prosumer, which Maria tells me is a real word. There is some computer exposure in that space and then we have a bunch of smaller subcategories that get the \"all other\" kind of classification. So it's a pretty -- from a consumer perspective, it's a pretty diverse set of end customers and applications.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I have 2 quick ones on the cash return again. You talked about over the next 5 years getting up to 80%. How long does it actually take to ramp to that point? Is this something where we should really expect a step change or is this something that builds in? Second question just really quickly to save time, you talked about -- sounds like mostly dividends and opportunistic buybacks, but over the last few years, it's been primarily dividends. It sounds like you're going to focus on that still. So does the increase in the cash return of what you're talking about really imply a very significant increase in dividends. Is that really how we should be thinking about this in terms of what's driving the cash return?","David A. Zinsner","Yes, so I wouldn't look at 80% as we're going to try to ramp up to 80%. We're going to try to average 80% over a 5-year period. Some quarters that's going to mean it's going to be plus 80%, some quarters, it might be below 80%. But the average is supposed to be 80%. I don't think next quarter it will be 80%, although we're going to have to see. We haven't changed the approach we have towards buybacks. The buyback aspect of this thing is that we will buy when the historical price is above the current price by some measure. And that's what will trigger the buyback. It's somewhat -- it's to some extent on autopilot, I guess, and we'll just execute when and if those situations occur. My guess is they will occur and that will be a reasonable amount of the 80% free cash flow return. But it's true that the primary means of returning cash to shareholders is going to be dividends. Having said that, I wouldn't expect the dividend per se to ramp dramatically at a rate that's dramatically faster than earnings growth rates. It will, in all likelihood, be at a faster rate than earnings growth, but I don't think it's going to be too dramatic. And that's because we have an expectation that we will buy back stock. And that will be a part of the cash return and it will be a meaningful part of the cash return.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Got it. But that would...","David A. Zinsner","We lost him.","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Eliscu with UBS.","Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","You referred the low end of sales guidance being based on the possibility of macro weakening. Are you actually seeing any signs that there could be weakening as we go into the middle of the year? Or is this caveat just based on what we've seen in the last couple of years?","David A. Zinsner","This is strictly just caution around the just kind of macro side of things. And we have seen no evidence to suggest that. Clearly, we are modestly -- I guess, slightly influenced by what happened last year. Steve, do you want to squeeze that one in?","Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, as my follow-up question, I -- if I look at your -- there is a prior reference to converters, but if I look at amplifiers, I -- actually if you look at the year-on-year trend, they actually weakened last quarter. Is there anything fundamental that's driving the weakness? Is it tied to a particular segment such as communications? Can you help us understand that?","Vincent T. Roche","Well, let me -- it's very, very hard to ascribe the shift in a quarter to any one particular segment or any particular application area. I think overall as a company, we have strong share and we play in the high-performance amplifier area. And I think you have to really look at our share over a long period of time. And just like in converters, these 2 areas form the core. These are ADI's backbone and we've actually been gaining share in the high-performance amplifier space over the last while. So I think looking at these numbers quarter-on-quarter-on-quarter, don't tell you anything because we have been gaining share.","David A. Zinsner","Yes, the other thing is that in some cases, this stuff is all integrating together and then we have to lump it in into something called other. It becomes an other category and so...","Vincent T. Roche","An identification issue.","David A. Zinsner","Yes, so a lot of times the functionality that was a standalone amplifier is not a standalone product anymore and so we kind of classify it in other.","Ali Husain","Great. Well, we're running out of time and well past the 6 o'clock hour. But, Vince, do you want to come back and do your closing remarks before we sign off here?","Vincent T. Roche","Sure. Well, firstly, I'd like to thank everybody for participating with us today here. So far we've discussed our results and our trends related to the industry, our markets and our shareholders. So in closing, I want to share with you what I've been discussing with our employees since I took over as President several months ago and what I continue to tell our employees as the CEO of the company. My primary focus is to accelerate ADI's growth. This world will emerge from the economic malaise that has dominated for the past 5 years or so, and when it does, my job and the job of other employees is to make sure that ADI emerges stronger and better. Our strength will be evidenced in the growth rate of our sales and the expansion of our operating profits, which generates earnings leverage and strong cash flow. The domain of signal processing, in which we lead, present an excellent growth opportunity in the years ahead as the world drives for more automation, greener energy, affordable health care, more connectivity and mobility. All of these trends face complex technical challenges, and we have a culture here at ADI that thrives on finding innovative ways to solve very complex problems for our customers. Many competitors also see these opportunities, but none of them have the breadth and depth of our signal processing engineering expertise and our customers also recognize us for this fact. We will focus on solving not only the complex problems, but also the critical problems. And this means we must continuously assess how we allocate our R&D and actively steer investments toward areas where innovation creates the greatest momentum for ADI. More and more, I feel employees deepening their customer engagements, bringing the outside world into the company and defining and solving the critical problems before our competitors do. I firmly believe that engineering excellence, coupled with deep customer market insights, drive superior innovation and superior innovation drives superior results. So I, along with our 9,000 employees will settle for nothing less. So with that, I'd like to thank you, and wish you a good evening.","Ali Husain","Great. Thanks a lot, Vince, and thanks, everyone, for joining us tonight. Just a reminder that our Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Call is scheduled for August 20, 2013, beginning at 5 p.m. Eastern Time. So thanks, everyone, for joining us tonight. Good night and have a pleasant evening. Bye.","Operator","This concludes today's Analog Devices conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Analog Devices Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Ms. Tagliaferro, you may begin.","Maria Tagliaferro","Thank you, Natalie, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Maria Tagliaferro, Director of Communications for Analog Devices, and we appreciate you joining us for today's call. If you haven't yet seen our second quarter fiscal year 2012 press release or Form 10-Q, you may access both by visiting our website at investor.analog.com.

Subsequent events and development may cause our outlook to change. Therefore, this conference call will include time-sensitive information that may be accurate only as of the date of this live broadcast, which is May 22, 2012.","With that, I'll turn the call over to ADI's CEO, Jerry Fishman, for opening remarks.","Jerald G. Fishman","Well, thanks, Maria, and good afternoon to everybody on the call. Our revenues in our second quarter totaled approximately $675 million, which was up slightly more than 4% sequentially, but down about 15% compared to the year-ago quarter. You might remember the year-ago quarter when ADI revenue peaked, as customers built inventory to reduce the risk of supply disruptions that were widely feared after the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami.","The industrial end markets, which are typically seasonally strong for ADI in the second quarter turned even better performance than we had planned and grew about 12% sequential. All of the major application areas within industrial grew sequentially, and it was led by over 20% sequential growth in both instrumentation and in energy.","Health care and industrial automation, which includes process control, as well as defense, aerospace and security, also grew sequentially in the second quarter.","In general, indications in the industrial market are that customers have stopped depleting inventory and our current orders more closely matched consumption levels, certainly much more closely than had been the case over the last few quarters.","In the industrial market, ADI is well recognized as the best brand amongst the wide range of industrial applications, and many of these applications we now believe have the potential for above market growth rates in the future.","Revenues also increased sequentially from communications infrastructure customers, as both wired and wireless applications grew about 3% sequentially. Communications order rates began very slowly in the early parts of Q2, but improved significantly toward the end of the quarter.","For the past few quarters, operators have worked to increase capacity at minimal cost by implementing software upgrades rather than hardware upgrades. But to date, networks in many regions of the world are very much overloaded, and operators find it difficult to respond to significantly higher bandwidth requirements from applications, such as streaming video by using existing equipment. As a result of new equipment upgrade cycles, ADI's leading technology portfolio and very strong customer relationships with the largest market shareholders in the infrastructure market, we expect our sales into communications applications to grow throughout the second half of our fiscal year and also into 2013.","Automotive revenues were down very slightly in the second quarter, but increased 10% year-over-year as a result of strong worldwide vehicle unit growth, increasing electronic content and increasing ADI content in cars. ADI, as you know, is very well-positioned in the major systems in the wide range of automobiles, and we expect the automotive market to continue to offer very strong growth prospects for ADI going forward, as it has over the past 3 to 5 years.","Revenues from consumer customers declined 8% sequentially, in line with the seasonally weak second quarter time period for consumer products. However, even in the consumer market, orders from consumer customers picked up late in the second quarter, and we now expect our consumer business will grow sequentially in the third quarter and again in the fourth quarter as a result of better underlying demand and I think very importantly, a very strong ADI design-in activity at the top of consumer brands.","On a regional basis, all regions except North America experienced sequential increase in both revenue and also in end customer bookings. On a worldwide basis, end customer bookings increased 8% sequentially, and the book-to-bill for the quarter was above 1.","Our best sense at this point is that the order expansion that we are experiencing is a result of a combination of the end of customer destocking, a incrementally better outlook at many of our customers and also our distributors and also what we believe is the beginning of what will be a very strong new product cycle at ADI.","In aggregate, ADI's second quarter performance was strong on virtually every measure. We met or exceeded our plan for growth and profits for the quarter, and we are continuing to deliver exceptional cash flow.","So Dave will now take you through some of the details of our financial results, and after Dave's done, I'll come back and talk a little bit about the outlook going forward.","David A. Zinsner","Thanks, Jerry. As Jerry mentioned, second quarter revenue increased 4.2% sequentially and declined 14.6% year-over-year to $675.1 million. Our gross margin was 65.2% in the second quarter. This was up 200 basis points from the 63.2% we reported in the first quarter, driven by a favorable mix of high-margin industrial and communications infrastructure products and increased factory utilization.","Second quarter gross margin represented a drop-through of approximately 115% on the incremental sales.","Lead times for our direct OEM customers remained similar to last quarter and are in good control, with virtually all of our shipments to OEMs occurring within 4 weeks. With these very short lead times from ADI, we are experiencing a very high proportion of orders for delivery in the quarter as our customers understand that our products are readily available rather than customers building long-term backlog to ensure supply.","Operating expenses for the second quarter were $227.5 million compared to about $226 million in the prior quarter. The slight dollar increase was primarily due to an increase in variable compensation and to a lesser degree, annual salary increases that went into effect in April. Operating expenses declined sequentially as a percent of revenue by 120 basis points.","And headcount in the second quarter remained essentially flat to the previous quarter's level.","Operating profits before tax for the second quarter were $212.9 million or 31.5% of sales. This was 320 basis points higher than the prior quarter's operating profits of 28.3% of sales. Operating profits increased as a result of the higher revenue and increased factory utilization in the second quarter.","Other expense was $1.5 million in the second quarter compared to $3.3 million in the first quarter. Our ongoing run rate for net interest expense should be approximately $3 million.","Our tax rate for the second quarter was 23%, in line with the prior quarter's 22.6% but higher than our prior expectations. The higher rate was primarily due to a shift in income to higher tax jurisdictions. We expect our effective tax rate in the third and fourth quarter to be approximately 22.5%.","Diluted earnings per share of $0.53 in the second quarter was at the high end of our guidance as a result of our strong growth from these high-margin products.","Cash flow in the second quarter continued to be strong. We generated 33.5% of our revenue or $226 million in operating cash flow.  Capital expenditures were $30 million, resulting in free cash flow of $196 million or 29% of revenue for the quarter.","Our accounts receivable balance increased from the prior quarter by $28 million due to higher sales. However, our days sales outstanding decreased to 45 days from the prior quarter's 46 days.","We continue to carefully manage inventory, both at ADI and our distribution partners to keep our total inventory well positioned to respond quickly to customers. In the second quarter, inventory at ADI increased by a modest 2% compared to the prior quarter.","On the days of inventory basis, ADI inventory decreased to 118 days from 122 days in the prior quarter. While a bit above our inventory model of a 100 to 110 days, we believe this makes sense given inventory in the channel is still low compared to historical levels, and there was a wide range of possible demand levels for the next few quarters.","We remain committed to maintaining very short lead times to avoid double ordering and to provide best-in-class service levels to our customers.","During the second quarter, we repurchased $44 million of our stock. We also distributed approximately $89 million or 55% of net income in dividends to our stockholders. Our cash and short-term investment balance at the end of the second quarter was approximately $3.8 billion, of which approximately $1.1 billion is available domestically. At the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $863 million in debt outstanding.","On May 21, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per outstanding share of common stock, which will be paid on June 12, 2012, to all shareholders of record at the close of business on June 1. At the current stock prices, this dividend represents an annual yield of approximately 3.3%.","In summary, second quarter delivered solid results. Our operating model turned a 4% sequential increase in revenue into a 15% sequential increase in diluted EPS. At gross margins of 65.2% and operating margins of 31.5%, we still have leverage ahead, as sales increase, factory utilization improves and we continue to prudently manage the growth in operating expenses well below our sales growth rate.","And now I'll turn the call back over Jerry to discuss ADI's outlook for next quarter.","Jerald G. Fishman","Thanks, Dave. For the third quarter of 2012, we're planning for our revenues to grow sequentially in the range of 1% to 4%. We're planning for the industrial market to grow sequentially again in Q3, although certainly at a slower rate compared to the very significant sequential rise in Q2, as we enter the seasonally weaker second half of the year for industrial products.","As I mentioned earlier, orders from communications infrastructure customers picked up momentum in the latter part of the second quarter. And as a result, our third quarter plan for communications infrastructure is for sales also to grow sequentially.","We expect automotive revenues to be about flat sequentially in Q3 and revenues from consumer applications to grow sequentially as a result of seasonality and also what we expect to be a very strong new product cycle for our consumer products.","We're planning for gross margins to increase approximately 50 basis points from the 65.2% we achieved in Q2, which if we achieve the midpoint of our revenue guidance, we'll generate more than 80% in drop-through on incremental sales.","We anticipate operating expenses of approximately $231 million, a slight increase primarily as a result of a full quarter with the annual salary increases that went into effect in April and variable compensation increasing as margins continue to improve. Based on those estimates and excluding any onetime items, diluted earnings are planned to be in the range of $0.54 to $0.58 in the third quarter.","So in closing, while the data we have points to 3Q being another solid quarter for ADI, we continue to be mindful of the global macro-environment that we are operating in. We're very focused on providing our customers with the very best technical support and the most responsive supply chain.","Internally, of course, we're focusing on the things that we can control, bringing breakthrough products to the market, looking for continuing efficiency gains wherever we spend money and wherever we apply resource and engaging every employee at Analog in the fight to get higher sales and higher margins.","Maria Tagliaferro","Thank you. Thank you, Jerry. Thank you, Dave. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we're now ready for questions from our analyst participants.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]  And the first question comes from the line of Doug Freedman from RBC Capital Markets.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","If I could, I guess, I'll start with just the revenue line. It does appear to be a little light of where we might think business might be if we were in sort of a normal semiconductor, if there is such a thing, recovery cycle. Can you comment on how you think the macro-environment is impacting your customer base and maybe if you guys have taken any actions of your own as a result of the nervousness out in the marketplace?","Jerald G. Fishman","Well, I think, Doug, the only thing that we could do is be suitably cautious given all the sort of macroeconomic issues out there. I think it's at the margin that makes our customers worry a little bit more than they would if everything was going well in every geography. But no, I still sense that most of our customers are looking out there and saying things are pretty good and that they're expecting to get growth. Typically, our third quarter seasonality is all over the map. There were some third quarters we actually grow 5% or 6% to 7%; other ones, we contract 4% to 6%, other ones are right in the middle. In fact, if you look at the average for the last 3 years, each one of which was a unique year. The average of those last 3 years was about 2% third quarter. So I think what we're trying to do is listen to all the positive vibes we're getting from the customers and make sure we have capacity in response to that. But yet internally, manage the company to try to keep as much flexibility as we can in case the macroeconomic situation gets worse. Now, Vince, you have some other -- you've been out there talking to -- particularly the industrial investor.","Vincent T. Roche","Yes. If you look at the geographic context on this thing, I would say from a number of conversations I've had with our large distributors, as well as our customers, particularly in the industrial sector, I'd say there's a general sense that Europe still has to work through the crisis. People have been very, very careful in terms of laying out cash, particularly for CapEx-oriented equipment. I think the inventories are going to be very, very lean. But I think we're at a point now as well where the inventories at our customers have got a very healthy and in line with consumption rates. I think the sense is that, that America is pretty stable. Everybody's watching China -- there are mixed reports in China. Some see it as very, very strong for the next couple of quarters, some not so strong. And Japan also seems to be pretty stable.","Jerald G. Fishman","So I think really the summary comment is that if we just listen to the feedback we're getting from our customers, we might put out more optimistic plan for next quarter. But I think we have to be cautious when you listen to what's going on macro-economically. And that's what I think our guidance reflects.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Great. If I could, for my follow-up just on the comment you made, Jerry, regarding a strong product cycle in the consumer segment that you're expecting. Can you just remind us, does that consumer segment include your handsets? And would that be -- if you could offer some more color there, that would be helpful.","Jerald G. Fishman","Well, I think -- as you know, when we've talked about previously, we really narrowed down our focus in the consumer business for those areas that we really think we can make not only a significant technology contribution but one that will last more than a few months or a few calendar quarters. And I'd say where our product offering is particularly strong right now is in the portable side. And that encompasses many different types of portable formats. And particularly in the audio and image processing, dimensions of that. So we have good products that represents a lot of mainstream analog technology, and based on the feedback we're getting from some of the top consumer companies, the design-in rate of those products seems pretty good. And if we believe their forecast for the second half, that should raise our consumer business in the next couple of quarters. But it's mostly focused on the portable area, I would say.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Shawn  Webster from Macquarie.","Deepon Sen Gupta ","This is Deepon for Shawn. Could you actually just talk about the current quarter where you're seeing orders from the end market and geographic perspective? Do you see order rates pick up? I know there's some talk about some order rates and maybe very strong for some of your competitors?","Vincent T. Roche","Yes. I'd say over the last couple of months, what we've seen is stabilization on the industrial side and a pickup in the communications infrastructure orders, in particular. The automotive also has been a great growth driver for the company over the last few years. And in order continues to be strong. My expectation is that in the second half and the 3Q that based on the order trends we're seeing, that market will behave pretty well for us as well.","Deepon Sen Gupta ","And when you're thinking the out-quarter, can you talk about where utilization rate is going to go and how much benefit we should see from utilization rate or how much we should see from mix? And also if you could give the utilization rates for the past quarter, that will be about helpful as well.","David A. Zinsner","So utilization in the second quarter was about 70%. We're expecting utilization to be in that range for the third quarter. It did pick up from, I think, it was 67-ish percent the prior quarter. So it added probably 50 basis points or so. The mix certainly contributed as well. What was your other question related to that?","Deepon Sen Gupta ","So just going forward, how do we anticipate mix impacting gross margins?","David A. Zinsner","Well, utilization's going to be flat. So I don't think that, that's going to benefit -- at the moment, we're predicting that mix will be relatively similar to what it was in the second quarter. So I doubt that, that will have much benefit. Really the improvement will get in the gross margin sequentially is going to be more just from the higher revenue level.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital.","Emily Scudder","This is Emily calling in for Ambrish. Can you discuss what regions are driving the growth in your communications infrastructure end market segment, and what regions you're expecting to be the strongest contributors to ADI in the second half of the fiscal year and fiscal '13?","Vincent T. Roche","Yes. I mean, all regions in the second quarter registered growth. America was relatively flat. But all regions grew. My expectation is that given what we're seeing on the end market side, there won't be much change in terms of the regional mix in, I believe, the third quarter.","Jerald G. Fishman","I think also our question was more related to communications.","Vincent T. Roche","Yes. On the communications side, well as you know, our business in the communication sector is very, very global. We supply products to all the sectors of equipment, such  as GSMs, all the 3G standards, WCDMA, TD-SCDMA, LTE on the 4G side. And I think particularly in America, you're going to see some significant capital deployments in the third and fourth quarter and also China. So I think Europe is probably on communications infrastructure side going to be somewhat tepid, but that's my sense based on what we heard from customers and what carriers seemed to be saying. And Japan has been quite good both on the wired and wireless side over the last quarter or 2. My expectation is that will remain steady.","Emily Scudder","Okay. And then can you comment on what your expectations are as far as distributor inventory as we exit this quarter, and how that might vary by the different regions?","David A. Zinsner","Yes. Days of inventory right now at distribution is around 7.5 weeks, that's a little bit below the target, which I think we generally think of as 8 weeks. I would guess, over time, that will migrate its way up to 8 weeks, but we don't have any insight as to when that will happen. And I think that it's pretty consistent across the geographies.","Vincent T. Roche","Yes. I think given the strength in supply as well, I think distributors are not incentivized, there's any particular reasons to hold at this point in time.","Jerald G. Fishman","And we're not incentivizing to give it to them.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Barclays.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess first question, Jerry, you talked about conservatism or cautious given the macro picture, but at the same time, it sounds like your visibility, particularly on the comm and consumer side is a little bit better. So I guess what I'm trying to ask and ask it directly is if we didn't have this kind of macro uncertainty, what kind of top line growth do you think we could see in Q2?","Jerald G. Fishman","I mean that's very hard to predict. I'd say just qualitatively, the only I can say is that if we had more macro certainty, we were sure that the economy was going to be no worse than neutral, I think our expectations for revenues will be higher. How much and what that number is, I'd just be guessing. And I don't think that serves either of us. But certainly, that macroclimate is -- I mean you have to be sobered by it. You can't see what's going on or read the newspaper every day and listen to all the commentary and not at least be a little concerned about how that might impact our business. So I think that's what our guidance is reflecting.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. I guess have you seen a pullback in terms of customers' asks? And it's flowing into your order book? Or is this more of a more cautionary stance just heading into what you may think you're going to see?","Jerald G. Fishman","I think it's more of the latter than the former.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. If I could just ask one last question, Dave. What should we be thinking about for tax rate in fiscal '13?","David A. Zinsner","I would plan it to be somewhere in the 22% range.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Chris Danely from JPMorgan.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So if we took all the macro uncertainty we all read about, what do you think your best guess would be for whatever is close to a normal seasonal quarter this quarter? And then what would be a normal seasonal quarter for next quarter in terms of revenue growth?","Jerald G. Fishman","I think the best way I can answer that is that we haven't had this seasonally normal quarter in 3 years.","David A. Zinsner","4 years.","Jerald G. Fishman","4 years, actually, Dave reminds me. So I think the trends for each of the market segments is much more dominant than the seasonality that we see. In the earlier days when our business was mostly military, industrial and so on, it was pretty easy to just figure that out. But I think with consumer business, the communications business, automotive businesses, those are not businesses that respond to typical seasonality as compared to what's going on in those particular market segments that are more on a secular way of thinking about it than a seasonal way of thinking about it. So very hard to predict. In fact, as I mentioned earlier, we went back and looked at seasonality for the last 3 or 4 years, and we couldn't figure out what it was, looking at all the data, of 16 quarters worth of data to try to figure out seasonal patterns. We couldn't figure out any seasonality, so very hard to predict that.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you tell us what sort of turns business you're expecting this quarter, and then what it was last quarter? What would be typical?","David A. Zinsner","Chris, our standard response on that is we don't really quote that number, only because most or at least half of our revenue is distributor based, so we have the backlog coming in from the distributors, but we don't recognize it until it ships out. I mean I think Jerry said qualitatively that we're in a higher turns like environment. We don't put a number to it. But nevertheless, clearly, customers are not layering in tons of backlog. They're not ordering until they really need it. And so we have quoted 4-week lead times, about how much time it takes from the time we get an order to the time we're shipping at this point.","Jerald G. Fishman","And in fact, the large part of the product lines are quite a bit less than 4 weeks. In fact, it's probably 4 hours.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Uche Orji from UBS.","Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Jerry, can I just ask you a question and I'm -- probably something I don't fully understand. You talked about some of the infrastructure customers to be more of a software upgrade rather than a hardware upgrade. Any comment as to what extent you were able to stretch that and in what types of technologies? I mean is it within 3G or I think another 3G level? And why you think that they will have to stop that now and do more of a hardware upgrade? I just want to get a bit more insight as to the comment.","Jerald G. Fishman","Yes. Vince, is going to answer that.","Vincent T. Roche","Most of our business, the GSM or 2G component of our businesses is becoming smaller and smaller over time, so most of the, if you like, the upgrades that are being managed through software largely in 3G systems today. But it's only so far that, that will get you because every year, data requirements are increasing twofold. There's 90 million 4G-enabled handsets out there today, and they all require with an insatiable appetite for more and more bandwidth, which is driving -- this data is driving the need for expanded bandwidth RF transceivers. That's our game in the wireless arena and higher frequency requirements as well across multiple different geographies with different spectrum needs. So our sense is from talking to some carriers, talking to our customers, the second half of this year is going to see an upgrade in the equipment at the 3G and particularly 4G level.","Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Well, that's helpful. Let me just ask a different question. Jerry, in terms of understanding the target inventory for customers, I mean, I think what Dave explained that the target is for 8 weeks and you're currently at 7.5 weeks.","Jerald G. Fishman","Well, that's in distribution. Just to clarify things...","Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","In distribution exactly, distribution. Let me understand it. I mean because we've -- last year, I think starting from 2009, there was all this talk about inventory moving down to slightly lower level over time because of improvements in VMI. And is there any reason why we shouldn't assume 7.5 weeks is now the new normal and why 8 weeks will be -- and the reason I ask this is because it kind of influences our assumption about a future tailwind coming from inventory restocking. Is that -- do you think 7.5 weeks is kind of where we should be modeling now, in which case we can conclude was normalized in terms of channel inventory?","Jerald G. Fishman","I think there's no meaningful distinction between 7.5 weeks and 8 weeks. Maybe 7.5 is the new norm or 7.2 or 8.3. We just don't know. But we're saying that it doesn't impact much what we do. So whether the new norm is 7.5 or the new norm is 8, I mean we're going to still do the same thing. We're going to have inventory available when our customers or distributors need it. And that's what we've done through the last couple of cycles and it significantly improved our competitive position relative to those who tried to, call it, more tightly than that. And I think that's what we're going to do going forward. I think there is no meaningful distinction to us of how we operate the business whether the new norm is 7.5 or 8 weeks.","David A. Zinsner","In particular because we don't recognize the revenue until it ships out from the distributor.","Jerald G. Fishman","Yes. So let's say it doesn't impact anything the way we run the business. So if we could be equally predictive on other measures in Analog, I'd be quite happy.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Somewhat related question on inventory. Just to be clear, does your guidance assume any customer restocking in the out-quarter? Or is the growth in the quarter just coming from some combination of a pickup and then demand and\/or customers just continuing to get their orders back in line with their demand?","Jerald G. Fishman","Again, it's hard to be quantitatively precise to answer your question. But I'd say that lion's share of what our guidance includes is customer's order and consumption. That's where we think most customers are in their thinking right now.","Vincent T. Roche","Our customers are indicating that the -- across the broad customer base particularly in the infrastructure area, the CapEx area like industrial and communications infrastructure that their inventories are at a very normal level now and very much in line with consumption. So I think that, that cycle overbuild is finished and customers are back to a normal order pattern.","Jerald G. Fishman","I mean I think in the de minimis level, there are still some customers that are destocking that we've heard of and there are some customers that are going to restock a little bit. But the predominant mode most customers are in, and we've said that we believe they're going to be ordering what they use.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And for a follow-up, as we go through these cycles, normally what happens is  something causes lead times to begin to stretch out a little bit and that's what starts the customers to reorder a little more, build a little more inventory or move away from the high-turns components that they're putting on you guys right now? Last time, obviously it was testing capacity that caused lead times to stretch. Other cycles, it's been other things. I know it's difficult to predict, but what kinds of things do you see out there that could potentially cause lead times to stretch out a little bit this quarter and kind of begin that cycle all over again?","Jerald G. Fishman","Well, we can only speculate about that. Certainly, we've heard anecdotes about foundry capacity getting a little bit tighter. We know that many of the assembly test subcontractors are thinly capitalized, so they don't carry a lot of extra capacity. So I think if the order trends start getting more confirmed and more positive, I think most semiconductor companies are reporting an improved order environment. I think if that continues with the relative scarcity of capacity out there, I think lead times for those that aren't thinking about it clearly could extend. Our goal is to not have that happen. Our goal is to really stay on top of this and keep our lead times in the range that they've been in. And if we do that, then that creates no need for customers to double or triple order and confuse us, and by definition, our investors. So I mean our goal is to really watch that carefully and keep the lead times short. It helps our customers, it helps you, it helps us. And that's what we're going to do with the cycle, just like we did in the last cycle. Those are the pressure points, typically. I think most semiconductor manufacturers have capacity in sight that's available to ramp up. We certainly do. So I think the pressure points will likely be on the outside, not necessarily on the inside.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Aashish Rao - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Aashish Rao for Vivek. A couple questions on the consumer front. In January, I think, you had indicated that Thailand floods had impacted some of the consumer in home entertainment builds, and you'd also indicated that your expected consumer to be up slightly in April. But then sales kind of declined 8% quarter-on-quarter. I mean could you give some color on that?","Jerald G. Fishman","Well, we were wrong. I think our consumer business, just across many different segments of it went down. Part of it was inventory that got a little too high, higher than we had thought. Secondarily, there were some products that -- in some end markets that weren't selling particularly well. The consumer cycle was not a strong cycle in the last 3 months. So I think those things qualitatively made our estimate wrong. We were also wrong in the industrial side where we thought it was going to be much lower than it is. And these parts of the cycle at the inflection points, it's very challenging to figure out what the aggregate is going to be, and I'd say even more challenging to figure out what any of the individual segments are going to do at least in the short term. I think that's part of the challenge now with all the changes that are going on to try and figure out the segment growth. We try to give you the internal plan that our product and market salespeople have in each of those segments. We try to give you a little more color at least directionally where we think it's going to happen. But very typically, we're happy to get the aggregate right. The individual categories are very volatile. It's very hard to get that correct.","Aashish Rao - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then it just sounded also on the call that you are excited about some new product cycles in the consumer segment and this is even after the divestitures of the computing and the handset, x those products, I mean your sales from, say, fiscal year '10 and you're averaging about $155 million or so a quarter. I mean right now you're at $108 million. I mean is this just the cyclical recovery that you're expecting in consumer? Or are there really some new product cycles?","Jerald G. Fishman","Well, I'd say it's predominately new products that we've refocused on as we've decreased investments in consumer products that we didn't think fit well with our long-term portfolio. So I think we've decreased investments. In some of those areas, we refocused them on areas that we think are suitable for the product mix and the margin models that we have for the company. And I think those products will be well received.","Aashish Rao - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So should we expect any kind of the growth rate target you have for this business off the bottom?","Jerald G. Fishman","Why don't you give us a couple more quarters, and then we'll talk about it?","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie from Raymond James.","Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","David, I was hoping you could comment on any internal efforts you guys are making in terms of gross margin improvements? Basically just looking for an update on some of the pricing strategy efforts you've been making and some of the efforts on making products more easy to -- or more efficiently to manufacture?","David A. Zinsner","Yes, I mean all of those are progressing. And I think we're in kind of middle innings of making improvement in both those areas. We do believe there will be tailwinds to our gross margin. The biggest thing, of course, that will improve the gross margin is to get the utilization up. And so getting the business back to the levels we saw in 2011, I think, would have been the biggest driver for gross margin.","Jerald G. Fishman","I think last time, our gross margin got up to about 67%. There is a lot of conversations about were those anomalous or were there onetime things that were driving that up, because it was so much higher than it's been in Analog, at ADI historically. I think the fact that we got back over 65%, at below 60 -- $700 million of revenues is a very good sign that the kind of improvements that we made are not fleeting, that they're permanent and that we have pretty good expectations on the gross margins for the company as revenues build, as Dave said. I think that those numbers this quarter on the gross margin were very encouraging to us.","Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Right. And just as a follow-up on that, to what extent can you get, let's say in a better more normalized macro-environment, to what extent can you get above that, the 67%? And just to sneak one more in, can you talk a little bit about what OpEx dollars might look like over the next several quarters assuming some modest sequential revenue growth, I mean as we sort of reach the dollar plateau here now that you've added in these extra items you mentioned earlier? Or is that -- will that still keep expanding?","Jerald G. Fishman","Dave, I'll turn it over to you on the expected, then I'll talk a little bit about the margins.","David A. Zinsner","Okay. So on the OpEx side, we are expecting it to obviously increase this quarter. It's a little bit, I think, a little around half the rate of the revenue growth. We did better than that, obviously, in the current quarter. And that's generally our goal, to try to expend -- grow expenses at a rate that's below the rate of revenue growth, get good fall through to the operating margin line.","Jerald G. Fishman","I think on the question of the margins, the margins are a combination of price and cost. Somebody asked earlier, we're continuously ensuring that we get paid fairly for our products. So I think that helps us. We're continuously setting tougher cost objectives on the products. Our goal is to be -- from here to be increasing the gross margin sequentially as the revenues go up. And if we continue to do that, I think everyone will be very happy with the gross margins we get.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis from Caris & Company.","Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Jerry, I appreciate the candid acknowledgment to the uncertain macro. As you look around today and assess the backdrop that you have, how would you compare it to the same time last year? What are the positives and what are the headwinds?","Jerald G. Fishman","Well, I think this time last year, we were really worried that not only were there sort of macro issues developing, but there was a significant amount of inventory that was in the channel out there. People really inventoried up much more so than we or anybody else have thought during the earthquakes and tsunamis that happened around that time. And so we were faced with a situation where you had macro sort of demand issues, at the same time you had very significant inventory out there with our customers and in the distribution channel. And the intersection of those 2 things took a big whack out of all of us. I think where we are today is -- we still have macroeconomic issues, some would argue that they're closer to getting resolved, some would take a different point of view on that. But certainly this time, relative to what consumption rates are, there's not a lot of inventory out there that channels compound that issue. So I think from that standpoint, Craig, I think we feel like there's less downside with -- than there was a year ago at this time. And I think at the same time, with the customer cycles that we're hearing about from our customers, I think there's more upside potential. So qualitatively, I think sitting here today a year after all those events last year, we're feeling better than we feel a year ago. It's certainly not without risk, but better.","Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then a follow-up for you, Dave. You guys did a great job with the dividend increase a quarter ago. And just by that and buying back stock the cash balance still moved up. So how should we think about how you're thinking about cash management?","David A. Zinsner","Well, we're obviously anxious to return the cash in the form of dividends and opportunistic buybacks. I think we'll continue to do that. Obviously we built a lot -- or we generate a lot of cash, which is a high-class problem. But, however, I think you will see us continue to be committed in both buybacks and dividend growth going forward.","Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","And what's the percentage of cash that's in the U.S. versus overseas at this point?","David A. Zinsner","I think I mentioned we have $1.1 billion in the U.S. The rest is overseas.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Sanford Bernstein.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","For the first one, how do we think about the impact of what sounds like a very strong potential consumer cycle into the back half in 2013 on gross margins? Can you talk a little bit about some of the drivers of margin into the back half and as we exit the year around product mix given some of those cycles around utilizations and growth as well, maybe some of the other initiatives that you're targeting?","Jerald G. Fishman","I think on the consumer side, I wouldn't want to let the expectations run away with us here. What -- the reason we mentioned it is that we've been very clear that we were really narrowing our reach in the consumer business to applications that add a lot of value to the customers and, therefore, were valuable to us. And I think we're beginning to see the fruit of that. I don't think -- we're talking about numbers that are going to fundamentally change the needle. I think consumer applications typically carry somewhat lower gross margins than the average, particularly in the industrial business. But at the same time, they carry very high operating margin since below the line, there's not a lot of expense. So I think carefully managed and carefully executed consumer business is a fine business. It shows you how to be very careful of what you do and who you do it with, or who you do it for in order -- so you don't get banged around by product cycles that are out of your control and margins that result from being in that vise. So I think it's important, and I want to clarify that we're not talking about any huge disruption here that all of a sudden, we're going to have a lot more consumer revenue than we've had historically. It's just we have couple good product cycles incrementally, it's going to make our computer business grow a little bit, it's been declining -- or our consumer business rather will grow a little bit where it's been declining, and I think that's going to help the top line a little bit.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Got it. So to be clear, you don't foresee mix, I guess, turning a little more negative on the gross margin front as we exit the year then?","Jerald G. Fishman","Given Dave's guidance on the gross margin, I don't think so.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Got it. And for my follow-up, sequentially on the automotive market, auto has been very strong for you and for a number of other players for the last few quarters. What's your point of view on the stability of that auto strength, again, as we -- as we're cycling for the rest of the year, maybe into 2013? Do you think that what we're seeing is actually a stable unit growth? Is there any chance that what we're seeing potentially is pull forward of demand? Can you give us some view of how much of the upside you've seen is actually been unit growth versus overall electronic content increasing versus your design win traction increasing?","Vincent T. Roche","It looks like this year, the number of cars that are sold worldwide will reach maybe 80 million, up about 5%. And the content, the electronic content per car continues to increase. From our perspective, we're very well positioned. We play with all the leaders worldwide. We have a particularly strong position with European OEMs who are doing extraordinarily well in the world market, particularly in America and Asia. So my sense is that the growth pattern we've seen will continue for the remainder of the year if we have another good year in automotive, and for the next number of years as well. So all the indications are that we'll see a growth here in terms of units, car units and growth in electronic content. So we're feeling very positive about it.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.","Bheeshm Chaudhary - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Bheeshm Chaudhary for Ross. Just a quick question. I was curious what your revenue guidance would be for the next quarter if you recognize distribution sales on a -- or distribution revenue on a sell-in basis?","David A. Zinsner","We have no idea. We don't measure it that way, and so we don't pay any attention to it.","Jerald G. Fishman","Although, I expect it will be higher.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Sumit Dhanda from ISI Group.","Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","One question I have on the comm infrastructure stuff where you're expecting a pickup in the back half. I guess my question was, is that just based on a general sense that spending needs to revive? Or do you have some specific indication from your customers, perhaps in specific geographies that suggest that you'll indeed see a nice pick up in the third and the fourth quarter of this year?","Vincent T. Roche","Well, for example, China Unicom, who's a WCDMA operator, they've been very vocal as have AT&T about the LTE deployment. So I think if you look at some of the carriers, they're being a lot more aggressive and determine on what they're going to do in the second half. And our customers also are seeing their order books firm up. So I think it's not just wishful thinking. My sense is based on the order streams that we're seeing in the last couple of months and what we're hearing from our customers and the carriers, that there is real demand in the market to continue to build out macrocells in particular. And I think over the next 18 months, which you're going to see is a very aggressive move towards small cell architectures as well to supplement the macrocells. So our expectation, by the way, over the coming few years, this year, there will be somewhere in the region of -- I believe, somewhere in the region of 1 million macrocells in production, deployed I should say, 1.1 million, 1.2 million. And what we're expecting is over the next 3 to 4 years, that, that will probably triple or quadruple. So there's going to be a major build-out that we're kind of gliding into over the next 2 to 3 quarters, I believe.","Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that was very helpful. And then for my follow-up, Dave, I know you don't guide to turns, but perhaps you could tell us what do you think, it's directionally up, down or flat, and\/or whether you expect any difference in distributor versus OEM sales or order patterns through the course of July quarter?","David A. Zinsner","It is down, I would say, probably directionally, as Jerry kind of made a comment about it, I think, early on that qualitatively, we think that increasingly that particularly the OEM customers are shortening their lead times and putting more on turns basis. As far as OEMs versus disty I believe our expectation is that OEMs will be growing a little bit faster than disty the next quarter.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of David Wong from Wells Fargo.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Looking forward, can you tell us what are your highest priorities are in terms of either product segments or end market segments for R&D investment?","Jerald G. Fishman","Well, I think the way we look at R&D is now everything we're doing is a priority, because all the ones that weren't, we're not doing anymore. So that's a simple way to look at it. There are market segments or product segments in each of the end markets that we believe are very favorable and a good match to the technology that we have, where we can offer products our competitors can't do. So I don't think that there's any one particular market that we're favoring more than the others. If we are investing R&D in a market, then we think it's a good -- we're going to get a good return on it or we're not going to invest. So I think the segments that we've talked about, the industrial segments, there is 10 or 11 segments in there, the communications infrastructure market, the consumer market, particularly as related to portable products, I think those are all high priorities for us, which is why we're putting a fair amount of R&D into all those things.","Maria Tagliaferro","Okay. Well, I believe that was the last question that we had in the queue. So that brings us right up to the 6:00 hour.","Jerald G. Fishman","Very disciplined, good.","Maria Tagliaferro","Yes. So we want to thank everyone for joining us. Just as a reminder, the third quarter earnings call is scheduled for August 21, and that will start again at 5 p.m. Eastern time.

Sir, the floor is yours.","Ali Husain","Alright, great. Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining ADI's fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 earnings conference call. You can find our press release, relating financial schedules, and the investor toolkit at their usual spot, at investor.analog.com. And specifically about the investor toolkit, it's something we post on our website two hours before the earnings call and it's actually a pretty good summary of our prepared remarks. So, for those that are interested in kind of getting the early scoop, that's probably good place to go, as we file our press release.","With me on today's call are ADI\u2019s CEO, Vincent Roche; and ADI\u2019s CFO, Dave Zinsner. Before we start, let\u2019s do our disclosures. Please note the information we\u2019re about to discuss, including objectives, outlook and the proposed acquisition of Linear Technology Corporation, includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and our most recent 10-K. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Our comments today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which we've reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in today\u2019s earnings release, which we\u2019ve posted at investor.analog.com.","And so with all that behind us, let's get started. And I'd like to turn the call over to Vincent Roche, our CEO.","Vincent Roche","Thank you, Ali, and good morning, everyone. By almost any measure, ADI had an excellent fourth quarter. To put it in perspective, we achieved record revenue of $1 billion, expanded operating margins to a record 38% of sales and we generated record free cash flow margins of 44%. Throughout fiscal 2016, as you know, caution and uncertainty were the norm across the world. Nevertheless, we executed well in a tough business environment, investing and positioning ourselves for future growth while remaining disciplined and making smart investment tradeoffs.","All told, the actions we took during the year drove free cash flow margins to 33.7%, a 520 basis-point improvement over the prior year. And I\u2019m very proud of the stellar execution by our entire team.","For ADI, it starts with an obsession for customers\u2019 success as I personally spend, as you know, a lot of time talking to and listening to their needs. It\u2019s obvious to me from these conversations that ADI is an exceptional Company and we're more relevant to our customers than ever before. What is also clear is that our customers are seeking true innovation partners, as they grow and develop their businesses in the midst of unprecedented levels of complexity. At the same time, our customers\u2019 hardware engineering talent is stretched thin. As a result, they're increasingly focusing their design efforts on systems and software while turning the analog design challenge to ADI where we have economies of scale and of scope.","With the analog design challenges set to become even more complicated and critical in the area of IoT and Industry 4.0 for example, helping our customers bridge the physical and digital domains in mission critical applications will, we believe, create tremendous opportunities for sustainable profitable growth for ADI long into the future.","Customers choose us because we've been at this craft for over 50 years now. And in our industry, brand matters. The ADI brand is synonymous with high quality and high performance. And our customers rightly have full faith that ADI will support them today and well into the future. We've demonstrated an unwavering commitment to innovation that creates economic value for our customers by investing strongly in our own business.","Since the great recession, ADI has invested $4 billion in research and development alone, primarily in the B2B markets of industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure. We've also made investments in quality, manufacturing, supply chain and field operations because being able to effectively and efficiently deliver high reliability innovation and customer support is just as important as the innovation itself.","In addition to these organic investments, we've been acquiring capability that not only builds our technology base but also enables ADI to move up the value stack. During the year, we announced the proposed acquisition of Linear Technology which once complete will create a high performance analog leader with the combined company having a top-two market share position across all the key building blocks of the analog market, namely data convertors; power management; amplifiers; interface; and high performance RF and microwave. Once the transaction closes, we will have the ability to meet all of our customers\u2019 analog and mixed signal needs in sticky, long life cycle, high value applications in the industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure markets.","During the year, we also acquired some very interesting early stage technologies which we believe will help ADI move up the value stack, as we say over time. The acquisition of SNAP Sensor gives ADI the ability to provide our customers with very high dynamic range imaging capabilities, important in smart city applications, as an example. For smart factory applications, we acquired Innovasic, a developer of the Deterministic Ethernet Switching and Software Solutions to extend our reach in this core market. We also acquired the Cyber Security Solutions of Sypris, giving ADI the ability to provide customers with a trusted sensor to cloud solution with security write down of the node. And just recently, we announced the acquisition of some exciting LIDAR technology from Vescent Photonics that will enable ADI to develop a true solid state scanning LIDAR system complementing our existing RADAR-based ADAS offerings. And these things are very important in autonomous driving applications.","The investments we\u2019ve made and continue to make are helping create economic value for our customers. And I\u2019d like to share a few examples of where ADI\u2019s technology is making a real difference.","In the automotive space, our recently announced A2B Audio Bus structure provides vehicle manufacturers with high-end in-cabin audio fidelity while reducing vehicle weight. We estimate that our solution helps save car manufacturers approximately $30 per vehicle in combined CO2 taxes and fuel efficiency. In the area of factory and process automation, our software configurable input output solutions are solving significant channel density, physical space and thermal challenges while reducing system complexity and installation and wiring costs. And in the healthcare arena, ADI\u2019s vital signs monitoring products are bringing clinical grade care into the home, enabling high-quality remote patient monitoring that reduces or even eliminates the need for and cost of the hospital stay.","Ours is a customer value creation journey, 51 years in the making. We have the intellectual capital and more importantly, we have a talented, passionate and engaged team of ADI to help serve our customers needs today and well into the future. The combination with Linear Technology represents the next phase in this value creation journey.","With our market-leading product portfolios tied to attractive markets, we believe we can create a free cash flow engine that will be unmatched in our industry and help provide investors with an attractive combination of growth and shareholder value from many years to come.","So with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Ali for details on our performance by end market in the fourth quarter.","Ali Husain","Great, thanks Vince. So digging deeper into our results by end market. The industrial market of 39% of revenue increased 6% sequentially; a very strong result in what is typically a weaker period for the industrial business. Revenue from our broad base of small and medium sized customers was better than seasonal and in fact increased sequentially. And the expected rebound in the aerospace and defense sector was also pretty strong. And our healthcare business also posted record quarter as we are now beginning to see the early returns from our investments in the healthcare sector. Compared to the prior year, the industrial market showed actually pretty considerable strength, growing 8% over the prior year, and it was broad based strength across all of the industrial sectors, as we compare the year-on-year performance.","The automotive market at 14% of revenue increased 5% sequentially and that was broad based growth across really all sectors within this market. But I\u2019d say, more importantly, automotive revenues increased 7% compared to the prior year.","Communications infrastructure sales at 17% of revenue decreased slightly from the prior quarter. Both, wireless and wireline application revenues decreased slightly sequentially but increased compared to the prior year, led by growth in a 100 gig plus optical networking applications. The consumer market at 29% of fourth quarter revenue increased 58% sequentially, and decreased 7% compared to the prior year with both sequential and year-over-year results, largely due to portable consumer application sales.","So, now, I'd like to turn the call over to Dave for details of our financial performance in the fourth quarter and in fiscal 2016. With the exception of revenue, Dave\u2019s comments on fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 P&L line items will exclude special items, which in the aggregate totaled $39 million for the quarter. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and our calculation of free cash flow are on schedules E and F in today\u2019s release.","So with that, Dave, it's all yours.","Dave Zinsner","Thanks, Ali. The fourth quarter was once again a very strong and profitable quarter, and we set records for revenue, operating margin, free cash flow generation and earnings per share. Revenue in the fourth quarter totaled $1 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.05. Gross margins of 66.6% increased 60 basis points from the prior quarter and included a 120 basis-point benefit relating to the sale of previously reserved portable consumer application inventory. Excluding this item, gross margins were in line with guidance, decreasing 60 basis points from the prior quarter, due to mix.","We continue to tightly manage inventories and as a result, inventory on a dollars basis in the fourth quarter decreased $16 million sequentially and inventory on the days basis decreased 17 days to a 105 days. Weeks of inventory and distribution were slightly below seven weeks and we're at the leanest level in six years.","Operating expenses increased 3% sequentially, lagging well behind the 15% sequential increase in revenue. As a result, operating profit hit a record 38.1% of revenue expanding 400 basis points sequentially and 220 basis points over the prior year. Other expense in the fourth quarter was approximately $20 million. Our tax rate in the fourth quarter was approximately 10%, as we adjusted our full year tax rate to approximately 11%.","Excluding special items, our business delivered strong operating leverage, even with low utilization rates. And diluted earnings per share grew 28% sequentially to the $1.05 per share, which was almost twice the rate of sequential revenue growth. We had a record cash generation quarter with free cash flow margins of 44%, expanding 600 basis points compared to the year ago period. Capital additions during the quarter were $41 million and we expect fiscal 2017 capital additions to be in the range of $125 million to $145 million.","During the quarter, we paid a $130 in dividends and our long-term financial model incorporates annual dividend increases of 5% to 10%. At the current stock price, ADI's dividend yield of a $1.68 represents a dividend yield of approximately 2.5%, although maybe a little bit lower now that the stock rose today.","Now, I'll take a moment to talk about our performance in 2016. Revenue of $3.4 billion was stable to the prior year and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share decreased 3% from the prior year, primarily due to lower gross margins and higher interest expense ahead of the Linear Tech deal close. The lower gross margins for the year were primarily the result of a very deliberate and disciplined inventory management program that reduced inventory on a dollars basis by $36 million or 9% and on a days\u2019 basis reduced inventory in the fourth quarter by nine days to a 105 days. Nevertheless, gross margins remained relatively stable to the prior year as we minimized the impact of lower factory utilization rates through pricing and cost efficiencies. The good news is that inventory levels are now in excellent shape.","All told, fiscal 2016 free cash flow margins expanded by over 500 basis points to 34%, setting a new Company record. During the year, we also returned almost $900 million or 77% of free cash flow to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks. Of course, the biggest news of the year was the proposed acquisition of Linear Technology. To-date, we\u2019ve received regulatory clearances in Israel, Germany, Japan and United States. And we now expect the transaction to close by the end of our second fiscal quarter of 2017.","Our integration planning teams are hard at work and we are very pleased with their progress. Vincent put me in charge of the integration effort, and I am confident that our combined Company will be greater than some of its parts.","We expect the transaction to be immediately accretive to non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow, and for accretion levels to increase as we have begin realizing the planned $150 million of annualized run rate synergies within 18 months of the transaction close.","During the quarter, we also made good progress on financing the transaction, locking up a $5 billion term loan facility. Based on our current expectations, we anticipate the all-in coupon rate related to the financing to be approximately 3%.","So, now, turning to our outlook and expectations for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, which with the exception of revenue expectations is on a non-GAAP basis and excludes known special items that are outlined in today's release.","Order rates are currently stable across our business as we enter the seasonally slow January quarter. As a result, we expect revenue in the first quarter to decrease sequentially and be in the range of $840 million to $900 million, but to grow 9% to 17% over the prior year. With inventory levels and utilization rates in good shape, we anticipate gross margins in the first quarter to be between 65.5% and 66%. We expect operating expenses in the first quarter to increase slightly sequentially and for operating profit before tax to be well north of 30%.","We are planning for our tax rate to be approximately 11%, which is our planned non-GAAP rate until we close the Linear transaction. In total, excluding special items, we expect diluted earnings per share in the first quarter to be between $0.68 to $0.78, which would represent year-over-year earnings per share growth of 21% to 39%.","This was a great quarter for the Company, and we are very proud of our achievements. But as Vince always says, we should be often pleased but never satisfied. It is our job to make sure that we continue to exceed expectations. Our customers, employees and shareholders would expect nothing less and neither do we.","So with that, operator, let\u2019s open up the floor for questions.","Ali Husain","Just a reminder to folks on the line, please limit yourself to one question. If you have a follow-up, I would ask that you please re-queue. And again, we do this in the spirit of fairness that everybody who wants to ask a question gets to ask at least one of their questions. And we\u2019re running this call till 11. So, I think that\u2019s plenty of time to get to everyone's question. So, Jennifer, I think you have got the instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO.","Ambrish Srivastava","Hi, thank you. I know the rule but I had a quick fact check for Dave and then I had a longer term for Vince. Dave, I apologize if I am missing it, usually in your prepared press release, you do get the end-market breakdown for the coming quarter. I don\u2019t think I saw at this time.","Dave Zinsner","Yes. Maybe we ordinarily do. Okay, I\u2019ll give you two questions, Ambrish. I would say just kind of directionally the B2B businesses which we would consider industrial, automotive and communications will roughly be down mid-single digits. And of course consumer, I think would be roughly in the 30% down range. Does that answer your question, Ambrish?","Ambrish Srivastava","Yes, thank you. My other one was a bit of a longer term for you, Vince. And this is going back to a conversation you and I had a while ago. I know you\u2019ve been on a path to transforming ADI and you\u2019ve talked about inorganic as well as organic, and thinking more of a value creation as opposed to what we are used to, design-in, design-out. You kind of showed it in the consumer side so far that you are not a one socket win. But, give us a perspective of where we are. I know baseball season is over and I love cricket but cricket is bad analogy, there is only two innings. So, where are we in the transformation, Vince? And just help us with that perspective. Thank you. ","Vincent Roche","Yes, thanks Ambrish. Good questions. So, look, we are on a journey. We believe -- we said several years ago, we believe that there is enough impetus in our business and that we have the balance sheet as well to help us get this Company towards $4 billion to $5 billion in sales in a reasonable period of time. We are well on track. I believe over the next several years, we will be updating -- obviously when we integrate LTC, we will be updating all the benchmarks around what we expect our revenue to be over time, profits, free cash flow and so and so forth.","So, I don\u2019t know, I am not a cricket fan at all, Ambrish. I don\u2019t know cricket. And I am only an amateur in terms of understanding baseball. But, I would say, we are still in the probably the first quarter of the transformation.","Ambrish Srivastava","Okay. That\u2019s football.","Vincent Roche","So, we have plenty of upsides. As I said, what makes me very optimistic about this business is that the analog domain essentially sets the performance for all the systems that make up this massive information communications technology sector. It\u2019s one of the foundational technologies. Our customers are asking us for more, more and more. And we are getting to the point now where we can be very, very choosey about the problems that we solve. And we can solve those problems across the board from microwave to mix signal to digital single processing, to power sensor technologies. So, I think there is a huge innovation upside that\u2019s the root of this Company. We are in a better and better position with our customers. So, I am very optimistic that we can get this business well-beyond $5 billion in a reasonable period of time.","Ambrish Srivastava","Okay, Thank you. Happy Thanksgiving, guys.","Vincent Roche","Many happy returns.","Ali Husain","Thanks, Ambrish. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel.","Tore Svanberg","Yes. Great execution, guys. Dave, can you remind us where utilization is right now? And what are your plans for the next quarter? Obviously you\u2019ve done a great job bringing the inventory day down, but kind of as we look forward from here on, how should we think about utilization in inventories?","Dave Zinsner","So, utilization was in the kind of high 60s in the fourth quarter. I would expect it to be roughly in that range in the first quarter, which is somewhat atypical for us for our first quarter because generally we're working our inventory back down in the first quarter and with industrial usually having a sequential decline in the first quarter as well, it generally drives our utilization down a bit. But given that we've done so well, the operations group has done so well in terms of managing inventory this year, we can keep utilization a little bit higher going into the first quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tristan Gerra with Baird.","Tristan Gerra","Related question on the gross margin guidance, when we adjust for the sale of previously reserved product, you have a sequential trend in gross margin guidance that's better than seasonal. And you just mentioned the utilization rate being better than what you'd see typically in fiscal quarter. Is there anything else in terms of mix that also has an impact on the gross margin, maybe some weakness in base station or anything else that you could give us color on?","Dave Zinsner","I think it's generally utilization that's going to drive it. Because in reality, mix on a year-over-year basis is actually a little bit worse. Because if you remember the first quarter was a pretty difficult quarter for us with regard to consumer came down quite a bit. This year, it won't have as dramatic a decline. And so, mix is a little bit negative but utilization will offset. And I'd say the other thing just anecdotally as the operations group has done a very good job on the spending side, just really managing the expenses there. And so we've incrementally, I'd say, every year have been doing a bit better in terms of spending. And then on top of that there's obviously, as I think I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've been focused on pricing as well. And so, I think those things have just had an incrementally little bit of a benefit every quarter. And then, of course utilization drives a lot of it and the offset would be mix.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.","Craig Hettenbach","On industrial and understanding there is a big macro overlay to industrial but nice to see the broad based strength. Can you talk about, Vince, just maybe some of the applications or products that you're excited about in terms of where you're seeing some investment by your industrial customers?","Vincent Roche","Yes. I mentioned in the prepared remarks there, Craig, for example, in our core businesses, like robotics for example, there's a need to be able to push the speed and the accuracy of these robots to ever higher levels. That's a tremendous digital signal processing challenge. And we've been building complete solutions that are only coming to fruition now for that area to enable much higher speeds in the operation of the robots with lower power, much greater accuracy. So, it's a complete signal chain of digital signal processing technology and mix signal technology. I mentioned in the prepared remarks as well some of these software defined input-output structures that are enabling our customers to deepen the penetration of sensors into their environments and to dramatically reduce the complexity of installation and the costs. Energy is another area. It\u2019s a slow burn market but it\u2019s an area where we have tremendous technology in transmission and distribution and also in the metering of energy.","So, those are just a couple of areas. And I should say as well, we combine, we just lump healthcare into the industrial sector as well. And we have seen -- this is the market where we have been investing, I would say, modestly but very determinedly over the last seven or eight years and we are beginning to really see the returns come good there in terms of revenue and profit. So, I'll give an example. Using integrated silicon photonics and signal processing technology, we've changed the way our customers can implement CT scanning and digital X-ray. We are bringing a clinical grade vital signs monitoring beyond the hospital into the clinic and the home. So, those are all things that are making a big difference to ADI. I should point out by the way as well, we are on a quarter -- we are on a quarter billion dollar run rate now with our healthcare business, with very, very good profits and a good outlook. Again, it\u2019s a slower burn business, but it\u2019s a terrific fit for the future for ADI.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Danely with Citigroup.","Chris Danely","I wanted to ask the Trump question since I get it five or six times a day. So, who knows what this guy is going to come up with policy wise but maybe if you could just share with us your thoughts on how you think this impacts you, what your concerns are, what you think any positives could come out of it for ADI and the industry? Any thoughts there would be appreciated.","Vincent Roche","It\u2019s a good question, but we are getting into our 52nd year now as a company. So, we have gone through many regime changes across the world and many, many -- how many American presidents is that. So, I think it\u2019s just wait and see. We don\u2019t know. We hear like everybody else hear the rhetoric. We have yet got to see what the policy is going to look like, but maybe on the margins it will be good, at least for the American business environment.","Operator","Your next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.","Amit Daryanani","Congrats on a really nice quarter here. I just want to go back to the Linear transaction for a second, maybe you have more time to go through this and review this. The number one question we tend to get is just how much of -- what sort of manufacturing optimization savings could you get from the transaction over time, and what sort of upside would that yield versus 150 million you talked about. So anything you can talk about just manufacturing integration optimization you can do and if that would be incremental to what you have talked about?","Dave Zinsner","Thanks Amit; that\u2019s a good question. Let me start though since you asked -- opened up the Linear question, why don\u2019t we just start at the beginning -- at the top here. We have actually spent the last several months really focusing on how integration will go as of day one. I would tell you that where we have gotten a lot more optimism is around revenue side. We were already coming into this and this is the reason we do an acquisition like this is to get revenue synergies. We are already coming into the acquisition thinking that we would get hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue upside over time because it takes a while to get that kind of revenue upside. But eventually, I would say that we are even more optimistic about getting revenue synergies, the teams have sat a number of times and talked through where there might be opportunities for the combined Company to really address markets and deliver products that we hadn\u2019t in the past. And fruits of those conversations have been very, very positive.","On the manufacturing side, I think that right now, we\u2019re going to go in with the footprint that we have. And what we do and what we\u2019ve always done is optimized that to our needs. And we\u2019ll continue to look at it. So, I don\u2019t know beyond -- I think we had roughly thought that there is about $50 million of manufacturing synergies through purchasing power and so forth. Whether there will be more several years down the road, we\u2019ll just have to wait and see. But for now, I would call it about $50 million. And then, we expect there is probably another $100 million of OpEx synergies. There is a lot of early wins that we\u2019ve identified through the efforts and planning the integration, obviously the public company expenses. But there is a lot of things that we spend in terms of outside services and so forth that we don\u2019t need to spend two of. And so, I think we\u2019ll get some very quick cost savings out of that activity.","So, if anything, I think we\u2019re very positive. I would tell you that the other thing we talked about when we announced the acquisition was that we thought our tax, blended tax rate will be 19.5%. I think today, now, we believe that\u2019s more like 15%. So that actually pushes up the near-term accretion number from about 10% to probably about 15%. So, if anything, we\u2019re more optimistic about the near-term and incredibly optimistic about the long-term.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Ellis from B. Riley.","Craig Ellis","Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the excellent execution, guys. Just looking at the model, bottoms up and going back a bit to Ambrish\u2019s question. So, if my model is correct, not only did you have record margins in the quarter but auto and industrial also had record quarters. And as I look at the outlook, the 13% midpoint year-on-year growth, relative to ADI\u2019s history and global GDP growth, I think we\u2019d typically look at the analog industry growing at a 2 to 2.5 times multiple of global GDP growth. You are growing at four times that. So, as we look at the business and where it is now and the early pay-off in some of the platform investments the Company has made, are we seeing the Company start to move into a phase where its growth rate relative to its own history and relative to the industry is now at a nice premium to what we would have seen in the post Lehmann and even pre-Lehmann periods?","Vincent Roche ","Yes. I think firstly, you\u2019ve got to take growth over a longer period of time, it\u2019s a longer integral.0 But, yes, as I\u2019ve said, what makes me very optimistic about things is that we are innovating like never before and we\u2019re solving big meaningful problems of greater impact. And our customer relationships are such that I think we\u2019re very, very well-positioned to be able to partner with them to really uncover what they believe to be the most intractable challenges, both in terms of their innovation and their commercial impact. So, yes, I think we are innovating in a way that gives us tremendous opportunity for growth. And as I said, we\u2019ve got the customers with us. So, I think I would expect -- we\u2019ve said that our long-term growth model is two to three times GDP. I think we\u2019re well positioned to at least deliver that organically. And as I said, when Ambrish asked the question earlier, we'll be updating our models over the coming couple of quarters, once we integrate LTC here. So, we'll give you more color and visibility.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.","Stacy Rasgon","I guess I also had a housekeeping question. Dave, you mentioned that you thought consumer would be down in the ballpark of 30% sequentially next quarter. But, just mathematically, that doesn't give me the B2B down mid single-digits, B2B specific items will be down more than that. So, were you just sort of rounding on the consumer number or is there something else going on within that?","Dave Zinsner","No, it's surrounding on the consumer number.","Stacy Rasgon","So, you expect it to be down more?","Dave Zinsner","A little bit more.","Stacy Rasgon","Got it. So, that\u2019s the housekeeping question, if I could ask the real question now. Just last year, you gave us a little bit of color on content increases for Apple and obviously the business consumer was down a little bit this year but not much with the content decrease offsetting the inventory reduction. What do you guys see for content increase on the next cycle for that product?","Dave Zinsner","I think it's too early to tell right now. I think we feel good about our content right now, whether there'll be any additional items, is I think difficult to say right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis","Actually just a follow-up there on the consumer side. The 30ish decline seems fairly normal, so just wondering if you can compare and contrast this year versus last year. And then, you have additional components, are you seeing any yield issues or anything else like you saw in this year or is it fairly smooth?","Dave Zinsner","Yes, we don't -- it's fairly smooth. I think what you saw kind of on a year-over-year basis, as we came down a little bit while increasing content. So, the driver of the opposite kind of force here was obviously the inventory build that happened last year that doesn't appear to be happening this year. So, it's kind of tracking as you would normally expect.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore","On the OpEx side of things, I realize you only have a couple of quarters left before Linear comes into equation. But, Dave, can you walk us through why you're guiding it up sequentially? If I look historically, I can't find the quarter in the last four, five years where it was actually up. And then, how do you plan to manage the organic OpEx up until that Linear integration?","Dave Zinsner","Well, I'll take the second question first which is very carefully -- I mean, we're not looking to build or add a lot of resources right now because we're going to inherit a lot of resources from Linear Tech and we want to optimize the combined workforce that we're going to have going forward. So, we're very, very, very cautiously managing OpEx, I would say, for the most part keeping headcount flat, maybe there's one or two people here or there that we do need to add for one reason or the other. There's a dynamic within our compensation plan -- variable compensation plan that makes this phenomena happen every so often. And that's a situation where on a year-over-year basis we have pretty meaningful growth which is a component of our variable comp. And so, while, as you point out, we do a pretty good job with the fixed expenses, bringing them down in the first quarter on a sequential basis, and generally the same thing happens with the variable compensation. In this particular quarter, that's not going to be the case because of the year-over-year component is going to actually drive a higher bonus payout. So, that\u2019s really the dynamic there. Otherwise, it would have been largely as you would have expected it to be managed in the first quarter.","Ali Husain","I think as you mentioned, Dave, in prepared remarks, the operating margin in the first quarter is still going to be I think in the midpoint around 32%, just pretty strong. I think we will have to go back five or six years to see those kinds of operating margins in the first quarter. Okay, good question. Next caller, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from David Wong with Wells Fargo.","David Wong","Your B2B segment, industrial, automotive, comms, they have all swung from year-over-year decline a couple of quarters ago to solid 6% to 7% growth in October. Sounds like your January comm guidance assumes about the same. Are you seeing any sub-segments of these accelerating or actually strengthening from that very good October level?","Dave Zinsner","I think they are all pretty much behaving, as you might expect. There are areas that we\u2019re obviously seeing the strength in general. Vince mentioned the healthcare space, clearly aerospace and defense business has been good. Areas around IoT that we focused on have done well. There are sub-segments of the auto space like ADAS and powertrains and so forth. Vince mentioned A2B platform that we have in auto for infotainment area. So, all those things are doing probably on the margin little bit better. But I would say it is a very, very broad based situation with the B2B space and pretty much every sub-segment is doing well.","Operator","Your next question is from Steve Smigie with Raymond James.","Steve Smigie","I was hoping to get some quick color on LIDAR opportunity. What do you see that opportunity for you guys as and what does your acquisition bring to the table versus some of the competition out there?","Vincent Roche","Yes, good question. So, basically, the technology we have required is liquid crystal optical wave guide technology. And it\u2019s a solid state approach to a very, very difficult problem, basically using a solid state approach to optical beam steering. That\u2019s critical if you are going to really push the resolution of LIDAR in future. And in contrast to other beam steering methods, for example like MEMS mirrors, the spinners that you\u2019ve seen running around highway 101, there are optical phase arrays. The technology we have acquired doesn\u2019t have any sensitivity to vibration for example. So technically, we have got great frame rates, no blind spots, and we can run them and we steer the beam as well.","So, this technology we believe puts us firmly on the LIDAR roadmap. And combined with our RADAR-based advanced driver systems technology at 24 and 77 gig really gives us two of the very critical technology modalities to enable not only greater safety which everybody craves in transportation but also puts us well on the path to enabling our customers to get closer to realizing autonomous driving as a major trend in the transportation sector. So that\u2019s essentially what we see. And it\u2019s a potentially beyond $1 billion semiconductor time for this thing for us. So, it could be potentially a wave. And that\u2019s why we bought the technology. It is reasonably early stage but with the technology is working, now we\u2019ve got to get it installed and make it work in the application.","Operator","And our next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein","Great, thanks for taking my question. I am hoping you can address the reasoning behind the greater optimism for revenue synergies. Specifically is this more of an inside out view when you sit down with engineers and think about the products that you might be able to deliver or is it more customer driven where you\u2019re hearing feedback that requests a combination of products, let\u2019s say?","Dave Zinsner","I would say it is a combination. Vince can add some color if he wants. But I would say, it\u2019s a combination of clearly the business units, call the engineering force and the business units do see opportunities for products that they could make that would be special. But I think a lot of it comes from just the sales force that the combined company looking at the other company\u2019s portfolio and looking at their jobs what they could do with those products in their geographies, their customers and so forth. I think that\u2019s really where we see a lot of kind of near side opportunities.","Vincent Roche","Yes. I think maybe as well in some -- particularly of the larger customers, there is an open door invitation to do more together with the portfolios that we have on hand as well as getting our engineering teams together to figure out how to create even more value in future together in terms of how we invest in R&D and apply it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the great execution and the recovery in the B2B segment. My question though is related to the consumer segment. And what is the right way to model that segment for the next two years? If you were in our shoes, would you model that segment to be flat, up or down? Just given the large influence of one of your customers in that segment, that\u2019s really hard to model that. So, I was just wondering how you would be modeling it if you were in our shoes? Thank you.","Vincent Roche","Well, from a topline perspective, I\u2019d say if we could get 10% growth compounded for the next few years in that business, we\u2019d be very, very satisfied.","Vivek Arya","But, do you see -- do you have visibility for that, Vince?","Vincent Roche","Well, look, you really have visibility into anything. I mean, we work hard on building great products; we\u2019re working very, very hard on deepening our penetration, not just in one customer but in several customers. It\u2019s a rapid cycle business as well. And things can change, markets can change, products can hit, not hit products; products get -- can even at the customer level be brought to market or cancelled. So as best we can tell, we\u2019re happy with the position we\u2019re in, in terms of the products and technology we have, the relationships we\u2019ve got with the critical customers in this space. So, I am optimistic that we can grow this business at the level I\u2019ve said, and time will tell. We don\u2019t know. We can\u2019t predict because also it\u2019s a market with relatively fickle customers on the other side of thing. But I think we\u2019re well positioned to pick the upside and that\u2019s pretty much what I\u2019ve got to say about it.","Dave Zinsner","I mean, one thing I would add is that we do track kind of the opportunity set. We certainly have the opportunities to do what Vince said. And it is a matter of markets and applications taking off and so forth. But from an opportunity perspective, we're optimistic about what we can do in the consumer space.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer","I guess, Vince, an earlier questioner rightly pointed out that within your B2B business, industrial and auto kind of established new all-time quarterly highs in the October quarter. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the communications sector, still about 40 million below peak revenue run rate a few years ago. I know not all of Hittite gets wrapped up the comps but especially given the success at least on the design side from the Hittite acquisition, I'm just kind of curious as how you view the outlook for the comps business. Why is that the business that's still kind of struggling relative to past ties and what are kind of the growth drivers you see from here?","Vincent Roche","Well, again, I think you've got to take a very long-term view to the consumer space. We have been playing in this business from 1G into 4G; we're helping our customers with 4.5G. We\u2019re at the early stages of helping them architect 5G technologies as well. It's an important market for ADI. And with Hittite, we're able to bring a level of completeness to our customer solutions. We're seeing the growth we expected out of Hittite that we had thought was there. We're getting the growth. We're well-positioned with our customers. And we're grinding out results in 4G. I think we're getting share in 4G. And on some of the older technologies, some of the 2.5, 3G technologies, clearly, there's price erosion, which offsets to some extent the growth that we got on 4G. But, I think the customers are facing increasingly difficult challenges in this space. We're helping them solve them at an increasing level of sophistication.","So, it's a way for the future. And we'll grind out the results quarter-by-quarter, year-by-year. And I think as I said, we're in an increasingly good position to gain share in the space, particularly as we begin to push our products as well towards single chip radio solutions in future. So, I think there're very few companies standing in the radio who can build a sustainable business for the long term and ADI will be right at the top of that stack.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Caso with CLSA.","Chris Caso","I wondered if you could talk about what you consider to be normal seasonality for the April quarter. And I ask because last year was the first quarter of the substantial revenues from the consumer segment but that was undergoing the inventory adjustment. If we normalize for the inventory adjustment, what would your expectations be for normal April?","Dave Zinsner","It\u2019s a good question, Chris. We're kind of in new territory. So, I'll take a crack at it but don't hold me to it. I would expect, as is typical, the industrial and automotive sectors to have pretty good sequential growth. I think the industrial sector usually has about 10% and usually the automotive sector is a little bit below 10% but they're both pretty strong. Comms will do what it does; it's more cyclical than seasonal I think in most cases. And then, the consumer business which is the big wild card, I am going to guess that it\u2019s down probably the same kind of level sequentially as it was in the first quarter, probably in the 30% plus or minus or something like that in the second quarter again and of course will have rebound after that in the third and fourth quarter as it seasonally does. But it\u2019s hard to say but that will be my guess.","Operator","Your next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari","Great, thanks for taking my question and congrats on a very strong quarter. I had a question on your incremental gross margins. I think for the October quarter on a year-over-year basis, most of your revenue growth dropped through to the gross margin line. And also for the January quarter, if we take the midpoint of your revenue and gross margin guide, again, I think close to 90% or 100% of your revenue growth is dropping through the bottom line. So, I guess, I am curious, is this just product mix or are there other factors that play here? Thank you.","Dave Zinsner","Yes. I think drop-through works when there isn\u2019t a lot of like a changes going on around working capital and so forth. And I think that kind of masking things a bit. Like for example in the fourth quarter, as I talked about, we had this inventory release which drove up the gross margin. So, you have to kind of strip that away before you even look at it. And then in the first quarter, we are -- because we normally have this kind of utilization decline in the first quarter, we are not going to have that because of such of the really good discipline we had through the year this year in terms of inventory management; it\u2019s a utilization level that\u2019s kind of atypical for us. So, I am not sure drop-through is the best way to look at it. It\u2019s more a function of, at least in the first quarter, it\u2019s a more function of utilization levels. And they are going to be in the mid to high 60s. And that\u2019s going to be really beneficial relative to where we were last year, at this time, which is kind of unusual for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from CJ Muse with Evercore.","CJ Muse","I was hoping to revisit the earlier comments regarding a 10% CAGR for consumer. If you look at your top customer in that bucket, I think 13% of your total revs in fiscal 2016 that would imply your other consumer business decline about 25% year-on-year. So, curious, the 10% CAGR, is that a reflection of your vision to rising content as you have very large customer there or is it reflection of seeing greater breadth with other consumer customers as you look out over the next one, two, three years?","Vincent Roche","Well, I think it\u2019s a combination of all of the above. It\u2019s a long term projection. As I said, we have certainly got the customer engagements. We have got the technologies and products. And I think we are solving problems that really matter. So, what I am indicating is that to my mind it\u2019s probably more of a how the market performs than individual, if you like dynamics around engagements and individual customer. So, it's really more about the market. So, I think what we are talking about is a long-term expectation. We are investing at a rate that should enable us to get those kind of growth rates. I will say as well that we have funded our B2B business; I mean, we are spending more than 90% of the Company's R&D on our B2B businesses to make sure that we drive growth and capture the opportunity that\u2019s available to us in those sectors. So, we\u2019re all the time making trade-offs and investment between the various applications in the B2B area. And we are very carefully picking up the vital few opportunities in consumer where we think our technology makes an enormous difference to the user experience.","Ali Husain","Just a clarification, the outside of the portables business within consumer, so outside of portables consumer was up sequentially and was about stable to the prior year. Okay, next question?","Operator","Next question comes from Romit Shah with Instinet.","Romit Shah","Yes, hi. Just regarding the merger, it sounds like early indications are good. But one of the things that\u2019s come up is just employee retention, something to that extent was mentioned in the proxy. And one of the -- for some of us who have followed Linear over the years know that it\u2019s kind of a different culture West Coast company. So, I am just curious, how are you guys incentivizing the Linear people to stay at the organization? And Dave, as we put our merger models together, should we assume that OpEx and stock comp sort of step up on a like-for-like basis after the deal closes?","Dave Zinsner","Well, we do have our retention plan in place for them. So, near-term, we\u2019re not too worried about it. But I would tell you that my own view on this, since I can probably opine is that engineers stay with the company or come to a company based on what they are doing and whether they are doing exciting things and have granted the opportunity to work on really difficult problems and do amazing things. And that\u2019s the environment we intend to create for both the ADI and Linear Tech engineers. So, I am not particularly worried about it. Our compensation plan in the near-term for ADI and Linear Tech people is to maintain what both of them have. Over time, they will be how homogenized but I think in a way that we wouldn\u2019t see a negative impact of.","Vincent Roche","Yes, I\u2019ll just add a little more color to what Dave has said, Romit. I spend a lot of time as many of our leaders have with the LTC engineering community, the business community, the operations community and we share a very similar view of the world. We understand our each others\u2019 businesses very, very well. We share a very similar value system, how we believe value gets created and captured. And I think there is tremendous excitement by the way, all through both companies incidentally about how we can combine the complementary technology suites of both companies to do really marvelous things in future.","As Dave said earlier that our sales forces are really jumping at the bid to get the two bags, for the ADI people to get the LT power bag and the LT says people to get the ADI mix signal bag and really capture the opportunity that we think is a available to both of us over the next three to four years. And I think as Dave said, a part of retention is a sense of equity and fair treatment in terms of compensation. And we pay a lot of attention to that. But the soft side of the adventure that people can undertake here and work together to do amazing things into the future, solving really critical meaningful problems of the world, that\u2019s what people want to do. And I will tell you as well, we pay lot of attention to retention. And I'm pleased to say that things are very, very stable on both sides of the fence.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ian Ing with MKM Partners.","Ian Ing","You mentioned pricing efficiencies helping gross margins year-over-year, looking for color on that. You've a pretty capable team in place now and for a while you've been -- I've been assuming you have been posting by value of solutions?","Dave Zinsner","I mean it's basically that. I mean we're -- as Vince mentioned I think in one of the questions, we're increasingly putting more and more robust technology in the products, some cases algorithms, some cases other software, some cases it's just hardware but it's just really solving a really challenging problem. And what we do is work to try to get commensurate price for that value that we create. And not surprisingly in a big organization, sometimes a little bit of that slips through the cracks. And what we've been doing over the last three years is plugging those holes. And so, we're not looking to gouge our customers by any means, we're looking to find the right optimal level of price per value and that\u2019s what we do every day. I think we've done increasingly a better job at that over time.","Operator","Your next question is from Harsh Kumar with Stephens.","Harsh Kumar","On that answer you gave, there seems to be some trend amongst semiconductor companies that they can actually get paid very well for what they're doing. Historically, it's always been downward pricing but now, I think some of the companies are trying to raise prices and maybe get paid fairly. I'm curious, you mentioned, you touched upon in the previous answer, but I'm curious where your philosophy is as a company with that and how much of an impact did pricing have in margins for the last quarter?","Dave Zinsner","So, I think, Harsh, I would say that some companies who have been drifting into the 40s and maybe very low 50s in terms of gross margin, they got to get a whole new kind of philosophy in place for pricing. I mean, we already had 60 plus percent gross margin, so we were actually pretty good at executing a strategy around this. It was more just cleaning up a little bit around the edges where we probably weren't executing as well. Hard to put a number on it for the quarter. I would say though that on the average over the last say four years, our ASPs are probably up 30%, 40% probably. So, it's obviously been a pretty big impact in terms of our gross margins.","Operator","Your next question is from Cody Acree with Drexel Hamilton.","Cody Acree","Maybe just any more color that you could give on the wireline business, and you made some comments about strength you're seeing in 100 gig?","Vincent Roche","So, we have a reasonably significant business in the optical space and providing precision measurement and control for the various parts of the optical system. So, it's grown well for the Company over several years. And I think as the need for data center, infrastructure build-out continues and medium and long-haul, backhaul connectivity continues to be pressured, we see it as a good bet for the future and probably at the higher end of the spectrum of growth that we've put into our model.","Operator","And our last question comes from Stephen Chin with UBS.","Stephen Chin","I had a quick question on wireless infrastructures. I know that was down in the quarter. Was that broad-based softness in that business or were there any pockets of the positive demand? And also related to that, how would you characterize the current I guess level of rollout 4G and 4.5G overall, are there any more greenfield or upgrade opportunity left around the world in next couple of years? Thanks.","Vincent Roche","Yes. So, I guess in the quarter the macro base station and the backhaul were down for the quarter. Our small selectivity was up. I think China is reasonably strong. And our transceiver pipeline by the way across the board, not just in base station technology but across the board is continuing to build a nice pipeline of opportunity. And also, we are converting a pipeline into decent revenue. I think we are still in the reasonably -- I mean 4G is going to be around for a long, long time to come. The largest part of the world by the way is still on 2G, 2.5G and 3G networks. So, 4G will have a long life ahead of it. And as I said, we will be grinding out share gains there in an increasingly thinning atmosphere here, if you like in terms of suppliers. 5G is on its way. As I said, we\u2019re in the earlier stages of helping our customers to architect 5G solutions. But I think it\u2019s going to be many, many years out yet. So, I think it will be -- I don\u2019t expect to see capital deployments and the carriers change an awful lot. So, I think it will be a slow and steady increase in the build out of 4G. And I think that will be the environment till we get the 5G and see another specific step function ramp here.","Ali Husain","Alright, thanks Stephen. It looks like it's the end of the call. We had a good quarter. The deal here for Linear Tech continues to stay on track, progressing well here for close. Inventory, as Dave has talked about, is in great shape, gives us good gross margin leverage going into 2017. Our business is now showing some really good momentum, especially in the B2B markets. You guys saw the results of some pretty some operational execution this quarter with our free cash flow margins up pretty significantly. So, we appreciate you guys calling in. And we\u2019ll look to talk to you soon. Thanks. Happy Thanksgiving.","Vincent Roche","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's Analog Devices conference call.

[Operator Instructions] Mr. Husain, you may begin your conference.","Ali Husain","Great. Thanks, Rachel. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Ali Husain, Director of Investor Relations. If listeners haven't yet seen our third quarter FY '13 press release or our Form 10-Q, they can be found on ADI's Investor Relations website at investor.analog.com, and this conference call can also be accessed from the same page.","A recording of this conference call will be available within 2 hours of this call's completion. It will remain available via telephone playback for 2 weeks and will also be archived in our Investor Relations website. We've also updated the financial schedules on the IR website, which include the historical quarterly and annual summary P&Ls for continuing operations, as well as for revenue from continuing operations by end market and product type.","Participating with me in today's call are Vincent Roche, ADI's President and CEO; Dave Zinsner, Vice President of Finance and CFO; and Maria Tagliaferro, Director of Corporate Communications. During the first part of the call, Vince and Dave will present our third quarter FY '13 results as well as our short-term outlook. The second part of our call will be devoted to answering questions from our analysts and investor participants.","During today's call, we may refer to non-GAAP financial measures that have been adjusted for certain nonrecurring items in order to provide investors with useful information regarding our results.

Therefore, this conference call will include time-sensitive information that may be accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, which is today, August 20, 2013.","And so with that, I'll turn the call over to Vincent Roche, ADI's President and CEO, for his opening remarks.","Vincent T. Roche","Thanks very much, Ali, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. As you've seen from our press release, our revenue totaled $674 million, which was up 2% from the prior quarter. This sequential revenue growth, coupled with strong gross margins at relatively low levels of factory utilization and disciplined OpEx control resulted in diluted EPS of $0.57 per share excluding special items. This represents a 10% sequential growth in diluted earnings per share. These are solid overall results with our sales performance above the midpoint of our guidance and our earnings results above the high end of the range we have provided last quarter.","Order rates strengthened through the quarter across all of our end markets, which was a welcome result, especially when considering that our third quarter includes the month of July, which is traditionally the time for summer vacations and plant shutdowns, particularly in North America and Europe. By end market, both industrial and communications infrastructure revenue grew sequentially in the third quarter, led by the communications sector, which turned in a significantly better performance than we had planned.","Now I'll go into some more detail on our performance by market segment. Firstly, communications infrastructure grew 12% sequentially and represented 21% of total sales. Sales to our wireless infrastructure customers drove most of the upside as China launched the last phase of its 3G TD-SCDMA network buildout and carriers in the U.S. gradually began to move towards densification of the 4G LTE networks while continuing to increase their coverage footprint. Sales to all of our major OEM customers for wireless infrastructure were up in the third quarter.","As you know, 3G systems are highly penetrated in the wireless infrastructure network, and in order to meet the steep demand for mobile data, operators in most geographies are in the transition phase to 4G systems. Operators in China and the U.S. have declared their intent to step up 4G LTE deployments in 2014 following examples of LTE deployments in Korea and Japan. ADI is well positioned to capitalize on our wide range of high performance radio transceiver products and solutions, given our penetration levels at key customers, particularly in the densification phase.","Our wireline business also grew sequentially as customers in this sector in the U.S. and China accelerated the move from 10G and 40G to 100G optical systems to satisfy the burgeoning demand for data coming from cloud connectivity and from backhaul connections in wireless base station systems. ADI's focus in wired applications is primarily around timing and control of the signal in optical and cable infrastructure systems, where the engineering challenge requires very high performance timing and precision signal processing, which is particularly complex at 100GB speeds.","We deliver a wide range of products and solutions to address short-range, high-speed enterprise and metro-wide area network system monitoring and control needs. In the short to medium term, we see strong possibilities to further our growth in this area. We also saw growth from our industrial business, which was up 1% in the third quarter after growing 11% in the second, and this end market represented 47% of our overall sales.","Now I'd like to point out that excluding a sequential decrease in the defense and aerospace business, our industrial business actually grew 3% sequentially. Delays in U.S. government programs in the defense and aerospace sector offset growth in our broad and diversified industrial customer base, where we sold thousands of products to thousands of customers in areas such as process control, factory automation and instrumentation where our customers value ADI's products for their reliability, ruggedness and long life cycles.","The varied applications within industrial share a common need for increased measurement capability, intelligence and connectivity, as well as an underlying drive for improvements in energy efficiency, all of which require ADI's high-performance signal processing technology. We've increased our R&D and customer engagement investments in the industrial sector, and we are confident that industrial can continue to contribute significant long-term sustainable growth to ADI in the future.","Automotive revenue, after showing very strong performance in the prior quarter, was virtually flat in the third and up 5% over the same quarter last year. At the current quarterly run rate, automotive has grown to represent an almost $500 million annual business for ADI. The automotive industry premium brands are traditionally the drivers of innovation, and it's here that ADI's technology is especially strong. These brands value ADI's strength along the entire signal chain in centers, signal conditioning, data converters and DSPs, enabling them to deliver more efficient engines, intelligent collision avoidance and mitigation systems and in-cabin infotainment systems. Overall we continue to be very well placed to take advantage of the increasing electronic content and demand for ever-increasing performance in vehicles to meet both government and consumer demand for a safer, cleaner, more enjoyable driving experience.","And finally, our consumer business was approximately flat to last quarter, and it represented 15% of sales evenly divided across 3 main application areas: portable media, prosumer audio video and digital imaging and computing. Each of these application areas was approximately flat sequentially. Within these application areas, we focus on the high end of these markets where our user experience challenges arise when people interact with electronics through sound, images, video motion and touch.","So across all of our end markets, customers increasingly rely on ADI to sell the most complex signal processing challenges. This has been the case for decades, and we are investing to make sure that it will continue to be the case long into the future as we secure the signal processing growth opportunities in our established markets, as well as in new emerging applications created by such mega trends as Big Data, cloud connectivity and energy efficiency.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Dave, who will take you through some of the details of our financial results.","David A. Zinsner","Thanks, Vince, and good afternoon, everyone. Third quarter revenue increased 2% sequentially and declined 1% year-over-year to $674 million. Our gross margin was 64.5% in the third quarter. This was up 50 basis points from the second quarter on slightly higher factory utilization in the third quarter compared to the second quarter.","Factory utilization remains low at mid-60% in the third quarter compared to approximately 60% in the second quarter. At the same time, inventory on our balance sheet decreased by $14.6 million, and days of inventory fell to 109 days in the third quarter compared to 115 days in the prior quarter. At 109 days of inventory, we're now within our model of 100 to 110 days.","Inventory at distribution on a days\u2019 basis was just a bit above 7.5 weeks, up slightly from the prior quarter and below our model of 8 weeks. Low inventories and low utilization levels set us up for strong gross margin leverage as the macroeconomic recovery continues to slowly unfold. Our plan is to tweak utilization rates slightly higher in the fourth quarter, which should keep our days of inventory approximately flat to the third quarter levels. Lead times for our direct OEM customers remain similar to last quarter and are in good control with virtually all of our shipments to OEMs occurring within 4 weeks.","Total end customer orders, which include both direct and distribution customers, increased in the third quarter compared to the second quarter, and our book-to-bill was 1. As Vince described, overall order patterns improved throughout the quarter and across all our end markets, showing momentum exiting this quarter.","Operating expenses as a percent of sales were lower in the third quarter by about 50 basis points, showing the good leverage in our model. In dollar terms, exclusive -- excluding special items in the prior quarter, operating expenses increased slightly from $224.5 million to $226.7 million in the third quarter. Operating profit before tax for the third quarter were $208.3 million or 30.9% of sales. This was about 100 basis points higher than the prior quarter's 30% of sales, excluding any special items.","Other expense of $13.3 million included $10.2 million related to the extinguishment of our note due in 2014. Excluding this item, our net interest expense was approximately $3 million. During the quarter, we issued a $500 million bond at a sub 3% rate for the next 10 years. As a result, our ongoing net interest expense is estimated to be approximately $4 million per quarter.","Our third quarter tax rate was 11.7%, excluding special items, which was lower than the prior quarter's 16.5%. The lower rate was due to a change in estimates of our future tax liabilities and a few discrete tax items. We expect our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter to be in the range of 14% to 15%. We also estimate our fiscal 2014 tax rate to also be in the range of 14% to 15%.","Diluted earnings per share of $0.57, excluding special items, was above the high end of our guidance and up 10% from the prior quarter. Cash flow in the third quarter continued to be very strong. We generated 33% of our revenue or $220 million in operating cash flow. Capital expenditures were $30 million, resulting in free cash flow of $190 million or 28% of revenue. Our cash and short-term investments balance increased by $278 million during the third quarter and now stands at $4.5 billion, with $1.3 billion available domestically. At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately 87 -- $870 million in debt outstanding.","Our accounts receivable balance was up $11.5 million compared to the prior quarter on higher overall shipments in this quarter, and our days sales outstanding increased by 1 day to 47 days. Deferred income on shipments to distributors increased by 7% as a result of a modest increase of inventory and distribution and the addition of a distributor in North America. And as I stated, weeks of inventory and distribution remain below our model of 8 weeks. Our revenue recognition policy is to recognize 100% of our distribution revenue only when our distributors sell out to the end customers.","During the third quarter, we returned approximately $105 million to our shareholders through cash dividends. On August 19, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.34 per outstanding share of common stock, which will be paid on September 11, 2013, to all shareholders of record as of August 30, 2013. At the current stock price, this dividend represents an annual yield of approximately 3%.","In May, we committed to drive shareholder return even higher. We'll accomplish this by increasing our free cash flow payout from a historical average of about 60% to an average of 80% over the next 8 years. Although quarter-to-quarter, we'll likely be above or below the 80% payout, our plan is to have average an 80% payout at the end of that 5-year period.","In summary, the third quarter delivered solid results for ADI. Our operating model turned a 2% sequential increase in revenue into a 10% sequential increase in non-GAAP diluted EPS at what still remains at very low utilization levels. We have plenty of leverage ahead as sales increase, factory utilizations improve from our current levels, and we continue to control our operating expenses.","And so now I'll turn the call back over to Vince, who will discuss the outlook for the fourth quarter.","Vincent T. Roche","Thanks, Dave. As we look into the fourth quarter, it appears that world economies are stabilizing, at least at the margins, and some regions are beginning to see some growth. These are positive signs that should benefit ADI to the extent they translate into higher capital spend, which is particularly important to ADI's industrial and communications businesses. End customer bookings are showing momentum, and inventories remain lean across both direct customers and in the channel, leading us to be cautiously optimistic about a disciplined recovery.","Looking at the fourth quarter by end market, we expect continued gradual growth in orders in line with end demand in the industrial markets. For automotive, we are also expecting modest growth. Communications infrastructure should also be up as 3G and 4G deployments continue in most regions of the world. In consumer, secular and cyclical factors will counterbalance, and we expect a more meaningful impact in our consumer business from new product cycles in FY '14.","In total, we expect our revenues to be in the range of $675 million to $700 million and up from the $674 million in the prior quarter. Our utilization rate should improve modestly, expanding gross margins by approximately 50 basis points. In addition, we are continuing to control operating expenses to generate operating margin leverage as sales improve. Based on these assumptions, we expect our diluted earnings in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $0.55 to $0.61.","Throughout ADI, from engineering and manufacturing to customer support and sales, we are relentlessly driving our ability to distinguish sustainable innovation from fleeting leadership. There are many signal processing markets to be served in the years ahead, and our success will be based on how well companies can align technical innovation and market insights. We are working hard to optimize our portfolio, picking the right spots in the right markets at the right levels of investment, with good profitability and strong sustainable growth potential. We are engaged, and I believe we're stronger than ever and we will continue to drive returns higher for our shareholders in the future.","Ali Husain","Great. Thank you, Vince. [Operator Instructions] With that operator, we're now ready for questions from tonight's participants.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Steve Smigie from Raymond James.","Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","As we look out to the guidance, it looks like you're guiding a little bit better than seasonal. The guide seems to be a little bit lower than the Street. So I'm just curious, if you could frame the guidance here in terms of do you see the guidance as being positive because you're ahead of seasonal, or was there some surprise, maybe, on the short -- on the softer side that made you guide less than the Street here?","David A. Zinsner","So I think we're guiding generally kind of seasonal as you look around. I mean, it's hard to -- the problem is the cycles overshadow anything that happens in the seasonal side of things. So -- and for the most part, as we kind of read through the tea leaves, this is generally what we would expect in terms of seasonality. I would say that one area that we do typically see a little bit of a seasonal ramp in is the consumer business. And just because of the way the product cycles are now flowing, it looks like it's going to be less about seasonality and more about product cycles, and we think the upward momentum on the product cycle is going to probably happen in 2014. The guide -- what the Street comes up with is their own predictions of what's going to happen. We feel pretty good about the guidance. The industrial business has shown some momentum, and had good results in the second quarter, continue to grow in the third quarter, albeit a little bit weighted down by the defense business. But other than that, all the other businesses were doing really well, and it looks like it's going to be up again in the fourth quarter. So we think that that's a good sign for kind of a slow, methodical kind of recovery in our broader business. We also expect automotive to come back. It was a little bit down this quarter after a really big second quarter, coming back again in the third quarter. That seems to be positive. And then the SIP-er [ph] business probably was the one that surprised us the most this quarter on the good side because we do start to -- we are starting to see some spending by the carriers to build out their networks. And that looks like it's going to continue into the fourth quarter, and we haven't even really seen the ramp from some of these deployments for 4G in China that are on the comm. So this is, I think, a pretty good guide for the fourth quarter and sets us up pretty nicely for next year. And as I talked about on my prepared remarks, as we start to see this recovery, we'll start to see utilization come back in our factories. That's going to be good on the gross margin side, and we're doing a good job, I think, company-wide in controlling expenses and making sure those expenses don't grow at a rate that's out of line with what we want to do in terms of leverage. So everything seems pretty good.","Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Great. And just as my follow-up, on your point about gross margin, as you said, you've been marching your gross margin up, your utilization improved and it seems like there's a lot of room for utilization to fill up still. How should we think about the gross margin opportunity relative to last cycle? So you said that you expect to have a higher gross margin this cycle than in the past. What's the magnitude of that difference at this point, do you think?","David A. Zinsner","Well, obviously it depends on how the revenue behaves over the course of the next several quarters. But our utilization right now is at about 6 -- I think we ran around 65%. We'll tweak it up into the high 60s next quarter. Ultimately, when the engine is really moving along, our utilization gets up into the 80s. So from a move from -- into the 60s to a move into the 80s in terms of utilization, that generally drives a couple hundred basis points of improvement right there in gross margins. Mix usually goes in our favor as well. So I think it's hard to call the exact gross margin number because it's somewhat dependent on what quarter we're talking about and where the mix is and what have you. But I feel pretty good about the fact that we're going to get into the range of where we were before, and we have good opportunity to do a bit better than that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo Bank.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","What proportion of revenues today come from products made in foundries and do you have a target for the range in which you expect external manufacturing to run?","David A. Zinsner","So the external right now is running in kind of the low 50s as a percent of our total revenue. I wouldn't say that we have a particular target. It has been in kind of that zip code for probably since I started here, which was in 2009. So we try to -- we have a kind of a balanced approach. We have this big, broad industrial business. A good portion of that is manufactured internally, and we continue to make investments in those areas. So my expectation is that will grow in line with the top line growth. And so I think you'd expect that the percentage of external versus internal is roughly going to remain pretty similar to where we are today.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Great. And are you seeing any signs of pricing firming as demand improves?","David A. Zinsner","Well, the Analog market is one of those markets where we never really see the price being unfirm, if I can coin a phrase. So it's pretty stable, and it's been pretty stable for -- through this entire cycle. So could it get better? I guess, it could get better, but it's actually in a pretty good shape today.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A question on the consumer side. You mentioned that you have some offsetting things going on in October, and then you said the growth would resume in 2014. Dave, were you alluding to that the timing of some of those product launches mean the January quarter of 2014, or were you talking about more of a full year guide?","David A. Zinsner","It was more of a full year, although we do expect kind of a pretty steady ramp through 2014.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can you talk about what's driving that ramp either from a product side, end customer type, et cetera?","Vincent T. Roche","Well, Ross, we've been, over the last 3 or 4 years, we've been changing the investment portfolio very much in the consumer space. We've been steering R&D more into industrial communications infrastructure and automotive areas and utilizing our spend in the consumer area much more wisely. So in the past, where we were supporting applications in areas like home entertainment, TV, for example, and we had a pretty sizable business at one point in time there in the camera space, we have really taken the spending down in those areas for a number of reasons, I think we've explained to you before, and concentrated our R&D primarily in what we think are very good audio, imaging and sensor applications that really make the difference in the portable media area. So it's primarily in that space that we expect to see the improvements in revenue growth in the coming year.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So would that be enough -- because for the last couple of years, that segment has been a bit of a headwind year-over-year. Is that enough where you think that the segment could actually grow in fiscal '14 over '13?","Vincent T. Roche","Yes, I think whatever happens in the end markets, we're positioned to actually take some share. There are some new application areas arising where we have some unique technologies. So we will -- I think we're pretty well-penetrated, and we're in good position to grow with the programs that we've chosen.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess my last quick question is on the OpEx side of things. Dave, you've done a good job of controlling that and keeping it tight in a slow growth environment. As we look into fiscal '14 and beyond, how should we think about how OpEx grows relative to revenue? And maybe specifically, how much of the OpEx is variable versus fixed?","David A. Zinsner","Yes, so we're trying to maintain kind of the similar discipline quarter in, quarter out where as revenue grows, we try to grow OpEx at roughly kind of half the rate. And we've done, I think, a pretty good job this quarter, and we're expecting to do around that kind of model for our next quarter. I think as we go into 2014, we're going to pretty much take a similar approach. And I mean, the variable component could be a bit of a lift to OpEx. There's no doubt about it, but most of this OpEx is really within our control. So I don't see any reason why we would break our discipline next year in terms of managing the OpEx.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Aashish Rao from Bank of America.","Aashish Rao - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Vince, the automotive sales this year appear to be trending towards low single-digit growth in fiscal year '13, well below the double-digit growth you've seen for the last several years. One would've expected content growth to outpace any sluggishness. At a high level -- I mean, what's causing this deceleration in sales growth in automotive?","Vincent T. Roche","Yes, I think -- I mean, over the past 5 or 6 years, we've been able to grow in the mid-teens kind of area. We'll grow again this year, as you say, at a slightly lower level. I think in the third quarter in particular, we were hit with some sluggish sales of cars in the European market. But we track very, very carefully the programs by customer, by region, by technology, by market segment. And I think we're in very, very good shape. I think what you're seeing is just a very, very short term anomaly, for want of a better expression, but in the longer term, we're positioned very, very well. There's an excellent match between our technology and what our customers are telling us they need. ADI is very much viewed as a leader in innovation in ways that make the car greener, more efficient and more enjoyable for consumers. And we've also, by the way, been working. As you've probably seen, we did an announcement with Audi there a couple of months ago, where we're working to find new ways of innovation in the automotive area as well with the car manufacturers themselves. So we're bullish about the long term. I think we see a very bright future and that we can grow this business, at least in the foreseeable future, in the double-digits area.","Ali Husain","Aashish, Do you have a follow-up?","Aashish Rao - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, just a follow-up on the consumer business again. In the last couple of Octobers, you've seen a $15 million to $30 million bump up followed by a seasonal decline in January. This year, you're guiding sales flat due to the product transition and product cycle issues. I know you're not providing Jan guidance, but should we expect a seasonal drop in January before the steady sequential growth resumes in fiscal year '14?","David A. Zinsner","I would tell you that a lot of our business now is not necessarily seasonal. We have a big prosumer business that generally stays pretty solid through the entire year. And the portables business has now become more about when OEMs launch their products and not necessarily around where some of the consumer products that we had been in the past were more tied to a kind of a Christmas or back-to-school period. That's no longer the case here. So what -- without giving any specific guidance, I'd tell you that the cyclicality, both on the ups and the downs probably won't be as significant quarter-to-quarter on a go-forward basis is my best estimate.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley.","Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just following up on inventory. From a weeks\u2019 basis, it looks like it's still below your target in distribution, yet the deferred income ticked up a bit. So just really want to get a sense of kind of the message you're hearing from distributors and kind of how they see this recovery playing out?","David A. Zinsner","Yes, so inventory at distribution was, I guess, probably in kind of the low 7-week kind of range last quarter. It's now in kind of the upper 7-week range this quarter. So it trended up, which of course drove a bit of an increase in inventory at distribution, which followed on to give us a little bit of an increase on the deferred income line of our deferred income line of our balance sheet. Those all kind of tie together. It's still like you said, below the 8-week range. So we feel comfortable that they aren't building inventory out of line with their demand. We hope that this is -- and this generally does follow a good sign in terms of what their end customers' order patterns are in the next few quarters. So we hope that us pushing them plus their own desire to get the inventory up is a result of the fact that they believe that they're going to see some increased order flow in the next few quarters, and so they want to have the inventory ready to go for that purpose. The other thing, as I think I mentioned in the prepared remarks, is that we did add a distributor and that does sometimes creates some anomalies within the deferred income line because you're just adding somebody without any follow-on revenue at that point. So that does drive a little bit of an anomaly. And then the other thing that we did notice in distribution was the mix of our products was a bit better this quarter on the shelves versus in prior quarters. So some of it isn't actually unit volume growth, but more about the profitability of the inventory at distribution, that being up a bit, and so that drove a little bit of the deferred income. So I think as you look at the deferred balance sheet item, you want to take away anything from it. I think that it's in very good shape. I think we've done a very good job managing the disties, and part of that is that we keep lead times so short so they don't have to necessarily worry about ramping inventories beyond what they should. And I think it's in a healthy situation right now.","Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And then as my follow-up, for Vince, you guys spoke a little bit about the consumer market, which is a small market here. I was hoping to get, into fiscal '14 as you look more broadly at that portfolio, what you see is most promising for growth drivers in fiscal '14.","Vincent T. Roche","Yes, I think as Dave pointed out, we have a steady base business that is like an annuity based on a lot of different products and different applications, typically driven by performance in the prosumer, like things like broadcast space, for example. So we'll get some growth out of that. I think the areas -- as I've mentioned, we're in -- we've been in transition in terms of our investments in consumer over the past few years and steering R&D more into portable media applications. So we're developing a very good position in some of the audio signal chains in things like tablets, phones and so on and so forth. We've got a good position in the camera control systems, for example, in many of these complex, space-constrained applications, and some new sensor technologies as well, such as gesture that we're bringing into play for some of the touch-oriented applications there. So we expect to see during '14 that we'll build up some good cadence there in terms of revenue growth in that particular sector, driven by portable media applications.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Danely from JPMorgan.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Quick question, Dave. So you mentioned your utilization rates are now at 65%. Do you remember in previous cycles where your gross margins were when your utilization rates were in about the same range?","David A. Zinsner","Well, it depends on the cycle you're talking about. You go far enough back and our gross margins were probably in the high 50s probably. So yes, this is incrementally or significantly better at similar utilization levels.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I have a follow-up question. You guys continue to have a very nice cash balance. You've seen some of your competitors go the M&A route. I'm just wondering what the latest and greatest thoughts are on acquisitions or M&A to either drive revenue growth or enhance the product portfolio at ADI?","David A. Zinsner","Yes, I think for us, M&A has been all about -- when we've done it, it's been about acquiring technologies that we think are important to our customers down the road, where we think that the ROI case can be made better to do it externally than internally. And so those are areas where we usually make M&A bets. So it tends to be what, I guess, you would define as tuck-in acquisitions. They're generally smaller shops with a product at some period of evolution, usually in one of the early stages. We need that technology to augment what we're doing internally, and we acquire it and usually we acquire it with relatively low proceeds upfront and a lot of earn out on the back end, assuming we get the performance that we expect. I don't think that it dramatically changes from here. We've always looked at M&A, and we want to utilize our -- what we think is a superior balance sheet to our advantage, but we also think we've got a lot of opportunities internally with what we're developing to drive the growth rate and -- based on some of the things that Vince talked about earlier. And so I think that will be our primary means of growth going forward.","Vincent T. Roche","I think, Chris, just to add a couple of comments to what Dave has said, we've always viewed philosophically M&A as something that must enhance the capability of the company first and foremost. And something that 3, 5 years down the road that our customers are looking at the combined technology of what ADI has had organically with the acquired technology and they look at that and say, this is a much more powerful entity and a much more powerful technology story for them from their standpoint. So that's the thesis going ahead.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terence Whalen of Citi Bank.","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","This one is actually a question on the medical segment within your industrial business. I was wondering if you could help us understand the size of that business. And what's really going to have to occur either from a regulatory perspective or a customer perspective for that business to really begin accelerating beyond the 6% of sales or so level and when you think that might occur over the next several years?","Vincent T. Roche","You answered your [ph] question [indiscernible]. It's around 6% or 7%. We follow modest investments in there. Our business is very largely imaging-oriented, and we've been investing, over the past few years, to really build some bigger-in-scope solutions around the imaging space, particularly in areas like CT and things like digital x-ray. There's a new modality there in digital x-ray where we have a tremendously wide design win base with all the key players there in Japan, Asia and the U.S. in particular. And we're starting to see the first signs that these units are going into production right now in digital x-ray. So that will be a long life cycle business and it's in, really, the stage of early infancy at the present time. My sense is it's always a business, of course, that has a lot of regulatory impact to it. But we're seeing a lot of excitement around some of the sensing and vital signs monitoring type technologies. We have that again, will cross the boundaries between probably some consumer-ish, high-end consumer applications as well as kind of new business models that are emerging to take advantage of the cloud that will aggregate a lot of data from human sensing devices. So I think we've a good mix of exploratory things like vital signs monitoring as well as the more traditional businesses where we're extending our footprint in applications where originally, we had established a foothold with our converter technology. So that's essentially health care in a nutshell.","Ali Husain","Do you have a follow-up, Terence?","Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Sure. My follow-up question is a little bit near-term in nature and that is that there is somewhat of a debate right now in the fourth quarter. I believe TSMC said fourth quarter sales would decline more than they have in prior years. And then conversely, some other companies have said that they believe the fourth quarter will be less of an inventory correction this year than in prior years. I'm not necessarily asking you to make that call. What I would ask is, what are you monitoring specifically to give you a lead indication of how fourth quarter is shaping up? And that's it.","David A. Zinsner","Well, I mean, the best leading indicator we have is order flow and unfortunately, with 4-week lead times, we have no visibility really into the fourth quarter. So it'd be very difficult for us to even guess at what the fourth quarter might look like or fourth calendar quarter, our first fiscal quarter might look like at ADI. I mean, we do kind of pay attention to economic data, PMI and so forth. Those numbers look relatively positive right now, although relatively uncertain as well as to how they unfold over the course of the rest of the year. So we're -- I guess what I would call us is cautiously optimistic. I think big foundry partners like TSMC, they have businesses in a lot of different subcategories beyond the broad industrial business that we play in and so there could be more volatility or less volatility in their businesses that wouldn't necessarily tie with the way ADI has managed.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Dave, I just wanted -- when you guided last quarter for July, you talked about that you're baking in some conservatism for July has typically been weak for you. And it seemed like you said orders had kind of improved throughout the quarter. So just curious how you reconcile the two. Is there some offset that -- in other segments? I know comm was better for you in July than you were expecting. And then when you look forward, the book-to-bill 1. If you could just talk about just the trajectory of orders versus the 1 book-to-bill.","David A. Zinsner","Yes, so what we saw is that order momentum, I guess, in the first fiscal quarter looked pretty good, set us up for the second quarter. And the second quarter's order level in total looked pretty good to set us up for the third quarter. I mean, in the third quarter, I guess what I would say is that we always expect in the third quarter period this kind of like somewhat acceleration through the quarter. So we always start off a little bit behind, and it slowly kind of makes its way back in -- by the end of the quarter. So that -- all of that really played out as expected. One thing that did happen was we probably thought industrial was going to end up at the higher end of the range. And it would have, had it not been for the military business, which is very program-related. It's not -- it doesn't necessarily -- you have difficulty reading it in the tea leaves of order patterns and you just kind of have to see it as it ends up at the end of the quarter. So that was probably the more negative surprise in our results was that defense and aerospace business didn't quite materialize as expected. And as you point out, on the more positive side, we did see the SIP-per [ph] business do a bit better than we expected. We thought that would be a little bit more flattish and that, in fact, didn't happen. So that offset some of the weakness we saw in the military, aerospace business.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then just a little clarification on the consumer part for the guide. It sounds like there's some product-specific stuff or ramp-specific stuff that offsets seasonality, but does that net out flat? Or are you saying that, that business is down for the October quarter?","David A. Zinsner","Yes, I think we're thinking flattish. It might be a little down depending on how the one cycle rolls off and the new cycles kind of roll on. So it's tough to call the timing exactly to the millionth dollar, but it's roughly flattish.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Vince, and I apologize if I missed this, but in your prepared comments around comm infrastructure, you specifically talked about 3G in China. I'm kind of curious about your view on the LTE buildout. Is that also what's driving growth here? If it isn't, when do you expect that to hit? Can you kind of help me understand the addressable market when it does start to go in full force?","Vincent T. Roche","Yes, good question, John. I think so far, all the build in China has been 3G-related. All our sales in that region in the third quarter were 3G-related. Now as you know, there are tenders out for 4G buildout. We expect that to happen somewhere. We don't know for sure. I don't think anybody knows. But we believe somewhere over the next couple of quarters, we'll start to see the ramp there. So that's very much all ahead of us. And our content gain between the generations is somewhere between 20% and 30%, between -- we'll get 20% and 30% more gain in the bond value in 4G than we have been getting in 3G. So that's all ahead of us still. We think that what we're seeing now are kind of the last buildouts, significant buildouts of 3G in China. It will continue for a period of time, but the switch to 4G is going to start happening pretty rapidly, we believe, over the coming couple of quarters.","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Perfect. And then as my follow up, I hate to belabor the point, but going back to consumer, if you go back a year ago October, there was a pretty visible smartphone launch which I think benefited your October quarter. And I think you were up about 25%, 26% sequentially in that quarter. Many of us here are expecting another fairly visible smartphone launch this quarter. So I'm kind of curious, is anything that's going on in the consumer business relative to socket [ph] loss? Or is it all just timing of product cycles you see [ph] ?","David A. Zinsner","Well, when I said transitioning product cycles, that was one of our products is rolling off and newer products are not rolling on. But outside of that, I can't comment on specific OEM customers and their launches and what our attach rates are on those. They limit our ability to talk about that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin from UBS.","Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","First one I had was to drill down a little bit more on the industrial business. I got your comments on the defense side and also for the U.S. geography, but was wondering how Europe and Asia preparing from a demand standpoint for industrial end market.","Vincent T. Roche","Well, overall, the industrial market is a composite of many, many different subsegments. What we saw in the third quarter was quite significant strength in Asia. Europe was -- gave us some growth, and America wasn't as strong. But largely, if you take net of our aerospace and defense business, actually industrial in America was positive. But there was, as Dave said, one significant program with many, many products that was delayed by a quarter, and that dampened our sales in America. So Asia, strongest; Europe in the middle and America for that one reason was not as strong as we had expected, but good signs for the fourth quarter that we see ahead of us.","Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. And just my follow-up is on the defense business that you mentioned earlier. The military programs that you highlighted, was that just a timing delay, or is there other concerns about those programs, such as the U.S. budget question marks, overspending that might be gating or...","Vincent T. Roche","Yes, well all the indications are that it's purely a timing delay that we expect to see the inclusion of that business in our fourth quarter revenue stream. So -- and currently that's a contracted revenue guarantee as well. So that's our expectation at least at this point in time.","Ali Husain","And I'd also like to remind you that our Q4 FY '13 earnings call is scheduled for November 26, 2013 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis from Jefferies.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Dave, maybe for you. When you talk about the cash return to shareholders going from 68% to 80% over time, I think -- correct me if I'm wrong, I think I've calculated the last 2 quarters that average about 50%. So the question is, how does that ramp up over the time? And can you give us a framework for thinking about how that breaks out between dividend and share buyback?","David A. Zinsner","Yes, so well, I guess it depends on how you calculate it, if you do it by free cash flow or earnings based on timing. But it's -- generally we're paying out, I think, at about 60% of our earnings over the last couple of quarters, and so definitely below our 82% threshold. And I think the dividend is roughly designed to be something in that range on a go-forward basis. So as earnings grow, so does the dividend. Where the variability comes in between something in the kind of 50s, 60s and something in the 80s really comes from the buyback. And the buyback will be lumpy. It will be -- we have an algorithm that's based on kind of technical flows of ADI valuation. And when it kind of triggers, it buys back a bunch of stock. So there'll be quarters in which our -- we return well more than 80% of our earnings in the form of either a dividend or a buyback, and there'll be quarters where we're less than 80%. But over the course of a 5-year period, we expect it to kind of average out to be 80%. And that's how I think you can model it.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. So over the next 5 years, the average of over about 80% on the earnings?","David A. Zinsner","Yes. Right, 80% of earnings.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Got you. And then on the second question, on the wireless base stations, this business has been difficult for a lot of component vendors to project over the last 18 months. But you seem to have a high degree of confidence on China 4G rollout next year. And I'm wondering if you could provide any insight as to what drives that confidence. Are you more confident now than you had been in the past? Do you have a particularly good kind of visibility into that?","Vincent T. Roche","Well, there's a lot of tendering activity, a lot of quoting activity between the OEMs and the carriers at this point time. We do our best to understand what's happening right through the ecosystem with the operators as well as the OEMs. So as best we can tell, over the next couple of quarters, we're going to see the first deployment of the 4G systems. So that's the best information we have at this point in time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Covello with Goldman Sachs.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess just a question, you'd made the comment, and this is a little bit of a follow-up to the discussion you had around Blayne's question, I think. You'd made the comment in the last quarter that if industrial stayed strong, you'd do the -- probably do closer to the upside of the -- or upward end of the range and then obviously, the delta there was defense. But if that defense piece was an order from a prior period, that's kind of going to be now in the fourth quarter revenue, and the orders were up across the board and all the segments in this most recent quarter, how can you help us reconcile kind of seasonal guidance in that result -- in that event? Again, strong orders this quarter with the benefit of a slippage of a relatively significant piece of business, I would think, would result in guidance that would be a little higher, or am I missing something?","David A. Zinsner","Well, I think I could be wrong, but I think if industrial is up in the fourth quarter, that's a bit anomalous. I mean, I actually think we see it going the other direction on average. Where we see this pick up for the fourth quarter overall is because usually, we have a reasonably high lift in consumer. And what we're telegraphing is that I think the seasonality in consumer probably won't impact us on a go-forward basis, and it's more about product cycles. And the product cycles just aren't going to happen in the fourth quarter. So that kind of gets us back down to something more in line with seasonality.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, I mean, I guess I had incorrectly been looking at the ISM as a gauge for the overall industrial piece. Obviously, there's an important defense component in there. What would you recommend if you were us -- you would use as you go throughout the quarter kind of as a barometer of that industrial business for ADI to gauge, again, kind of relative to that comment last quarter that if industrial stays strong, you could be at the high end? What would you be looking at if you were us as we go through the quarter?","David A. Zinsner","Well, I'd love to say there's a perfect number. The best indicator we have is usually our orders and unfortunately, we can't share that with you every day, although we'd love to. So that's the difficulty. I mean, most of where we get our real sense as to how the business is doing is order flow and qualitative discussions with distributors and some of our larger industrial customers. And we kind of read through that. Usually, all this ISM data, PMI data, all this stuff is somewhat old news to us because it's reporting on what's pretty much already been kind of recognized in the order flow. I hate to say that that's the best answer we have, but that's the best answer we have.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman from RBC.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","If I could get a little bit of detail on your work-down of inventory. What's your target for inventory going forward? And if you had held inventory flat, what would your utilization and gross margin have looked like?","David A. Zinsner","So the target is to be roughly in the 100 to 110 days. The fact that we're at 109 days, I feel pretty good about where we are at this point. And I've been talking to the manufacturing people, I think we all agree that we'd like to keep the inventory levels on a days\u2019 basis right around where we are today. So that would mean no further reductions in inventory on a days basis. It's difficult to tell -- to give you a detailed response because there are a lot of moving pieces on the gross margin side. But suffice it to say that it's a minimum of 50 basis points better because we're guiding 50 basis points better in gross margins next quarter, and we're ticking up utilization. It's probably somewhere, if I had to quote a range, probably somewhere in the 50 to 100 basis points.","Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Great. And if I could, as my follow-up, I just want to dig in to a little bit on what's going on in consumer. I want to make sure I understand correctly. Are you guys -- could you help me understand what your exposure is to, say, high-end smartphones versus low to mainstream or more cost-effective smartphones? And what's happening in your camera business? And given that you're guiding consumer to less than seasonal, should we think that it should have a less than seasonal decline in the first -- in your fourth quarter or first fiscal?","David A. Zinsner","Yes, I mean, I think I said in a question asked before whether I thought the volatility around consumer is probably muted a lot on a go-forward basis, and I think that's a fair assumption. We are certainly more closely tied to high-end portables only by the virtue of the fact that what we try to do is the really difficult things to do, the really complex problems. Generally, when you start getting into the more mainstream part of the market, they don't necessarily require a lot of the more complex technologies and thus, you don't normally find us in those.","Vincent T. Roche","But just to follow up on what Dave said there, that the -- we have a very good sense for each of the solutions we're offering, what the value and the price of that solution is. It's up to our customer to decide where they deploy it. We don't differentiate. When it comes to pricing these products, we don't differentiate at all between high end or low end. We say, \"Here's a piece of differentiated technology. This is the price.\" And it's on that basis we do business. But as Dave said, we're certainly targeting the higher performance and typically the higher end of the market in terms of end products.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis from B. Riley & Co.","Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley Caris, Research Division","Just to follow up on John's questions on communication infrastructure. It was helpful to get the comments on the content gain that you think is possible for ADI with LTE up 20% to 30%. For the China deployments, what do you think will happen with your market share there? And when will you have a good insight into what that market share will be on the different programs that roll out?","Vincent T. Roche","Well, it's very, very hard at this point in time to make a stab at market share and to give you any particular information on that. But our investments have been increased pretty significantly in communications infrastructure over the past 4 or 5 years to develop a really leading-edge transceiver technology capability, which we are well established in 3G with. 4G is even better for us in the sense that there are a lot more radios per system than there are in 3G. There are new antenna structures coming, adaptive array antennas. So all these -- we're at the leading edge and in fact, we're enabling a lot of these applications to occur as well as early as possible. So my sense is our market share will increase as these radio standards become just more complex to deal with. There are very, very significant technology issues, problems to deal with such as being able to handle more and more and more LTE spectrum with different needs. So the bandwidth requirement of these units, these devices we ship, is becoming more and more and more complicated and the dynamic range that's required as well, so across the radio chain and converter chain. So there's a lot of -- as these standards keep evolving, there's much, much more complexity to deal with technologically, and we're working very, very closely with all the key players out there to make sure that we enable their systems to get to market as the technology is needed.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Will Stein from SunTrust.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I just want to get an opportunity to talk to you a little bit about the military part of the business that seemed to drive a bit of a shortfall relative to my and it sounds like your expectations in the industrial end market. Can you talk to us about how big that business is relative to the overall and how concentrated it is? It sounded like perhaps this was one program that it might have driven the shortfall, which would be quite surprising. So any comment on this would be helpful.","David A. Zinsner","So the size of the business is, I guess, mid-single digits as a percent of total company. It's probably about as accurate as we want to go. I'm sorry, what was your other question?","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Was there a single program that drove the...","David A. Zinsner","I think what it was, was it was one single program but of several products.","Vincent T. Roche","And multiple customers.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And you expect that business to bounce or to recover in the next quarter?","David A. Zinsner","Our best read is that we will see it come back in the fourth quarter.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And then if I can just talk about drop-through on the gross line. I think you achieved mid-80s this quarter. It looks like you're guiding to mid-70s. Should we expect that level of incremental gross profit on revenue growth to continue in the, let's say, the next few quarters?","David A. Zinsner","Well, it's somewhat mix-dependent. Sometimes it's just only slightly above our corporate gross margin. Sometimes it gets up as high as 90%. It really depends on how much internally manufactured product we expect to sell in the -- or ship out in the next quarter. This quarter just turns out it's going to be kind of a little bit lower. But on average, it probably runs around 80%.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Ranjit Ramachandran from Sanford C. Bernstein.","Ranjit Ramachandran","This is Ranjit on behalf of Stacy. Just had a quick question on distributor inventories. You had mentioned that the lead times are short and inventories of the distributors are low. But when you look at the competition, do you see any lengthening of lead times from other vendors or your competition? I'm just trying to get a feel for is there any reason for distributing to distributors to stock up inventories again?","David A. Zinsner","Yes, I -- and this is only anecdotal, what I've heard. I haven't heard a lot about lead times extending. I've heard a little bit of spot shortages in the commodity part of the market, but nothing in the kind of high performance analog space that would drive, I think, any different behavior from the distributors.","Ranjit Ramachandran","Okay. Great. And the next one was about quickly on the tax rate. Last quarter, you had mentioned something in the range of 16.5%. It came in quite a bit lighter than that. You guided to around 14.5% this quarter. Do you think -- do you see any -- foresee any circumstance in which there could be a lower tax rate in the fourth quarter?","David A. Zinsner","Well, I mean, our tax rate is somewhat dictated upon how the profits break out when it's all said and done. We make an estimate of that and sometimes it ends up being a little bit different than expected and that was one of the reasons that the tax rate was so low this quarter. It could obviously go a little bit lower, a little bit higher than that depending on how things go. But our best guess is that it would be around 14.5% and I think plus or minus 50 basis points. And I think next year, it probably runs in the 14% to 15% as well based on what we think the profit split's going to be between U.S. and the international locations. But we'll see how it goes. I don't think it -- if it's higher or lower, it's probably not higher or lower by much.","Ali Husain","Thanks, Ranjit. And we'd like to thank everyone here. We're going to close off for the evening, for joining us tonight. Just a reminder that our fourth quarter FY '13 earnings call is scheduled for November 26, 2013, beginning at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time.

My name is Natalie and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I will like to welcome everyone to the Analog Devices First Quarter Fiscal Year 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Miss Tagliaferro, you may begin your conference.","Maria Tagliaferro","Okay. Thank you, Natalie, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Maria Tagliaferro, Director of Corporate Communications for ADI. Here with me now are Jerry Fishman, our President and CEO; Dave Zinsner, Vice President of Finance and CFO; and Vincent Roche, Vice President of Sales and Strategic Market segment. We appreciate you joining us for today's call. If you haven't yet seen our first quarter fiscal year 2012 release or the release announcing an increase in the dividend, you can find both on our IR website at investor.analog.com. A recording of this conference call will also be available on the website within about 2 hours of the call's conclusion.","I would like to point out that there were 14 weeks of activity in the first quarter of fiscal 2012, that compares to a typical 13 weeks in a quarter. From time to time during today's conference call, we will point out the impact of this additional week on historical and projected trends. ","The 14-week quarter occurs because ADI follows a fiscal year calendar of 52 weeks per year. As a result, there is an extra week approximately every fifth or sixth year, and to adjust for that one day difference between our fiscal year and the typical 365-day calendar year.","Finally, I'd ask you to please note that the information that we're about to discuss includes forward-looking statements, intended to qualify for the Safe Harbor from liabilities established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include risks and uncertainties, and our actual results could differ materially from those we will be discussing. Factors that could contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those described in our SEC filings, including our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q which was filed today. ","The forward-looking information that is provided on this call represents our outlook as of today, and we do not undertake any obligation to update the forward-looking statements made by us. Subsequent events and developments may cause our outlook to change. Therefore, this conference call will include time-sensitive information that may be accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, which is February 22, 2012.","With that, I'll turn the call over to opening remarks from our CEO, Jerry Fishman.","Jerald G. Fishman","Well good afternoon to everybody. As you can tell from our press release, our revenues in the first quarter totaled about $648 million, which was a decline of 9.5% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. And although within the range we provided last quarter, it was at the lower end of that guidance range. ","Continuing inventory reduction by both our customers and distributors in November and December, coupled with lower capital spending by many of our customers, reduced orders on ADI and that continued the trend that began about 6 or 9 months ago. Nevertheless and happily, order rates and orders began accelerating in January and have continued strong into February, which leads us to believe that our first quarter may represent the sales gross margin and operating margin trough of this cycle for ADI. And we expect to resume growth in our second quarter, which began in early February. ","We believe that customer and distributor inventories are reaching levels commensurate with the now revised outlooks and many of our larger customers have become marginally more optimistic and are beginning to free up some of their capital budgets. I'll provide a few more specifics on the short-term outlook towards the end of the call.","In the first quarter, our sales, into virtually every end market except automotive, declined sequentially and year-over-year. In the first quarter, automotive sales actually increased 6% sequentially and 26% year-over-year as ADI continued to benefit from increased ADI dollar content per vehicle and increased vehicle unit sales worldwide. We would expect that our automotive sales to remain strong in our second quarter. ","Industrial revenues declined 8% sequentially in Q1 for the third consecutive quarter of declines. The decline was very broad-based across customer tiers and geographies and of course industrial automation, energy instrumentation and health care applications. As has been the case now for several quarters, order rates from industrial customers appear to be well below consumption rates for our products for the first 2 months of our first quarter, but have recently been showing some good signs of improvement, which of course is very welcome news for us, since the industrial market represented 45% of our revenues in Q1 and remains our highest margin business. Based on these trends, we expect that industrial revenues will increase in the second quarter after now 3 quarters of sequential decline.","The communications infrastructure end market also declined in the first quarter. Continued economic uncertainty, some country-specific regulatory issues and disruption from the failed AT&T and T-Mobile merger all contributed to widespread deferral of orders for new systems in favor of temporary improvements, mostly software and network capacity. Communications was 19% of revenues and declined 13% sequentially. While at this point in time, we're not currently forecasting much improvement in communications infrastructure revenues in our second quarter, our customers in many geographies are now beginning to signal that we should expect the resumption of growth in the second half of this year.","The consumer end market decreased 21% sequentially, a little bit more than our seasonal expectations, but also due in part to customer production limitations caused by the floods in Thailand, which limited our customers ordering patterns for many of our products. We're currently forecasting some growth in consumer sales in the second quarter, in line with what we normally see seasonally from first to second quarter. ","So I think, really, the summary comment with few exceptions is the 2 things that seem to play out during the first quarter were inventory reductions at most of our customers and delays to long-term capital expenditures at many of our customers. And I think for the most part, we now believe that both of these trends seemed to have run their course, at least for ADI, by the end of December.","On a regional basis, only North America experienced any sequential revenue increase in Q1. And even in North America, the growth rate was very modest. It was only up about 1% or so. And that was the result of strength in automotive and the wired communications markets in the U.S. ","Revenue in Japan declined by 23% due to consumer inventory seasonality and also the supply-chain limitations that I mentioned earlier. ","Revenues from Europe decreased 12% as increases on automotive sales were more than offset by declines in industrial and communications revenues. ","Revenues in China decreased 11%, as declines across the industrial end market overshadowed good growth in other markets. ","This RoW, or rest of world, decline of 6% was largely due to reductions in consumer revenue. ","So now Dave will take you through some of the details of the first quarter financial results, and I'll come back after Dave's comments and talk a little bit more about the outlook.","David A. Zinsner","Thanks, Jerry. As Jerry mentioned, first quarter revenue declined 9.5% sequentially and 11% year-over-year to $648 million. Our gross margin was 63.2% in the first quarter. This was down from the 64.3% we reported in Q4, primarily as a result of our decision to decrease factory utilization. ","Lead times for our direct OEM customers remained similar to last quarter and are in control with virtually 100% of our shipments to OEMs occurring within 6 weeks and in 99% within 4 weeks.","Operating expenses for the first quarter were approximately flat from the prior quarter at $226.1 million, a great result given an extra week of expenses. Holiday shutdowns and tight control of discretionary items helped keep expenses in check. ","Operating profits for the fourth quarter were $183 million or 28.3% of sales compared to 32.9% of sales in the prior quarter. Operating profits were down both in dollar and percentage terms as a result of the lower revenue and reduced factory absorption in the first quarter.","Other expense was $3 million in the first quarter compared to $4 million in the fourth quarter and reflects the ongoing run rate of our net interest expense. ","Our tax rate for the first quarter was 22.6%, in line with expectations we communicated for our 22% rate in fiscal 2012. We expect our effective tax rate, excluding discrete items, to be approximately 21.5% for the remainder of fiscal 2012. ","Diluted earnings per share of $0.46 in the first quarter was slightly lower than the midpoint of our guidance, as tight control of operating expenses provided some relief against lower revenue on gross margins.","Cash flow in the first quarter continued to be strong. We generated 33% of our revenue or $215 million in operating cash flow. Capital expenditures were $25 million, resulting in free cash flow of $190 million or 29% of revenue for the quarter. ","Our accounts receivable balance decreased from the prior quarter by $46 million due to lower sales, and our days sales outstanding increased by 2 days from the prior quarter to 46 days. ","Inventory was carefully managed and increased by only $2 million or less than 1% despite lower sales. Inventory at distribution also declined by approximately 7% and is at the lowest point since 2010.","During the first quarter, we repurchased $78 million of our stock, and we received $49 million in proceeds from stock option exercises. We also distributed $74 million in dividends to our stockholders. Our cash balance at the end of the first quarter was approximately $3.7 billion, of which approximately $1.1 billion is available domestically. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $870 million in debt outstanding. ","On February 21, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per outstanding share of common stock, up from $0.25 last quarter, which will be paid on March 28, 2012, to all shareholders of record at the close of business on March 9. At current stock prices, this dividend represents an annual yield of about 3%. This significant dividend increase represents our strategy to improve returns to our shareholders and also our confidence in our continuing ability to generate significant free cash flow in the future.","In summary, our operating model includes significant variable costs that have helped ADI achieve record-high margins during the upturns in recent industry cycles, and equally as important, during the inevitable downturns. Our results in the first quarter continue to demonstrate the strength of our model as tight expense control, variable compensation and a highly responsive manufacturing infrastructure have ADI well positioned for the emerging recovery. ","At current operating margin levels, we have significant operating leverage as sales increase, and we begin to reload our factories, while keeping very tight control of operating expenses.","And so now I'll turn the call back over to Jerry to discuss recovery in terms of ADI's outlook for next quarter.","Jerald G. Fishman","Well, thanks, Dave. Although we are certainly in a challenging business environment, we do see improvement on the horizon. We now believe that our inventory levels at both OEM customers and distributors are below consumption rates, and we're pleased to report that our order rates have improved and increased significantly over the last 6 weeks. ","For the second quarter of 2012, we believe revenue to be in the range of $655 million to $675 million or up 1% to 4% sequentially. Considering now we're going from a 14-week quarter to a more normal 13-week quarter in Q2, this sequential revenue growth at these levels is significantly higher on an apples-to-apples basis. We're planning for higher sales and a higher mix of industrial products, which leads us to our gross margin plan of somewhere between 64% and 64.5% for the second quarter. ","While utilization will increase in Q2 compared to Q1, it's expected to still remain below 70%, which indicates that we still have significant remaining gross margin leverage as sales improve in future quarters and as utilization expands. ","We anticipate that operating expenses will remain flat in Q2 to Q1 levels and also to Q4 2011 levels at about $226 million. Given that the macroeconomic environment still remains uncertain, as Dave mentioned, we will continue to aggressively monitor and control our expenses in Q2 and for the balance of the year. ","Based on these estimates that are excluding any onetime items, diluted earnings are planned to be in the range of $0.48 to $0.53 in our second quarter.","So in summary, the fundamentals of our business remained strong during this cycle. And as growth returns, we believe our customer relationships, our technology portfolio, our better market focus, our terrific service levels and our financial model will all contribute to higher profitability and we believe, increasing shareholder returns.","Maria Tagliaferro","Great. Thank you very much, Jerry. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we are now ready for questions from our analyst participants.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of James Covello from Goldman Sachs.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess first question, Jerry, can you give us some sort of idea of how much you think we can grow revenues here just from customers kind of going back to consuming at their own shipment levels? So in other words, if production and consumption levels kind of come back in line, how much can we grow? And then beyond that we're going to need sales growth, how much do you think, just kind of catching back up, can you give us some growth here?","Jerald G. Fishman","Well that's a very complicated question to answer, so I can only really speak qualitatively about that. One way to think about it, I think, Jim, is that if you look at our industrial revenues from the peak of where they were before the cycle sort of collapsed to where last quarter wound up, our industrial revenues are down 20-plus percent. If you look at our customers' results in the industrial business, none of our customers' results are down anything like that. In fact, many of our larger industrial customers particularly -- well, customers in the United States and Europe and China, we look and their industrial revenues are up. So there's been a pretty significant inventory reduction at our customers. When you couple that with their most recent outlooks -- and after I finish, I'll turn it over to Vince who just came back from another long week on the road talking to a lot of those customers, I think most of our customers are really not pessimistic about the next couple of quarters. I'd say they are not jumping off the tables and saying that everything is great, but they're -- so they expect to get some growth and some little sooner, some a little later. I think the early adapters in this business to what's happened will be the industrial business, but I think soon after, it could be followed by the communications business. So it's really very hard to put a crisp number on it, but some of the largest customers have had enormous inventory reductions, well beyond what would be indicated by any potential slowdown on their sales. So I think there's a reasonable amount of just snapback, just to get back to normal consumption levels. But Vince, you have some comment?","Vincent T. Roche","Yes. Just a couple of points for color here. I think it's true to say that the first -- or let's say, the second and third quarters of the year just gone -- customers were trying to get ahead of the supply issues and a lot of over-inventorying was done. I think the second half of the year was very much dominated by the debt crisis in Europe to a large extent, a lot of our business is done in Europe with the industrial customer base, particularly in the areas of automation. I think the confidence is generally good with our customers out there that this is going to be a pretty good year, maybe modest growth. But I think also some customers still believe that their burning off inventory, and it will take probably another couple of months to get the inventory out of the pipe. But I think certainly second and third quarters, we're expecting to see some positive movements in terms of industrial customers based on their confidence and certainly the order rates that we're seeing from them.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's terrific. If I'm allowed a follow-up I guess I would ask how much margin expansion should we see for every, say, $50 million of incremental revenue growth from here, assuming mix stays the same with industrial being a little bit higher of a percentage than it was at times in the past?","David A. Zinsner","This is gross margins you're asking?","James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Correct.","David A. Zinsner","Well I know, I mean we're obviously -- first off, I think the gross margin, if this is indeed the trough, we're pretty stellar relative to previous troughs. In fact, I think, now our previous troughs -- our previous peaks are like much our current troughs. So we've done a lot to fundamentally improve the gross margins from where we were, say, a few years ago. Going forward, clearly I think the utilization were down to -- a lot of this is going to be driven off utilization -- were down below 70% when we were at our peak at 67%, a little over 67%. We were -- our utilization was up past 80%. So really the fundamental driver in getting the margins up, I think, will mostly be a function of getting that utilization up. And as Jerry said, we're still even next quarter operating at relatively low utilization, and I think our expectation is that we'll ramp back into the levels that we saw in prior periods where the margins were up into the high 60s.","Jerald G. Fishman","Jim, the other comment I'd make is that we're working hard to really manage the inventory very carefully here. And we want to make sure that we have enough so -- because in these kind of cycles, you can get a very quick snapback or changing customer sentiment, and everybody starts loading you up again. So you got to be careful that you don't see both ends of the seesaw here. So we're trying to keep the inventory levels at reasonable levels, so that: number one, we'll get expansion on the gross margins when we really do load the factories, but also that when customers do decide to make changes, and history shows they make those changes very quickly that we can be as responsive in this cycle as we were in the last cycle. We still think that's the best policy for ADI.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shawn Webster.","Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research","Just a little bit, maybe more on the gross margin question. So Dave, could you quantify what your utilizations were in the January quarter? And is the full utilization rate for you guys north of 80%? And did you have any one-time kind of markdowns or inventory effects impacting gross margins for your last quarter?","David A. Zinsner","Okay. So utilization in the first quarter was 67%. Like Jerry said, we're expecting it to be north of that, but below 70%. So hard to pick the exact point, but somewhere between 67% and 70%, we're expecting utilization. We did have a little bit of a inventory write-down more so than we normally have in the first quarter. It probably was -- contributed about 50 basis points of the decline in gross margins, certainly will help us because we don't think that's going to repeat again in the second quarter. As far as maximum utilization goes, I guess, theoretically, if you get to a 100, rarely do you get to that level, so something in the high 80s probably, or 90% is probably where we'd like to -- where we feel comfortable and think we can keep our lead times to the place we want to keep them.","Jerald G. Fishman","Yes, we've operated our manufacturing facilities very well at 90% utilization. And then just by adding small amounts of incremental capital, we can get the overall capacity up quite quickly. So 90% is quite comfortable for us.","Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research","Okay, great. And then on the inventory question, it sounds like some areas from your perspective, if I heard it correctly, are getting lean, in some areas, there are still some or what your customers are communicating to you as they're digesting inventory. What are the areas that still seem like they're still in the process of burning down inventory?","Vincent T. Roche","I think particularly in the small customer base, which is largely industrial and some of the larger industrial customers themselves, but I think it's very much industrial and possibly health care as well.","Jerald G. Fishman","But all the signals we're getting is, that's really winding down. So we're seeing -- when the inflection point on the bookings occurs broadly as we've seen, that's usually an indication that there's still might be a little inventory out there in couple of the customers, some of these end markets as Vince mentioned. But that's going to not affect the results nearly to the extent that it has affected them over the last 3 quarters. So I think we're all -- even if they are still burning off a little inventory, the net results that we can achieve is quite a bit better than where they were, where the mentality 6 to 9 months ago was just get inventory down as fast as you possibly can. We had many of our largest customers that went through a quarter or 2 and didn't order anything because they just didn't want any more inventory. And that really accelerated what we got into November and part of December when they were facing year end. We monitor our customers' inventory in aggregate pretty carefully. And when you look at the inventory levels of some of our large industrial customers are carrying in aggregate, this doesn't necessarily make a comment about ADI products specifically. It's quite, quite lean right now. So there might be some more to go. It might take another month or 2 in some of the accounts, but I believe and what we're seeing in the order rates is most of that is behind us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of from Tristan Gerra from Robert Baird.","Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Could you talk about the segments this year you think are for the best growth opportunities? And also on a geographic basis, do you expect to catch up in Japan over the next couple of quarters as the supply chain comes back?","Jerald G. Fishman","I didn't get the first part of your question, could you repeat that?","Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","The first part of the question was just to talk about some of the segments that you think are for the best growth opportunities for ADI this year? Any color by end market?","Jerald G. Fishman","Sure, I think was that the question...","Vincent T. Roche","Sure. I think in general, yes. So your question is the best growth opportunities across the globe. So clearly automotive has been a standard growth contributor to the company over the last couple of years, and I expect that will continue this year and for the next few years at least anyways. Demand is very strong in all the geographic markets. And particularly the America, we saw strong growth in the quarter just gone. In fact, I read a statistic in the last couple of days that the average age of a car now in America is over 10 years, so there's a replenishment cycle going on there very, very clearly. And we're expecting in Japan and China as well growth in the region of 9% to 12% for this year. There's, again -- in China, there's a lot of demand for mid- to high-end cars that we're very prevalent in supplying products to. And Japan as well there's a very, very strong replacement activity going on there. So I think automotive will be strong. Communications infrastructure, I believe, in the second half of the year as we start to see the calendar year, as we start to see the continued data explosion and the need to put hardware in places. As Jerry said earlier, there's been kind of an optimization cycle in the past quarter or 2, but the operators who have the cash are going to have to start putting hardware into place over the next 2, 3 quarters. So I think we'll see some decent growth there. And industrial, as I said, it could be modest but at least we expect some growth during the remainder of this year.","Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then a quick one could you give us the breakdown of your communication revenues?","Vincent T. Roche","Well it's roughly -- 2\/3 of the revenue comes from the wireless infrastructure sector and 1\/3 from the wired infrastructure sector. And wired is really the composite of optical and cable infrastructure and some enterprise business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes. Quickly, Jerry, the first question I have is just relative to the January quarter. You guys came in at a little bit late of the low end of guidance. Was that all the Thailand? And the reason why I ask is a lot of chip companies actually saw some strength in the December, beginning of January. So I'm just kind of curious as to why you guys came in at the low end of your guidance for the January quarter. And then I have a follow-up.","Jerald G. Fishman","Well I mean, it's hard to say what other people did one way or the other. We weren't even around the last 2 weeks in December. We had most of our factories closed and not much of our sales guys out there. But we began to see the increase in very early January, starting with the first week in January that we came back, and we've seen that to be relatively strong since then. So it's very hard for us to say why somebody's orders were stronger one week versus another. It's hard to get into that level of granularity. I'm just happy to see that our orders began to pick up in early January and it has continued strong into mid-February. That's the best I can tell you.","John Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A follow-up, just going back to the utilization, below 70% for both the Jan and the April quarter, can you do -- can you help us, remind -- for every 100 basis point improvement in utilization, what that might mean for gross margin? And I guess given the strong mix of industrial in the April quarter, does mix come into a play that perhaps dampen cyclical leverage beyond April?","David A. Zinsner","Well clearly the second quarter will have a strong industrial component to it. And that will help gross margins from a mix perspective. But we think or we're assuming that industrial was at a low point in the first quarter and that we will see recovery beyond the second quarter. So my guess is mix is not a headwind going forward, if we're right that we're in the early stages of a recovery. But I guess maybe the best way to describe the utilization to gross margin ratio is, back when we were operating in the 67% gross margins, we were running kind of high 70s to 80% utilization.","Jerald G. Fishman","It's not a strictly linear relationship of x number basis points for each point of utilization. It just -- does not the way the factories are run, that's not the way the costs are generated. But I think Dave's comment is illustrative of the kind of gross margin leverage that's out there as utilization improves. But we can't model it linearly for you.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis from Caris & Company.","Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","The first question is just a follow-up on the communications business. Vincent, can you talk about the types of projects that you're hearing about for the back half of the year? Are those 3G projects? Or are those LTE projects? And the color that you're getting, can you provide some insight on whether that's based on OEMs in particular geographies, or on the projects in particular geographies? Or is it more broad-based?","Vincent T. Roche","Well I think all of the major players in the wireless space are attacking the market with a broad range of technologies. Some are more heavily focused on 4G, some of them got out of the starting blocks earlier on the 4G, but I think everybody has some level of offering across 4G, 3G and even 2G. In India today, we still see deployment of 2G. But my sense is that this year or next year, we're going to see largely a move out of 2G into 3G, and I think most of our sales over the next 3 or 4 years will be dominated by 3G and particularly 4G. I think it's true to say that in the more developed economies, the deployment is really 4G at this point in time. It's to get the data into place that people need to be able to move all these massive quantities of mobile video and high-bandwidth data.","Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then switching gears and a question for Dave. Dave, real nice increase on the dividend, 12%, $0.30 a share. As we think about the dividend generative capacity of the firm and the balance that you want to strike as you think about the right level of payout and the cash that's available in the U.S. to fund that dividend, how do we think about an upper control in that forward, what the dividend payout might be as we think about ADI's business?","David A. Zinsner","How do we think about what?","Craig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","The upper control limit. Is there a free cash flow payout that you wouldn't want to go over? Or what are some of the parameters that you're looking, as you think about what the potential payout is on your dividend?","David A. Zinsner","Well I mean the issue with using payout ratios on cash flow is every quarter it can be up and down, depending if you have onetime tax payment, things like that. So generally historically I think -- someone mentioned that we've been paying -- we've paid out around 40% of our net income in the form of dividends, and what we'd like to see is that number to be higher. We don't have a rule of thumb for every quarter, but we're trying to push the dividend to be more and more compelling to shareholders, return more and more of our cash flow to shareholders. And that's really the way we think about it versus some sort of scientific ratio that we apply. We think that investors, at least the ones we've talked to particularly over the last, say, 6 months has been really interested in dividends as a means of returning cash to shareholders vis-\u00e0-vis buyback. So we've taken the approach to really put a little bit more emphasis on the dividend.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Uche Orji from UBS.","Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Jerry, can I just ask you a few subsegment questions? So my first question is on the infrastructure area. You did mention some of the events last year that led to a slowdown in basically the wireless infrastructure. As you go in through this year and you talk to your customers, what is the expectation for recovery there, particularly in North America and in China. Is there any comment on wireless infrastructure will be helpful.","Vincent T. Roche","Yes. Because of the situation in the U.S., there would be the whole situation surrounding AT&T and T-Mobile, there was obviously a great lull in procurement of equipment or deployment of equipment and procurement of products. But in my sense is some point in this -- in the next number of months, we're going to see, as I mentioned earlier, some level of deployment of hardware because there just aren't enough base stations deployed, particularly in America and Europe to have -- handle the data requirements that are in place. Now our -- the operators and our customers have been trying to optimize the equipment that's already there through pretty much software techniques, just to get the capacity to where it needed to be. But I think we're going to see a pretty strong deployment of new hardware, particularly in Europe and the America in the area of 4G in the second, third, fourth quarter of this year. But I think in Europe and America, we're pretty much 4G; Japan, 4G; and in China to be a mixture of 2, 3 and 4G.","Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","In terms of the leverage you have as we go into -- as we deploy 4G, I know that some of that component suppliers will have higher leverage. Do you think as we go into 4G -- there are 2 questions here, one is how much more leverage do you think you have within that segment? And also in terms of the base of that over 3G, I mean I'm just trying to see if there's any way to understand how ADI could leverage this growth beyond just about that in the 4G deployment. I'm not sure if that's any more incremental leverage for you.","Vincent T. Roche","SO I think it's actually very good for ADI. The more complex the problem becomes, and the problem does become more complex in terms of delivering performance when you get to 4G levels. That's good for ADI. We participate in pushing the performance envelope in all of these radio systems across the globe with all the major players. So the move into 4G is very, very good for ADI. And of course it won't stop there either. There will be more generations coming on top of that in the years ahead. So in terms of being able to put a specific quantity in there in terms of leverage, all I can tell you is that the content increases for ADI in terms of ASP per system, the higher level of the system, and that is certainly true in terms of 4G from 3G, for example.","Jerald G. Fishman","Well I think the other part of it is that not only does that require higher performance components, as Vince said, but we have a much wider spectrum of products that we supply in newer systems. We've talked previously about our RF portfolio, which I think in the early generations of wireless infrastructure was quite minimal, but in the more recent and most advanced deployments, our RF products are very, very important, and very often the differentiator in the system that differentiates our product offerings from our competitors. We also have many other new products like clocks and other types of things that go around converters that we never had, really, in the early 2, and in some cases, 3G deployments. So I think that we're getting the benefit of number one, that you need higher performance components; number two, in many of the new systems, there are more cards per box than in the older systems; and thirdly, the product offering is much broader in the newer systems than it was in the older systems. So the combination of all those 3 things happening simultaneously does give us a lot of leverage on the upside as newer systems get deployed.","Vincent T. Roche","There are 2 dimensions to the products that we supply to these systems. We have, of course, the data path products that allow the performance, the speed and the bandwidth performance requirements to be realized. But also there are control and observation circuits that are required that become more and more sophisticated as the standards continue to increase in performance levels. So it's good on both sides of that -- on both those dimensions for ADI, both in terms of the data stream, but also the sophistication of the components required to keep these systems stable and secure.","Jerald G. Fishman","I would just make one final comment on that. That when we visit all the large infrastructure accounts, we are one of very, very few competitors that can offer the breadth of products they really want. And as you look forward, the deepness of the relationship that's going to be required between the suppliers, in this case, like ADI and the manufacturers, who well-known in this business is getting to be much, much tighter every year. And the strategic rationale of buying one part from one vendor and another part from another vendor and picking the rest of the catalog in that business, I think is more indicative of what it's been than what it's going to be in the future. So I think that the deepness in the strategic engagements that are required to really penetrate new applications in that business is much, much greater than it's been. And in that sense, the breadth of the portfolio, the reputation of the vendor, the share that the current vendor has, the build of materials, the technology roadmaps in terms of not only single products but very integrated products that integrate analog technology and RF technology and a bunch of other things on either the same chip or the same package is going to be a very important differentiator going forward. And In that sense, we think that's one of ADI's long-term, very significant competitive advantages.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Barclays Capital.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess first question, I was hoping to maybe get some color on whether you saw any changes in order patterns post-Chinese New Year, whether any business performed better or worse. Would love to hear color on that.","Jerald G. Fishman","I don't think so. I think what we typically see is business was very good for quite a while. The Chinese New Year came and businesses in Asia weakened for a week, and then it came back very strongly the week after. So I don't think we saw any trends in the Chinese New Year that are not very typical to what we have seen normally.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess as my follow-up, I was hoping maybe could talk a little bit about some of the recent acquisitions, Lyric, AudioAsics, et cetera. Any contribution there that's noteworthy that we should be thinking about in terms of future growth?","Jerald G. Fishman","Well I think some of the -- the second one you mentioned has been long ago integrated and cataloged as an important part of our product offering. Lyric is much more of a longer-term play where we really believe that the kind of technology they have really enables performance that without that type of technology, it just isn't possible on many, many dimensions that are very critical in signal processing. We're just now beginning to embed that type of technology in our products. We have a couple of areas that we picked out where we think it's the most relevant. So I think as we get out toward the end this year and into 2013, we will begin to see Lyric technology deployed in a wide number of ADI products that will really -- that technology will really make a huge difference in power [ph] participation and other characteristic signs that people really care about. So the proof is in the pudding, and it's always hard to predict exact quantitative numbers long in advance. But everything we've seen so far substantiates the value of that technology ultimately to Analog Devices and our customers.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie from Raymond James.","Jonathan Smigie","Jerry, you mentioned that you'd expect a quick snapback on the industrial side. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the piece of how that would look. I mean is it you get the bulk of that recovery in one quarter? Or will it take at least over a couple of quarters?","Jerald G. Fishman","I think it will be probably, if history is a good example, it will be a gradual recovery, eventually it gets to the point where people's psyche changes a little bit and they start saying, \"Oh my God, there's not enough supply out there.\" Then we can see more rapid acceleration. But at least from the data that we're getting from the customers and Vince, as I mentioned, just visited a bunch of our large industrial customers in the last week or 2. I think what we're expecting or at least what we're planning for is a gradual recovery in our industrial businesses as we've seen in many other cycles. Vince, do you have anything else to...","Vincent T. Roche","I think just to add a little more color to what Jerry said, we have -- we characterize the industrial sector across the areas that have automation, energy instrumentation and aero. And we've seen since this time last year, pretty much all those subsegments are down just about the same level from the peak. The indications are that they're all going to pick up. As Jerry said, they are down roughly about 25% over the past year. Now we're expecting that the recovery will be fairly gradual, and I would say in the next 2 or 3 quarters we'll see the recovery gather steam.","Jerald G. Fishman","Of course Vince is just saying that because he wants me to raise his sales plan. Our experience is that is typically what happens.","Jonathan Smigie","Right. And my follow-up, with regard to the telecom recovery you're talking about for the second half, is there a particular geography you'd expect to see a sharper or more meaningful recovery?","Jerald G. Fishman","I don't know. I mean my own sense, I'd be curious to hear Vince's views on that. It will come up where it went down the most first because some of that recovery is just going to be the end of the inventory reduction. I think longer term, everyone can make their own prediction about which economies are going to grow faster, what's going to happen in Europe, what's going to happen in the U.S. as the election gets closer, what's going to happen in China in terms of government policy. So there's a lot of unknowns about what the macro issues are going to be in each of the regions. But I think right now, what we expect is that the places that have done -- have had the most significant reductions will have the most significant increases at least in the short term. Vince?","Vincent T. Roche","Yes. So the industrial business that we've talked about a lot is very intertwined in Europe and America, in particular. Those 2 regions have seen the sharpest declines over the last few quarters, and they are the regions that I would expect to see improve, see the benefit of the improvement over the next number of quarters most compared to the others.","Jerald G. Fishman","I think just to try to quantify that just a little bit. If you go back to the fourth quarter, our peak quarter, in industrial revenues, which was about a year or 15 months ago, we were doing -- we did $350 million in the industrial area that quarter. Last quarter, we did below $290 million. In a business with probably 10,000 or more different customers in virtually every geography in the world, that's a massive decline in the short period of time. I mean that's a market that tends to move at glacial speeds. So that just gives you a sense of what it is that is possible for us over the next couple of quarters. But we'll just have to wait and see how that happens.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Sanford Bernstein.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I had just a quick one first on, I guess, the effect of the 14th week. So as I recall from last quarter, you'd suggested that holiday shutdowns and I guess the Asia holidays as well would mitigate or eliminate any potential upside from that 14th week, but you don't seem to be suggesting that now when you're giving color on the seasonal growth embedded in your guidance. Can you give us some feeling for how much additional revenue in this quarter that you just reported that 14th week actually provided, so we can get some better feeling for what the apples-to-apples seasonal growth comparison ought to be?","Jerald G. Fishman","I mean it's purely a guess is what I'd have to say. We believed that probably we lost at least a week to maybe 1.5 weeks of revenue last quarter due to the holidays. Some people think it's 2. Some people think it's this. I mean there are a lot of different analyses of that. Of course it's very hard to be specific about that. But I'd say if you took a number of 1.5 week or something, that probably wouldn't be a bad number.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","But wouldn't you usually have that same loss of revenue in this quarter every single year? So that would be normal wouldn't it?","Jerald G. Fishman","Oh no. Yes, partially that's absolutely true. But when you have a year where the economy is really in the tank and virtually every company that we sold to, including us, it was closed for at least a week and maybe, in Analog's case, 2 weeks, and many of our customers. That tends to be exacerbated from what would normally be people think 3 extra days over Christmas off. So I think when times are good, we see periods where we get through that with almost no change in the Christmas period. And when times are bad, we get a whopping big change. So I think this was more in the latter category than the former.","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And for my follow-up, I want to touch a little bit on this, I guess, peak-to-trough decline in industrial revenue. So there, you're right they're down 20-plus percent from the peak. But is it fair to say that, that peak itself was potentially elevated as the customers were probably overbuilding inventories? Do you have any sort of feeling for how elevated it might have been and like -- how far below are you? What would tend to be sort of a normalized level of typical inventories? What would that decline be if it was off of a normalized level?","Jerald G. Fishman","You're asking very challenging questions that we really don't have...","Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I do try.","Jerald G. Fishman","I know you do, and you can see. I mean it's very hard because when we were shipping at those levels and we went to the customers and went to our sales folks, and said, \"Boy, this looks pretty overheated. Is this really sustainable? And what's going to happen when the inventories rebalance?\" And we got a lot of comments that was very specific with the consumer, customers and I'd say the communications customers that this one probably took 10 million too much, this one took 20 million too much. And we did see a long lineup in the lobby of those kind of customers that were desperate for products then. We didn't see that much in the industrial area, because the customers tend to be smaller and more diversified. So in the communications area, it's a little easier to try and be quantitative about that than in the industrial area, but I don't know. If you say I did 350, how much could that be? It could be $10 million, it could be $20 million, I don't know. It could be $5 million. I don't think it's more than $20 million. But I don't know. I just don't know. When there's too many customers, too many different ordering patterns to be real specific about it.","Vincent T. Roche","Yes. I think a couple of things that might have helped us through the upswing, through the cycle. I think our lead times were very healthy as the tsunami crisis hit last year, and we've kept our lead times very healthy as a company over the last 2.5 years. And also, we paid very close attention to the demand rates as per the end customer rather than factoring in the channel demand. So I think those 2 things helped us to some extent manage both the upswing and the downswing.","Jerald G. Fishman","I think the other thing that we look at, Stacy, a little bit to try to smooth this out as we look at what the growth rate of the industrial business has been over the last couple of years on the average, because this owing supply or demand issues on either side of that end. The kind of numbers that we're planning for our industrial business are commensurate with the industrial business that's grown about 8% to 10% a year. Now I think '11 was a little bit overheated. The year before was a little bit underheated. But the sequential numbers are harder to try to predict because of all the things you're saying that what's the long-term growth rate of that business, and I think with the success we're having in some segments of the industrial business, which are growing at quite strong rates. We think long term that's a good grower for us. And it's going to grow at a rate that is higher than most people believed and that we even believed when we looked at it 3 years ago on the average. Years will be better; years will be worse, but the question you're getting out of trying to predict, how much industrial revenues you're going to get based on the bounce back is just -- we just don't know enough to be quantitative about that. I mean there's something there, I just can't pin point exactly what it is.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Danely JPMorgan.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a quick clarification. If we take out the 14, the 13-week transition, did you guys feel like demand or your revenue this quarter is back to normal seasonality?","Jerald G. Fishman","I don't know. I don't know what normal is in this world any more frankly, but I think what we're -- the guidance that -- the range of guidance that we put out is indicative of the order rates that we're now achieving. That's the best I can say.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's fair. And then in terms of the increase, Jerry, do you think that it's all inventory replenishment or all demand improving or a little bit of both?","Jerald G. Fishman","Well your guess on that is probably as good, if not better, than mine. I think there's certainly some inventory replenishment. As Vince said earlier, many of the large industrial customers are indicating that they're planning to grow this year. And so I think there's probably some of that in there. It's probably a combination of those 2, the ratio between those 2, I just don't know.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then one last clarification, if I may. On the reported quarter, the reason you guys came in at the low end of guidance, was that because consumer and\/or industrial was a little bit lower than you thought?","Jerald G. Fishman","Well I think November and December were worse than we thought at the outset. And then we were worried going into January that we'd miss the lower end of the guidance. I think we had some people around that believed that was the case going into the Christmas period. But January was a better month, and you could really see the inflection point in the order as soon as we came back. So that was very encouraging. And the fact that it stayed strong in the early part or the first couple of weeks in February, which we've now seen is encouraging to us and we're hopeful that continues.","Maria Tagliaferro","Great. Well we just came up on the 6:00 hour, and unfortunately we have quite a few people still in the queue. So I'm going to ask folks to give us a call to the Investor Relations line. And we'll set up a scheduled time, and get back to you today this evening. The number there is (781) 461-3282. And we have a record of who's still on the queue, and we'll be sure to reach out to you. ","So thanks again for joining us on today's call. Just for your information, our call for the second quarter's financial results is scheduled for May 22, 2012, beginning at 5:00 p.m. The release will be out at 4:00. Thanks very much for joining us.
