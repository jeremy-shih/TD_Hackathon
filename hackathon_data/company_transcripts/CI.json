[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded.","We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Will McDowell. Please go ahead, Mr. McDowell.","William McDowell","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I am Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom McCarthy, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Tom will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's full year 2014 financial results as well as our financial outlook for 2015.","As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. Specifically, we use the term labeled \"adjusted income from operations\" and \"earnings per share\" on this same basis as the principal measures of performance for Cigna and our business segments. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com.","In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2015 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.","Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. First, please note that when we discuss the number of covered lives for our global medical customers, we will be doing so on a basis that excludes those individuals that were previously covered under Limited Benefits plans. As a reminder, we exited the Limited Benefits business as of December 31, 2013, as required by the Affordable Care Act regulation.","Second, please note that our definition of adjusted income from operations will change for 2015 reporting in that we will now exclude acquisition-related amortization expense from this operating measure. When we discuss our earnings outlook for 2015 today, it will be on a basis of adjusted income from operations that excludes acquisition-related amortization expense. This is a change compared to the basis on which 2014 results are reported and how we have previously provided our 2014 outlook. In 2015, the impact of excluding acquisition-related amortization expense is approximately $100 million after tax or $0.40 per share.","Third, beginning in 2015, we have simplified our guidance and disclosures for our medical care ratios or MCRs by reporting them on a basis of total Commercial and total Government. The total Commercial ratio encompasses all of our commercial risk products, including medical, pharmacy, dental, stop loss and behavioral products, provided through guaranteed cost or experience-rated funding arrangements in both the United States and internationally. The total Government ratio includes our Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D and Medicaid businesses. To ease the transition, we have provided historical medical care ratios on these bases within our quarterly financial supplement that was posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com this morning.","Lastly, consistent with past practices, when we make any prospective comments on earnings or EPS outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future capital deployment or prior year development of medical costs. Our outlook also excludes the impact from our recently announced acquisition of QualCare, which we do not expect will have a material impact to our financial results in 2015.","And with that, I will turn the call over to David.","David M. Cordani","Thanks, Will. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today.","To begin, I'll review highlights of our full year 2014 financial results and our 2015 outlook. I will then discuss how we will continue to create value for our customers, clients and shareholders in the future. I will also illustrate more specifically how we are creating value in our Seniors business and leveraging our experience and success of that business to drive long-term growth. Then Tom will address our fourth quarter and full year 2014 financial performance in more detail as well as provide the specifics for our outlook for 2015 before we take your questions. And following the Q&A session, I'll wrap up the call with a few closing remarks.","We'll start with some highlights from the year.","Cigna's strong 2014 performance represents the fifth consecutive year of competitively attractive financial results. This outstanding track record of results is driven by the disciplined execution of our growth strategy, all while we continue to invest in new capabilities, expand our offerings and our geographic footprint. Over the past several years, in the face of a particularly challenging and dynamic environment, we have been focused and disciplined with targeted yet meaningful investments to drive innovation, including new clinical programs, aligned incentives for customers, expanded technologies and programs for health care professionals. We have done all this while delivering competitively differentiated results year in and year out.","The full year 2014 consolidated revenues increased 8% to $35 billion, with each business segment delivering strong growth over 2013. We reported adjusted income from operations for the full year of $2 billion or $7.43 per share, which represents a per share increase of 9% over 2013.","Our revenue and earnings performance reflect growth in all of our businesses over the course of the year, a year in which we also grew to more than 85 million customer relationships worldwide and where we continue to generate strong margins and significant free cash flow for the benefit of shareholders. These results position us to once again deliver competitively attractive revenue and earnings growth in 2015.","For 2015, our outlook of 8% to 10% revenue growth and 5% to 10% EPS growth, excluding reserve development recognized in 2014 as well as future capital deployment, reflects the focus and clarity of our strategy and continued strong performance of our team around the world. Tom will walk you through more specifics regarding our outlook later on the call.","Now I'd like to talk about how our guiding framework, global strategy and multiple avenues for growth have enabled our long track record of success and will drive ongoing future value creation.","Across our business, we operate in an ever-changing market landscape with diverse needs across customers, employers, health care professionals and governments. Moving [ph] in this market, we are meeting and exceeding the expectations of our customers and clients around the world by delivering affordable and personalized solutions. As we look to the future, we have built a growth framework to create ongoing value, leverage our differentiated capabilities for the benefit of our customers.","There are 3 components to this framework. First is leveraging our well-positioned existing portfolio of businesses to continue to generate attractive value for our customers and clients. We expect to double the size of our company over the next 7 to 8 years. This will result in an average annual revenue growth rate of 8% to 10%, largely driven by our existing portfolio and focused execution. This continues a track record that we have demonstrated over the last 5 years, and our 2015 outlook of 8% to 10% revenue growth is consistent with this goal.","The second component is targeted and effective capital deployment to create ongoing shareholder value. I would note that, over the past 5 years, we have effectively deployed capital through a balance of investments in our business portfolio, strategic M&A and share repurchase. A good recent example of this is our agreement to purchase QualCare Alliance Networks. This acquisition is directly aligned with our Go Deep and our physician partnership strategies.","Our businesses are generating high margins and are capital efficient, allowing us to both fund attractive organic growth and generate significant free cash flow. This free cash flow provides us with financial flexibility and the opportunity to deploy capital to create additional value for our shareholders. And given the health of our balance sheet and underlying capitalization level of our subsidiaries, we expect to have $1.8 billion of capital available for deployment in 2015.","The third component of our framework where we seek to drive additional value for our shareholders is through new and emerging opportunities. These opportunities include new distribution marketplaces such as public and private exchanges, geographic expansion such as new Medicare Advantage markets and international opportunities, and new buying [ph] segments and service expansion such as medical service organization offerings for the benefit of integrated health care professionals. We are well positioned to pursue each of these potentially attractive future growth opportunities that are aligned with our strategy. As such, we have dedicated resources to fuel future expansion in these areas.","To illustrate how we are leveraging this framework to create value, I'll highlight how this framework applies to our Seniors business. This market segment includes a population with a variety of complex needs, requiring customer engagement and incentive-based clinical resources and programs to drive ongoing success. Our Seniors business pioneered successful physician engagement models, including aligned incentives and collaborative relationships to drive high-quality and a more affordable health care experience for both customers as well as physicians. As we continue to leverage our core physician engagement capabilities across all of our health services businesses, we are focused on key investments that improve affordability, enhance personalized services and drive better clinical outcomes. For example, the strategic investments we're making to enhance our physician insight and data tools will enable our clinical data to be accessible in a real-time fashion for more of our physician partners as well as our service teams. Enabled by our physician engagement model, seniors continue to find our Cigna HealthSpring benefit offerings increasingly compelling. And we expect to have 6% to 8% Medicare Advantage customer growth in 2015.","As for positioning, we continue to be amongst the top 3 players in market share for all of our established markets, and we are posting attractive growth in our newer markets. In 2014, we expanded our Seniors business into Georgia and the Carolinas, where we successfully leveraged existing Cigna commercial networks to develop and implement engaged physician relationships for seniors. Importantly, the quality of care delivered through our engaged physician groups is reflected in our stars ratings, where we increased our membership in 4-star or higher plans from approximately 40% to nearly 60% in 2016. Looking to 2017, we again expect to deliver an increase in this result. These improvements in star ratings have allowed us to enhance our benefit offerings and position our Seniors business to be an earnings accelerant in 2016 and beyond.","Relative to our expanding opportunities, we currently operate Medicaid into eligible plans in Texas and in the Illinois markets. Here, we are leveraging our care coordination capabilities to serve the dual-eligible population within our Medicaid platform. Focusing our growth efforts on improving care for the underserved, including the dual-eligible and aged, blind and disabled populations, complements our proven experience with complex care coordinations, differentiated clinical outcomes and affordability focus. While our Illinois plan is relatively new, having just begun in 2014, our Texas plan has been in operation since 2011 and has a track record of delivering affordable care and better health outcomes. In a testament of our commitment to servicing these customers, our Texas plan recently was acknowledged by the Medicaid Health Plans of America for our cutting-edge, intensive behavioral health programs.","We are well-positioned and have the capital flexibility to pursue these accelerating geographic and market segment expansion opportunities, either organically or through M&A, as Seniors remains a strategic growth priority for us. As a global company, our efforts to leverage these capabilities have also expanded across key markets beyond the United States. In Korea, for example, where the aged population is seeking new solutions to meet their emerging needs, we've developed an innovative and new health membership program targeting seniors known as Heyday. This organically built affinity program delivers value-added services directly to seniors in Korea. And while only a year into this expansion, we now serve more than 300,000 Korean seniors. So overall, we have a clear strategy and the capabilities to deliver value and improve the health and well-being of senior customers today and into the future.","Whether in our Seniors business as we discussed today or other growth businesses we have addressed in previous calls, we will continue to deliver attractive growth, produce and deploy capital effectively, and invest and position ourselves to win in new and emerging markets and segments.","Now to summarize my comments before Tom offers more detail on our 2014 results and expectations for 2015.","Cigna's strong 2014 financial performance extends a multiyear track record of delivering competitively attractive revenue, earnings and free cash flow. Continued execution of our growth strategy is creating value for our customers and clients, complemented by our differentiated capabilities and innovative physician and customer engagement solutions. As a rapidly changing industry and economic environment continues to unfold and new challenges arise, we are positioned to capitalize on new growth opportunities while we continue to leverage our core businesses for growth. And by embracing change, we continue to position our company for successful investing in the future, preparing for significant new opportunities such as those we shared this morning for our Seniors segment, including: in existing programs and markets, new market expansion, new offerings for health care professionals through our medical service organization solutions, new segments such as dual eligibles and new affinity programs such as HeyDay in Korea.","We expect to meet our growth objectives of 8% to 10% on average, doubling the size of our company again over the next 7 to 8 years. And based on our focused strategy, strong market positioning and ability to leverage capital, as well as further opportunities we have for growth, we expect to continue to deliver competitively attractive and sustained long-term EPS growth of 10% to 13% on average, all while continuing to invest back in our company.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas A. McCarthy","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone.","In my remarks today, I will review Cigna's 2014 results and provide our outlook for 2015.","We had another strong year in 2014, with revenue growth of 8% and industry-leading earnings per share growth of 9% over 2013 results. 2014 represents our fifth consecutive year of consistently strong revenue, earnings and EPS growth -- an attractive result both on an absolute and competitive basis. In addition, we continued to generate strong free cash flow in 2014, which resulted in approximately $1.6 billion being returned to shareholders through share repurchase. The strength of our 2014 performance provides us with a solid foundation for growth in 2015.","Now moving to operating results.","Our full year consolidated revenues grew 8% to $35 billion, driven by growth in each of our business segments and in our targeted markets. Earnings grew 3% to $2 billion, and earnings per share grew 9% to $7.43 in 2014. Our ability to grow revenue, earnings and EPS in a challenging operating environment reflects the strength of our underlying businesses and focused execution.","Regarding the segments, I will first comment on our Global Health Care segment. Overall, Global Health Care delivered another good year. 2014 premiums and fees grew 7% to $24.5 billion, reflecting growth in all of our Global Health Care businesses, including ongoing growth in our self-funded programs and specialty products. We ended 2014 with 14.5 million global medical customers, growing by approximately 380,000 customers or 3% for the year.","Full year earnings were $1.65 billion, reflecting business growth, specialty contributions, operating expense efficiency and effective medical cost management.","Turning to medical costs. We continue to deliver medical costs that reflect better health outcomes and strong clinical excellence for our customers and clients as a result of our deep collaborative relationships with physicians and our focus on personalization of care. For our total U.S. commercial book of business, full year medical cost trend was slightly less than the low end of our previous range of 4.5% to 5.5% for 2014. Our commercial medical trend result continues our multiyear track record of industry-leading performance. And given that over 85% of our U.S. Commercial customers are in transfer and ASO funding arrangements, our clients directly benefit from these favorable medical costs.","Regarding medical care ratios. In our U.S. Commercial guaranteed cost business, our full year 2014 medical care ratio or MCR was 81.8% on a reported basis or 82.7% excluding prior year reserve development. Consistent with our expectations, our fourth quarter 2014 guaranteed cost MCR of 86.6% reflects an increased seasonal impact from the growing share of high-deductible plans in our employer group and individual businesses. We also expected and saw this increased seasonal impact across most of our Commercial business, including our stop loss and experience-rated businesses.","Overall, our employer risk businesses continued to deliver solid results in the quarter and throughout the year, reflecting strong pricing, disciplined underwriting and continued effective medical management and physician engagement. Results in our individual business, while still below long-term expectations, continued to improve in the fourth quarter.","In our Government business, our full year 2014 MCR for Medicare Advantage was 83.5% on a reported basis or 84% excluding prior year reserve development, reflecting the impact of medical cost improvement initiatives implemented during 2014.","Moving to operating expenses for 2014. Our total Global Health Care operating expense ratio was 22%. This includes the impact of health reform-related taxes, which added 110 basis points to the expense ratio for the year. Overall, we've had another strong year in our Global Health Care business.","Now I'll discuss the results of our Global Supplemental Benefits business, which continues to deliver attractive growth and profitability.","Premiums and fees grew 14% year-over-year in global supplemental. 2014 earnings in our Global Supplemental Benefits business were $230 million, reflecting attractive operating margins, continued strategic investments to drive future growth and nonrecurring favorable tax items of $21 million after tax recorded in the third quarter. Fourth quarter earnings of $33 million reflect claims seasonality, our funding of long-term strategic investments and the impact from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.","For Group Disability and Life, full year results reflect premium and fee increase of 6% over 2013. 2014 earnings in our group business were $317 million and reflect favorable claim experience in our Life business and a lower operating expense ratio.","For our Corporate and Other Operations, results totaled to an after-tax loss of $197 million for full year 2014.","Overall, our 2014 results reflect revenue earnings growth from each of our business segments and a significant free cash flow as the result of the continued effective execution of our strategy.","Turning to our investment portfolio. For 2014, we reported net realized investment gains of $106 million after tax, coupled with a strong net investment income result. The high quality and diversification of our investment portfolio continued to drive our overall investment results.","Now I will discuss our outlook for 2015. In 2015, we expect to continue to deliver strong financial performance for our shareholders by leveraging our differentiated capabilities to meet and exceed the expectations of our customers and clients by delivering affordable and personalized solutions, effectively deploying capital and targeting new and emerging opportunities where we will seek to drive additional value for our shareholders.","For full year 2015, we expect consolidated revenues to grow in a range of 8% to 10% over 2014, with continued growth across our targeted market segments. We expect full year 2015 consolidated adjusted income from operations to be in the range of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion or $8 to $8.40 per share. As Will noted earlier, our full year 2015 consolidated and business segment adjusted income from operations, as well as earnings per share estimates, now exclude acquisition-related amortization expense.","In 2015, the impact of excluding acquisition-related amortization expense is approximately $0.40 per share or $100 million after tax, including $85 million in our Global Health Care business and $15 million in Global Supplemental Benefits. Lastly, consistent with prior practice, our outlook excludes any contribution from additional capital deployment as well as any prior-year claim development, which in 2014 totaled $53 million after tax.","Putting our 2015 outlook and our 2014 actual results on a comparable basis, that is adjusting for the reserve development reported in our 2014 results and adjusting to a consistent base with -- basis for reporting deal amortization, our outlook for operating earnings in 2015 reflects 3% to 8% growth over 2014, and our outlook for EPS growth is 5% to 10% before considering the impact of additional capital deployment.","I will now discuss the components of our 2015 outlook, starting with Global Health Care. We expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of approximately $1.73 billion to $1.79 billion. This outlook reflects continued benefits from organic revenue growth, specialty contributions, effective medical cost management and operating expense efficiencies. This also includes our updated view of the annual enrollment period results for both Medicare and the public exchange business.","I'll now summarize some of the key assumptions reflected in our Global Health Care earnings outlook for 2015, starting with our customer base. Regarding global medical customers, we expect 2015 customer growth of 1% to 3%. This growth is driven by expected ongoing growth in our Commercial employer business led by continued double-digit customer growth in our Select business, as well as mid- to upper single-digit growth in our Medicare Advantage customers, with some expected reduction in our non-ACA-compliant individual customers.","Turning to medical costs. Our 2015 outlook assumes some increase in medical utilization versus current levels, and this increase has been reflected in our pricing. For our total U.S. Commercial book of business, we expect full year medical cost trends to be in the range of 5% to 6%.","As Will noted earlier, we are changing the basis on which we provide guidance for MCRs to total Commercial and total Government. We believe this basis will provide better insight into our ability to effectively manage medical costs for our Commercial and Seniors customers. For our total Commercial book of business, we expect the 2015 medical care ratio to be in the range of 78% to 79%. This compares to our full year 2014 total Commercial MCR of 78.9% on an operating basis. For our total Government book of business, we expect the 2015 medical care ratio to be in the range of 84.5% to 85.5%. This compares to our full year 2014 total Government MCR of 84.7% on an operating basis.","Regarding operating expenses, our 2015 Global Health Care operating expense ratio is expected to be in the range of 20.5% to 21.5%. Overall, we expect full year 2015 Global Health Care earnings to be approximately $1.73 billion to $1.79 billion. We believe this is a competitively attractive result reflecting our focus on growing segments of the health care market and continued strong execution of our business strategy.","Now moving to the other components of our outlook.","For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we continue to expect strong top line growth. We expect earnings in the range of $230 million to $250 million. This represents earnings growth of 3% to 12% after adjusting for $21 million of nonrecurring favorable tax items recognized in this segment in 2014. Regarding the Group Disability and Life business, we expect full year 2015 earnings in the range of $320 million to $340 million. Regarding our remaining operations, that is Other Operations and Corporate, we expect a loss of $180 million for 2015.","So all in, for full year 2015, we expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion or $8.00 to $8.40 per share. Our outlook continues to exclude the impact of prior year claim development or any future capital deployment. While we do not anticipate the impact of future capital deployment in our EPS outlook, we do expect the additional free cash flow that we generate will be deployed for the benefit of shareholders either through value-creating acquisitions or share repurchase.","Overall, these results represent a competitively attractive outlook and underscore the benefit of our diverse and differentiated portfolio of businesses. I would also note that due to the timing of some strategic investments, as well as the growth of our Medicare Part D business, which traditionally reports low first quarter earnings, we expect our first quarter 2015 earnings will be lower than first quarter of 2014.","Now moving to our 2015 capital management position and outlook. Overall, we continue to have excellent financial flexibility. Our subsidiaries remain well capitalized and are generating significant free cash flow to the parent, with a strong return on capital in each of our business segments. Our capital deployment strategy and priorities have not changed. These priorities are: providing the capital necessary to support the growth of our ongoing operations; pursuing M&A activity with a focus on acquiring capabilities and scale to further grow in our targeted areas of focus; and after considering these first 2 items, we'll return capital to shareholders, primarily through share repurchase.","Regarding free cash flow. During 2014, we repurchased 18.5 million shares of stock for approximately $1.6 billion, and we ended the year with parent company cash of approximately $400 million. For full year 2015, we expect subsidiary dividends of approximately $1.7 billion, driven by strong performance in each of our business segments. After considering all sources and uses of parent company cash, including the funding of our recently announced acquisition of QualCare, this outlook implies we would have approximately $1.8 billion available for capital deployment in 2015, including approximately $115 million we deployed to repurchase 1.1 million shares from January 1 through February 4.","Our free cash flow outlook reflects the industry-leading margins and returns on capital in our businesses, and a high level of capital efficiency, particularly from our fee-based businesses. This capital efficiency allows us to fund attractive organic growth while continuing to generate significant free cash flow to be deployed for the benefit of shareholders.","Now to recap. Our full year 2014 consolidated results reflect the strength of our diversified portfolio of global businesses and a continued track record of effective execution of our focused strategy. The fundamentals of our business remain strong, as evidenced by strong growth in revenue and earnings, industry-leading medical costs and quality outcomes, and continued strong free cash flow. Based on the strength of these results, we are confident on our ability to achieve our full year 2015 earnings outlook.","And with that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Justin Lake with JPMorgan.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question, David, can you walk us through your view of initial 2015 guidance from the lens of a growth perspective versus your typical targets? And maybe talk about some of the key headwinds, tailwinds, investment spending, et cetera that you see in '15.","David M. Cordani","Sure, Justin. So first, the headlines. We're pleased with the 8% to 10% revenue outlook and continued growth of our well-positioned businesses; as Tom noted, the 3% to 8% earnings growth on a same-store basis; and the underlying 5% to 10% EPS growth on a same-store basis. And as we've done in the past, we will continue to make ongoing investments in our company while seeking to generate an attractive and competitively differentiated outcomes for our business. Also very importantly, all the numbers I just referenced exclude the impact of the $1.8 billion of deployable capital we'll have for 2015. As it relates to tailwinds, you can think about several tailwinds for us: clearly, the revenue and customer base growth, number one; two, expense leverage -- we have a track record of continuing to generate efficiency gains and expense leverage, some of which we redeploy for the benefit of innovation. Third, ongoing specialty penetration. We have a good track record of driving further specialty penetration. And fourth, some improvement in the performance of our individual portfolio of businesses. As it relates to headwinds, you can think about a few: as we've discussed before, the impact of specialty pharma on the overall medical cost trend and specifically, for example, its impact on Seniors portfolio of business; two, as you know, another step-up in the industry tax -- a portion of it, our assumptions are, will not pass through fully in the Medicare arena. And thirdly, for us, given our global nature, some FX impact into 2015. But taken as a whole, we feel good about the 2015 impact that we're able to generate here with growth, earnings and EPS growth; capital positioning; and then finally, Justin, the positioning this gives us for 2016, as we would expect to have further earnings accelerants off of the positioning we've taken relative to our Seniors business in that portfolio. So taken as a whole, we're pleased with the outlook for '15.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then David, you mentioned the capital deployment not being in the numbers. Every one of your peers now include share repurchase in their guidance. I'm just curious if you could tell us, give us an update on what -- your strategy around not including any benefit from that $1.8 billion in the guidance going forward.","David M. Cordani","Sure, Justin. We've always been quite transparent providing the updates each quarter, so stepping back, our capital deployment priorities are clear and unchanged: serve the existing needs of the corporation and support the underlying growth and investments; two, targeted and strategically attractive M&A; three, return to shareholders. And to your point, our track record demonstrates our preferred approach there is relative to share repurchase. And our objective is to provide you the transparency of what the free capital available for deployment and allow you to draw your judgments in terms of how you want to look at that. The headline here is really strong and well-performing balance sheet, really strong and well-positioned operating subsidiaries from an underlying capitalization level that provides the $1.8 billion available for deployment. And I would suggest you look at our track record relative to how effectively and how efficiently we've deployed that and we provide updates each quarter.","Operator","The next question is from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Could you talk to the drivers in your outlook for the global supplemental business? It seems like the growth rate, and maybe some of that is the impact of foreign currency, is lower than we might have expected for a typical year.","Thomas A. McCarthy","Thanks, Matt. It's Tom. Our Global Supplemental Benefits business has a track record of building strong revenue and earnings growth. And it's focused by leveraging the broad and innovative distribution and strong analytic and customer insight capabilities. We saw that result in '14 and we're really seeing that result in '15 also. There are a few layers to the result in '15, though. Our outlook for 2015 earnings of $230 million to $250 million reflects continued strong operating margins; the continued funding of growth initiatives; and continued currency pressure, as you suggested, of about $10 million to $15 million after tax. So if you adjust for the $21 million onetime tax benefit reported in '14, the deal amortization change and the impact of the currency pressure, the underlying growth for global supp is in the 8% to 18% range.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay, that makes more sense. And I'm sorry, did you give a revenue outlook on global supp for '15?","Thomas A. McCarthy","No, we don't intend to provide revenue outlooks by business segment, but we're expecting continued strong revenue growth in global supp.","Operator","The next question is from Joshua Raskin with Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I want to talk a little about the public exchanges and the impact on the Commercial business. I guess, first, if you could help us size what the revenues were in public exchanges this year; and maybe what the impact on the overall Commercial MLR was; and then as a part of that, what assumptions you've made regarding the 3Rs.","David M. Cordani","Josh, it's David. I'll give you some context relative to size and scope of that business in terms of revenue. I'll ask Tom to give you a little bit relative to the MCRs as well as the -- our positioning relative to the 3Rs. Consistent with our prior conversations, we've positioned this book of business for 2014 as well as 2015. Our expectations is it will be a small portion of our overall franchise. Think of it, in order of magnitude, as we've talked about before, about 3% of the overall franchise revenue in terms of 2014. And we would expect it to be in the similar range in 2015, with some puts and takes in terms of the runoff of the grandfathered business and some growth on the on exchange business. So I think the headline here that's quite important is a small percentage of the overall portfolio that we've been seeking to manage in the context of the performance of the franchise. Tom, could you put a little more color on the MCR?","Thomas A. McCarthy","Sure. So Josh, the MCR dynamics in individual have been improving over the course of the year. So also reflecting, of course, increased seasonality in the fourth quarter. It's just basically been improving from our initial expectations in the year. It's still a little higher than where we'd like to be. That improvement has been driven basically by both a better assessment of the early part of the year claims as they developed a little favorably and a little bit of an improvement in the run rate and, as you kind of suggested, the 3Rs. So just a couple of minutes on the 3Rs. Our year-end accrual for 3Rs now totals about $200 million after tax. The majority of the accrual continues to be related to the reinsurance element of the 3R program, with risk adjusters representing the higher amount of the remaining balance and a smaller amount for risk corridor recoveries. And I'll give you some more specific color on our approach. We have accrued reinsurance at the 80% coinsurance level consistent with the design of the program. We have not accrued any risk adjuster impact for our Texas business due to the current lack of industry data. And we accrued amounts under the risk corridor because we're comfortable with the statutes and administrative guidelines that support that program. So as you know, there's some interplay among each of these program elements, but overall, we're very comfortable with our total accrual.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So I guess more specifically, think about -- I know it's a small portion, but obviously, the MLR is elevated. I'm just trying to figure out the commercial MLR for 2015 with the understanding that you guys have moved the buckets around a little bit. But I'm assuming there's an assumption of the public exchanges getting a little bit better. You've got the industry tax uptick, which assuming you priced for it, is actually a little bit of a tailwind as well, and the guidance is for, let's call it 40 basis points of improvement at the midpoint. So are there -- I'm just trying to think if there's any other moving parts? My guess is you've got a little bit of a benefit on the hep C and Specialty Pharmacy from the new Gilead relationship announced yesterday. So I'm just -- is there anything underlying? Are you guys just basically assuming apples to apples on your total -- on your sort of commercial book flat type of MLRs with a couple of these moving parts helping you a couple basis points?","David M. Cordani","Well, Josh, I think you've got the moving parts pretty well nailed. So again, our MCR outlook for commercial in 2015 is 78% to 79% compared to 78.9% on an operating basis in '14. And it is driven by the items you mentioned. It reflects continued good performance in our employer group business, some benefit from pricing for the incremental industry fee in 2015 and some improvements in individual. And that essentially summarizes the major moving pieces.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And I'm sorry, did you guys quantify the FX headwind in the fourth quarter?","David M. Cordani","Well, in the fourth quarter, things have been moving around. I'd say low single-digit million dollars impact. So I didn't before, but that's about the quantity.","Operator","The next question is from A.J. Rice with UBS.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Maybe first, I'll just ask you if you don't mind about the private exchange dynamic. I know that was a hot topic about a year ago. It didn't -- it doesn't seem like we're hearing as much about it. But in your ASO book of business, did you see much attrition? And can you just sort of comment on the state of play from your perspective in private exchanges at this point?","David M. Cordani","It's David. Just a little color on our view and our positioning and then our results. First, and most -- we continue to view that the private exchanges may create a sustainable attractive long-term market. As such, we positioned ourself in just about all of the various private exchanges that are in the marketplace today. In addition to that, we have our own proprietary exchange and a dedicated leadership team managing the overall exchange activities. As it relates to outcomes to your point, there had been a lot of conversation in the market as we expected. But consistent with our prior dialogues, we did not expect to see a significant amount of movement in the overall landscape in the marketplace in '14 or '15, and that's what manifested for both the industry as a whole, as well as for ourselves. So specific to Cigna, some movement in both directions, but it all nets out to a de minimis amount of activity. Lastly, as we look to 2016, as I noted, we're well-positioned in the respective exchanges. We'll be actively engaged if -- target clients that, we believe, align very well with our value proposition, present good growth opportunities. But slow activity thus far in line with our expectations.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And maybe just for the follow-up. You mentioned in the prepared remarks MA is an area you would look to -- for potential capital deployment opportunities, acquisitions. And thinking about that, are you looking -- what would be an attractive opportunity for you? Something that just broadens your geography? Or you're looking for something that you think you can run better than it's currently being run? Maybe add some color on what would be attractive there.","David M. Cordani","Sure, AJ. We've been very consistent relative to MA is, over the long term, a very attractive growth opportunity. And our view is that a sustainable MA program has 2 major dimensions; effective consumer engagement and personalization capabilities and then strong clinical partnership and physician engagement capabilities with a value-based reimbursement structure, which is what our model is. As it relates to capital employment, you hit the nail on the head. We see both organic geographic expansion opportunities, as well as inorganic geographic expansion opportunities. So that would be one, targeted geographies that are inorganically attractive. Second would be if you expand a little more broadly relative to Seniors and the broader chronic population, additional capabilities or opportunities to serve the Medicare, Medicaid duals or other parts of the population we think are underserved. As I noted in my prepared remarks, we've seen good success in Texas, emerging success in Illinois, and we're going to seek to grow those programs. So those would be the 2 areas for capital deployment: geographic; as well as what we would call segment expansion.","Operator","The next question is from Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First question, just wondering if you could drill into the Select growth, and it looks like the trajectory's still intact there -- double-digit growth. Can you maybe just talk a bit about how much is being driven by continued market shift downstream into ASO in terms of how much increased ASO market penetration you're seeing as -- and then as compared to some of the market share gains that you may be driving in that segment?","David M. Cordani","Sure, Scott. It's David. First, relative to Select. So we define Select as employers with 51 to 250 employees, so that's our Select Segment. To your point, it has been and continues to be a very attractive growth segment for us, continuing to notch double-digit customer base growth for us and something we're quite pleased with. Our approach to this base is somewhat different than the marketplace. So it's to be consultative and work with employers to design the right consumer engagement and benefit designs and network structures, and then offer multiple funding alternatives, one of which is, as you referenced, an ASO proposition that gives them much more transparency and tighter alignment. As you know, the overall employer landscape in the U.S. is not growing, shrinking up market, a little bit of growth down market. So there's little bit of growth. But net-net, we're taking share in this space and we tend to take share in this space from more traditionally designed financing alternatives for healthcare, to more progressively designed health engagement programs, incentive-aligned programs that have a high degree of transparency, and the outlook there is very positive.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, just on the follow-up question. Helpful if you could just walk us through your thoughts on the cost components for cost trend relative to the overall 5% to 6%. And then, just within RX, what type of impact year-over-year you think that the new preferred partnership with Gilead for Harvoni could benefit?","Thomas A. McCarthy","Scott, it's Tom. So we're really pleased with our medical trend results. And just to repeat, we improved our outlook for medical cost trends throughout the year. We ended up delivering our cost trend below the 4.5% low end of our improved range and building on the very strong trends results we reported for several years. Our outlook for 2015 of 5% to 6% reflects some uptick in utilization and some increase in pharmacy trend, especially drug costs and, of course, some impacts from the flu. Components are generally in the mid-single-digit range with maybe pharmacy in the double-digit range.","David M. Cordani","Scott, [indiscernible] to your question relative to the specialty item. You're correct. We will see some impact -- a positive impact. But per prior discussions, our team has effectively managed the specialty drug component and specifically, the hep C specialty component in 2014. We're pleased with the recent announcement we have with Gilead. And importantly, I would note that both organizations have committed to innovating a performance-based and an outcome-based component to the ongoing activities. So we're pleased with the overall development that transpired, but also the commitment of both organizations to collaborate on an outcome-based program for the benefit of customers as well.","Operator","The next question is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. I just wanted to drill into the government MLR a little bit. I guess, when you say operationally that the MLR was like 84.7%, that's x development, right? So you're basically saying MLR should be relatively flat to up in 2015 versus 2014? And I guess, when I think about PDP coming in worse, I thought that you guys probably would have made some progress there next year. And then MA, obviously, you've got a funding gap, but it seemed like there was a lot that you were doing in 2014 to try to offset that. So just trying to understand how you think about the margins.","Thomas A. McCarthy","Yes, Kevin. It's Tom. And you've got the dynamics right. Our -- we've got an outlook of 84.5% to 85.5% compared to the 84.7% operating basis result delivered in '14. And as you say, that excludes prior development reported in 2014. And the picture, I think, is generally like this. We're generally expecting stable Medicare MCRs between Medicare Advantage and PDP with some mix impact actually driving the dynamic here as we're growing some of the higher MCR Medicaid business we have as a portion of the portfolio. Again, all in the margin, but that's generally the result. And I think the outlook calls generally for a stable result.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess when you talk about accelerating the MA -- I'm sorry, the government kind of business in 2016 and beyond, is it accelerated from a revenue perspective off the kind of 6% to 8% that you're looking for this year in a membership basis? Or is it margins? Is it both? How do we think about that?","David M. Cordani","Kevin, it's David. Again, I think you had the right lever. So one, we're pleased with the outlook we have for 2015 from a growth standpoint. As Tom noted, generally speaking, stable MCRs. As we look to 2016, we would expect to be able to grow both revenue, as well as margin. As I noted in my prepared remarks, we expect to see further improvement in the Stars Ratings, for example. And the positioning we took in 2015 was to position products in key markets within expectation, and what we saw was a step-up in 2016 Stars. So we will see both revenue contribution going into 2016, as well as margin expansion contribution in 2016, therefore, an earnings accelerant.","Operator","The next question is from Christine Arnold with Cowen.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","A couple of this and thats. The CRomnibus exempted the expatriate businesses from the health insurance fee. Is there a quantifiable impact there?","David M. Cordani","Christine, it's David. First and foremost, there have been a variety of administrative release that took place post the passage of the bill back in 2012 and up to, as you referenced, the CRomnibus because the administration recognized that there was an unintended consequence to that business. We're pleased with the outcome from the CRomnibus, legislatively rectifying that for the benefit of global employers. And I would suggest to you the biggest impact here is taking away the administrative complexity that applying the ACA to the global employers expatriate benefit business would create, that was putting a burden on that business portfolio that we were managing through; that's the biggest benefit. There's a small economic benefit, but that's the -- that's a few of the [ph] byline. The bigger piece is it cleans it up for purposes of global employers not to be exposed to that.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, can you talk about why first quarter '15 will be lower than first quarter '14 and give us some kind of order of magnitude on the factors? And then, do you think you need Medicaid in order to serve the duals? Or you're still kind of the view that you've got the portfolio you need for those duals?","Thomas A. McCarthy","Christine, it's Tom. First, I'll address the first quarter earning spend. Of course, just to reiterate, we're expecting first quarter 2015 earnings to be lower than the first quarter of 2014. And we attribute it to 2 things: strategic investments; and the growth of our Part D business in the first quarter. On the strategic investment side, I think about additional start-up costs in Medicaid expansions, increased grant spend compared to 2014, and the Part D impact reflects both the first quarter pressure typical in Part D, given the benefit structure -- we all know that Part D first quarter results tend to be low -- and the impacts of the drug transition requirements for new customers. So all in, on a comparable basis, we're expecting first quarter '15 to be lower than first quarter '14.","David M. Cordani","Christine, it's David. On your second part -- and pretty efficient working in multiple questions here. At a headline level, as we've discussed before and I noted, duals, ABD, et cetera, in targeted geographies continue to present an attractive opportunity for us because we believe they're underserved as it relates to clinical care coordination. And our clinical programs actually play quite affectively there as noted in our Texas program. We're going to seek to grow those activities organically, and then opportunistically as we noted in our M&A priorities, opportunistically for geographic density. We will also look to dual capabilities from an M&A standpoint. So I would view that as both organic and inorganic opportunities for us.","Operator","The next question is from Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So just following up on one of the earlier questions here for PDP specifically, the very last quarter you highlighted some pressures around specialty drugs and a higher brand mix, and maybe just how did that continue to play out or evolve in the fourth quarter? And then, related to that, you saw pretty strong annual enrollment -- growth in the annual enrollment period, again, about 200,000-plus lives. So what are your expectations on those costs continuing into next year?","Thomas A. McCarthy","Thanks, Andy. It's Tom. I'll start and then David will address some of the growth issues. So as you pointed out, PDP results do reflect higher drug costs in the fourth quarter and the full year. And that includes some impact from the mix in channel of drug purchases and some impact from specialty drugs, so both. We've taken actions to try and improve results here -- that will improve results here. We made network and formulary adjustments when we merged the HealthSpring and Cigna Part D plans for 2015, so that resulted in a leaner formulary and expanded utilization plan -- management for the merged plans, which we expect will improve cost. As you pointed out, we also expect some favorable impact from our recent agreement with Gilead on hep C drugs. But we have factored some ongoing pressure in Part D into our 2015 outlook.","David M. Cordani","Relative to growth, as Tom noted, we merged the HealthSpring and the legacy Cigna programs and sought to take the best of both organizations. For 2015, we -- our growth efforts, we're targeting the chooser population and we saw a very good traction in our sales efforts there. We'd note that our early results through January from a utilization and performance standpoint for the new population are in line with our expectation for that chooser population, meaning the aggregate utilization levels, importantly, the mix of utilization by generic and otherwise. And as Tom noted, we expect, generally speaking, stable MCRs going from 2014 to '15 for this portfolio. And again, it presents an opportunity for further earnings expansion looking into 2016.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And just maybe a -- changing gears a little bit to follow-up question here. A little bit early, but for the national account selling season, I mean, anything to highlight for us as you start really heading into it? Have you -- how much business do you guys have up for renewal to maybe versus an average year? And any opportunities out there that you guys are really looking to target?","David M. Cordani","Sure, Andy. As you noted, it's early in the cycle. But to give you some color -- and again, when I give you color, just -- we'll define what we talk about in national account, so commercial employers with 5,000 or more employees that are multistate. We're actually seeing a pretty robust pipeline of new opportunities unfold. So it's unfolding both meaningful scale and early in the cycle. So we're seeing a robust pipeline begin to unfold early in the cycle. And with an elevation -- a further elevation in intensity looking for what we call engagement and incentive-based programs, exploring a lot of the value-based network configurations and the like, which play very well to our strategy. As it relates to the last part of your question, the percent of our book that's out to bid, we see a smaller percentage of our book that's out to bid for 2016 than we did prior year, and that's consistent with the dialogue we had last year. We indicated that we had an elevated percentage based on procurement cycle. So we managed through that queue pretty well for 2015. And now looking to 2016, while the smaller percentage of our book of business out to bid and, again, we're seeing a pretty nice robust pipeline beginning to unfold early in the cycle.","Operator","The next question is from Ralph Giacobbe with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Can you give us a little more sense of expectations for ASO membership growth versus maybe risk for 2015? And you guys have talked a lot about the Select Segment, but just interested in thoughts maybe more broadly as well since there seems to be more movement within the ASO segment amongst peers.","David M. Cordani","Sure, Ralph. It's David. As you know, the vast majority of our commercial business, U.S. commercial business, is ASO. So as we're able to grow our portfolio, the preponderance of that is ASO-oriented. I'd also note that our expectation, as the results unfold and in line with the guidance that Tom provided, the 1% to 3% customer growth, which excludes our QualCare network acquisition, we would expect that our guaranteed cost lives, or our risk lives, would decrease because of the run off of the individual non-ACA compliant lives, so very important. As we get into the year, we'll provide you more detail as that manifests itself. But net-net, you should think about our growth as being predominantly ASO-oriented, and that transcends through Select, the regional segment, et cetera. And we see good traction there.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, just in terms of just the competitive environment for ASO broadly?","David M. Cordani","Well, the competitive environment -- maybe I'll flip it around a little bit the other way, and then try to answer your competitive environment. The buying environment, so the client portfolio -- and we call them clear as [ph] clients, clients continue to seek what we call -- you might call alternative funding, we'll call transparent funding -- so the demand for more transparent funding continues to grow as employers are seeking to get alignment of incentives and better visibility through how their funds are being deployed and align the incentives for their employees or customers. And so that trend continues. So hence, the competitive environment, competitors are seeing more ASO activity as well. For Cigna, that's good for us because we're extremely well-positioned in that environment from benefit design, the consultative nature, and very importantly, the employer reporting and insights that go along with that monthly, quarterly and annually to provide the guidance in terms of what's transpiring. So yes, elevation, but it's elevation because of the client demand, not competitive activity. And client demand continues to go up.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's fair. And then, second question, can you talk about the accretion you've captured from the Catamaran deal in 2014? And maybe what you expect incremental for 2015? And then, your Specialty is separate from that deal. Is there any timeline or decision on whether you want to keep it that way or if you're exploring options at this point?","David M. Cordani","Ralph, I'll try to be responsive. Again, real efficient in getting a bunch of questions in here. For pharmacy, more broadly, as you know, we have a wholly-owned pharmacy organization that we continue to invest in. It's performing well as evidenced by our strong clinical outcomes, continued customer growth and strong earnings performance. And we continue to invest in that. So relative to your latter question on Specialty, we run our own Specialty operations within the organization. It's performing well. Our team continues to look to means to further expand and strengthen that, either through collaboration or otherwise. But we're investing in and continue to run that on our own. As for results, and per prior conversations, for 2014, our results tracked in line with our expectations. In fact, they tracked a little bit ahead of our expectations largely because of actions we took around rate and pace of investments, the timing of that and inherent level. So we actually were a little bit ahead of our track record for 2014. And for 2015, our overall targets for our pharmacy business are in line with our expectations, maybe slightly favorable for the overall franchise.","Operator","The next question is from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners.","Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to follow-up on the Select and the ASO mix shift that moved from a stop loss perspective. So I'm trying to understand firstly whether the company that just do stop loss are competing on a bundled or an unbundled basis with all of you? And it looks like United and Aetna have started to play a bigger role here.","David M. Cordani","Ana, it's David. First and foremost, as we've talked now for multiple years around the Select space and ASO, ASO stop loss, variety of funding mechanisms, we believed, and it's proven out, we believe that there will be increasing demand. We believe that's a result of the increasing competitive activity, and we believe to be successful we'd have to continue to innovate. And that's what's transpiring in the marketplace. As it relates to standalone, if you'll -- stop loss players in the space, I don't see that as a primary competitive disruptor largely because of the impact of integration here. So if you step back, what makes these programs work is not a stop loss program. What makes these programs work is getting the benefit alignment laid out with the right incentives, the network configuration appropriate, the clinical programs aligned. For example, we have the ability, and we do, do on-site biometric screening, on-site coaching for a 100 lives employer. That's a new model, to be able to do that and bring that on board for a client and identify the 1, 2 or 3 high-risk individuals who are not incurring costs today, but we need to engage clinically with. And integrating all of that with the ASO funding mechanism, stop loss when it makes sense for that employer, as well as the reporting, that's the core of our value proposition and we continue to see strong demand for that today and into the future. And we would expect, again, competitors to step into this space because there's a significant amount of demand. Key to us is the results we're delivering and ongoing innovation.","Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","And does that mean then, David, that because of your integration, you can keep your pricing more steady? And the 65-ish percent loss ratios that you used to disclose anyway a while ago, still hold?","Thomas A. McCarthy","Ana, it's Tom. I would think about the standalone stop loss segment as a totally different market than the market we're serving. Again, our approach focuses on the integrated benefits of actually more effectively managing medical cost. And the standalone stop loss carriers, you typically don't have that feature. In addition, we do have some built-in advantages versus them. I mean, we already have this customer in our sights, so we have one set of acquisition costs that they have to pay -- incremental acquisition cost to secure this customer, and we have a lot better insight into the underlying claims data, so our ability to effectively approach the program is very superior. So we don't really find ourselves in what sometimes can be a hypercompetitive standalone stop loss market, not really a market we're computing in. We don't sell stop loss unless we write the underlying program. And when we're selling stop loss, it's part of an integrated package. So the competitive dynamics for the standalone market are very different than the competitive dynamics we see.","Operator","The next question is from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","My question is also on the stop loss business. Is that business included in the commercial MLR that you're giving us now, in the total commercial MLR?","David M. Cordani","Yes. Total commercial MLR will include all of our risk businesses in commercial.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So just by the growing mix of that in your commercial MLR, it should be pulling the loss ratio down by maybe 100 basis points? Is that a fair number? So does that mean that -- or is it rising in loss ratio on that book of business, so that it's not pulling it down as much going forward?","David M. Cordani","Yes, Peter. I have to tell you, I haven't done that calculation. But obviously, we're not seeing it in the results, so I don't -- I think you might be missing a little -- something there. But just a couple of things. First, the loss ratio on stop loss is lower than the average overall loss ratio, but the premium density in the other businesses is pretty high. So I'd be surprised if there was a 1 point impact, but we'll do that math. Second, on stop loss, we actually would expect some modest increase in the stop loss loss ratio as we continue to sell disproportionately in the lower end. And those customers tend to have a more premium density, so less of an expense factor in the result and a higher MCR. Again, very attractive MCR, so it's not like it's worse profitability. The bottom line margin is still very attractive for the -- that stop loss business. But the dynamics in the MLR are a little higher. So I would expect that there's marginal impact probably from this change, but I'll do a little more careful look at that.","Operator","The next question is from Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just wanted to come back to capital deployment again. And I heard your comments on Medicare Advantage and things generally. But when we think about opportunities sort of broadly here, are you -- do you think opportunities are better at this point domestically? Or you still think international is kind of a better opportunity?","David M. Cordani","Chris, it's David. As it relates to inorganic capital deployment, we have 4 priorities and the 4 priorities have remained the same. These are not in order. These are the 4 priorities: further our global footprint, Medicare Advantage and dual capabilities, further our retail-based capabilities, and then what we call Go Deep bolt-on capabilities for our portfolio. So I wouldn't separate international as more than or less than for 2015 versus the last year. It's within our portfolio when we've been opportunistic and focused in terms of opportunities outside the U.S, as well as inside the U.S.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then, my follow-up is just on sort of overall growth to the company, and specifically in the health care segment. I mean, I'm just trying to figure out, you're growing your revenues 8% to 10%. Obviously, the bottom line isn't growing in line with that. Obviously, PPD is having an impact. But do you -- can you give us a sense for when you think you'll at least start to get some more leverage down the P&L? Is it -- is 2015 sort of the last truly difficult year and we should start to see some leverage next year? I know you're not going to give guidance. But just, again, big picture-wise, just trying to figure out the trajectory of growth.","David M. Cordani","Well, the direct answer to your question and then a little more color is yes. A little more color is as we talked about the 2015 outlook, we're pleased with it, with the 8% to 10% revenue growth outlook. And then, the 3-day percent earnings growth outlook on the same-store basis and the 5% to 10% EPS growth outlook without capital deployment. As we said, looking to 2016, we see margin expansion opportunities within the health care business. Margin expansion opportunities, specifically in the senior space, both for MA, as well as PDP. We see further margin expansion opportunities within our individual block of business where we've seen some improvement move from '14 to '15. And then, we'll see further scale leverage beyond the ongoing fundamentals of our strong performing employer business. So margin expansion opportunities exist in 2016 and '17 and beyond, and we're quite excited about that.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Wright with Sterne Agee.","Brian M. Wright - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And I apologize if I missed this, but did you give us some color on the number of PDP lives to be added in '15?","David M. Cordani","We didn't, Brian. It's about -- we ended up 1:1 enrollment period. It's about 250,000 more lives than we had at the end of the year.","Brian M. Wright - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, just one follow-up. First of all, thanks for the consolidated commercial MLR. We've been waiting for a decade, so thrilled to have that. But the conspiracy theorist in me looks at how you're reporting now, and you have another peer's been very vocal about kind of large-scale acquisition in this space, and you're kind of reporting segments very nicely that would make consolidating 2 models pretty easily. So just any comments on that.","David M. Cordani","Brian, I think you may be able to work for the NSA if you're going try to connect those dots. But the -- really, what you have is continued refinement and responsiveness. We actually chose to provide 2 MCRs versus 1 because there are different attributes within the government portfolio business versus the commercial business. And while we had alternatives, we believe that, that was more customer-friendly and provided the transparency to drive the dialogue on a go-forward basis. And as we have in the past, and as we will on a go forward basis, we'll try to give you as much color as possible in terms of the underlying drivers of the overall business portfolio. But this was an attempt to be, again, responsive to the market, but also maintaining appropriate amount of transparency and not go to a single loss ratio, but provide 2 loss ratios for the domestic health business.","Operator","The next question is from the Dave Windley with Jefferies.","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","My question's on Medicare Advantage. David, wondering if through the AAP here and your changes in the mid-Atlantic market, specifically if your view is that those changes -- network, and to the extent they were benefit design as well, are complete and set you up for a more normal contribution from that market in 2016?","David M. Cordani","In your comments, Dave, were pointed toward 2016, so put MA back in context. We're pleased in aggregate with the M&A -- MA outlook for 2015 from a customer growth, the 6% to 8% customer growth. You're correct. You draw attention back to a market that we sought to do some repositioning in, and we're feeling the final impact of that, or a final meaningful impact to that repositioning in 2015 in terms of both the lack of life growth. So even in the 6% to 8%, the lack of life growth in that market is fully contemplated in the 6% to 8%. And we would expect, as we step into 2016, an opportunity to see improvement in performance there. So that's a contributor as we look to the future, but part of that repositioning is being felt in 2015.","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And then, sticking with that, is that also something that you think can have another positive impact to Stars Ratings when they come out later this year?","David M. Cordani","Our organization has demonstrated significant improvement in Stars as I noted going from 40 to 60 for 2016. We were pleased with that outcome. It was in line with our expectations. And as I noted previously, we would expect to see a further improvement going from '16 to '17. I'm not going to comment on individual market activities. But more importantly, our organization is highly focused on the intricacies of the Stars program. And importantly, making sure we're given the right service experience and clinical experience, both medical and pharmacy, for the benefit of our customers, and doing so in a way to move the Stars Rating up in 2017 to another step function off of the very attractive movement we made going to '16.","Operator","Our last question is from Michael Baker with Raymond James.","Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","David, I was wondering if you could give us some color on how you're positioning your proprietary exchange offering. I know at this point, private exchanges has been pretty de minimis to the business. But just curious, is really differentiation around enhanced engagement and strengthened guarantees, as well as some ben admin element that increases stickiness?","David M. Cordani","Michael, so relative to our proprietary exchange capabilities, as you would expect, those capabilities are largely focused on what we'll call down market, so think about Select Segment and a portion of the regional employer portfolio. It's a single carrier, as you would expect, exchange alternative. The value prop -- so let's go into the value prop. The value prop is primarily to enable a further retail experience for individuals to get them more actively engaged in the selection of their personal benefits. And we know that when that transpires, whether through a private exchange or other mechanisms because we do this every day without private exchanges, you get a higher level of awareness, a higher level of engagement, a higher level of ownership of the individual and their benefits and their understanding of what's there, That's the primary mechanism. And then you're able to drive the appropriate personalization or efficiency that works for them. So using your term, consumer engagement or personalization, there's a primary attribute there. As I noted previously though, we've expected this marketplace more broadly to unfold slowly and it is. Our team has seen some success. And we have a dedicated team of resources that will continue to focus on this, but we have not banked on, nor are we banking on a significant step function in revenue, customer lives or earnings growth here. Rather, we've positioned ourselves to have smart optionality to the extent this market moves forward very positively.","Operator","I'll now turn the call over to David Cordani for closing remarks.","David M. Cordani","Thank you. So to conclude, I just want to offer some points from our morning discussion.

At this time, all callers are in a listen-only mode.","We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedures on how to enter queue to ask questions at that time. As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen this conference, including the question-and-answer session, is being recorded.","We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Will McDowell. Please go ahead, Mr. McDowell.","William McDowell - Cigna Corp.","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I'm am Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me this morning are; David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric Palmer, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Eric will cover a number of topics including Cigna's third quarter 2018 financial results, as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2018.","As noted in our earnings release when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States otherwise known as GAAP. Specifically, we use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, shareholders net income is contained in today's earnings release which is posted in the investor relations section of cigna.com.","In our remarks today we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2018 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.","Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, I note that in the third quarter we recorded special items totaling to a charge of $138 million, or $0.56 per share, primarily to reflect the impact of merger-related transaction costs and a litigation matter. As described in today's earnings release special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations in our discussion of financial results.","Also, consistent with best practices, when we make any prospective comments on earnings or EPS outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future capital deployment or prior-year development of medical costs. Finally, our outlook for 2018 does not reflect the impact of Cigna's combination with Express Scripts which we continue to expect to close by the end of 2018.","With that, I will turn the call over to David.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Thanks, Will, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. Today I will begin by highlighting Cigna's outstanding third quarter 2018 financial results, which reflect substantial revenue and earnings growth and strength across each of our business segments. Next, I will discuss, how our ongoing effective execution of our strategy continues to drive Cigna's ability to deliver differentiated value for our customers and clients and how we will strengthen, broaden and accelerate our path forward through our combination of Express Scripts. Regarding our combination, I'll also provide a brief update on where we stand relative to the state regulatory approval process and our continued progress on integration planning.","Finally, I'll share some initial thoughts regarding our expectations for 2019 before turning the call over to Eric who will discuss our third quarter results in more detail. Following Q&A, I'll conclude the call with a few closing remarks.","Turning to the third quarter, we once again delivered strong operating results with substantial revenue and earnings growth, strong retention, expansion and addition of new customer and client relationships and continued industry-leading medical cost trend.","In the third quarter, our consolidated revenue grew by 9% to $11.5 billion, and our earnings per share increased by 36% to $3.84.","We had strong performance across our businesses with Global Health Care delivering sustained strong revenue growth and exceptionally strong earnings growth; Global Supplemental Benefits delivered consistent revenue growth and solid earnings; and Group Disability and Life delivered meaningful earnings expansion, relative to third quarter 2017.","Cigna's continued momentum across our portfolio of businesses through the first three quarters of 2018 gives us confidence we will achieve our increased 2018 outlook.","Looking more broadly at our performance, the marketplace continues to demand greater value through the right balance of affordability and personalization. At Cigna, we continue to be guided by Go Deeper, Go Local and Go Beyond strategy to deliver differentiated value and invest in ongoing innovation. A demonstration of our success to-date is captured by our industry-leading medical cost trend, our outstanding customer and client retention, continued strong increases in Net Promoter Score results across our businesses, exceptional employee engagement levels and our ongoing commitment to community impact exemplified through our leadership in opioid use reduction and safety as well as overdose prevention.","Further and consistent with our strategy, at Cigna we continue to innovate and invest for sustained value creation for the benefit of our customers, clients, partners and communities. We view innovation as a set of capabilities that puts the customer first, recognizes and values the crucial role of our partners, such as our health care professional partners and seeks to apply technologies which when coordinated can truly change lives.","Our Diabetes Prevention Program is just one recent example of this. This program in collaboration with Omada Health delivers an expanded suite of personalized digital health tools to help prevent the onset of diabetes, as well as other chronic conditions. Participants in Cigna and Omada pilot programs have achieved improved health, quality-of-life and affordability in part by reaching their weight management targets. As a result, employers realized both improved affordability and coworker productivity.","This program is fueled by Cigna Ventures, our corporate venture fund which invests in innovative early-stage companies with the potential to bring improved quality, affordability, choice and simplicity to the market.","Key to our sustained success is our number one strategic imperative, which is to be the undisputed partner of choice. The results of our commitment to innovation and investment help us realize this goal. For example, we have focused on building strong collaborative physician partnerships resulting in the independent research firm, Black Book, rating Cigna number one overall for customer experience in its annual survey of physician networks, medical practices and companies providing value-based solutions for physicians.","In the Medicare Advantage space, which we continue to view as a very attractive growth opportunity for us, Cigna-HealthSpring was recently recognized for driving differentiated care quality and customer satisfaction, placing it in top three out of ten national competitors in the latest J.D. Power customer satisfaction rankings.","And with strong underlying performance in HEDIS clinical quality and CAHPS customer satisfaction measures, our overall corporate Stars rating rose to 4.5 Stars for 2020. In addition, I would remind you that 76% of our Medicare Advantage customers will be in plans of 4 star or higher in 2020.","Each of these examples speaks to Cigna's ongoing innovation and investment to deliver differentiated value and to drive sustained growth.","Looking ahead, through our combination with Express Scripts, we will accelerate our ability to improve affordability and choice, expand our distribution reach and addressable markets and further strengthen predictability for our customers, clients and partners. Additionally, given the rapidly changing and dynamic marketplace, we will be well positioned strategically aided by outstanding financial flexibility.","Relative to strategic flexibility, our open architected model which emphasizes capital-light partnerships and broad choice for customers and clients, strengthens our delivery system relationships, encourages innovation and leverage synergies across our commercial, government, health services and international businesses, all in a capital efficient manner. As a result, Cigna will be even better positioned to deliver differentiated value for our customers, our commercial and health plan clients and governmental agencies.","We will also leverage the strength of our combined company to deliver a medical cost trend that is in line with the Consumer Price Index by 2021. A level we believe is sustainable for society.","Now I'd like to provide you with some specific regulatory and integration planning updates regarding our pending combination with Express Scripts. In September we secured permanent financing for our combination and the U.S. Department of Justice cleared our transaction. At a state level we continue to make very good progress achieving 23 approvals with six approvals remaining and we continue to expect to close the transaction by the end of the year.","Relative to integration, our planning teams continue to work collaboratively and are making strong progress in actively preparing our combined company to deliver on our promises to the marketplace in 2019. Each of our 11 integration streams are on track and our combined team of approximately 1,000 coworkers continues to collaborate and drive our plans forward keeping a keen eye on our customer and the value for our customer and clients.","In September, we announced our enterprise leadership team for the combined company. I have tremendous confidence in these highly accomplished leaders who are poised to advance our strategy and service champions for our customers, clients, coworkers and communities. Upon closing, our combined company will operate from a position of considerable strength as we move forward with four well-positioned growth platforms comprising our Commercial, Government, Health Service and International businesses.","Turning our attention briefly to our initial outlook for 2019, we expect once again to deliver attractive financial performance and are excited by the opportunities that are in front of us. We expect continued organic growth of revenue, earnings and customers over our increased 2018 outlook driven by our well positioned Commercial, Government and International businesses.","As we step into 2019, there are headwinds I'd like to call out. First, we have delivered particularly strong performance this year in our U.S. individual business, with margins in excess of our target levels. In 2019, we expect to achieve margins more in line with our long-term expectations for this business. This represents an approximate $100 million after-tax earnings headwind as we step into 2019. And second, while we have recognized significant favorable prior year development in 2018, for planning purposes and consistent with our past practice, we do not expect this to occur in 2019.","We expect to more than offset these two headwinds with a number of tailwinds such as continued growth in our customer base, including Medicare Advantage, further expansion of relationships through our specialty products, and continued growth in our international and group disability life business.","We also expect to achieve a step function growth in revenue and earnings through our combination with Express Scripts. As a combined company, we expect to continue to drive strong margins and free cash flows, enabling us to rapidly reduce debt levels and continue reinvesting in capabilities, all while having additional capital available for deployment. All in, we are very well positioned for an attractive 2019 from both a revenue and EPS growth standpoint and remain on track to deliver our 2021 EPS commitment of $20 to $21 per share.","Now to summarize a few key points before I turn the call over to Eric, Cigna once again delivered outstanding results in the third quarter with substantial customer, revenue and earnings growth and strong execution across our business segments. Taken together, our continued momentum gives us confidence we will achieve our increased 2018 outlook.","Looking ahead to 2019 and beyond, we are well-positioned to continue to deliver attractive financial performance, and this will be further accelerated through our combination with Express Scripts for the benefit of our customers, clients and shareholders.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Eric.","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will review key aspects of Cigna's third quarter 2018 results and provide an update to our full year outlook. I will also discuss our capital position and free cash flow generation which remain very strong and will be meaningfully enhanced through our pending combination with Express Scripts.","Key financial highlights in the quarter are consolidated revenue growth of 9% to $11.5 billion, consolidated earnings growth of 32% to $945 million, quarterly earnings per share growth of 36% to $3.84, and continued strong free cash flow and financial flexibility. Our results this quarter and year-to-date reflect effective execution of our focused strategy and underscore strong fundamentals across our businesses.","Regarding our business segments, I will first comment on Global Health Care. Third quarter operating revenues in Global Health Care grew 12% to $9.1 billion driven by commercial customer growth and expansion of specialty relationships, as well as premium growth reflecting underlying cost trends.","We ended third quarter 2018 with 16.3 million global medical customers, an organic increase of 363,000 lives year-to-date led by growth in our Select, Middle Market, and Individual segments. We continue to win in the marketplace, growing in both risk and ASO funding arrangements, as our industry-leading trend results continued to resonate with the market.","Third quarter earnings increased 40% to $804 million reflecting growth in medical and specialty customers, continued effective medical cost management, favorability in our U.S. Individual business, and a lower tax rate compared to 2017.","Turning to our medical care ratios, our third quarter 2018 Total Commercial medical care ratio, or MCR, of 76.3% reflects ongoing strong performance of our Commercial business which delivers highly customized and fully integrated solutions that enable better management of total medical costs, better than expected results in our U.S. Individual business, and the pricing effect of the resumption of the health insurance tax. Our third quarter 2018 Total Government MCR of 80.7% reflects strong execution in Medicare Advantage.","Third quarter 2018 Global Health Care earnings included favorable prior-year reserve development of $19 million after-tax.","Moving to operating expenses, for third quarter 2018, our total Global Health Care operating expense ratio was 23%, which reflects ongoing investments in growth and innovation, continued effective expense management and the impact of the return of the industry tax. Overall, our Global Health Care business delivered very strong results in the third quarter.","Turning to our Global Supplemental Benefits business, operating revenues grew 11% to $1.1 billion. Third quarter 2018 earnings were $93 million reflecting continued strong margins and ongoing disciplined operating expense management partially offset by some unfavorable claims experience.","For our Group Disability and Life segment, third quarter operating revenues grew to $1.1 billion. Third quarter earnings in our Group business grew 37% to $100 million reflecting continued solid performance in both Disability and Life and a lower tax rate.","Overall, as a result of the continued effective execution of our strategy, our third quarter results reflect strength across each of our business segments as we delivered strong revenue and earnings growth.","Now I will turn to our outlook for 2018. For full year 2018, we now expect consolidated revenues to grow approximately 8.5% over 2017, an improvement of 50 basis points versus our prior expectations. Our outlook for full year 2018 consolidated adjusted income from operations is now in the range of approximately $3.49 billion to $3.54 billion, or $14.20 to $14.40 per share. This reflects an increase of $0.50 to $0.60 per share over our previous expectations and represents per share growth of 36% to 38% over 2017.","I will now comment on the components of our increased full year 2018 outlook, starting with Global Health Care. We now expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of $2.97 billion to $3 billion reflecting continued strength in both our Commercial and Government businesses.","Key assumptions reflected in our Global Health Care earnings outlook for 2018 include the following. Regarding global medical customers, we continue to expect an increase in the range of 400,000 to 500,000 lives over year-end 2017 reflecting the strong growth we have seen across our commercial market segments.","Turning to medical costs, for our total U.S. Commercial Employer book of business, we now expect full year medical cost trend to be in the range of 3% to 4%, an improvement of 50 basis points versus our previous expectations. I would remind you this is the second time this year that we have lowered our already industry-leading medical cost trend outlook for 2018.","Now moving to our medical care ratio outlook, for our Total Commercial book of business, we now expect the 2018 MCR to be approximately 77%, an improvement of 50 basis points versus the midpoint of our previous expectations.","For our Total Government book of business, we now expect the 2018 MCR to be approximately 82.5%, an improvement of 100 basis points versus the midpoint of our previous expectations.","Regarding operating expenses, we now expect our 2018 Global Health Care operating expense ratio to be approximately 23%, consistent with the midpoint of our previous range of expectations.","For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we continue to expect strong top-line growth and now expect earnings in the range of $400 million to $410 million.","Regarding the Group Disability and Life business, we now expect full year 2018 earnings in the range of $340 million to $350 million.","And regarding our remaining operations, that is other operations and corporate we continue to expect a loss of $220 million for 2018.","So all in for full year 2018, we now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $3.49 billion to $3.54 billion, or $14.20 to $14.40 per share. This represents an increase of $0.50 to $0.60 per share over our previous expectations. This increased outlook reflects consistent ongoing execution of our strategy across our businesses.","As David discussed, this is driven by a relentless focus on customer needs and the key levers of affordability and personalization and by our ongoing innovation and investment for sustained future value creation. I'd also remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of additional prior-year reserve development or any future capital deployment.","Now moving to our 2018 capital management position and outlook. Our subsidiaries remain well-capitalized and are generating significant free cash flow to the parent, with a strong return on capital in each of our business segments.","In September, we completed our debt offering to finance the proposed combination with Express Scripts resulting in $19.9 billion in net proceeds. Excluding those proceeds, we ended the third quarter of 2018 with parent company cash of $1.3 billion.","After considering all sources and uses of parent company cash and excluding the debt issuance proceeds, we now expect capital available for deployment to be approximately $3 billion in 2018.","As a reminder, in the first quarter of this year we deployed approximately $130 million of parent company cash to repay current maturities of long-term debt and we repurchased 1.3 million shares of stock for approximately $275 million. As previously discussed, we do not expect to conduct additional share repurchases prior to the closing of the Express Scripts transaction.","Looking ahead, our pending combination with Express Scripts greatly enhances our strategic and financial strength and flexibility enabling us to accelerate our ongoing investments in market-leading capabilities and to deploy capital to drive additional growth and value creation.","Additionally, as David noted, we are making good progress in our planning for the integration with Express Scripts and our work to-date has reinforced our confidence in achieving the targets we have set for the combined company. We are excited by the capabilities our combined company will have to enhance affordability and predictability for our customers and clients and to create differentiated value for our shareholders.","As communicated previously, following the closing of the combination with Express Scripts our top capital priority will be to reduce leverage to a debt to capital ratio in the upper 30s within 18 to 24 months. Even during that period, we anticipate having meaningful, additional capital available for ongoing investment and innovation as well as capacity for strategic M&A and\/or returning capital to shareholders.","Now to recap, our third quarter 2018 consolidated results reflect strength and momentum in our diversified portfolio of global businesses and continued effective execution of our strategy. The strong fundamentals of our business continue to drive these results which reflect strong revenue and earnings contributions from each of our business segments, innovative solutions and differentiated capabilities that create value for our customers, clients, health care partners and communities, industry-leading medical cost trends and high clinical quality and continued strong free cash flow.","Based on the strength of these results, we are confident in our ability to achieve our increased full year 2018 earnings outlook and we are well-positioned to continue to drive innovation, growth and value in 2019. We look forward to accelerating our growth strategy and expanding our capabilities through the Express Scripts combination and delivering on the very attractive financial commitments we have established for the combined company.","And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Just wanted to ask, at this stage of the year, probably mostly if not all the way through kind of the Commercial selling season, how you guys fared? And if that's sort of embedded in the comments around growing enrollment into 2019, thinking about both Group, ASO, as well as risk on the Commercial side primarily?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Steve, good morning. It's David. So relative to 2018, generally speaking, correct. We are through the 2018 selling season. I would note that one of our critical growth segments, Select, it's busy season until December 31. So there is activity throughout the course of the year, and additionally, obviously we're deep and almost complete through the national account selling season for January 1, 2019.","Big picture, we feel great about the results we delivered for 2018. Our results are first driven by outstanding client retention levels, our continued ability to deepen our relationships with our proven specialty services portfolio and then sustain new business wins. And we expect that will continue into 2019 based on what we are seeing more broadly for our portfolio. And we've not seen any major change in trend from what we're realizing in 2018 versus early look to 2019.","Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. That's helpful. And noticing the results since the deal was announced, obviously really strong numbers from you guys. Solid numbers from Express as well. So I'm curious if you could give us sort of your latest thoughts on where debt to cap ends at the end of the transaction, kind of the cash generation that you're now thinking about post-close relative to your initial expectations.","And maybe just as a follow-up to that, how are you all thinking about most recently kind of the use of those proceeds? What I mean by that is the run rate going forward when your cash generation kind of steps up pretty meaningfully. Should we be thinking about buyback over M&A? Or any sort of latest thoughts on where you might look next to grow the business?","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Steve, it's Eric. Just a couple of comments. So, overall in terms of at the closing, we expect the debt to cap ratio to be around 50% or a little bit favorable to that, 49%, in terms of point of closing. And consistent with our prior comments, we'd expect to use capital to deleverage the organization over the first 18 to 24 months. Really no change in terms of approach.","As you noted, we're delighted with the strength of the Cigna results, and nothing has changed in terms of our thinking as it relates to the Express Scripts results and how we will use the strength of those results in the first couple of years of the transaction.","Maybe I'll ask David to comment on just any other broader comments from a strategic deployment over longer term.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Steve, our priorities remain the same relative to capital deployment above and beyond. So to remind you what they are, they're three: to ensure the business is properly capitalized for both growth in the regulated entities as well as CapEx for ongoing innovation, and we have a strong track record of doing so, pursuing strategic and financially attractive M&A and then returning excess capital to shareholders, historically predominantly through share repurchase.","And as Eric noted in his prepared remarks, additionally I would just highlight the fact that we are well-positioned for 2019 and 2020 during that rapid debt pay down to be able to achieve the debt pay down, as well as serve the business needs and have additional capital available for deployment and then to the tone of your question, a significant step up in 2021 of free cash flow which is just a tremendous shareholder value creation accelerant for us.","Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Tanal. Our next question comes from Zack Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Zachary Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thanks for the call, and congrats on the quarter. So I wanted to ask \u2013 Express last week put out a new benefit design for one of their coalitions that featured a lot of transparency, paper performance. Sounds like something that aligns well with Cigna customer base. Just curious on your thoughts on that? And how you think about the opportunity of that product going forward?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Zack, good morning. It's David. Express has a very good track record of ongoing innovation. And I think you should look at that as an indication of evolving capabilities based upon current and projected market needs and indicative of what we'll be doing more together because the notion of transparency, value-based performance, aligned incentives and then further integration of programs that leverage the whole person through the pharmacy, behavioral, clinical programs. But I think it's an exciting step forward and indicative of a really powerful set of capabilities that Express has on a standalone basis that'll just be further augmented when we're together to drive further transparency, further value-based relationships and targeted integration.","Zachary Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got you. Thank you. And just quickly on your Stars improvement, what do you think about the main factors that were driving that improvement and I guess how do you think about the opportunity to continue to improve those ratings going forward?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","So, Zack, thanks. First, we're really pleased, well-positioned for 2019. With the Stars positioning well in excess of 70%, step up further in 2020 to 76%, four-plus. The corporate rating at 4.5 Stars is critical for 2020 as you know that represents a Stars rating that will be used for new market openings and we have a great opportunity from that standpoint. There's not one driver that I would point to, as I noted in my prepared remarks, there's really strong balance performance both in the clinical quality performance, as well as the customer satisfaction and service quality. I think if you were to intersect the two, our sustained execution coupled with our deep partnership relationship with healthcare professionals is helping to demonstrate just sustained delivery as well as continued improvement and we couldn't be more excited about our 2019 and 2020 positioning.","Zachary Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks for the questions.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Sopcak. Our next question comes from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.","A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks. Hi, everybody. First question about the reduction in the expectation around cost trend and obviously that has some implications for the MLR guidance as well. You already, as you mentioned, have one of the \u2013 have the lowest expectation around cost trimming and reducing, and again, what did you see in the last quarter or so that brings you to a reduction? Is there any particular buckets that you're seeing any outperformance in? Is it market or is it your initiatives that you think are driving this?","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Hey. It's Eric. Our trend results, I would say at a macro level reflect the power of the integrated model and the effectiveness we have of aligning incentives across our clients, our customers and healthcare professionals and that's been consistent for some time. I would remind you that we've got 85% of our U.S. commercial customers are in self-funded arrangements, so this cost trend really directly benefits them and ultimately, it's their dollars that we're able to manage well for them.","Relative to the specific categories, I'd note each of inpatient, outpatient, professional, pharmacy, each one of those are lining up to be somewhere in the, I'll say the 2% to 4% range this year, so each one of those categories in that range. It's not one category I'd call out as particularly changed or driving the results, but overall the total package and the total strength of our offerings bring it back to that 3% to 4% trend result that we talked about and just continued strong execution there.","A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. I know in the prepared remarks, I think in terms of talking about tailwinds, you said that you expect to see growth in the MA next year. CMS has come out and said that they thought the overall market might grow as much as 11.5%. Is there any way to sort of bracket \u2013 do you think you'll grow it more in line with the market whether you think it's 11.5% or not? Or should we see acceleration in the performance I guess next year? Can you put any brackets around that?","And I guess also part of that is I'm surprised when you talk about the tailwinds for next year, the HIF is particularly in MA, but maybe also in timing \u2013 the HIF moratorium. I would have thought that was a tailwind. Do you not think that's a tailwind?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","A.J., good morning. It's David. So two questions. Let me take the second question first. A small tailwind is the way we look at it relative to the book of business, order of magnitude about $50 million for the enterprise on an after-tax basis. And as you know, our \u2013 the impact of the HIF to our portfolio versus some of our peers based on the mix of our business is different.","Specific to MA, we're excited about the outlook for 2019. I would remind you that our strategic goal for MA is to grow that book of business in the high-single digit revenue range. I'll also remind you is that we compete and deliver significant value in the individual MA marketplace, not in the group MA marketplace. So we're very excited about the growth opportunities. We look forward for 2019. And as I noted to a prior question, we're really well-positioned for 2020 as well with a further step up in Stars from our current point of strength of about 72% to 76% and a corporate Star rating of 4.5 Stars for new market on trade. So very attractive positioning for 2019 and 2020, and our team is excited about that.","A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Rice. Your next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. Just wanted to get a sense from you how your customers and brokers are thinking about the combination with Express. Are you getting any early feedback about whether the value proposition that you guys articulated to the Street is starting to resonate at all with the customer base?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Kevin, good morning. It's David. Obviously the marketplace will always be in a wait-and-see mode, but the tone I would give you relative to our clients and our broker relationships is indeed a positive one.","So it's off a base in an environment where, as Eric referenced, we have a sustained track record of delivering market-leading medical cost trend. Pharmacy is a contributing factor to that, as he just referenced. In 2018, all of our cost categories are in the 2% to 4% range, including Pharmacy.","The marketplace sees this combination positively because of the ability for us to further strengthen that value proposition for the benefits of \u2013 in that case, our integrated proposition for our clients and customers is very positive. For example, tapping into Express's market-leading and differentiated specialty capabilities is an outstanding opportunity, high value to our clients and customers, and I might add, high value to our collaborative accountable care relationships.","So we're excited to step into 2019 with the expanded capabilities, and our clients are optimistic that they'll see a further step up off the strength they're already realizing today.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. I guess maybe going back to the capital deployment question, is there something I guess structurally \u2013 because obviously this is a huge transaction for you guys \u2013 where you say you would be out of large M&A for a certain period of time before you'd be ready to get in? And how long do you think that it takes to integrate Express before you think about doing the next deal of size?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","So Kevin, it's David. I'm not going to give you a timeframe. I'm not going to give you a date certain in terms of when we will or will not act or transact. The company has a very clear track record of being quite disciplined in terms of being first, an appropriate capital steward, as well as making very deliberate decisions that are on strategy, clear and are financially attractive on a go-forward basis.","Over the immediate term, as Eric articulated, our capital priorities are quite clear: ensure our business is positioned for continued growth \u2013 we're very well-positioned from that standpoint \u2013 to aggressively pay down our debt levels in the first 18 to 24 months. Our free cash flows will be well-positioned for that, and we have capacity even within that for further deployment.","As we look beyond that window, we're going to have tremendous capital flexibility and the business will be well-positioned to be on our toes obviously from a large scale standpoint as we look forward to further conversations on that matter as we go forward with you.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Fischbeck. Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning. First question is I want to circle back, David, on your 2019 commentary. So you gave us some headwinds on the exchanges in PYD, the tailwind on the HIF kind of outside the norm. And then if we exclude all those, is it reasonable to expect that the company will deliver earnings growth in the 7% to 9% long-term target range that you kind of highlighted at this time last year?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Justin, good morning. We're obviously not providing detailed guidance for 2019. Look forward to doing so, as you know. And what you articulated, that's our strategic goal and our strategic target on average over time, and we have a great track record of delivering that.","I think the big picture message I'd ask you to take, and with the summary points you made, is we're delivering an outstanding 2018. Even with the headwinds noted that you can adjust the baseline for, it's an outstanding 2018. We'll carry momentum into 2019 on the core, and we'll have a tremendously accretive result with the Express combination. So I'd suggest stay tuned for more, but we feel really good about our positioning for 2019.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then on the Individual business, I want to make sure I understand the headwind there, so I was hoping you could share a couple things. One, first, I've got your premiums at about $2 billion. Is that correct? And then after the reset that you're talking about here, can you tell us what the target range is for 2019 on margins? If I remember correctly, I think you had said longer-term you expect this to be a mid-single digit pre-tax business. Thanks.","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Kevin, it's Eric \u2013 or Justin, I'm sorry, it's Eric. With respect to the premium level, it's actually a little higher than that, probably closer to $2.5 billion in terms of our total expected premium level for 2018. And you're correct in your recollection with the margin. We've said mid-single digits has been our target for this business over time.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Lake. Your next question comes from David Windley with Jefferies. You may ask your question.","David Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. It's Dave Styblo in for Dave Windley. Thanks for the questions. I want to take a look back at your 2021 EPS target of $20 to $21. I'm curious if you have an updated view on that from here? I guess since announcing Express Scripts, you've raised 2018 guidance by over $1.60, so wondering if you see upside to the $21, or alternatively, where would you propose to invest the $1.60 of outperformance over the next three years?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Good morning. It's David. Appreciate your question and appreciate the optimism. As I noted in my prepared remarks, we feel confident and strong relative to the $20 to $21 of EPS. Which when you step back and look at it from a jump-off standpoint, it represents a growth trajectory that's at or above the high end of our commitment of 10% to 13% compounded over a period of time. I'd say stay tuned for more.","We recognize the fact that the core Cigna business has tremendous outperformance for this year and we're proud of that. There's not a detailed plan to \"reinvest that number\", and as we go forward we'll look forward to updating our outlook, but for right now the $20 to $21 remains our commitment, our target and we're fully focused on delivering that for 2021.","David Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then the follow-up just on the individual book, can you update us on your 2019 exchange plans? At some point I think during the second quarter you talked about evaluating some of the regulatory changes that were happening and how that might affect your footprint and strategies? Curious what the updated view is for your expansion plans or not in 2019 as well as why mid-single digit margins is the right target there? We're seeing some peers deliver above that seemingly on a sustainable basis so why is mid-single digit versus something like a higher single digit margin not the right level to think about?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","So it's David. Two questions there, first, relative to 2019, we will carry strength out of 2018 as I noted before. We're in six states for 2019. We had evaluated a posture in totality as you noted, we concluded to remain in those six states plus add an additional state that specifically is Arizona. Additionally, our view is that the marketplace for the individual exchange business is more competitive in 2019 than it had been in 2017 or 2018.","As you look at the environment, there's more competitors entering the space, hence we will be well-positioned in those seven states but we're actually projecting for a little compression in our overall number of lives that we're serving in 2019 and we're projecting that we will deliver toward the higher end of our strategic range which as Eric articulated is mid-single digit margins. We think that's a responsible margin, a sustainable margin whereby we're giving a great value proposition back to our customers. We're working very closely with our value-based providers in terms of overall clinical quality and having a responsible return from a shareholder perspective.","So we think that the mid-single digit margin is a responsible margin, a capital-friendly margin but also a sustainable margin and margins above that are not sustainable.","David Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Windley. Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. You may ask your question.","Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. A question on MA growth, for 2019, just looking at some of the CMS filings, it looks like there's relatively modest county expansion and understand that you guys have gone through some sanctions and other changes, et cetera, but is that really just a function of the model, the deeply-integrated clinic-based model that you guys use for most of your markets in Medicare Advantage just being a little more difficult to grow very, very quickly, right. Is it just you've got to be much more targeted or is it just where we are in time and expect a bigger jumping-off point or bigger expansion in 2020?","And then just a follow-up on the cash flow, it looked like there were some timing issues. I was wondering maybe, Eric, you could just lay out any of the puts and takes? Understanding that the full year number is still very strong but third quarter number was a little bit lower than we were looking for. Thanks","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Josh, good morning. It's David. To your point I'll take the first question, I'll ask Eric to take the cash flow question. I think you hit the nail on the head. So I appreciate the way you framed the question. It's more the latter not the former, specifically tremendous focus in that business. You can see the tremendous focus resulting in the outstanding Stars performance as well as public recognition for the performance of that business in the top three of the J.D. Power survey amongst 10 national competitors, so we feel great about that. It was targeted and very disciplined in terms of expansion, in terms of some adjacent counties and one new market for 2019 with a view and a positioning that there will be a larger expansion in 2020.","So view it as a discipline, view it as ramping and view it as we love the strength of what we're carrying into this in terms of sustained execution, Stars rating in the existing markets, corporate Stars rating of 4.5 Stars to be able to carry forward, so building momentum going into 2020.","Eric, on cash flow?","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","The cash flow, Josh, really is just the timing of the receipt of government reimbursements and such. Actually I think this quarter played out the same as the third quarter last year in terms of the overall timing. That payment will be recognized in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, but really nothing else to call out there.","Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC","So a reverse in the fourth quarter, 4Q, will be sort of abnormally high. Is that the way to think about it?","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","All else equal and we're not giving the specific guidance on the fourth quarter cash flow. It always ebbs and flows and such there. But all else equal, yes.","Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC","Okay. Perfect. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Raskin. Our next question comes from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. You may ask your question.","Ana Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Hey. Thanks. Good morning. So with the DOJ approval of the two deals and the states looking pretty good as well, with Select ending in December 31, can you give us a sense of the timing that you might be phasing in the administrative savings in 2019? And as you're going through the selling season for Select, are you actually positioning this go to market with Express with your pricing and messaging to drive cross-selling right now for 2019?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Ana, good morning. It's David. First, we expect \u2013 to be clear, we expect to plan an attractive close this year. Second, as it relates to the synergy capture for the benefit of the shareholder part of the proportion, as Eric has articulated in the past, that $600 million before tax is planned to be realized over a four year period of time, somewhat ratably. So we would assume, if 2019 is our first year, it's a ratable attribution of that benefit from a shareholder standpoint.","As it relates to our go to market proposition, our number one strategic imperative guiding our integration planning is to ensure that both companies remain in position and are on their toes relative to delivering on the 2019 promises and well-positioned for 2020.","So you should take that as it's a business as usual intense focus on execution for the benefit of both existing clients and new clients that are being added by both franchises, and as we augment through the year there will be enhancements to the value proposition that will take place on a phased notion.","And lastly, I appreciate you asking it through the lens of Select because, per your inference, every day is busy season there. So as we ramp in some of the value creation and value capture for the benefit of clients and customers, we'll be able to represent that in part through that segment on a go forward basis. But January 2019 looks a lot like January 2018 with intense focus on value delivery for client and customers for both companies.","Ana Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","And just to follow-up on that, what are your competitors doing, either the nationals or the blues, in terms of their messaging on integrated medical and pharmacy? Is it getting louder? And are they possibly coming in more aggressively with self-insured plus stop loss to compete in Select?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Ana, I think as it relates to the value proposition, clearly that's a question for you to probe competitor by competitor and then submarket by submarket.","But more broadly, it is very clear in the marketplace, through whether you look at governmental led pilots through the Medicare lens, whether you look at through the successful value-based care relationships that exists or whether you look at in terms of the evolving demand of employer clients, a more integrated approach which is not a cross sold or a bundled approach, but a more integrated approach that addresses the whole person, understands the need of the whole person and could connect the mind and body, the behavior, the lifestyle, the clinical and partner up with a health care professional.","That is a more winning proposition day in, day out that yields a better cost outcome, but it's a better cost outcome from a better quality outcome, so I'd say a more consistent mantra relative to that in the marketplace.","As it relates to ASO, there's been a consistent trend for years now as it relates to the marketplace embracing more transparency and demanding more transparency through a variety of lenses, and ASO is a mechanism to do so. And as you know from prior conversations, one of the reasons why we've been so passionate about ASO is transparency presents an opportunity for alignment. Alignment presents an opportunity for speed of shared execution which is what's necessary here.","So those trends are consistent, but just to amplify yet again, integration is different than bundling or cross-selling. It's truly integrating around the whole person, the information flows, the incentives, the benefit designs with the clinicians, and we see that continuing to grow. And we're well positioned there.","Ana Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you, Ms. Gupte. Your next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citigroup. You may ask your question.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just an update on penetration of the specialty book, I think you mentioned expansion of that this quarter so I was hoping you can give some more details there. And then are there still service lines that you're not in that you could provide additional opportunity or are the offerings largely set across specialty?","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Ralph, it's Eric. I'll start on the penetration. The overall \u2013 I think the headlines here are just consistent execution in terms of us continuing to both innovate additional offerings and such within our specialty programs and increase the penetration rate of our specialty programs across all of our segments. And again each market segment has a little different set of needs, and so we have to be focused in how we develop those solutions across the market but again, consistent execution in terms of innovation and then continuing to penetrate the market segments with those. Again, we've had a nice track record of that and continue to have opportunities to progress in that space. David maybe will take the other part of your question.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Ralph, if I heard you correctly, when you said service lines you correlated that back to the specialty programs, so I appreciate that. The way I'd ask you to think about that is, I would not think about it through the lens of three to five product offerings, that chapter is long since gone in the past. We think about it today in the existing Cigna portfolio of 20 to 25 different programs or service offerings that our client management, our clinical staff could offer for a client based upon their unique needs, health burdens, change objectives et cetera, and we would see that as continuing to evolve and expand and further accelerate candidly with the addition of Express Scripts and eviCore to the Cigna portfolio.","So we see an evolution through sustained innovation, there's not any one item where we say we're gapped by any stretch of the imagination but you continue to evolve some programs and services and that's in part, as Eric articulated before, how we are able to deliver industry-leading medical cost trends six years in a row now.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up, you announced some management changes including the departure of Chris Hocevar and bringing back Matt Manders, so I was hoping you could talk about the change in structure of the organization kind of past the Express deal? And then in your prepared remarks you mentioned four segments, just hoping you could flesh that out in terms of, is that a reorder or how do we think about that on a go-forward basis? Thanks.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","So Ralph, on the second question first, on the four segments, stay tuned for more, it's not a reorder, it's a positioning of four platforms and the respective capabilities based upon go-to-market, client needs and diversified focus with diversified value propositions. So stay tuned for more as we complete the combination, the way we'll bring forward our reporting visibility and dialogue with you will be centered from that standpoint.","As it relates to the leadership team, we're delighted to announce the enterprise leadership team as the inevitable close of the transaction drew closer, the positioning of that leadership team has very focused go-to-market P&L leaders, has a large strategy and solutions organization that services capabilities across all of our operating segments and then has functional leaders in support of the Corporation.","We're also delighted to the fact that we're able to, not only previously announce that Tim is staying on with the Corporation but Dr. Miller from Express Scripts is the Chief Clinical Officer for the combined Corporation. And then lastly I would note is, we were able to announce about a week ago Tim's leadership team for his business portfolio which will have tremendous continuity of proven business leaders for the benefit of that business from Everett Neville, to Dave Queller, to Brian who runs a specialty business, to Glen who is the Chief Innovation Officer et cetera, et cetera, so we could not be more excited with the leadership in place at the enterprise level and for the key business units on a go-forward basis. We're ready to close and get on with execution.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Giacobbe. Your next question comes from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Two-part question. The first one is kind of a victim of your own success question, and you've covered a little bit of this in terms of the year-to-date outperformance and how that might impact some of the forward guidance you've already given.","But the question is, when we think about 2018, your guidance now is 12% to 15% better than the beginning of the year, and it looks like roughly half of that is a little bit of repurchase, the PYD, and then some of this individual market outperformance. And I'm just wondering is there anything else besides just broad outperformance or general outperformance on utilization management and cost trend that you would attribute the other portion of the year-to-date upside to, or something you'd want to call out a little more?","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Gary, it's Eric. I think you really hit the headlines there in terms of the things that I would call out. I would just note we've had really strong performance in each one of our business segments, and ahead of expectations in each one of the business segments driven by fundamentally solid execution and better cost management both in terms of medical cost as well as continued disciplined expense management and such. But again, just overall really strong execution.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. And if I could just follow up, we've heard more about at the state level Medicaid plans carving in behavioral. And when we look at your enrollment, you've got 16 million medical, 27 million behavioral. I guess I was under the impression most of your behavioral business was with your commercial customers or other commercial players. Obviously you have a small Medicaid book, so the question is, is this trend towards carve in by the Medicaid HMOs, does that have any measurable impact on your outlook for your behavioral specialty enrollment that resides outside of Cigna?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Gary, good morning. It's David. The simple answer is, we believe yes. The marketplace by the day is seeing that the broader definition of behavioral services in terms of the health and well-being broader definition inclusive of the core in terms of core behavioral health, mental health, substance abuse issues, the demand for those services continues to grow.","The proof points relative to societal and individual value creation continues to grow, and then the opportunity to drive targeted integration of clinical programs and outreach programs with individuals along with physicians continues to grow. So I appreciate you calling out the numbers. We have a significantly larger behavioral book than we do medical book, and both through market forces as well as the combination we have with our broader health service platform in the corporation, we see tremendous growth opportunities here over time.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Taylor. Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. You may ask your question.","Steven Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Oh. Thanks. Good morning, David and Eric. Thanks for taking the question. So I guess over the past few months, it's been fairly obvious that the investor sentiment around the pending Express Scripts merger changed dramatically for the better once the Express Scripts dollar amount of drug rebate retention was disclosed. So it might be a little bit preliminary to ask this question, but I guess I'm just curious if you're at least considering disclosing the overall Cigna Express combined retained drug rebate dollars maybe on a more regular basis going forward once the merger is complete, just given that transparency on this metric seemed to drive better valuations and just investor sentiment? Thanks.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Good morning. It's David. I appreciate your comment. Number one, we always challenge ourselves to relook at disclosures, transparency, et cetera, and we're pleased and proud with the amount of transparency Cigna delivers as part of our ongoing communication with you, our shareholders.","Just one item I would point out, specific to the Cigna standalone portfolio of today, as you know, our orientation is a highly integrated orientation. So our clients purchase a package of goods and a package of services and hold us accountable for delivering an integrated outcome that delivers tremendous value to them. And we're able to dynamically manage medical programs, behavioral programs, pharmacy programs, wellness programs, incentive-based behavior modification programs on behalf of our clients and customers.","So as we continue to challenge ourselves over time, we find it a little bit more difficult to parse any one subcomponent out because we've truly worked to drive that integrated proposition. Having said that, we always challenge ourselves in terms of how do we get the optimal level of constructive transparency? And as we look into 2019, stay tuned for more.","Steven Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Appreciate the color. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Valiquette. Our next question comes from Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. You may ask your question.","Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yes. Hi. Good morning. My question is on your target, your pledge to reduce medical trend. I think you said to the general CPI level. So, my question about that is how can you fix to that target when much of that is out of your control because the self-insured employer customers are making the decisions about how to change benefits and maybe which medical management programs to apply and how aggressively?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Matthew, good morning. It's David. First, thanks for bringing attention back to that strategic goal pledge and objective. Number one, as you've seen, we have been successful relentlessly working to reduce the rate of medical cost growth while simultaneously managing and helping to coordinate outstanding clinical quality and service quality results. 2017, our medical cost trend was below 3%. As Eric articulated, we're in the 3% to 4% medical cost range right now, and we see further opportunity going forward.","Secondly, as noted in my prepared remarks, we believe that that is a society sustainable level and we need to work every angle to be able to achieve that with the appropriate clinical quality and service quality.","Lastly, to your point, but taking a little different angle with commercial clients, working hand-in-glove on a consultative basis with commercial clients is how it's achieved. How we've achieved what we've delivered to-date is not by delivering a product and hoping for the best. It's working client-by-client, hand-in-glove, trying to get the benefit design, the network design, the clinical programs, the incentive design, the engagement programs designed properly for those clients and dynamically managing them in the year, and then augmenting that with the same approach relative to the collaborative value-based physician relationships. And given our progress to-date, we believe that that is the right strategic objective to have for ourselves to push us to drive continued innovation, and we think it's the right objective to have societally.","Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Just one follow-up, if I could. There's obviously a lot of validation for your capabilities from your customer base in the response. But if we look to some competitors that maybe don't agree with your claim to have the industry best trend, is there any independent validation, since a lot of that's in the self-insured bucket that we can point to on that front?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Matthew, it's David. Appreciate the tone of caution. We recognize that we operate in a competitive environment. I'll give you three items to consider.","One, six years in a row of sustained delivery of the lowest medical cost trend; two, it's augmented with outstanding client retention levels. Remember, 85% of our clients are ASO. They see their medical cost trend every month. Candidly, the largest ones will see it weekly in terms of what plays through. And our ability to work arm-in-arm, shoulder-to-shoulder to deliver this result is what demonstrates that. When you step back and think it through from that standpoint, the sustained results we've been able to deliver in our guarantee cost business, albeit smaller, whether it's employer or individual base also reinforces that.","And then lastly, just tactically coming back to, as Eric articulated in his prepared remarks, in the seniors business, we were able to systematically further improve our medical cost, our MLR this year, in large part driven by cost discipline \u2013 medical cost discipline but it's augmented with outstanding clinical and service quality. So we like our track record. We like the consistency results and our ASO clients are the direct beneficiaries day-in, day-out of that.","Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Borsch. Our next question comes from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. You may ask your question.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you. So I'm going to stick on commercial cost trends here, and I appreciate given Cigna's mix why you're reporting a blended ASO and risk book. I think the challenge is Cigna's only large insurer not to break out commercial risk cost trend alone. So maybe can you help us understand what the difference is in cost trends from accounts that you've held for a long time versus the first year or two, and the order of magnitude of difference that you could experience between cost trends on a risk versus an ASO book?","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Sarah, it's Eric. So as you think about the ASO versus insured book of business, we really tend to manage our medical cost the same across each one of those things. And so I wouldn't call out over an extended period of time any difference in terms of the underlying cost trends, in terms of our employers who choose an insured funding arrangements versus our employers who choose a self-funding arrangement. Again, overall, across the entire book of business, I wouldn't call it anything that's meaningfully different there. Our programs are effective in both of those funding arrangements and are attractive and that's why we've been able to grow both of those funding arrangements.","In terms of looking at kind of over time or newer clients versus those types of things, you tend to see we build our effectiveness as we deepen our relationship and have additional specialty programs and things along those lines come into play. So as we work through the first couple of years of building relationships with clients, you tend to see our effectiveness pick up, but again, that would probably be the only other dynamic I'd call out in terms of differences in the kind of trend by different slices of the book of business.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Maybe I could look at it another way. You talked earlier about the ASO clients tending to want more transparency and that that could lead to benefit design choices in consumerism. So maybe you could talk about it in that framework of how much potential to lower cost trend there is if your book would behave more like those ASO clients that are enhancing transparency in consumerism?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Sarah, good morning. It's David. I'd ask you to think about in our employer guaranteed cost or in our employer experience rated book of business, we attempt to take the same approach not only as Eric articulated very importantly, from the way we coordinate clinical care access, et cetera, but as well the way we try to seek to influence the benefit design.","We're not passive in the risk dialog and active in the ASO dialog. We try to be active in dialog across the board because we want the best sustained value for the employer clients.","And I would remind you that historically we've not competed in the legacy smaller employer book of business from a guaranteed cost standpoint, the under 50 or in some states under 100 guaranteed cost. That has not been a backbone for the corporation where you might have more routine product design and rigidity that comes forward. Rather, even in the guaranteed cost standpoint or the experience rated, the employers are multi 100 life employers on average, and hence, we have active engagement from that standpoint.","So I'd ask you to take that active dynamic into all the employer engagements, obviously varied employer-by-employer. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. You may ask your question.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Congratulations on the quarter. Just wanted to hear your views on what you think your smaller accounts, your Select accounts, are going to be doing with the changes from the government regarding association health plans and regarding health reimbursement accounts as we get closer to 2020?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Peter, good morning. It's David. Generally speaking, the small employers we're servicing through our legacy Select segment are employers that have wanted to and therefore see the value from their engagement with us to have a more actively engaged, dynamically managed benefit design, clinical program design, engagement programs, et cetera.","Hence, on average they would be less desirous of going into an association health plan and losing control of their benefit design, their incentive design, their communication strategies and the transparency they benefited from. So general direction rule of thumb.","HRA expansion, we'll call them the savings based programs, that may create opportunity over time for further expansion in that market as part of the dialog today. And the further enhancements to those programs only slightly will somewhat enhance that value proposition on a go forward basis, but that's a client-by-client call.","So I'd ask you to think about the kind of selection bias that exists within our portfolio of an activated employer, embracing transparency, embracing communication, embracing incentive alignment with their employees will lend itself to more active dynamic management on a go forward basis and less attraction to be in a pool where they lose some of that control \u2013 for example, an association health plan. Hope that helps.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Costa. Our final question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. You may ask your question.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah, David, thanks for squeezing me in. And maybe I'll just switch gears a little bit. David, in your prepared comments you talked about these Cigna ventures and this pilot with Omada Health, and it's interesting to hear you along with your peers just talk more about sort of digital capabilities. But I guess my question really is, first, with Omada, like how many employees are actually piloting this for you? And really how much interest are you getting from clients for these type of capabilities? And to that extent, are these capabilities really making much of a differentiation in actual RFP activity and bidding and winning new business? Thanks.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Charles, good morning. It's David. Appreciate you coming back to that. We called out an example in the prepared remarks. So I would ask you to think that there are multiple examples. And similar to a prior question I was asked in terms of the specialty services where I said, don't think about three or four specialty product categories, think about 20 to 25 service programs that we make available to our clients depending on what could deliver the best value for them and getting the right constellation of those.","Specific to your comment here, I don't have the front of mind, if you like the number, Will, you can follow up with Will. And he can give you how many are in the Omada pilot at the current course and speed. I could tell you it's growing and there's significant demand from clients.","Secondly, that's what drives us to expand, for example, the Cigna ventures program because it could accelerate on a targeted basis some of our innovation. And since we are a partner of choice organization, we are open to partnering and working with others to create accelerated value. In some cases it is a differentiator, so some of these types of services are differentiators as it relates to RFPs and demonstration of not theoretical value creation through digitization or innovation, but tangible value through digitization and innovation on a go-forward basis. And you should expect just to see a more sort of constant drumbeat of sustained innovation, we put the customer front and center, our willingness to partner, smart use of technology and align partnership with clinicians on a go-forward basis. And what we called out today in the prepared remarks is one very powerful example of that. Hope that helps.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Fair. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Thank you. So to wrap up our call today, I just want to reiterate some important points. First, Cigna delivered outstanding third quarter financial results, reflecting strong performance across each of our business segments. We generated substantial revenue and earnings growth, strong retention, expansion and addition of new customer relationships and continued industry-leading medical cost trend. Cigna's continued momentum across our portfolio of businesses through the first three quarters of 2018 gives us confidence we will achieve our increased 2018 outlook.","At Cigna, we continue to be guided by our go deeper, go local, and go beyond strategy to deliver differentiated value and to invest in ongoing innovation. Looking ahead through our combination with Express Scripts, we will accelerate our ability to further improve affordability and choice, expand our distribution reach and addressable markets and further strengthen predictability for customers, clients and partners. Additionally, given the rapidly changing and dynamic marketplace, we will be well positioned strategically, aided by outstanding financial flexibility. As a result, we will be even better positioned to deliver differentiated value for our customers, our commercial and health plan clients and governmental agencies.","Before wrapping up, I want to acknowledge Cigna's more than 45,000 coworkers around the world who have remained focused and who have continued to deliver outstanding results as we have pursued our combination with Express Scripts. We also look forward to welcoming our new colleagues from Express Scripts once we close our transaction, which again, we expect to occur by the end of this year.

[Operator Instructions]  As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded and we'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Ted Detrick. Please go ahead, Mr. Detrick.","Edwin J. Detrick","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I'm Ted Detrick, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Ralph Nicoletti, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer; and Herb Fritch, who now leads the Seniors business for Cigna.","In our remarks today, David will begin by commenting on Cigna's full year 2011 results and how our accomplishments in 2010 and 2011, as well as the acquisition of HealthSpring, position us for continued success in 2012 and beyond. Next, Ralph will review the financial results for the quarter and full year of 2011. He will also provide Cigna's financial outlook for 2012. We will then open the lines for your questions. And following our question and answer session, David will provide some brief closing remarks before we end the call.","As noted in our earnings release, Cigna uses certain financial measures which are not determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, when describing its financial results. Specifically, we use the term labeled, adjusted income from operations, as the principal measure of performance for Cigna and our operating segments. And the reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. ","In addition, when we discuss our 2011 Health Care financial results and specifically, our results for revenue and membership growth, as well as operating expense ratio, it will be on a basis that adjusts for our exit from non-strategic markets, most notably the Medicare Individual Private Fee for Service business. This adjustment creates a better basis of comparison for explaining our financial results.","Now in our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking comments. We would remind you that there are risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations, and those risk factors are discussed in today's earnings release.","Also, please note, that in addition to our earnings release and the quarterly financial supplement, we have made available on our website some additional information to facilitate your understanding of our 2011 results and the specifics of our 2012 financial outlook, which Ralph will discuss in a few moments.","Now before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our 2011 results and our disclosures for 2012.","Regarding our results, I would note that in the fourth quarter, we recorded an after-tax charge of $31 million or $0.11 per share for transaction costs related to the HealthSpring and FirstAssist acquisition, which we report as a special item. I would remind you that special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations in today's discussion of our 2011 results and our full-year 2012 outlook.","Also as previously discussed, effective January 1 2012, Cigna's adopting new guidance regarding the accounting for the deferral of certain costs related to the acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts. This accounting change restricts the amount of cost that can be capitalized and accelerates the recognition of certain acquisition costs that previously would have been deferred.","Cigna will adopt this accounting change on a retrospective basis in the first quarter of 2012, recasting prior periods and recording a one-time non-cash charge of approximately $250 million to $300 million directly to shareholders equity.","The impact to recast full year 2011 results for the adoption of this new accounting guidance will be to reduce earnings for our International business by approximately $70 million after tax. We remind you that this accounting change has no impact on the fundamentals of the business. That is, there is no effect on revenues, future cash flows, our statutory capital position or the lifetime profitability of the policy.","Because this accounting change is effective January 1, 2012, the impact of this change is not reflected in our 2011 results that Ralph will discuss in a few moments. However, when David and Ralph provide commentary on our 2012 outlook, it will be on the basis that assumes retrospective adoption of this accounting change with both 2011 and 2012 being recast on a comparable basis.","And one last item, we announced earlier this week that we have completed the acquisition of HealthSpring, effective January 31, 2012. When we discuss our full year 2012 outlook, it will be on a basis which includes the expected results of HealthSpring as of February 1, 2012, excludes any future capital deployment and assumes break-even results for our run-off Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefits business, otherwise known as VADBe. For 2012, we will record HealthSprings' results within our Health Care segment and going forward, we will not report actual HealthSprings-specific earnings or provide an explicit financial outlook for our Seniors business, as we begin to integrate our commercial and Seniors businesses to drive revenue synergies and create improved value for our customers and clients.","With that, I'll turn it over to David.","David M. Cordani","Thanks, Ted, and good morning, everyone. Before Ralph reviews our results and outlook, I'll briefly comment on Cigna's achievements in 2011, and I'll highlight our expectations for the future.","First, we delivered strong revenues and earnings growth for full year 2011. Overall, these results reflect consistent execution of our growth strategy and demonstrate the value we continue to create for our customers, clients and shareholders. Most specifically, our retention, expansion and new business growth in our targeted geographies and customer segments are further evidence of our continued success.","Regarding the fourth quarter, results were consistent with our expectations and reflect continued strong operating fundamentals, as well as considerable investments in our future. These include: Service in clinical staffing for the high levels and growth we are expecting for the first quarter of 2012, and increased spending on branding, technology and product development across all of our emphasized businesses. These investments will continue to support future growth opportunities and strategic positioning. Ralph will describe the financial impact of these investments in a few moments.","Second, 2012 is going to be a significant year for Cigna as we continue to execute our growth strategy. Including the recently announced closing of the HealthSpring acquisition, which will accelerate our expansion into the growing U.S. Senior and Medicare markets. And lastly, we are making ongoing investments into our diversified portfolio to position us to deliver sustainable and attractive earnings growth in 2012 and beyond.","So let's dive in. 2011 was a strong year for Cigna and it marks more than 2 solid years of execution of our Go Deep, Go Global and Go Individual growth strategy. For the full year, we reported the adjusted income from operations of approximately $1.4 billion and delivered earnings and EPS growth of 12%. These results reflect strong organic revenue and earnings contributions from each of our ongoing businesses: Health Care, International and our Group business, demonstrating how our solutions create value for our customers and clients in today's very challenging economic environment.","For U.S. Health Care business, we delivered membership growth aided by strong client retention. Our results demonstrate that we are gaining market share in our targeted customer segment and geography. Specifically, we generated organic growth of approximately 17% in our select segment and approximately 4% in our middle-market segment. This growth continues to be predominantly in our ASO arrangements.","Our highly transparent, self-funded plans enable clients to benefit from our incentive-based, integrated health and engagement solutions while retaining greater control of their health benefits spending. In our International business, we delivered revenue growth of 31% along with sustained earnings growth. This includes growth from our Individual Health, Life and Accident business and our Expatriate Benefits business, which we recently rebranded as our Global Health Benefit business, to reflect the broadening demand for our services beyond expats to include third-country nationals, key local nationals and international business travelers.","In our International business, we expanded our distribution capabilities and our product portfolio with the acquisition of FirstAssist, which extends our presence in the U.K. and increases the number of Cigna affinity partners, while also adding a new travel insurance capability to our portfolio. With more than 7 million individual policies and 1 million global health care customers, Cigna's global propriety network, on-the-ground operations, established clinical models and local license space to sell in 30 countries and jurisdictions, continues to provide a meaningful competitive advantage for us.","In our Disability Group business, our revenue growth and strong profitability relative to our peers demonstrates the value that clients realize from Cigna's leading disability and productivity management programs. These programs help employees return to work faster and often prevent disability-related absences from happening in the first place. Our approach helps to improve the quality of life for individuals, increases workforce productivity and generates cost-savings for our clients and customers. Looking into 2012, Cigna is well positioned with our differentiated balance portfolio of businesses to deliver competitively attractive growth prospects. This includes our U.S. commercial business, where we continue to expect to deliver strong organic growth, our International business, with strong top line and earnings growth in excess of 20%, and the expansion into our Seniors and Medicare business, where the acquisition of HealthSpring is expected to be accretive in 2012, and highly accretive on a cash basis.","It is clear that the U.S. Health Care market place remains volatile and competitive. However, we are succeeding in expanding our existing client relationships and winning new clients who are focused on improving the health of their employee population and their total cost position.","As a result, we expect to deliver significant customer growth in 2012. Specifically, we now expect to add approximately 500,000 new commercial Health Care customers in 2012. This membership expansion is a direct result of repositioning our national account business and sustained growth in our select and middle-market customer segments. We will continue to deliver on the fundamentals that our clients have come to expect from Cigna: Service excellence, leading engagement and incentive-based programs that provide high clinical quality and lower health care costs, all while continuing to maintain disciplined underwriting and pricing standards.","As we've noted before, private and public health service delivery models will continue to evolve regardless of how health care legislation unfolds. In this environment, greater focus on health improvement and individual engagement in quality align very well with our strategy and capabilities. Let me touch on just a few examples. Our customer-centric model is anchored in a consultative sales approach with integrated health and productivity solutions designed to meet each client's unique cultural and workforce health profile.","Our new brand launched last fall underscores our focus on the individual and offers highly personalized service experience that is accessible and personally relevant. This approach is being well received by clients who are seeking to maintain a healthier, more productive workforce, by physicians who are striving to improve health outcomes for their patients and by individuals who want greater personalization and value for their investment.","A good indicator of this shift, to individual engagement, is the double-digit growth in consumer-directed health plans that our industry is seeing, while membership is declining in traditional HMO and PPOs here in the U.S.","Cigna was at the forefront of this transition, investing in and repositioning our customer engagement capabilities long before this market shift occurred. In 2011, our growth for consumer-directed plans was 35%, more than double the industry average. It is clear that our value proposition is resonating and we expect to continue to see growth in these plans in 2012.","An addition, we will also continue to drive innovation with Accountable Care Organizations by focusing on creating stronger engagement in care coordination between physicians and their patients through actionable information, assistance and incentives.","Cigna now has 17 of these patient center initiatives, with more than 1,800 primary care physicians spanning across 15 states.","With HealthSpring, we greatly enhance our capabilities to serve seniors and partner with physicians. HealthSpring offers a unique and proven physician partnering model based on effective engagement, highly targeted data exchanges, integrated care coordination programs and aligned incentives to help patients be healthier, enjoy a better quality of life and lower their overall health care costs.","Herb and I have visited most of the key HealthSpring markets during the last few months. Feedback from HealthSpring's physician partners and employees has been very positive. Visits to HealthSpring's LivingWell Centers provided me a first-hand view into the outstanding service HealthSpring customers are receiving. It is clear that together, Cigna and HealthSpring can deliver greater value for our customers throughout all stages of health and life.","In short, Cigna's success with customer and physician alignment in the commercial segment, along with HealthSpring's proven approach in the Seniors market, creates a complementary platform and positions for attractive future growth. ","Looking ahead to 2013 and beyond, Cigna is positioned for a strong future with several engines to deliver competitively attractive growth. These include our highly focused U.S. commercial business, where we are seeing increased demand for our health and productivity improvement capabilities. Our strong client retention and new client wins demonstrate we are gaining market share from companies who are seeking to improve their employees' health and lower their total cost. We expect to drive growth in the mid-single digits as we look to the future. In our International business, where we are experiencing elevated demand for health solutions to serve globally mobile individuals, and increasing opportunities created by the growing middle class and emerging markets. We are continuously evaluating opportunities to expand our International distribution capabilities and product portfolio, as well as invest in new markets where there is demand for our services. We made meaningful organic investments in our future with the opening of operations in Turkey, and establishing our joint venture with the TTK Group, to offer health, wellness and insurance products in India. We are now selling in Turkey and expect to begin selling in India in 2013, following regulatory approval.","Our Seniors and Medicare business where growth opportunities are increasing due to the aging population, eroding health status, and evolution of business models to improve quality and cost outcomes by engaging and incentivizing physicians. As we move forward, we plan to expand HealthSpring's sufferings beyond their current markets to leverage Cigna's broader U.S. footprint, including establish relationships with physicians and hospitals. We also plan to extend the value of HealthSpring's physician engagement model by developing new commercial offerings. By leveraging Cigna's and HealthSpring's combined capabilities, we expect to deliver continued growth by extending our health solutions across the government, employer-sponsored and individual consumer segments. Taken together, we continue to expect to deliver 10% to 13% EPS growth over the next 3 to 5 years.","Now before I turn it over to Ralph, let me just re-emphasize a few points. Our full year 2011 results reflect significant revenue and earnings contributions from each of our ongoing businesses, balanced with strategic investments that position us for the future. I am pleased with our continued progress in executing our growth strategy, and our results reflect the dedication and commitment of the more than 30,000 Cigna colleagues around the world who are working to improve the health, well-being and sense of security of our nearly 70 million customer relationships. The milestones we have reached and the steps we will take this year provide us with the opportunity to deliver sustained growth in 2012 and beyond. And finally, I believe our 2012 outlook represents a competitively attractive result and we are positioned for long-term sustainable growth. ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Ralph.","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will review Cigna's full year 2011 results and also discuss our outlook for the full year 2012, including contributions from the HealthSpring acquisition. In my review of consolidated and segment results, I will comment on adjusted income from operations. This is also the basis on which I'll provide our earnings outlook.","We had a very strong 2011, driven by effective execution of our strategy and are carrying solid momentum into this year. Our 2011 results include several key accomplishments, specifically top line growth for each of our targeted businesses, attractive organic membership growth in our targeted markets, Health Care earnings growth of 15%, International earnings growth of 19%, earnings per share growth of 12%, just to name a few.","Our fourth quarter results were in line with our expectation, and we generated strong overall revenue and earnings contributions while making significant strategic investments in capabilities in each of our businesses. Our full year 2011 consolidated revenues were $22 billion. Revenues reflect growth in premium and fees of 6% in Health Care, 32% in International and 4% in Group Disability and Life, driven by continued success in our targeted customer segments.","Full year consolidated earnings for 2011 were $1.43 billion, compared to $1.28 billion in 2010. Earnings per share for 2011 was $5.21 per share, a 12% increase over 2010, reflecting strong earnings from each of our ongoing businesses. Our 2011 earnings per share were $5.24, adjusting for the dilution of approximately $0.03 per share related to the shares issued in the fourth quarter for the HealthSpring acquisition.","Turning to Health Care. 2011 premiums and fees grew to $13.2 billion, representing a 6% increase from 2010. Full year Health Care earnings were $990 million and reflect contributions from sustained growth in our medical and specialty businesses, as well as the impact of favorable prior year development.","Importantly, we have increased our spending on strategic investments in the fourth quarter in branding and technology to support future growth in membership and capabilities. These increased investments amounted to $40 million before tax or approximately $0.09 a share on an after-tax basis.","We ended 2011 with 11.5 million Health Care members, which is approximately 2% higher than year end 2010. As David noted, our membership growth is aligned with our Go Deep strategy with the particularly strong results in our middle-market and select segments, where we offer clients differentiated funding alternatives and product solutions through a consultative and incentive-based approach.","Now turning to medical cost, in 2011, we achieved a competitively attractive commercial, medical cost trend of approximately 5% for our total book of business. I would remind you that approximately 90% of our customers are in funding arrangements were they directly benefit from these medical trend results.","Across our risk book of business, our fourth quarter earnings include: Favorable prior period claim development of $24 million after-tax. For the full year 2011, the impact of favorable prior year claim development was $53 million after-tax, including a negligible amount in the fourth quarter.","Specific to commercial guaranteed costs, our full year 2011 medical care ratio or MCR was 79.7% on a reported basis. Excluding prior year claim development, the commercial guaranteed costs, MCR for 2011 was 80.9%, including the effect of our rebate accrual.","Overall, we are pleased with our results in our medical risk business as they continually reflect good pricing and underwriting discipline, as well as sustained clinical quality for our clients and customers.","For the full year 2011, total operating expense ratio was 27.2%, which is a 50 basis-point improvement over the 2010 expense ratio.","Now, I will discuss the results in our other segments. Cigna's International business continues to deliver attractive growth and profitability. The results reflect strong retention and further product penetration of existing customers, as well as targeted new sales. Premiums and fees for 2011, totaled $3 billion, up 32% year-over-year, driven by strong customer retention and growth within our Health, Life and Accident business and our Global Health Benefits business. Our top line growth drove earnings of $289 million in 2011, which represents a strong 19% increase over 2010. Full year results were driven by strong customer retention and growth in Health, Life and Accident and Global Health Benefits businesses, partially offset by an elevated MCR in our Global Health Benefits business, in part due to business mix, as well as higher spending on strategic initiatives.","Our earnings in the fourth quarter were consistent with our expectations and demonstrate continued success in the marketplace. These results reflect solid top and bottom line growth, partially offset by continued strategic investments for future growth, some costs to streamline operation and unfavorable changes in foreign tax law. All totaling approximately $10 million after-tax or about $0.03 a share.","In our Group Disability and Life segment, premiums and fees for 2011 were $2.8 billion. Group premium and fees increased 4%, including 9% growth in our targeted Disability business. Full year 2011 earnings were $282 million, which was in line with our expectation and a good result in the challenging economic environment. We continue to deliver value through our market-leading Disability and Productivity Management model, which focuses on early customer engagement and leverages Cigna's proven clinical capabilities.","Full year 2011 earnings also reflect favorable Life and Accident experience, partially offset by higher disability claims, as well as the impact of strategic investments.","Finally, I would remind you that fourth quarter 2010 earnings included an after-tax gain of $11 million from the sale of a workers' compensation and case management business. Results for our remaining operations including Run-off Reinsurance, Other Operations and Corporate, total to an after-tax loss of $133 million for the full year 2011. The full year 2011 results includes the third quarter reserves strengthening related to our run-off VADBe book of business. No additional VADBe reserve strengthening was required in the fourth quarter. Overall, our 2011 results reflect strong revenue and earnings contributions from each of our ongoing businesses and these businesses continue to generate significant free cash flow.","Turning to our investment portfolio. We're pleased with our results in 2011. For the full year, we recognized net-realized investment gains of $41 million after-tax, coupled with strong net investment income results. Our commercial mortgage loan portfolio continues to perform well within a challenging economic environment. And overall, we continue to be pleased with the quality and diversification of our investment portfolio. Our strong investment management capabilities and disciplined approach to risk management have delivered solid results. ","Before turning to our 2012 outlook, I'll now provide an update regarding our acquisition of HealthSpring. We are pleased to announce this week that we closed the transaction on January 31, a very good outcome from a timing perspective. We have been engaged with HealthSpring management -- with the HealthSpring management team on integration, and plans to recognize significant growth opportunities as well as cost efficiencies over time. Consistent with our previous discussions, we expect the acquisition to be earnings accretive in the first full year and highly accretive on a cash basis.","I'll provide some color on the expected HealthSpring contributions in my discussion on the 2012 outlook. ","So now turning to 2012. We're carrying solid momentum into the year from strong membership-driven revenue growth, earnings growth off a strong 2011 and strategic investments that could provide sustained growth into the future, most significantly the HealthSpring acquisition.","This outlook reflects our expectation that the global economic conditions will remain challenging and that the U.S. unemployment rate remains essentially unchanged. Based on our current view, for the full year 2012, we expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $1.46 billion to $1.57 billion and EPS of $5 to $5.40 per share, reflecting continued, strong underlying results in each of our ongoing businesses. Adjusted for reserve -- adjusted for prior year reserve development and VADBe reserve strengthening, this represents growth of 2% to 10% in earnings per share over 2011. I would remind you that consistent with our prior practices, our outlook excludes any contribution from future reserve development or capital deployment.","For our Health Care business, including the impact of HealthSpring, we expect full year 2011 -- 2012 earnings in the range of $1.12 billion to $1.19 billion compared to 2011 results of $937 million excluding prior year claim development. This outlook reflects continued benefits from customer-driven revenue growth, specialty contribution and operating expense leverage.","I'll now summarize some of the key assumptions reflected in our Health Care earnings outlook for 2012, starting with membership. We anticipate full year 2012 membership growth of approximately 900,000, driven by organic growth and the addition of customers through the HealthSpring acquisition. We expect government medical membership to grow by approximately 400,000. HealthSpring added 365,000 Medicare Advantage customers at the acquisition date, and we expect some additional Medicare Advantage and Medicaid membership growth during the year. We expect commercial medical membership to grow by approximately 500,000, which is higher than what we had previously discussed. This growth is across all our targeted market segments and essentially all in our ASO funding arrangement. We expect the majority of that growth to be delivered in the first quarter.","Turning to medical cost. Our outlook assumes an increase in medical services utilization during 2012. For our total commercial book of business, we expect full year medical cost trend to be in the range of 6% to 7%, which is above the amounts we realized in 2011. These expected medical costs have been reflected in our pricing for 2012. Based on these factors and changing business mix, we would expect the full year MCR to be in the range of 81% to 82% for our commercial guaranteed book of business, which is approximately 50 basis points higher than the full year 2011 results, excluding prior year development.","Our Medicare Advantage MCR for the full year is expected to be in the range of 81.5% to 82.5%. Regarding operating expenses for full year 2012, we expect the total Health Care operating expense ratio to be in the range of 22.5% to 23.5%, based on our current outlook for membership growth and business mix.","Pulling the pieces together, we expect full year 2012 Health Care earnings, including HealthSpring, to be in the range of $1.12 billion to $1.19 billion.","We expect HealthSpring to contribute $160 million to $180 million to Health Care segment earnings, excluding transaction costs that will be reported as a special item. The 2012 earnings contribution from HealthSpring reflects approximately $130 million after-tax or $0.45 per share for depreciation and an amortization expense. This acquisition has significant strategic value and is immediately accretive. And in addition, on a cash basis, we expect to realize approximately 10% accretion in 2012.","Now moving to the other components of our outlook. For our International business, we expect continued strong top line growth and earnings in the range of $265 million to $285 million, which represents continued attractive growth on top of the strong 2011 earnings of $219 million, adjusted for their required accounting change for deferred acquisition costs adopted in 2012. This outlook reflects continued strength in both our Health, Life and Accident and Global Health Benefits businesses. The outlook also includes the impact of increased investments and new market expansion, as well as ongoing contributions from the Vanbreda acquisition.","Regarding Vanbreda, while we saw better-than-expected earnings in -- earnings contributions in 2011 associated with this acquisition, we estimate that the earnings contributions in 2012 will be consistent with 2011, which is less than our original expectation due in part to competitive pricing pressures, as well as a lower level of internalization of the insurance underwriting for some of our clients. We continue to view the strategic rationale and long-term growth opportunities for this business as attractive.","Importantly, overall, we expect International earnings growth of 21% to 30% for 2012, with growth in both our Health, Life and Accident and Global Health Benefits businesses.","For our Group Disability and Life business, we expect full year 2012 earnings in the range of $260 million to $280 million, which reflects the competitively attractive result in a continued challenging economic environment. This outlook for Group assumes revenue growth for both our Disability and Life books and strong execution of our Disability Management model, as well as increased investment in customer-facing capabilities.","Regarding our remaining operations, including Run-off Reinsurance, Other Operations and Corporate, we expect a loss of $185 million for 2012, inclusive of additional interest expense of approximately $55 million after-tax, associated with the incremental debt issued to finance the HealthSpring acquisition.","So all in for 2012, we expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $1.46 billion to $1.57 billion and consolidated EPS in the range of $5 to $5.40 a share.","I'll now discuss our capital management position and outlook. Overall, we continue to have good financial flexibility as our subsidiaries remain well-capitalized and are generating significant free cash flow to the parent, reflecting the strong return on capital in each of our ongoing businesses.","Regarding the HealthSpring acquisition, we have put in place a financing structure that allows us to maintain good financial flexibility. We ended 2011 with parent company cash of approximately $3.8 billion, which was used to fund the HealthSpring acquisition. And for the full year 2012, we expect some subsidiary dividends of approximately $1.3 billion. After funding the HealthSpring acquisition, as well as other sources and uses of capital in 2012, this outlook indicates that we would have approximately $900 million available for deployment. Approximately, half of which we would intend to hold for capital flexibility at the parent.","Overall, our capital position and outlook remains strong. And our capital deployment strategy and priorities remain unchanged. We will provide capital necessary to support the growth of our ongoing operations, as well as supporting our pension plan and Run-off Reinsurance business. We will pursue M&A activity with focus on acquiring capabilities and scale to further grow in our targeted areas in -- of focus, and after considering these first 2 items, we would return capital to shareholders primarily through share repurchase. I would remind you that we executed on each of these in 2011.","So now to recap. Our full year 2011 consolidated results reflect the strength of our global diversified portfolio of businesses and effective execution of our focused growth strategy with solid growth in our targeted customer segments. We expect the momentum from our 2011 results will position us well for strong growth in 2012, highlighted by strong revenue growth, as well as attractive customer growth. Earnings growth off of a strong 2011, EPS growth with the opportunity for [indiscernible] deployment, positive impact from the HealthSpring acquisition and targeted strategic investments which provide sustained growth into the future.","We will now turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First question, maybe if you can share some views on the revenue outlook for 2012, maybe a consolidated revenue view and then maybe some guidance around what you're expecting for the Health Care business?","David M. Cordani","Scott, it's David. I'll start. Obviously, we didn't walk through the detailed quantification of the revenue outlook. If you take the comments that I made and Ralph made, we expect to have strong retention and good client adds throughout the -- throughout all of our businesses. So we had good revenue growth, very importantly, in the specific geographies and buying segments. I'll comment specifically on Health Care and see if Ralph wants to add, but within the Health Care business, we stepped out of 2011 with net -- a growth of about 2% in terms of new customers or individualized recovering. Stepping into 2012, as we noted in our prepared remarks, we've increased our outlook from at least 400,000 to 500,000 commercial lives. And what's exciting about that is, one, the vast majority of that will show up in the first quarter, two, it's heavily oriented to the ASO business portfolio, with a lot of engagement and incentive-based programs that are attached to it, and three, there's some good balance and symmetry in all of our operating segments, the national segment's contribution, the middle-market segment contribution and the select segment. So we feel good about both the quality and I'll call location, both segments and geographies for our revenue growth. Ralph, would you add anything to that?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Maybe I think -- maybe all I can just add is, within the Health Care segment on our guaranteed portion of the business, which is a smaller percentage of the total, there is some pricing in there to the cost trend as well, so that we play through the revenue, with no change to the medical cost ratio net. So there's a little bit of revenue lift just from the small part of our guaranteed book. And I think just overall, I think you could think of it as in the long term, we look at this business growing, in mid-single digits on the revenue line, and we certainly are putting a great step in that direction this year.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, and then I just wanted to ask a follow-up question on the DNA expense guidance, and maybe if you -- walk us through the accounting treatment that you're using for that? And then what you expect for DNA expense in the out years? I think you're using a declining balance approach, so should that start to come down? Or do you expect that to be similar in, let's say, '13?","David M. Cordani","Sure. Clearly the earnings contribution from HealthSpring is affected by amortization. I had mentioned in my remarks, it's about $130 million after-tax. The valuation is still being finalized by some outside experts, but this is a pretty good estimate. And in the phasing of the amortization is, as you point out, skewed early -- to the early years. So what we would expect to see over the next several years is about a 10% to 15% decline in the level off of this year, over the next several years, and then you begin to see it level out.","Operator","We'll go next to Ana Gupte with Sanford Bernstein.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I wanted to follow up on your commercial guaranteed cost results for the quarter. So it's -- I mean, it's not terrible by any means, but that being said, Aetna came up pretty clearly saying that utilization's low. And your days and claims payable seem to have trended down significantly. And it certainly wasn't anything to write home about in terms of the beat. So I'm trying to understand what exactly is causing a result that's in line to probably slightly worse than even your own expectations? Is it seasonality? And is it MLR? So did you accrue later? I understand you have a different methodology, or are you seeing anything to do with pricing? One of your competitors says you're underpricing doesn't show up in your premium yields. Or is it trend?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Ana, it's Ralph. First, there's a lot of moving parts in all this. So let me, in a couple of parts to your question. First, overall, we came in at where we expected. And in the first -- just to remind you on our guaranteed cost of book of business, again, a small piece of our total portfolio, but having said that, came in as we expected. Essentially, you're a year flat. Also, what you see -- back on the comment you made on the payable, there's some noise in there because we exited the Private Fee for Service business and so as those liabilities ran out, you see a reduction in those liabilities. So when you strip that out, it's a fairly even level year-to-year. So that has some noise in the numbers looking year-on-year. And then I think, also importantly, in the fourth quarter you see a jump year-on-year, quarter-on-quarter. Again, full year, it's essentially where we expected, essentially flat. In the quarter, you see a big jump. Because just the prior period development flow into the fourth quarter of 2010 was significantly higher than the flow of prior period development on our guaranteed cost book of business in the fourth quarter this year. So there was about a 400 basis-point swing, and it's all because of that. So absent the change in the prior period flow, we're essentially flat year-on-year.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, so follow-up on that. It sounds like pricing, and my math tells me it's okay. Days and claims payable, you're attributing it to pricing. And then the MLR largely to a reserve headwind. Going forward, can you tell us what your -- is being embedded in your outlook for Health Care in terms of your cost trend? And would you be able to highlight the puts and takes in terms of the tailwinds from possibly unit costs, the reform provisions, which are one-time, and then possible headwinds from COBRA which you don't see now, utilization if you're seeing, or -- and what exactly are you embedding in your expectations?","David M. Cordani","Ana, it's David. Just -- I'll start and ask Ralph to embellish on the trend piece. But as you started your second part of your question, your headline is right. The pricing, the underlying medical cost trend, and as Ralph said, the net result for 2011 is in line with our expectations. We feel good about it. And to be very clear, we don't see any pricing issue relative to that small book of business. Secondly, in Ralph's prepared remarks, you referenced approximately 5% medical cost trend for 2011. We feel good about that. We've referenced an uptick in that medical cost trend going into 2012. That is predominant utilization-oriented, as we're making assumptions that utilization will escalate off the lower levels that exist today. To your question, what pricing for that? So pricing for that in our assumption is that we move forward within our book of business, and to the extent it doesn't manifest itself or manifest itself more slowly, we'll see that in our results as we go forward. Last thing I'll say, is the rate execution that we have with our physician-hospital partners were -- at 2012 is also in line with our expectations. A meaningful amount of the large contracts are entered into in the first quarter of the year. And our team's doing a good job in terms of partnering with physicians and hospitals in terms of revenue management for them, administrative cost savings, et cetera. So that basic rate execution is in line with our expectations and we've had several years of consistency around that. So headline is, comfortable with the pricing for '11, comfortable with the pricing for '12. We feel good about the medical trend we'd delivered in aggregate for our book of business in '11. Step off into 2012, is in line with our expectations, and our rate execution from a contracting standpoint is in line with our expectations. And it's the third year of consistency for us. Ralph, any more color on the medical cost trend assumptions?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","No. I mean, essentially for '12, even to this year, essentially, Ana, there may be some wiggle in there because of mix that runs through. But essentially to David's point, we're pricing to where the trend is, so you'd expect a fairly even level year-to-year on ratio.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So they said to conclude then that, there is some upside to your Health Care guidance, assuming the low levels of utilization that currently persist. They remain throughout the year because you're pricing for something that's above what you're seeing now?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Yes, I mean you can obviously have to draw your conclusion, but as we tried to lay out in our prepared remarks, really there's 2 things relative to that point that we try to be very clear on. One, it's our practice and we're consistent with we do not put any assumption for reserve development in our future years. So that's held out and anything that transpires, we have transparence and clarity. Two, we've projected for an uptick in utilization. You see the trend numbers we've talked about, we've priced for that. And to your conclusion, to the extent it manifests itself at a slower or different rate, they'll be both contribution to our clients and customers and some contribution for our shareholders.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And at this time, we will go to Josh Raskin with Barclays Capital.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess my question just talks about the guidance, just broadly speaking for 2012. It sounds like membership is probably coming in a little bit better than your long-term expectation. You're talking about HealthSpring being accretive. And it sounds like additional cash potentially. It's better and yet -- the guidance is at best kind of 2% to 10% EPS growth and you're talking about 10% to 13% long-term. So how do we think about 2010 as being a bad year -- I'm sorry, 2012 being a bad year, relative to sort of that long-term 10% to 13%?","David M. Cordani","It's David. We view 2012 as a good year and so let me put context around it. And importantly, I want to start from where your question did, the market place, the market demand. When we look at '12, '13 and beyond, we continue to shift back here in the U.S. of the orientation of buyers around the health and productivity focus, the orientation around the movement around incentive, engagement-based programs, both for the consumer, client-driven, but also increasingly, in terms of physician partnership. And then the increasing demand for the transparent programs that we offer, whether it's ASO or experience-rated. Outside the U.S., the palpable, continued growth of the middle class in emerging markets and our physicians, and the growth of the globally mobile, all bode well for us as we look to buying trends. So to your point, we feel good about the top line positioning both in terms of what we're stepping out of '11 and into '12 with in the U.S. and outside the U.S. As we look at our '12 guidance, our '12 guidance has a variety of things that we assume in it. First and foremost, as we referenced, Ralph and I referenced, there's no capital deployment in the way we build up our assumption. There's no reserve development in the way we build up our assumption. We're stepping into the year with the 500,000 customers in the U.S. Health Care business, and sustained growth in our International business. We have 11 months of contribution from HealthSpring, and as Ralph also articulated, we have a first year upward skewing of the amortization that comes along with that. And within taking all of that into consideration, plus the full year of financing, we have an outlook that is in the 2% to 10% range. And if you bookend that with '11 and the directional comments I made for '13, the 10% to 13% is a multi-year. It's not a year-in, year-out. It's a multi-year view, and we're making investments and strategic positioning in the company to make sure we can continue to deliver that. So we view '12 as a good year. We view '11 as a good year. And we're quite excited about setting up an even more attractive year to look to '13.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So maybe let me ask it a different way. So 2012 is a good year, one in which you're getting HealthSpring -- and I think you will be probably very helpful if you can give an EPS number in terms of the accretion from Health, on top of this. But it sounds like, 10 to 13 long-term is predicated on this additional growth, which sounds like, that's not lacking in 2012, you're certainly seeing that. And like I said, it sounds like HealthSpring's accretive. So, I'm just curious how you get from a good year in '12, hitting 2 to 10, to a long-term average of 10 to 13.","David M. Cordani","Sure. Josh, I'll try to give it to you in a macro level, and there's a couple of supplemental pieces of information we tried to help, as Ted noted, in the advanced materials. But then I'll ask Ralph to expand on the HealthSpring, specifically. But at the end of the day, consistent with what we've talked with you all about in our Investor Days and otherwise, as we look forward, we see the U.S. commercial business, with focus of delivering sustained mid-single digit revenue growth opportunities with somewhat above that in terms of earnings growth. We see the Medicare and Seniors space delivering high single, low double-digit growth in our earnings opportunities. And we see the International business continuing to deliver mid- to upper teens delivery results on a growth basis, and then, as we've talked about, before we have the additional capital deployment that would come off of our free cash flow. So it's the combination of those 2 that come together, the organic contribution with the balance in our portfolio of the U.S., to the Seniors and then the International business with ongoing capital deployment that steps us up as we go forward. ","Ralph, if I could ask you just to highlight the kind of EPS in-year on HealthSpring? I think that would be helpful.","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Sure, and Joshua, as David mentioned, too, we had -- and Ted, we had a slide and that we posted on the website that helps -- would help bring some clarity to this, too, beyond our speaking points. A couple of things, one, when you look at the earnings outlook for HealthSpring, which we put in a range of $160 million to $180 million. On an accretion basis, that would be $0.03 to $0.10 per share, accretive. And then when you add back the amortization, which we pointed out was skewed to the early years here, it would bring us to 10% cash EPS accretion. So immediate accretion, coming right into the first year. And then beyond that, as we think about it, there are some other things. There's another month coming through, there's only 11 months out of '12. The amortization does pare down over time as we pointed out. And then also, the build of cost and revenue synergies and growth opportunities are really out ahead of us, beyond 2012. So I think the opportunity for additional accretion and value creation is really going well beyond 2012. But the good news is, we're immediately accretive right out of the gate.","Operator","We'll go next to John Rex with JPMorgan.","John F. Rex - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I'm going to continue in kind of the same path here. So I just want to focus exclusively on the Health segment, and for a moment, I want to focus on the legacy Health segment, so x HealthSpring. So I mean, it looks like -- so, let's take out the favorable development midpoint guidance, it would look for about 5% operating's growth, is that correct?","David M. Cordani","That's about right.","John F. Rex - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, so wouldn't you characterize this, as I mean, this isn't just -- this is a really good year for enrollment gains for you. I wouldn't expect every year to trend, I mean, hopefully it will, but I wouldn't expect every year to trend this well. And help me understand why we're delivering so little to the bottom line in terms of impact for what should be kind of a very kind of low variable cost to add here? And then -- and the issue being so we're kind of that -- what you talked about kind of midpoint long-term earnings growth for this segment in what seems to be like a very good enrollment year?","David M. Cordani","John, let me just try to frame that broadly. When you look at first year, I think if you take the 5% and you look at the 500,000 lives we're talking about, you can kind of correlate the 2, and you're saying, well, where's the margin expansion? One, I think you know and recognize that when you have first year contribution of lives, there's cost to setting up those lives, bringing those lives on board, et cetera. So we're building a future annuity. And we're building a high quality future annuity if you like. Secondly, we've been very clear. We're continuing to make very targeted investments in the business, and we'll continue to make those investments. We've expanded our brand spending. We're expanding some capability builds, and we're making trade-offs around that. And that both presents a headwind and a tailwind opportunity for the rate and pace of the investments we'll make relative to that. And finally, consistent with my answers to Ana before, we were making estimation that there's going to be some uptick in medical cost trend as we go forward. So we think the estimate on the page is a prudent estimate, and it's an estimate that's based upon both the underlying earnings power, stepping off a very strong 2011, as you said with or without the reserve development, good organic growth. Very importantly, we're choosing to invest back in the business. And we will guide the rate and pace of that as we look on the fundamentals. But we've boded well in terms of yields from that. We'll continue to make those investments as we look into the future.","John F. Rex - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And maybe sizes, some of the rates -- how would you characterize kind of those incremental investments, so we can kind of think about what headwind they're creating? I guess just kind a follow on that also is, are there integration costs that are meaningful or not, that are being incorporated in the outlook also? So that is HealthSpring integration cost that would not recur in the out year?","David M. Cordani","Ralph, on the integration costs?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","This -- in 2012, there are some, but not that significant. And I would say, while we don't obviously have the plan forward beyond '12 fully laid out, I think you'd expect '12, '13 to be relatively even in the amount of integration costs that flow in both of those years.","John F. Rex - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you size those Ralph?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","I'd rather not at this time because we really just closed the transaction. They're kind of formulating those plans. But I think importantly, the tailwinds on this are clearly you have the synergies, both cost and revenue growth-oriented, really all outside of 2012. So those will really be coming to 2013 and beyond. And there's very little if any in 2012. And then you have the benefit as we talked about of the timing items of the additional month and the amortization skew.","David M. Cordani","John, on the first part of your question, and as you'd expect, I'm not going to give you a pinpoint answer. But your question was to step up investments and versus the 5%. You can think about several points of discretion that we're taking in terms of redeploying operating earnings back into the business, above and beyond the historic run rate. And we'll make trade-offs. So back your typical question of headwinds and tailwinds, we've demonstrated over the last couple of years that we'll make trade-offs relative to the rate and pace of those investments, be they technology, geography, brand capability build out, but we'll continue to do so because we're running the business for the long term.","John F. Rex - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, and then there's one kind of broad thing, across your book in your outlook for 150 basis points step up in trend, have you seen any evidence that utilization patterns have changed from what you saw exiting -- from what you saw on the 4Q, essentially?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","No, we haven't at this point.","Operator","We'll go next to Justin Lake with UBS.","Justin Lake - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","First off, I was hoping you could walk us through the pressure on the Disability business in the fourth quarter? And what are the moving parts embedded for 2012 in terms of the reserves, maybe reserves like the benefits from '11 that I might be forgetting, that won't reoccur any expectation of -- what would be embedded for an expectation of those higher fourth quarter costs trending into '12?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Just, I'll take that one. In terms of the fourth quarter, I think a couple of points I'd want to make. One, is that importantly, in a year ago in the fourth quarter, we had a gain of about $11 million from the sale of the Intercore business. So that's affecting the comparison. But having said that, even if you would adjust for that, earnings were slightly down in the quarter year-on-year. And what we're seeing there is some favorable claims experience, continuing on the Life side of the business, continuing increase -- I wouldn't say at a higher rate, but at the similar rate that we've been seeing in the back half of this year on the Disability side of the business, which is offsetting some of the favorable Life side. And we continue to make investments on both systems and then kind of capabilities in terms of case management and being able to work with our clients and customers on early engagement and managing through for better outcomes, which ultimately, over time is going to play out to improving disability trends, which we've seen in the past. So those pieces are all moving and that's why you see, the -- even after adjusting for the gain in last year, a slight decline in the Group earnings. Then when you move into 2012 -- here as we said, we're on a macro basis, our assumption is that we're going to be in a continued difficult economic environment. And on that basis, we're expecting to see some of the pressure on the disability claims side continue, and in a more even level of, I would call, continued good performance on the Life side, so we're not necessarily getting earnings lift, but we're continuing to see good performance there. And then making some year-on-year modest investments. So that's why you see the range that we put out there to be even-to-slightly down relative to this year's results. And this year, we're exiting with we think the appropriate level reserves on the balance sheet, and we're comfortable how that's been set up given the experience we've seen.","Justin Lake - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. And just to follow up here. On the other operating cost line, I see in Health Care you spent about $100 million this year on individual market expansion. And I'm just wondering, what is the return there, given I know that hasn't been a huge business for you historically in terms of profit? And then what do you see that becoming? And if you look ahead and we think 2013, if you look, it might have some lower costs and therefore, from HealthSpring you might have an accelerating year there, are we going to see further investment? And if so, on what other segments might you be spending -- looking to spend some dollars?","David M. Cordani","It's David. So let me just frame that and then answer the specific question. First is, I think we have a very successful individual franchise outside the U.S. and I want to just touch on the key strength there because it converts over to some of the U.S. direction. So our key strength there is really market segmentation and targeted needs identification, down to micro-segments, product development and innovation, and then the multi-channel distribution, be it telemarketing, Internet distribution, DirecTV. Back here in the U.S., the line you're talking about, over the last 2 years we've been driving some very targeted pilots in the individual primary space. To drive some targeted growth, we wanted to target about 100,000 lives or so over a couple of years, which we did in some specific geographies and test some innovation, product design, underwriting approaches, seeing the change in regulatory environment, some micro sub-segmentations, some different distribution channel approach. Yes, we did broker an agent, but we did distribution outside that. And we're able to grab some very good learnings from a profitability or drain standpoint. The loss ratios are in line with our expectations. It's a sub-scale business so the expense ratio is not where you'd want it to be for a long -- on a long-term basis. Lastly, it bridges back to your comment. One of the things we're quite excited about with HealthSpring is in Health Care, especially individual Health Care is so local, the ability to use their, what we call, physician-directed network approach and physician-directed partnership approach to offer very targeted commercial offerings for individuals as we go forward, and we're going to seek to build on that. None of that is built into our 2012 estimation as Ralph mentioned. Revenue growth and profitability synergies are broadly 13 and beyond. But we will build on that. So what you're seeing in the expenses is the underlying operations for that, about 100,000 lives. There will be a little bit more growth to that as we target -- play with some initiatives in 2012 and we're excited about stepping into '13 well in advance of '14 changes and distribution.","Operator","We'll go next to Christine Arnold with Cowen and Company.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","A couple of quick follow-ups here. I estimate that the prior period development last year is $64 million. All guaranteed cost was worth about 620 basis points on a guaranteed cost-loss ratio. Was all the prior period development that you reported in the fourth quarter this year in the guaranteed cost line?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","I missed the back part of your question. Was all the ...","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Was all the prior period development this quarter, the 20 -- I think it was an $24 million, was all that in guaranteed costs?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","No, only a portion of it. Only a portion of it was. I think around $8 million or so.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So $8 million guaranteed costs. Where was the rest?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","On our experience rated side.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Experience rate was the rest. Okay. And then, why is Vanbreda not growing earnings in 2012?","David M. Cordani","Christine, it's David. Relative to Vanbreda, first off, for 2011, the earnings contribution from Vanbreda in 2011 was a bit higher than our expectations. A little bit of that was some internalization of the underwriting margins a bit ahead of plan for '11 versus '12. Some of it was expenses. Some of it was new business growth. Looking into 2012, the '11 base is a little higher, but at end of the day, the 2012 number is lower than our original 2012 expectations. Really 2 forces, competitive pricing environment in the global landscape relative to that sub-segment is elevated, and we're maintaining our pricing discipline. So less business. Secondly, the rate and pace of internalization of some of the underwriting margins are lower or less than what we had planned for 2012. So net-net, better in 2011, less in 2012. As Ralph mentioned, strategically, we still feel good about the outset, and with that movement in 2012, which we'll note with our International guidance, we're still expecting to grow the International earnings in the 20% to 30% range in 2012, which we think is an outstanding result.","Operator","We go next to Charles Boorady, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Charles Andrew Boorady - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Two questions, first. If you can peel back the onion on the 2011 full year cost trend, and what you saw for utilization versus unit cost increases for inpatient, outpatient and pharmacy?","David M. Cordani","Charles, David. I'll just give you the macro, and ask Ralph to give you the pieces. At the end of the day when you think about the 2011 trend, you should think about the vast majority of that 5 percentage unit. So at the headline, you think about the vast majority of that is unit costs. As it relates to the components, you'd expect to see the facility side of it to be higher than the professional side. Ralph has a few other pieces to highlight for you.","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Sure. What we're seeing on the couple of the components here, on inpatient, mid- to high-single digits, outpatient, more mid-single-digit level, pharmacy come in the 3% range. Those are the trends that we see that makeup, in total the 5%.","Charles Andrew Boorady - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, and in terms of inpatient-outpatient, do you have generally the utilization component recognizing the vast majority as unit cost?","David M. Cordani","As I noted before, Charles, think about utilization as essentially de minimis.","Charles Andrew Boorady - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, for both in and out?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Correct. Yes.","Charles Andrew Boorady - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then, for cash at the parent in 2012, can you just step us through where it sat at the end of 2011? And how much deployable cash you think you have in 2012, including any excess statutory capital post the HS acquisition that you might be able to dividend up to the parent?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Sure. Charles, it's Ralph. I was feeling great about our position as we exit the year, significant amount of cash on hand. We expect -- as I mentioned in my remarks, subsidiary dividends at about $1.3 billion. And then included in our plans would be to continue to fund our pension plan well above the minimum requirements and continue to do that, as well as when you look at other net sources and uses, we would expect to have just a little less than $1 billion of available cash. We'd like to keep about half of that, sort of conservatively for flexibility, held at the parent. And that means the other half, we would be looking to redeploy. The other thing I would add to that is with that type of plan, we will be making a meaningful step down in our leverage ratio based on the earnings contribution from the business. And frankly, we have a little bit of flexibility there, too, in terms of the timing of that. So that gives us some additional capability. But all in, our expectation will be a little less than $1 billion at the parent at the end of the year, and about half of that, clearly deployable, and then we have some flexibility beyond that.","Operator","We'll go next to Carl McDonald with Citigroup.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","If I look at your Other and Corporate segments, it looks like you lost $85 million in 2011. You've got that going to a loss of $185 million in 2012. $55 million of that I get from the increased interest expense. Is there any other major item to single out there? Or is that just the usual cushion that the put into the guidance?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Yes, I think you're looking at it pretty correctly. There's the interest piece in there, and then it is a plan, and we have no specific area designated for the balance that you point out.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, and then just a follow-up question on the amortization. In response to the earlier question, did you say that amortization will be down 10% to 15% per year for the next few years? Or pretty stable at that 45% hit and then, let's say, 3 years out, it falls 10% to 15%.","Ralph J. Nicoletti","More sequentially, Carl. So each year for the next few years about 10% to 15% lower. Carl, just one other item though, just remember there's another month in 2013, so it will even be in the lower end of the range next year, but then more at the higher end of the range sequentially after that.","Operator","We will go next to Dave Windley, Jefferies & Company.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask a follow-up to Justin's earlier questions about your investments. And focusing in on International, I guess what I'm interested in, David, is philosophically do you see the International business at some point being able to grow bottom line faster than top line? And are you making those investments today so that, that can happen in the future when maybe the revenue growth is not so robust?","David M. Cordani","I appreciate it. First, when you think about that business, think about the 2 major drivers of that business today, are the Individual business where we target the emerging and growing middle class in the emerging markets, and then the globally mobile business. Both of those businesses have inherent tailwinds behind them in terms of just secular growth. And the underlying business strategy for International that we've been consistent around is that it is a growth business and it is a top line growth story. We've -- as we articulated, our 10% to 13% EPS growth for the corporation, we did not embed, I'll call it, margin expansion that would generate what you said. So what you said is you'd grow the bottom line faster than the top line. The exciting part of this business is we see over the strategic horizon, the ability to achieve top line growth rates, high teens and potentially beyond, as we've demonstrated over the recent past. We're making investments to make sure we're in position because product innovation and geographic expansion is a key enabler to us. As the market moves and changes, if you take your hypothesis that we don't see unfolding over the next 3 or 4 years, if the market -- a certain of our markets mature a little bit more, yes, we have markets in our portfolio, we're the bottom line grows faster than the top line, but the portfolio in total, you're going to see more of the top line and bottom line either grow in-line, or it's slightly different if we're making growth investments.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then on the Vanbreda piece in particular, was the slower level or lower level of internalization that you're commenting on for 2012, is that opportunity lost or opportunity delayed?","David M. Cordani","It's -- I appreciate the question. Broadly speaking, it's opportunity delayed, right? It's a -- there's a market environment out there. There's a pretty differentiated value proposition. There is purchasing cycles that IGOs and NGOs have. And as you go through those purchasing cycles, as you might imagine, just like other business, the larger entities have longer-duration purchasing cycles, the smaller entities have shorter-duration purchasing cycles. So that's wherein both Ralph's comments and my comments. We still feel good about this capability and positioning strategically. So we view it as more opportunity-delayed as we manage the portfolio in total.","Ralph J. Nicoletti","I guess the other thing I'd add, too, we also stay disciplined on our pricing and underwriting, too, and I think that's very important. And so we're not just kind of going after revenue, but we're trying to strike the right balance there, too. So I think the team there has put some good discipline in place, too, as we work through this.","Operator","We go next to Kevin Fischbeck, Banc of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to ask a couple of questions on the HealthSpring contribution and just how that compares to the S-4 that was filed with the merger. I mean, I see a little bit of math here, but it looks like, if you adjust for the DNA and interest expense that according to the S-4, they were looking for something closer to 210 versus the 160 to 180 that you're including in guidance, and that their MLR target was 80.7, but you're assuming something much higher than that. So can you talk a little bit about what that delta is?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Yes, our guidance for '12 is consistent with the performance and the expectations that we put in the valuation. As I put it in our remarks, and the very significant accretion, I think there's some trickiness in trying to reconcile the guidance to what is ultimately there for a few different reasons. One, on a tax, before tax, after-tax basis, you have to add back the amortization, the additional month, and there's a lot of moving pieces within there, and there is a little bit of the integration cost included that you wouldn't have seen in the -- that you wouldn't have seen in that projection that was in the proxy. So when you put those pieces together, we're pretty close to where that is and we're spot on to where we were in our valuation.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, and then if I might ask Herb to just expand a little bit in terms of how you feel about the quality of the business. We're stepping out of the fourth quarter and into the first quarter, knowing the volume, the sales, the quality, and the loan [ph] loss ratio, et cetera. Herb, you'd want to expand on that?","Herbert A. Fritch","No, we feel pretty good there. Everything is pretty much right in line with our growth expectations. Our medical loss ratios have been very consistent and favorable with the positive trends we've seen. And I comment, the one clarification on the loss ratio is really adding in the Phoenix Cigna business that ran at a little higher loss ratio. So it really isn't a deterioration in the legacy HealthSpring business.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And then just maybe, just one follow-up there, just on this opportunity you keep talking about for revenue growth next year within combining Cigna and HealthSpring. How quickly can you add new geographies? Are you going to be able to do that in a meaningful way for the 2013 season? Or with the deal just closing, integration going on, is it going to be difficult to do that and that's maybe more of a 2014 opportunity?","David M. Cordani","Kevin, you think about it in a couple of steps. Herb's business model has done a nice job of being able to, I'll say, expand to related geographies. So just think about counties expanding off of the existing geographies. We'll push hard on that in collaborating with Herb and his team to drive some acceleration. The work as you might imagine is already underway to figure out the additional geographies. And it's an open question in terms of the rate and pace in terms of how fast we'll be able to step into those in '13. '14 for sure, and the heavy lifting work is being done right now from a sequencing standpoint between the new geographies for MA and the existing geographies to drive the commercial business into.","Operator","We go next to Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I'd like to get a better understanding of the International margins, if you would, in terms of things causing pressure on it this quarter. Yes, you talked about the favorable third quarter reserve studies. I don't really recall what that was. Perhaps, you could refresh me in what it was, the favorable reserve studies' impact on margins in the third quarter? And then how much of the impact on margins is related to sort of the shorter term things of near-term spending versus some of the cost streamlining?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Sure, Peter, it's Ralph. A couple of pieces in here, when you look at the sequential flow of the International earnings, the reserve studies -- actually, several of them across different geographies, actually in the year ago, while we're in the fourth quarter this year, they were completed in the third quarter, and we recognize them. Think about in around the $5 million after-tax range as an impact. The other thing that we did point out, which is a one -- it's an item for -- that happened in the fourth quarter and will recur in '12, is that the tax rate in Korea did not decline. It was expected to decline and then there was a rule from the government there that they would not decline it from 24% to 22%. We had to recognize that in full in our fourth quarter this year for the deferred tax liabilities that we had. So you had an outside impact in the fourth quarter of '11, which will carry about the same level of impact in 2012. And then, the other areas are on the staging of the market expansions particularly in India and Turkey, as well as some costs to streamline operations throughout the International areas, no one area in a significant way. So when you put all those together, that's -- those are the drivers of the change. I think when you step back then from it, I don't think you should feel really any different about our margins and how we talked about those being in the higher single digit area over time. But quarter-to-quarter, they're going to bounce around a little bit because of these kinds of things.","Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And yet you're projecting sort of a mid-single-digit number. Is that because of DAP charge, so that's separate from what you were talking about before, in terms of margins? So your margins will have to be lower than the higher single-digit?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","You're right, the DAP piece does have a couple of hundred basis-point impact on margins. No impact to cash flow, no impact to returns.","Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","But the real margin would be more of a mid-single digit number going forward? And then in terms of the competitive pressure that you felt in Vanbreda, did you find that in some of your existing businesses as well, like in particularly in South Korea?","David M. Cordani","We did not -- it's David, we did not -- the Korean business retention rates were outstanding in 2011, new business growth and product innovation. And think about Korea -- predominantly, when we talk about Korea, think about that as the individual Health, Life and Accident portfolio. Now we service expats in Korea, of course, but with bulk of the earnings driver when we talk about Korea is the individual Health, Life and Accident business. As opposed to Vanbreda, think about expats largely IGO, intergovernment organizations. But we did not see any impact to speak of in Korea.","Operator","Our last question will come from Chris Rigg, Susquehanna.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just one last big picture question for you guys. Sort of the topic of the day in the investment community is the dual eligible opportunity. Obviously, you guys have brought on substantial Medicare assets with HealthSpring. I really don't have much positioning in the Medicaid side. I guess, can you comment on, what -- if you actually view the dual eligibles as an opportunity for you guys, and if you do, what you might be able to do over the near-term to improve your positioning to benefit from the potential expansion of managed care into that segment?","David M. Cordani","It's David. I'll start and I'll ask Herb to expand based on his experience and insights. From a strategy standpoint, we've been very consistent. We viewed in the U.S., our #1 priority in terms of inorganic expansion was in the Medicare space, and we took our time obviously, because we want to find an asset, we thought that had really differentiated capabilities. And we found that with HealthSpring in terms of the clinical capabilities. As we've talked about in the past, we said, off of Medicare asset that has differentiated clinical and physician engagement capabilities, we saw the opportunity on a targeted basis to pursue Medicaid. Using our Go Deep strategy, so market-by-market and specifically, looking at the ABD or dual populations. So we had that view for several years now. Clearly, there are some change in the marketplace due to budgetary constraints and pressures and seeing that the duals could benefit from a more comprehensively managed portfolio. The good news is within HealthSpring you have a proven capability to deliver an outstanding clinical quality, service quality and cost outcome for individuals, especially your higher medical costs or higher comorbidity population. And Herb has built an entr\u00e9e into the Medicaid space as an initiation. Herb, if I could ask you to just expand on how you think about the dual population?","Herbert A. Fritch","First, we certainly have a whole -- we've dual snaps in all of our geographies today. We serve a lot of the duals from a federal perspective in terms of the benefits that they cover. We are looking to expand come, as David said, I think our clinical models work exceptionally well with that population. In March, we'll start -- as one of the dual eligible star-plus [ph] providers in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, should give us about 20,000 to 30,000 new lives there. And we're bidding on at least one other state that's opening up the duals now. So we're hopeful that this is a real growth opportunity for us. Some states are considering, I think going through their current Medicaid contractors and when we're going to see if there's a way to -- partner or get in with those states, too. But there are other states that are bidding them out separately, where that happens, I think we're clearly well positioned to deal with that.","Operator","And I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. David Cordani for any closing comments.","David M. Cordani","Just briefly, I want to thank you for your questions today and your continued interest in Cigna. And in closing, just to emphasize a few points from our discussion. One, I'm pleased with the continued progress we are having in executing our strategy and just highlight that our results reflect the dedication and commitment of our 30,000-plus colleagues around the world who work tirelessly to improve the health, well-being and sense of security of our customers. The milestones that we've reached and the steps that we're targeted to take in 2012 and beyond, position us for a very strong top line and bottom line growth, specifically in our highly-focused U.S. commercial business, our International business and our Seniors and Medicare business here in the United States.","We view that our 2012 outlook represents a competitively attractive result and we are positioned for long-term sustained growth.

We will begin by turning the call over to Mr. Will McDowell. Please go ahead, Mr. McDowell.","William McDowell - Cigna Corp.","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I am Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom McCarthy, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. Joining David and Tom for the Q&A portion of this morning's call is Eric Palmer, Cigna's Deputy Chief Financial Officer.","In our remarks today, David and Tom will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's first quarter 2017 financial results, as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2017. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. Specifically, we use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, shareholders' net income, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com.","In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2017 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.","Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, I note that in the first quarter, we recorded two charges to shareholders' net income, which we reported as special items. The first special item was an after-tax charge of $83 million or $0.32 per share due to a long-term care guaranty fund assessment related to Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company and its subsidiary American Network Insurance Company.","The second special item was an after-tax charge of $49 million or $0.19 per share for merger-related transaction costs.","As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations in our discussion of financial results.","Also, consistent with past practices when we make any prospective comments on earnings or EPS outlook we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future capital deployment or prior-year development of medical costs. And with that I will turn the call over to David.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Thanks, Will. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today.","Before we get started, I'd like to take a moment to thank Tom McCarthy for his many years of service with Cigna. As you know Tom announced his retirement this past February. Tom has not only been an instrumental leader within our organization for more than three decades with considerable accomplishments and contributions to our growth and success, he's also a good friend to many of us, and we'll miss him on a both personal and professional level. Tom's excited to start his next chapter and I know you'll join me in wishing him and Linda (3:51) all the best in his upcoming retirement.","Also, Eric Palmer will be stepping into our CFO role the summer. Eric's a proven financially leader with a strong track record of accomplishments over his 20 years with our company, and I'm confident in the value he'll bring to the role. Eric's looking forward to discussions with you as we look ahead to Cigna's future and he'll be joining us for the Q&A portion of today's call.","To begin this morning's call, I'll briefly highlight our strong financial results. I'll then discuss how our approach to engaging, incenting and supporting our customers and healthcare professionals, combined with our ongoing investments in innovative capabilities, continues to fuel our growth and drive differentiated value for our stakeholders. Tom will then address our first quarter financial results in more detail as well as provide more specifics for increased outlook for 2017 before we take your questions. And after Q&A I'll wrap up the call with a few closing remarks.","I'll start with some highlights of our results. We started off 2017 with strong momentum in earnings growth across each of Cigna's business segments. For the first quarter of 2017, consolidated revenue increased 5% to more than $10 billion. We achieved 20% earnings growth with adjusted income from operations for the first quarter of $719 million or $2.77 per share.","Our Global Health Care business delivered earnings growth of 12% over the first quarter of 2016 with strong customer growth across all Commercial market segments, increased contributions from specialty solutions, well-managed medical costs and effective operating expense management.","Revenue growth in our Commercial employer business continues to be very strong as we retain, expand and add new customer relationships across National Accounts, Middle Market, Select and our International market segments.","In the Individual market, we continue to take a measured approach, participating where we can best deliver value and accumulate learnings as that very dynamic environment continues to evolve. And in our Seniors business, we expect be in position to participate in the Open Enrollment cycle this fall.","In our Global Supplemental Benefits business Cigna again had double-digit revenue and earnings growth while continuing to make targeted investments to support future growth. Results from our Group Disability and Life business are benefiting from continued stable results in our Life portfolio and further improvements in our Disability performance. Overall, we began 2017 with strong momentum that we expect to carry through the remainder of the year and as such have increased our outlook for revenue, medical customer growth and EPS.","Now I'd like to transition to how our ongoing value creation for you, our shareholders, goes hand-in-hand with improving the lives of our customers. As you know, we remain focused on enhancing access to affordable personalized quality care when and where health care services are consumed, all while we continue to expand peace of mind solutions for our customers around the world.","We continue to innovate new ways to incentivize, engage and support both customers and providers of healthcare in a very localized manner, an approach which our experience shows helps to identify health risks earlier while also providing customers with greater value when they do need health services.","Our proven approach begins with active listening to best understand and address the specific evolving needs of our customers and clients. This critical first step fuels our highly consultative solution oriented actions where we leverage our broad portfolio of programs and services and our collaborative relationships with healthcare professionals to deliver high-value, personalized solutions at a local level.","We also actively engage customers and providers to facilitate the achievement of individual health goals and to strengthen incentive alignment particularly for our highest performing health care partners. Further, by leveraging data and insights we are better positioned to identify health risks at an earlier stage and take actions which allow us to improve the quality of health outcomes at a lower cost.","As for scale and reach, our collaborative arrangements now total approximately 250 physician-based group arrangements. In addition to these partnerships we also have value-based arrangements in place with more than 125 hospital systems comprised of hundreds of individual hospitals spanning more than 30 states. We view our continued strength in Collaborative Accountable Care as paramount to accelerating the shared goals of increased value and sustainability across the healthcare system.","Taken together with our innovative clinical programs and broad array of specialty health programs, we continue to deliver industry-leading medical cost trend which directly benefits our customers and clients and as such you, our shareholders.","In addition to our proven partnerships with healthcare professionals, we are taking our alignment and collaborative approach to pharmaceutical companies. We have created seven such arrangements in the past two years that base reimbursement on the efficacy of the drug, not just the consumption or volume of the drug. Our leadership and innovation in the space was recently recognized by the Pharmacy Benefit Management Institute with their excellence award in recognition of Cigna's strategic efforts to change the reimbursement model with drug manufacturers from volume to value as well as our use of outcome-based contracts which link financial terms to measured improvements in our customers health and our use of insights to inform future affordability strategies. These accomplishments represent a clear source of sustainable value creation for our business going forward, and as such, shareholder value creation.","Our engagement with communities where we operate further complements our strategic growth initiatives and local focus. Because health is so highly personal and highly local, we believe that taking steps to demonstrably improve the health of the communities we serve is critical to creating a more sustainable healthcare system which in turn creates a better environment. We actively use our individual engagement tools to decrease the health risks in the communities we serve. These tools include differentiated partnerships as well as our information and insights and broad clinical programs. For example, we're working with communities to address the U.S. opioid addiction issue. We started in early 2016 by convening diverse leaders from public and private sectors and local communities across the U.S. from D.C. to LA and from Chicago to Houston. And with these leaders we are taking action to stem addiction before it starts as well as address the needs for those who are addicted.","Additionally Cigna is committed to reducing our customers' opioid use by 25% by 2019 to take us back to pre-crisis levels, while still providing the right care at the right time for our customers. To date, more than 150 forward-looking physician groups with nearly 62,000 physicians have signed on to actively honor our shared pledge, which is driving meaningful improvement already. For example, to-date, we've already delivered a 12% reduction in our customers use of opioid pharmaceuticals.","Another example of our focus on communities is the Cigna Health Improvement Tour, a multi-city tour bringing free health screening and health coaching to communities nationwide so people can learn their numbers for four key indicators of chronic health concerns including blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol and BMI. To date, our tour has visited 18 cities and has had interactions with thousands of people.","Our approach to partnering with our communities is another pathway towards creating greater access to more affordable, personalized and a more sustainable healthcare system.","Now as I noted earlier, creating differentiated value for our clients and customers also enables us to deliver differentiated value for you, our shareholders. A part of that value is underscored in our exceptionally strong capital position and strategic financial flexibility at Cigna. We continue to expect to have over $5 billion of deployable capital at the parent company level in 2017, a testament to the strength and capital efficiency of our operating businesses.","Given our under-levered balance sheet, as previous discussed, we also expect a significant increased degree of capital deployment capacity by returning to more normalized leverage ratios. Consistent with our prior comments, depending on the mix of share repurchase, dividend and M&A, we continue to expect capital deployment capacity of $7 billion to $14 billion in 2017. We remain very well-positioned to deliver attractive shareholder value over the long-term through a combination of strong organic revenue earnings growth and effective capital deployment.","I'll now briefly touch upon the status of our proposed combination with Anthem. As you saw last week, the U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the District Court enjoining the merger. This morning Anthem announced that it has filed a petition with the United States Supreme Court seeking a review of the decision by the Court of Appeals. On May 8, there will be a hearing in the Delaware Chancery Court to determine Cigna's rights to terminate the merger agreement. We will update you when there is additional news to share.","Now before I hand the call over to Tom, I'd like to reiterate a few key points. The momentum we closed 2016 with has continued into 2017. We've started the year with strong results highlighted by double-digit earnings growth and strength in each of our operating business segments. This performance gives us added confidence that we will achieve our increased 2017 earnings outlook which is now a growth rate of 15% to 20% versus 2016. We're continuing to deliver value with an emphasis on personalization, affordability and being the partner of choice.","Over the last couple of years we've positioned ourselves through ongoing investments in innovative capabilities and programs. We are positioned with outstanding capital strength, and as a global health service company we are creating significant value for all of our stakeholders thanks to the passion and dedication of our Cigna colleagues around the world.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas A. McCarthy - Cigna Corp.","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today I will briefly review key aspects of Cigna's first quarter 2017 results and discuss our outlook for the full year.","Key financial highlights in the quarter are consolidated revenue growth of 5% to $10.4 billion, consolidated earnings growth of 20% to $719 million including double-digit earnings growth in each of our business segments; quarterly earnings per share growth of 19% to $2.77 per share; and continued strong free cash flow and financial flexibility. Overall, the strength of our first quarter performance provides us with solid momentum to start the year.","Regarding our business segments, I will first comment on Global Health Care. First quarter premium and fees in Global Health Care grew to $7.3 billion driven by strong customer growth and specialty contributions across all Commercial market segments, partially offset by the expected contraction in our Seniors enrollment.","We ended first quarter 2017 with 15.7 million global medical customers, an organic increase of 537,000 lives year to date. First quarter earnings increased 12% to $610 million reflecting growth in medical customers and specialty relationships, continued effective medical cost management and favorable prior-year reserve development.","Turning to our medical care ratios, our first quarter 2017 total Commercial medical care ratio or MCR of 77.6% reflects ongoing strong performance of our Commercial business and favorable prior-year reserve development. The increase in the first quarter of 2017 MCR relative to the first quarter of 2016 reflects the impact on premium of the health insurance tax moratorium.","Our first quarter 2017 total Government MCR of 85.9% reflects continued effective medical cost management for our advanced physician engagement model, quarterly seasonal impacts and favorable prior year development.","First quarter 2017 Global Health Care earnings included favorable prior-year development of $61 million after-tax compared to $14 million after-tax in the first quarter of 2016.","Moving to operating expenses, for first quarter 2017 our total Global Health Care operating expense ratio was 20.5% which reflects the impact of the health insurance tax moratorium, business mix changes and continued effective expense management. Overall, we've had a strong start to 2017 in our Global Health Care business.","Turning to our Global Supplemental Benefits business, premiums and fees grew to $869 million, an increase of 13%. First quarter 2017 earnings grew 10% to $74 million reflecting business growth and strong operating expense management. This business has once again delivered double-digit growth as our customers continue to value the affordable and personalized solutions we deliver through an increasingly diverse and innovative set of distribution models.","For Group Disability and Life, first quarter premiums and fees were just over $1 billion. First quarter earnings in our Group business was $68 million with our Life business performing as expected and Disability results reflecting a better-than-expected pace of improvement from the claims process modifications made last year.","Overall Cigna's first quarter results reflect strong double-digit earnings growth in each of our business segments. We also continue to generate very strong free cash flow from our businesses and have significant financial flexibility.","Now I will discuss our outlook for 2017. In 2017 we expect to continue to deliver strong financial performance for our shareholders by leveraging our differentiated capabilities to deliver affordable and personalized solutions, continuing to invest in capabilities to better serve our customers and clients and effectively deploying capital. For full year 2017, we now expect consolidated revenues to grow in the range of 3% to 4% over 2016 results, an improvement from our previous expectations driven by our increased medical customer growth outlook for 2017.","Our outlook for full year 2017 consolidated adjusted income from operations is now in the range of approximately $2.41 billion to $2.53 billion or $9.25 to $9.75 per share. This represents an increase of $0.25 per share over previous expectations and represents earnings growth of 15% to 20% over 2016.","I will now discuss the components of our 2017 outlook starting with Global Health Care. We now expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of $2.065 billion to $2.135 billion. The assumptions reflected in our Global Health Care earnings outlook for 2017 include the following: Regarding global medical customers, we now expect growth in the range of 500,000, to 600,000 lives over year-end 2016, an increase over previous expectations reflecting the strong growth we have seen across our Commercial market segments.","Turning to medical costs, for our total U.S. Commercial book of business, we continue to expect full year medical cost trend to be in the range of 4.5% to 5.5%. We continue to drive greater incentive alignment for our customers, clients and physician partners resulting in positive health outcomes and better management of total medical costs.","Now turning to our medical care ratio outlook. For our total Commercial book of business, we continue to expect the 2017 MCR to be in the range of 80.5% to 81.5%. For our total Government book of business, we continue to expect the 2017 MCR to be in the range of 85% to 86%. Regarding operating expenses, we continue to expect our 2017 Global Health Care operating expense ratio to be in the range of 20.5% to 21.5%.","For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we continue to expect strong top line growth and earnings in the range of $295 million to $315 million.","Regarding the Group Disability and Life business, we now expect full year 2017 earnings in the range of $230 million to $260 million, an increase of $30 million over our previous expectations, reflecting continued operational improvements in our Disability business.","Regarding our remaining operations, that is Other Operations and Corporate, we continue to expect a loss of $180 million for 2017.","So all in, for full year 2017 we now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $2.41 billion-$2.53 billion or $9.25 to $9.75 per share. This represents an increase of $0.25 per share over our previous expectations.","I would also remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of additional prior-year reserve development or any future capital deployment.","Now moving to our 2017 capital management position and outlook. Overall, we continue to have excellent financial flexibility. Our subsidiaries remain well-capitalized and are generating significant free cash flow to the parent, with a strong return on capital in each of our business segments, and we have significant free cash and leverage capacity available at the parent company. Our capital deployment strategy and priorities remain, providing the capital necessary to support the growth of our ongoing operations, pursuing M&A activity with a focus on acquiring capabilities and scale to further grow in our targeted areas of focus, and after considering these first two items, would return capital to shareholders primarily through share repurchase.","Regarding free cash flow, we ended the quarter with parent company cash of approximately $2.7 billion. Year to date, we repurchased 2.3 million shares of stock for approximately $340 million. During the first quarter, we also deployed $250 million of parent company cash to repay current maturities of long-term debt and made a voluntary contribution to our pension plan of $150 million.","After considering all sources and uses of parent company cash, we continue to expect deployable capital to exceed $5 billion in 2017. Through May 4, we have used $340 million of the total $3.7 billion of share repurchase capacity authorized by our board.","Our balance sheet and free cash flow outlook remain strong benefiting from industry-leading margins and returns on capital in our businesses and a high level of capital efficiency, particularly from our fee-based business.","Now to recap. Our first quarter 2017 consolidated results reflect strength in a diversified portfolio of global businesses and continued effective execution of our focus strategy. The fundamentals of our business remain strong, as evidenced by our first quarter results, which reflected strong revenue and earnings contributions from each of our business segments, industry-leading medical cost trend and high clinical quality, and continued strong free cash flow. Overall, we are pleased with our strong start to the year and are confident in our ability to achieve our increased full year 2017 earnings outlook.","On a final note, as David mentioned, I have announced my retirement effective this summer. I appreciate the kind words and would like to express my gratitude to David and all of my talented Cigna colleagues for their partnership and friendship. I believe strongly in Cigna's mission and our continued focus on improving health, well being and sense of (24:15) security of those we serve, and I have enjoyed my many discussions with the investment community and know that you are in good hands with Eric Palmer when he takes over the role as CFO.","With that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","One moment please for the first question. Our first question comes from Kevin Fischbeck. Sir, your line is open. You may ask your question.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thanks, and thanks, Tom, for your help over the years. Must be something in the air, it seems like a lot of people are retiring now. But again, thanks for your help.","I guess my first question would be the guidance raise, you beat consensus by more than what you raised guidance for for the year. Just wondering if there's anything that you would highlight as far as timing in the quarter, or any increased pressures that you look for in the back half of the year.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Kevin, good morning; it's David. First, just at a macro level, we're quite pleased with the start of year, and just putting it into context, we set a pretty meaningful earnings growth goal for the organization for 2017 in the 12% to 18% range and we're quite pleased to start with this strength and raise that outlook to a 15% to 20% range. It's early in the year. We feel really good about the fundamentals from the revenue to the customer life growth, to the foundational aspects within the business, and look forward to a very good year. There's nothing beyond other than a strong start to the year, we feel quite good about raising the outlook, and it's early in the year, hence we think the raise is appropriate and for an (26:24) appropriate range.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then I guess as far as the guidance on trend goes, a lot of favorable developments. Maybe you can (26:33) give a little bit of color about how much was in each business Commercial versus Government. And then how you're looking at the buckets of trend and how they're shaping up.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Kevin, I'll just frame it and ask Eric to give you a little bit relative to the way our medical costs more broadly are unfolding. First off, to put it back in context, we're starting the year again quite positive. The -- put it back into context, 2016 we delivered another very strong year of below 4% medical cost trend. We set an expectation for ourself for this year of 4.5% to 5.5%, and we're performing well within those -- the construct. We typically don't break out the prior year development by micro line of business. Eric can give you a little bit direction there and then the little bit of color relative to just the core medical cost trend we're seeing within the business by some of the categories. Eric?","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Good morning, Kevin. It's Eric. As David noted for 2016 we did finish the trend at just under 4% and really see the categories within the medical cost trend from 2016 continuing into 2017 and generally the same ranges across each of inpatient, outpatient, physician and pharmacy. We're in the kind of low- to mid-single digits in each category, nothing that I'd call out as particularly changing through the early part of this year.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And thank you, Mr. Fischbeck. Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Barclays. Your line is open.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I guess first question just on the PBM strategy. I was wondering if you just give us an update on your thoughts and how you are perceiving the service, and what you're getting from Optum. Obviously you guys have chosen to stick with them through the change of control, et cetera. And so I'm curious just your perspectives on the PBM.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Josh, it's David. First, broadly relative to the PBM, our view relative to the services we need to deliver is that the broad-based pharmacy capabilities are one of the most critical capabilities to have an overall effective health service offering.","To put your question back into context and be clear, today we own and fully operate our PBM and continue to. We partner where appropriate, and work to actively integrate our capabilities, and we're quite pleased with the outcomes we're delivering for the benefit of our customers, the service, the clinical quality. Eric just made reference to the sustained medical cost trend in the mid-single digit range, great value for our employer clients.","And importantly, our approach to the integrated PBM presents even a further opportunity to integrate the information, the clinical program, the gap in care closure with our health care professionals. So own and operate, partner where appropriate, it's performing well and we're pleased. Lastly, in addition to the trend, I would note we've continued to successfully grow our PBM covered lives of our customer base pretty meaningfully and I think that's also a testament to the value we're delivering. So performing very well for us.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then just a quick follow up on your comments, David. You said you guys were confident you'd be able to participate in the Open Enrollment Period for Medicare in the fall. I know we're still several months away but the sanctions have taken a little bit longer, I guess, than we would have expected. So I'm curious, what gives you the confidence that that's going to get resolved here?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Sure, Josh. Well, first and foremost, as we stepped into this process early on and we've set an extremely aggressive push for our organization to attempt to get all of the issues resolved before the prior year's Open Enrollment process, acknowledging that it was an extraordinary, at least short timeframe based on historical standards. Once that window eclipsed we set our sights toward, obviously, fully finishing the remediation work, which we're at the final aspects of. Point two is ensuring that we position ourselves to come out of this phase with an even stronger business unit, operating platform, and team and we're literally in the latter chapters of the body of work, ongoing dialogue, interaction with CMS as we speak.","Lastly, just to reinforce, we're pleased with, while we don't like to shrink, we're pleased with the fact that our retention rates held up quite strongly through this process and I think that's a further validation and testament to the strength of the physician partnerships and collaboratives, with 85% of all of our MA lives in collaboratives and our very strong HealthSpring team that wakes up every day to serve our customers. So we're in the final chapter. We're having ongoing interaction and dialogue with CMS and we're planning for, in all aspects, to be in the fall enrollment cycle.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you Mr. Raskin. Our next question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Hi, everybody and, Tom, I also add my best wishes to you going forward. You showed 3% \u2013 I think I have 3% enrollment growth in your National Accounts business and we did a quick scan and we may be wrong but it looks like the first time you've shown growth in since 2012 actually. What's happening there? And is there any reason to believe either the underlying market, your wins? Can you give us some sense of the dynamics? And I think you've traditionally characterized this as a gradually declining market but any updated thoughts on that.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Yeah, it's David. Thank you for the question. First and foremost, we're quite pleased with our customer growth coming into the year. We've set an objective for ourselves to grow in the 300,000 to 500,000 range and we're able to increase that outlook. First, broadly speaking, we've seen strong retention results, good new business adds and good expansion of relationships across all of our Commercial business segment. So quite important. Specific to the U.S. National Accounts, and as you know we define National Accounts as commercial employers with 5,000 or more employees that are multi-state. The employment base in that market has more stabilized now versus the continued 2% or so attrition, broadly speaking, as you look at the marketplace.","We've had a great selling season coming into 2017, outstanding retention, good expansion, and good new business adds. I would add to the notion of our approach, that consultative approach is working quite well here in our National Account team, both our sales team, our client management team, aided by our informatics experts and our clinicians who've just done an outstanding job. Those employers are benefiting by our superior medical cost trend and it's working quite well in the market.","The only add I would give you, A.J., is that we did see some further contributions to the National Account number off of some private exchange growth, as well, which is additive to this. I would say it's complementary but the foundation performed quite well. And then in our target go-deep markets and geographies, we saw some good growth on private exchange as well. So net-net, a strong Commercial performance.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then just as a follow up, I might ask you about the Individual business. You actually almost, I think, doubled the memberships if I've got it right, from where you exited last year. Is that in keeping with what you, sort of, thought? Give us a sense of, if you look at the demographic profile of those new members, is there anything there that's surprising or is it, sort of, similar what you've seen before? And any early comment about your thoughts about next year's participation on exchanges and so forth?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","A.J., a bunch of questions there. Let me try to frame the environment as we see it. First, as you know, we've taken a very measured approach since the inception of the exchanges to this marketplace. We've been in a range of five to seven states and 2% to 4% of our enterprise revenue in these programs. We still have to engage here to learn and to evolve the programs we've put in place. And we've seen some successful recipes by using our highly performing collaborative models.","Specific to your question, our growth is about where we expected it to be. The locations of our growth, the aggregate growth and our performance in the first quarter is about where we expected it to be as well. Relative to 2018, while it's already late in the cycle, unfortunately it's too early to declare because as you know, the evolving rules, regs and positioning coming out of Washington is still pretty dynamic and we're tracking it day-to-day and working with the federal government. So growth in line with our expectations. First quarter performance in line with our expectations. Highly focused in seven states today and highly focused through our collaborative relationships. Stay tuned for more relative to 2018 as the final fact set closes relative to the regulatory environment.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","And thank you, Mr. Rice. And our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe. Your line's open, with Citi.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Tom, congrats on the retirement and thanks for all your help. I guess I wanted to also ask on the Commercial market, you mentioned \u2013 Commercial risk, I guess more particularly. You mentioned a little bit on the exchanges but you also had a pop in experience-rated. David, you talked about active listening to your customer base. Maybe can you flesh that out a little bit in terms of your offering and maybe factors driving accounts to perhaps incrementally pick that offer?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Ralph, just framing it from a broad standpoint, our sales and client management team, supported by our underwriters, informatics and clinical team; we attempt to approach the market in terms of a solution orientation. So understanding the clients' needs; understanding their health burden; understanding their culture and strategy; understanding their readiness to change; recommend a series of programs: service, design, et cetera; and then engage with them on funding approach with a pretty agnostic orientation relative to ASO, ASO stop-loss experience-rated guaranteed cost. And that's one of our strengths. And you'll see ebbs and flows over time.","Now we had good growth in all of our customer segments for 2017 thus far and good growth in all of our funding mechanisms. I wouldn't call out anything unique relative to experience-rated there. It's a part of our franchise that we've used over quite some time; and typically, that hunts well in the middle market. Lastly as I said to a prior call, we saw a little bit more uptick in the private exchange lives. They were split about 50-50; you could think about that between ASO and guaranteed cost on the National Account franchise. So, again, nothing to call out other than strong growth and leveraging the broad portfolio of funding mechanisms we have.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. And then in the last couple quarters you had cited some pressure on Medicaid, I think in Texas and Illinois. Is that largely fixed or still a drag? And I guess any incremental thoughts on your interest in getting bigger in Medicaid, just given relatively low exposure today? Thanks.","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Ralph, it's Eric. I'll remind you, Medicaid's a small business for us. It is a small business for us. Essentially just the Dual SNP programs in Texas and the demonstration projects in Illinois. And as you noted, we did report an increase at Medicaid MCR in Texas and Illinois towards the tail end of last year and still a bit elevated in the first quarter this year. But, again, overall a small business for us.","I would note that we do not plan to participate in the Illinois Medicaid market beyond the end of this year, so the exit of that business is contemplated in our outlook. The last thing I guess I'd add on the Medicaid business is that we did see some sequential improvement. Some of the actions we took out of the tail end of last year have started to have some traction in terms of improving the results, but again first quarter Medicaid loss ratio a little bit pressured versus first quarter of 2016. David'll give some color on the more macro framing.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Ralph, on the long-term we're looking forward. As we've discussed in the past, one of our M&A capital deployment priorities is to seek opportunities to expand, as we say our capabilities to serve Government-based high-risk programs over time. We believe the marketplace will continue to evolve to use more actively managed and collaborative-oriented programs relative to both state and federal programs that serve the higher-risk population. And over time, we see opportunities in a more localized manner to pursue those as we look to the future.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And thank you, Mr. Giacobbe. Our next question is from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Tom, good luck on the retirement; well-deserved. So first, sounds like you're seeing faster improvement in the Disability business. Can you talk about the drivers here relative to expectations? And how should we think about exiting the year? Can we get back to historical margins at the end of 2017 or is that still an 2018 event?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Justin, it's David. Good morning. First and foremost, we're pleased with the performance. We saw a step up in Q3 of last year, Q4 we see strong performance in the first quarter this year with stable ongoing results on the Life side. The Disability results were a little stronger in the first quarter than even we had anticipated which is good. And we're pleased to take up the outlook for that line of business. As we look forward to the core of your question, we remain fully focused on completing all the bodies of work that are in front of us relative to stabilizing that business. And our expressed objective is that we step out of 2017 with the full strength of that organization as we look to 2018. That's our objective, and we're well on our way relative to that goal.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Then just a question on timing. Without prognosticating on the outcome, can you tell us what your legal team expects in terms of how fast we get a resolution on the TRO post Monday's hearing? And then should it go your way and the deal officially breaks, what would you expect your timing to be in terms of potentially coming back to the Street with more color on capital deployment?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Justin, relative to Monday's court review and decision, not helpful for us to speculate on the outcome or the timing of that. Clearly, we'll be in position to communicate as quickly as possible, and recognize the importance relative to that, but not helpful for us to speculate on the timing or the outcome there, but it's on the immediate horizon.","To the core of your question, we would challenge ourself once there's open clarity to be as comprehensive and timely as possible for our shareholders to communicate next steps for our organization. And I would think you'd have confidence that we've always been both transparent and responsive and we would seek to be highly transparent and responsive as soon as the window opens to have that conversation.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","And thank you, Mr. Lake. Our next question is from Gary Taylor, JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. I just actually had three quick clarifications, and then one question. But the quick ones, when you talk about the less than 4% medical cost trend for 2016, I presume you're talking a gross number, and not a net number, net of buy down?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","The way we would frame it, I'm not sure how you're applying the net gross et cetera. We would view that as the net number that our clients and customers experience and noting that the vast majority of our business is self-funded. That's the net number of what they're seeing. And of course, you used the term buy downs. Evolution of the benefit programs is obvious factored in and contemplated within that.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And on the MA sanctions, I've heard your comments on that. Would you be willing to venture a guess on timing, so Open Enrollments obviously far away, but is there any way to tighten up when you think you might be able to announce that the issues are resolved?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Gary, David. Not helpful to try to put a pin point number on that. Most important piece, we remain fully focused, aligned and prepared for the Open Enrollment process for the fall cycle. Beyond that not helpful to expand further.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. And on the EPS guidance for this year, I'm sorry if you've said this, but I presume there's no additional repurchase in there beyond what you did in the 1Q.","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Gary, it's Eric. No additional capital deployment or any expectations about future prior-year development in our guidance.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then my last question, kind of my real question following a little bit on Justin. You've terminated the merger agreement and the judge has enjoined that pending this hearing. Is there a scenario where that enjoinment could continue and this SCOTUS appeal actually matters in terms of timing? Or do you expect a definitive answer on Monday?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Gary, it's David. First I compliment the efficiency of getting four questions in. Well done on your part. Specific to Monday, we're not going to expand further in terms of speculating the outcome relative to the court. We leave it to the courts to draw the conclusion, and we will communicate this immediately as quickly as possible after there's clarity in terms of next steps.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you Mr. Taylor. Our next question is from Chris Rigg from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Just wanted to \u2013 and you've talked about this a little bit already \u2013 but when I look at the Global Health Care adjusted income guidance, the revision, it's up about $25 million, but you had the PPD of 61. So I just want to make that it's really just \u2013 you're baking in some conservatism right now, and there's no offsetting impact factor to the PYD.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Chris, it's David. As I indicated to a prior question relative to the outlook, first off, macro \u2013 we set a pretty meaningful increase relative to the franchise performance for 2017 as we stepped into the year. We're pleased to actually have such a strong quarter and be able to raise our outlook. There is nothing unique to call out. It's just early in the year, a variety of moving parts, and we look forward to continuing to deliver strength as we look forward. But there's nothing unique to call out relative to moving items within the Global Health Care business.","Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then just on Medicare Advantage, do you think that you're going to see \u2013 are you troughing the membership and that you should see some growth later in the year, because the sanctions should be lifted midyear or something like that?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Our organization's orientation is going to be as soon as sanctions are lifted, we're ready to roll. The team is anxious to get back into the marketplace. It's a very capable, prideful, passionate team that have the deep position partnerships, and everybody's ready to move as soon we're given the green light relative to CMS's conclusion. So if that happens prior to the Open Enrollment cycle, there'll be activation in the current year, et cetera. So we're ready to move.","Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks a lot.","Operator","And thank you, Mr. Rigg. Our next question is from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Your line's open.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, good luck, Tom, and thanks for all the clear disclosure and help over the years. David, nice quarter.","I'd like to focus back again on the membership growth. Whenever we see big membership growth, we always get concerned about things, and so we wanted to pick out a few risks and ask you which of the risks you think are the most significant and the ones that are most concerning to you. So if you look at like the Individual business, that grew very fast, and a lot of other competitors have had issues there. So is that a bigger risk than, say, the risk of the Anthem merger agreement continuing on and impacting your business overall and causing a slowdown in that membership growth or overall membership growth?","And then perhaps the risk of \u2013 a lot of your competitors have talked about alternative funding arrangements and starting to go into the smaller accounts with that, which was historically one of your key strengths. And I guess the last one is just maybe the risk of overall pricing relative to medical costs trend. Are you confident that your view on trend is the right one considering it's lower than many of your competitors?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Peter, let me try to package the framework of your questions together and try to be responsive to all the items you raised. First and foremost, stepping back, most important headline, we're pleased with our outlook. Remember, we've set an expectation for ourselves to grow 300,000 to 500,000 lives, so we expect it to grow across our business. We had expectations to grow the Individual business. We had expectation to grow the Commercial business. We understood we would strengthen the Seniors business. That was contemplated within that. Within all of our businesses, we're essentially in line with expectations save for a little bit more strength in the National Accounts and a little bit more strength in the regional markets.","So headline, we expect it to grow. We've grown. We've grown across all of our funding mechanisms, and by line of business or by segment, in line with expectations with a bit more strength in National Accounts, which is great, as well as the regional segment.","Point two, you identified a bunch of risks. I maybe go to the end of your question and work my way back. As I discussed before, our approach has been for quite some time not to be in a position to sell products but rather to try to put in place a framework of solutions. So having the capabilities to do so is one thing, having the talent to do so is another thing, and having the information and infrastructure to support that is another thing.","While our organization is far from perfect, we're sitting on a decade of investments to be able to deliver that, and our really talented team is able to be consultative in support of our clients and customers in the marketplace today and move the levers that best match those clients' needs relative to benefit design, engagement, incentive, network design, collaborative leverage, and then get the right funding mechanism in place.","And the proof is in the pudding in terms of multiple years of lowest industry medical cost trend, last year below 4%. Targeted 4.5% to 5.5% for this your, performing in line with those expectations and moving forward.","Now to try to come back to the core of your question, if you had to pin us down in terms of what would be the number one variable that sits in front of us right now, you still have to come back to the Individual market just because as an industry there's variability relative to that. I would remind you it remains less than 5% of overall revenue for our organization.","We're focused in seven states. We exited three states coming into 2017 where we couldn't get the recipe we wanted in place, and the vast majority of what we're doing right now are aligned to the physician collaboratives and we performed, generally speaking, in line with our expectations for the first quarter. But there would be more variability in that than our other lines of business just because of the nature of that animal. But we're off to a start with the number of lives, the location of the lives, and the performance of those lives year-to-date, already.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you very much. Very helpful.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Costa. Our next question is from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Sir, your line is open.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Tom, best of luck in retirement. At the risk of asking something maybe a little more precisely but that you've generally answered on, on National Accounts and the growth there, we maybe heard some comments around lack of price discipline, not from you necessarily, but in the market, in general. And, David, you just mentioned, kind of, selling solutions. I'm wondering if the comments that were made in the prepared remarks about larger specialty contribution and penetration are wrapped up in that solutions answer that you just gave.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Well, Dave, remember first and foremost, if you take National Accounts, think about that marketplace as traditionally largely self-funded. So let's go back to the base frame. Outstanding retention year, so clients who are experiencing the service value proposition medical cost trend, et cetera, are pleased, therefore, staying with us. We could either drive innovation, changes, et cetera, but it starts with really strong retention. Second is earning the right to expand relationships with our existing corporate clients, either through adding new geographies for medical or further expanding the specialty solutions which is a cornerstone of our strategy, and then targeted new business adds.","As I noted earlier, we've also been able to perform on some of the private exchanges. There we orient relative to our very targeted go-deep orientation on key geographies where we believe we have a differentiated value proposition from collaboratives or otherwise and target some opportunities there. So we feel quite good about the quality of the business that's been put in the books. Important to underscore though, this all starts with an outstanding retention result. Outstanding retention in National, regional and Select then further expansion, then targeted adds.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Got it. Thank you. Just a quick question on Group Disability and Life. There are usually reserve studies annually. Wondering if there's anything anticipated coming out of that that is included in the guidance around Group and Disability for the balance of the year.","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Dave, it's Eric. Yeah, we will complete our disability reserve study in the second quarter. However, we wouldn't expect any significant impact from reserve studies and nothing built into the guidance.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you Mr. Windley. Our next question is from Tom Carroll from Stifel. Sir, your line is open.","Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning. So I have a question as well on the Global Sup and Disability and Life business. Are you seeing larger investment income in both of those areas because of the interest rate environment? And then, I guess as a follow-up to that, I imagine this will eventually benefit the Health Care business at some point and maybe could you remind us of earnings support per 100 basis points of rate change, however, you'd like to define that.","Thomas A. McCarthy - Cigna Corp.","Tom, it's Tom. We are seeing a little bit of a lift as interest rates go up but let's just put this into context, right? Most of our investment income relates to longer tailed reserves and, as a result, we have an average maturity of six maturities \u2013 it's long, about six years, let's say. And given that any change in interest rates tends to work their way into results, given that any change in interest rates tends to work their way into results over a long period of time as our invested assets mature and they are reinvested over the year. So to your point, 100 basis points increase now. Over the balance of the year, probably ends up with a net investment income in the $10 million to $15 million pre-tax range. So it's modest.","Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you so much. Great quarter.","Operator","Thank you Mr. Carroll. Our next question comes from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Ma'am, your line is open.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you. And I want to echo the comments to Tom. I wanted to go back to retention because Cigna's really stood out from peers on retention and I think it feeds into your low cost trend. One of your peers is starting a big retention initiative focusing on Net Promoter Score as the method to boost retention. Is there any efforts underway at Cigna to focus on Net Promoter Score? And how do you think about Commercial employer retention heading into 2018?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Sarah, good morning, it's David. We obviously, we've always talked about our growth strategy being oriented around retain, expand, add, because again you have to deliver on your promise relative to your existing clients and customers to earn the right, first off, to keep the relationships, ideally to expand the relationships on the targeted basis, and then new business adds. We talk within our corporation around a culture and an environment of customer centricity, putting the customer in the center of all we do.","I forget how many years ago it was. We started measuring Net Promoter Score on a global basis multiple years ago, feels like five years ago or so. We have it built into the incentive structure of the organization for everybody in the organization from me on down to anybody who's in a variable reward structure. And we think it's an important part. It's not the singular part, but it's an important part of understanding both relational NPS, that's the aggregate relationship, the loyalty factor et cetera. But then you have the ability to get really pinpointed as well in terms of transactional NPS. It helps you actually guide your business during the course of the year as opposed to waiting for the longer-tailed relational. So you want to look at both of those pieces of the equation.","And lastly to further expand this, we carry that orientation beyond our customers to our clients and our key health care professional partners as well. Understanding that orientation of beyond satisfaction, loyalty effect, and where dissatisfiers are versus satisfiers and continuing your innovative evolution around that is mission-critical. So we've been committed to this for a long period of time, and it's one of the mechanisms we use around our customer-centricity focus.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","That's very helpful. And just one clarification on your earlier comments around building out capabilities for the high acuity Medicaid. I wanted to get a sense of timing there. Is this a near-term focus given that we're heading into a more robust LTSS and ABD RFP cycle in the next 12 to 24 months? Or is this more of a long-term goal? Though not necessarily in place for this round of contract opportunities, but a long term service?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Sarah, I would think about it intermediate to long term. This is not a 12-month horizon item for us currently.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you Ms. James. Our next question comes from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Ma'am, your line is open.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Yeah. Thanks, good morning. My question was around the alternate funding on self-insured with stop-loss. You're growing really nicely in stop-loss and still in double digits on Select to low single in Middle Market. With the passage of repeal-and-replace with the tax relief for employers, do you see the growth rates likely to sustain? And what kind of communication are you getting from them?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Ana, a big picture, no is the answer. We don't see any disruption relative to that. So, yes, we expect the growth rate to sustain going-forward. And as you step back from it, having the \u2013 our belief that is then having the transparent funding mechanisms to better align ourselves with the employers, enables us to have daily, weekly, monthly interaction with the employers as opposed to an annual interaction relative to the performance. And then dynamically manage, engage in how the programs are operating.","For the smaller side of the employer space, as you move down beyond National into the lower end of Middle Market and into Select, the stop-loss component adds a measure of certainty and predictably for the employers and it augments. We never viewed that the prior law with the tax was an accelerant. We don't view that the current proposed changes will be a decelerant, because we didn't see it as (57:42) push either way. It's an important toolset to have to be consultative and transparent with our employers, and we continue to see good growth there.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. A follow up on that again on policy. At the state level post the elections, the Republicans did quite well. What is the climate looking like on that support for the 50 to 100 portion of the self-insured plus stop-loss, has that approved at all? Because the focus on trying to stabilize Individual and encourage dumping, and I'm not sure if I'm right or wrong on that. But has it gotten any better there?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Yeah, Ana, to your macro point, it's been a little choppy ride in terms of narratives and obviously state level there's 50 different narratives, 50 different dialogue points. First, stepping back, putting it back in context, historically, Cigna's not participated in, or focused on the under 50 employer segment. Our Select segment is focused on the needs for the under 250 life employer segment historically and typically in the 50 to 250 segment. There's a few states that actually moved that line from 50 to 100, and some modification to our approaches took place, but our growth hasn't been impacted.","More broadly, to the core of your question, and from a state standpoint, as we interact at both the federal level and state level, we strongly believe that enablement of more choice versus restrictive regulation is critical, including in the small employer market. And enabling access to the innovative programs that are working more broadly in the employer market that have transparency, have the incentive, have the engagement capabilities are good for the employer, the customer and the health care professionals.","And it varies by state, but we're seeing good understanding and acceptance of that; and very importantly, a lot of activation and support from the employer community itself wanting to amplify that dialogue. Because again it's their employees, their financing and their needs and they're seeing value there. So a dynamic environment and it will continue to be and we'll stay engaged. But for our Select segment, we see great growth opportunities looking forward.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks, David, and thanks, Tom, for everything. Good luck.","Operator","And thank you, Ms. Gupte. Our next question comes from Mike Newshel with Evercore ISI. Sir, your line's open.","Michael Newshel - Evercore ISI","Thank you. You mentioned plans to exit the Medicaid business in Illinois. Is that running at a loss currently; and if so, could the exit translate into any noticeable tailwind in 2018?","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Michael, it's Eric. I think the dimensions around that, I would say it's kind of near breakeven. Wouldn't characterize it as a major headwind or a tailwind in terms of the impact.","Michael Newshel - Evercore ISI","Got it. And I think you also said the Individual and Commercial performance is tracking in line with expectations. So just to clarify on margins, does that mean they're still negative but better than last year?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Yes.","Michael Newshel - Evercore ISI","Great. Thank...","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Perfectly summarized, Michael, yes.","Michael Newshel - Evercore ISI","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And thank you, Mr. Newshel. Our last question comes from Michael Baker with Raymond James. Sir, your line's open.","Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks a lot. David, employers are increasingly asking for tools that help their employees better navigate the health care system balancing cost and quality in light of the increased prevalence of high deductible plans. Just curious of your thoughts and positioning on that and any potential timing of new offerings along those lines.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Michael, good morning. So we actually strongly agree with that. So the ability as we talk about to engage, incent and support Individual customers is critical to the way we think about our portfolio. I'll give you two illustrations, prior set, current set. Aiding our customers with highly transparent consumer friendly decision support tools around cost and quality, quite important to us. We've continued to evolve those tools and capabilities. We've been chosen by Consumer Reports and others as having the industry-leading tools relative to it, not just because of the data that's out there but the usability and the ability to influence decision-making. So that's kind of past current state.","2017, important launch for us. In the first quarter of 2017 we launched a new program and service that does exactly what you're describing. It's known as Cigna One Guide. It's a multichannel, multi-modal engagement capability that allows the direction that you just articulated but also has a learning dimension that's built into it with smart algorithms to provide next-best decision support, next-best recommendations. It also has the ability to integrate between the consumer or the individual with our service professionals and our clinical professionals. And we see the opportunity to integrate that further in our health care collaboratives going forward. So it's quite exciting. By order of magnitude and scale, we're already servicing 1.5 million customers. With that platform it'll rapidly ramp to over 5 million customers.","So indicative of the journey we're on to the prior conversation relative to the customer NPS consumer centricity. These are just two examples of investments in customer-oriented capabilities to better engage and support them; and very importantly where possible, integrate them with the health care professionals so there could be a similar level of insights going forward. So expect to see more from us even on a go forward basis.","Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","And thank you, Mr. Baker. I would like to turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Thank you, everyone. So just to wrap up our call, I'd like to highlight a few key points from our discussion. We began 2017 with strong momentum and have increased our outlook for the full year. We reported strong revenue growth with earnings growth across each of our business segments and strong customer growth. We remain committed to achieving our long-term average annual EPS growth rate of 10% to 13%. We're confident in our ability to deliver our increased 2017 outlook of 15% to 20% earnings growth, and we're further strengthened by our significant capital position and our capacity for meaningful capital deployment.","Our efforts to improve the health and lives of our customers in the communities we work and live in and play in around the world are driven daily by the talented and dedicated Cigna team.

We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedures on how to enter the queue to ask questions at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded.","We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Will McDowell. Please go ahead, Mr. McDowell.","William McDowell","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I am Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Eric Palmer, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Eric will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's full year 2017 financial results as well as our financial outlook for 2018.","As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP.","Specifically, we use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, shareholders net income, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com.","In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2018 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note in today's earnings release and in our most recent Reports filed with the SEC.","Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, I note that in the fourth quarter, we recorded special item charges to shareholders net income totaling $221 million, or $0.88 per share, primarily to reflect the impact of the recently passed U.S. tax reform legislation. Specifically, this fourth quarter charge was related to the revaluation of the company\u2019s deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new statutory rate and a one-time tax on overseas earnings.","As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations in our discussion of financial results. Lastly, and as previously disclosed effective January 1, 2018 Cigna will adopt a new accounting standard titled revenue from contracts with customers or ASU 2014-09 which addresses recognition of revenues under GAAP. Cigna will adopt this accounting change on a retrospective basis in the first quarter of 2018 and will recast prior periods.","This accounting change requires reclassifications that impact certain financial ratios, but importantly have no impact on the fundamentals of the business and no impact to earnings or cash flows.","Because this accounting change is effective January 1, 2018 the impact of the new standard is not reflected in our 2017 results that David and Eric will discuss in a few moments. However, when David and Eric will provide commentary on our 2018 outlook, it will be on a basis that assumes retrospective adoption of this accounting change with both 2018 and 2017 discussed on the basis of the new standard.","To assist analysts in modeling the impact of this accounting change, we have included a supplemental schedule of financial information on page 17 of our quarterly financial settlement which shows the impact to our financial statements and ratios for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.","Finally, consistent with past practices, when we make any prospective comments on earnings or EPS outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future capital deployment or prior year development of medical costs.","And with that, I will turn the call over to David.","David Cordani","Thanks Will. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call today. I\u2019ll begin my comments by reviewing the highlights of our 2017 financial results, which reflect exceptionally strong performance across our portfolio of businesses.","Our sustained, differentiated results were driven by the effective execution of our go-strategy, along with the ongoing contributions of our talented and focused team to always put our customers at the center of all we do.","I will also highlight how we are continuing to deliver differentiated value and growth in our U.S. commercial employer market where we see effectively consultatively [ph] engage in customized solutions that improve our clients business and the quality of life for our customers.","I\u2019ll then offer initial insight into our expectations for 2018 which includes sustained momentum across our businesses and a strong capital position, driven by the organic results we deliver as well as enhanced impact from recently passed tax legislation.","Eric will then address our fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results in more detail and will provide the specifics for our outlook for 2018 before we take your questions and then I\u2019ll call a Q&A with some wrap up comments.","Let\u2019s dive in with some highlights from our share. Our results include strong performance across each of our priority growth platforms. Commercial employer, U.S. seniors, Global Supplemental Benefits and Group Disability & Life led by delivery of continued industry-leading medical cost trend.","For 2017, our full year consolidated revenue increased by 5% to $41.6 billion. We reported full year adjusted income from operations of $2.7 billion or $10.46 per share representing a per-share increase of 29% with each of our business segments delivering strong growth over 2016.","In addition, in 2017 Cigna grew to serve more than 95 million customer relationships worldwide all while continuing to generate strong margins and significant free cash flow for the benefit of our shareholders. Overall, we delivered very strong result in 2017 and as I\u2019ll discuss in more detail we are positioned to once again deliver competitively attractive revenue and earnings growth in 2018.","Now I\u2019ll spend the next few minutes delving further into our U.S. commercial employer business. We continue to view the employer marketplace as a very attractive growth opportunity. In a highly dynamic and disruptive environment, we continue to create value for employers by pursuing the right balance of affordability and personalization through a greater emphasis on alignment, transparency, and being the undisputed partner of choice.","We improve our client\u2019s business by helping to ensure they have healthy, present and engaged employees all on a more affordable and predictable basis. We achieved this in three key ways; first, through a strategic orientation and focus on alignment and engagement, which helps our employer clients better manage costs, and leverage integration to improve health and productivity all in a personalized fashion. This approach enables us to drive growth across our U.S. portfolio of businesses including significant opportunities to continue to add new clients in the Select and Middle Market segments and on a targeted basis with international account segment.","Second, we continue to retain, develop and attract the best talent around the world, which enables us to operate with a high touch consultative service orientation for the benefits of our customers and clients.","As we simplify many of the complexities in healthcare ecosystem, such as making it easier for our customers to connect to the right doctors, coaches and clinicians and take the customize employee benefit programs.","And third, our ongoing investments with our commercial employer business to further enhance affordability and personalization is in large part driven by effective, ongoing integration.","Growth of the integration Cigna\u2019s approach differs considerably from traditional cross selling which simply combines multiple products into one sale and it differs from bundling, which improves only the pricing structure of a sale. Rather Cigna\u2019s integrated model goes beyond, meaning we use combined data across our solutions to develop insights that drive improved health outcomes.","For example, our behavioural and medical teams work closely to identify Cigna customers with conditions which frequently lead to co morbidities in the behavioural realm, such as depression, positioning all behavioural colleagues to intervene on a preventative basis.","In addition, we continue to embed lifestyle coaching into our medical programs. This approach helps our customers achieve their specific health goals such as smoking cessation, achieving a healthier weight for better and more effectively managing their chronic conditions.","Pharmacy integration is another key driver for us to help improve overall health and affordability. Our integrated approach provides us with additional customer touch points to help ensure individuals who are taking their medication and to drive increase health engagement in specialty condition management, case management and health coaching.","In addition our specialty pharmacy capability drives significant opportunities to improve affordability for the most complex cases, because our integrated model manages both the pharmacy and medical side of the cost.","I would [Indiscernible] approach here help this drive the lowest medical cost trend in the industry again in 2017. Going forward, we will continue to define industry-leading integration by bringing innovative and new approaches to the market. For example, our initiative to reduce the use of opioids has pharmacy, behavioural as well as medical components, including close collaboration with our network partners to improve prescribing patterns.","Our approach to integration in addition to helping to drive clinical outcomes and affordability also helps to further improve the overall customer experience. An additional example of our ongoing investments in innovation is our recent acquisition of Brighter, one of healthcare\u2019s most innovative technology companies.","Brighter engages customers and healthcare providers to more effectively and efficiently deliver high-value healthcare in a personalized and seamless way. This acquisition further accelerates our ability to develop new digital platforms as well as to further innovate new end-to-end experiences that connect individuals and healthcare providers with the guidance, support and incentive they need to further improve affordability and personalization.","Taken together, our broad and diverse capabilities integrated solutions and customer centric approach have consistently fueled our ability to deliver best-in-class medical cost trend for many years running.","To illustrate the importance of the impact of medical trend, I\u2019ll provide a specific employer example. A 1000 life employer working with Cigna would have experienced nearly $2 million in medical cost savings over the last five years, relative to the industry average medical cost trend of 67%, thereby providing opportunities for them to strengthen their business in this highly competitive environment, whether through further investments in innovation, expansion of the workforce or margin growth, and with approximately 85% of our U.S. commercial customers being serviced through transparent ASO funding arrangements, Cigna\u2019s medical cost trend results directly benefit our employer clients, their employees and families.","Now looking ahead to overall expectation for 2018, we will continue creating strong value for our customers, clients and as a result for our shareholders through our consistent focus on delivering affordability personalization as well as partnering with healthcare professionals to ensure our customers receive the highest quality healthcare.","We expect to deliver revenue growth in line with our long-term objective of high single digit annual growth. Our outlook anticipates a 19% to 23% EPS growth rate over 2017 and I would note consistent to our practices, our EPS outlook does not include the impact of prior year reserve development or any future capital deployment in 2018.","Regarding recent U.S. tax reform, we anticipate positive earnings impact in 2018 inclusive of further investments in three critical areas, furthering our capabilities relative to innovation for the benefit of our customers, client and healthcare professional partners, furthering investments in market-based initiatives benefiting our external stakeholders including our communities and further investments in our Cigna colleagues.","Overall for 2018, we expect continued strong financial health and free cash flow inclusive of these investments. Now stepping back, at our investor day in June of 2017, we introduced an attractive EPS target of $16 per share for 2021. Each of our four growth platforms have remained well positioned for sustained growth. We have momentum from our 2017 performance expect to deliver another strong result in 2018 augmented by the U.S. tax reform.","In addition to this strong positioning we are further aided by our tremendous ongoing capital position. As a result, today, we are pleased to increase our long-term EPS target from $16 per share to $18 per share for 2021.","As I turn the call over to Eric, I want to recognize what our talented team of approximately 45,000 colleagues around the globe are positioned to achieve in 2018. As a team, we are poised to continue driving attractive growth and significant value creation for our customers, clients as well as our shareholders.","As a team, we remain driven by our unwavering mission of helping to improve the health, well-being in sense of security of those we serve around the world, and our innovative approach to meeting the needs of our customers and clients furthers our ability to deliver top and bottom line growth and gives us confidence we will achieve our very attractive full year 2018 outlook as well as our long-term objectives.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Eric.","Eric Palmer","Thanks, David and good morning everyone. In my remarks today, I will review Cigna\u2019s 2017 results and provide our outlook for 2018. Key financial highlights for 2017 include consolidated revenue growth of 5% to $41.6 billion, consolidated earnings growth of 27% to $2.7 billion, earnings per share growth of 29% to $10.46 and continued strong free cash flow and $2.8 billion return to shareholders through share repurchase in 2017.","These results reflect the underlying strength of our franchise and provide us with considerable momentum for continued growth in 2018. Regarding our segments, I will first comment on Global healthcare.","2017 premiums and fees grew 5% to $29 billion driven by strong customer growth and specialty contributions across all commercial market segments and as expected, this growth was partially offset by lower seniors enrolment.","We ended 2017 with 15.9 million Global Medical customers, an organic increase of 710,000 lives which represents 5% growth over 2016. Full year earnings were $2.17 billion, reflecting growth in medical customers and specialty relationships, continued effective medical cost management and operating expense discipline.","Turning to medical costs, we continued to deliver medical cost that reflect better health outcomes as a result of our deep engagement and collaboration with customers, clients and physicians. Our focus on personalization of care and the power of our differentiated speciality integration model.","For our total U.S. Commercial book of business, full year medical cost trend for 2017 was better than the low-end of our previous guidance range of 3% to 4%. As David discussed, our commercial medical trend result once again reflects industry-leading performance and enabled our employer clients to make further investment in innovation, expand their workforce and grow their margins.","The total commercial medical care ratio or MCR of 79.9% for full year 2017 reflects the continued effectiveness of our medical cost management capabilities as well as the impact of the health insurance tax suspension. This MCR also reflects better-than-expected medical costs in our U.S. individual business, which generated a small profit in 2017.","The total government medical care ratio of 84.9% for full year 2017 reflects the impact of our innovative physician engagement model within Medicare advantage and is consistent with our expectations.","Full year 2017 Global Healthcare earnings also included favorable net prior year reserve development of $112 million after-tax. The Global Healthcare operating expense ratio of 20.9% for full year 2017 reflects the impact of the health insurance tax suspension, business mix exchanges and continued effective expense management. Overall, we\u2019ve had another strong year in Global Healthcare.","Turning to our global supplemental benefits business. Our full year 2017 results reflect continued attractive growth and profitability as premium and fees grew to $3.7 billion an increase of 14% and full-year 2017 earnings grew 26% to $369 million, reflecting business growth, favourable point of experience and continued operating expense discipline.","For Group Disability and Life, full year 2017 premiums and fees were $4.1 billion. Full year earnings in our Group business increased to $285 million, reflecting strong performance in both our Disability and Life businesses.","Overall, as a result of the continued effective execution of our strategy, Cigna delivered strong revenue and earnings contribution from our Global healthcare, Global Supplemental Benefits and Group Disability & Life businesses in 2017. We also continued to generate strong free cash flow across our enterprise and maintain significant financial flexibility.","Now I will discuss our outlook for 2018. As we continued to drive strong value for our customers and clients, we step into 2018 with momentum in each of our businesses. As a result, in 2017 we expect to deliver attractive financial growth by deepening our customer and client relationships, delivering on-going superior medical quality and cost outcomes and continuing to invest in innovative solutions to more effectively engage with our customers and healthcare professionals.","For full-year 2018, we expect consolidated revenues to grow in the range of 7% to 8% over 2017 with continued growth across our targeted market segments. We expect full year 2018 consolidated adjusted income from operations to be 3.08 billion to 3.2 billion or $12.40 to $12.90 per share. This represents growth in the range of 19% to 23%.","This outlook includes approximately $425 million of incremental after-tax earnings resulting from U.S. corporate tax reform. I would note that this incremental earnings estimate is net of $150 million after-tax and additional investment in our employees, communities and partners as well as our capabilities that enable us to better serve our customers and clients while accelerating long-term growth.","For 2018, we project the consolidated adjusted tax rate in the range of 24% to 25%. Consistent with prior practice, our outlook excludes any contribution from future capital deployment as well as prior year claim [ph] development.","Now putting our 2018 outlook and our 2017 actual result on a comparable basis, that is adjusting for the reserve development reported in our 2017 results, and excluding the impacts from tax reform, our outlook for earnings in 2018 reflects 4% to 9% growth over 2017, and our outlook for EPS growth is 7% to 12% before considering the impact of additional capital deployment.","I will now discuss the components of our 2018 outlook starting with Global Healthcare. We expect full-year Global Healthcare earnings in the range of approximately $2.6 million to $2.68 million. This outlook reflects strength in our commercial employer business, driven by continued benefits from organic customer growth, specialty contributions and effective medical cost management as well as continued solid performance in our Medicare advantage business.","Key assumptions reflected in our Global Healthcare earnings outlook for 2008 include the following; regarding total medical customers, we expect 2018 growth in the range of 300,000 to 500,000 customers, driven by continued strong customer and client retention and new growth in our commercial business. And approximately, 3% growth in Medicare advantage customers.","Turning to medical costs. For our total U.S. Commercial Employer book of business, we now expect full-year 2018 medical cost trends to be in the range of 4% to 5%, with the increase over 2017 full year trend due to expected increases in utilization and pharmacy costs.","For our total commercial book of business, we expect the 2018 medical care ratio to be in the range of 77.5% to 78.5% reflecting the impact from the health insurance tax in 2018.","For our total Government book of business, we expect the 2018 Medical Care Ratio to be in the range of 84% to 85%. Regarding operating expenses, we expect our 2018 global healthcare operating expense ratio to be in the range of 22.5% to 23.5% reflecting the impact from the health insurance tax in 2018.","Now moving to our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we expect full year 2018 earnings in the range of $380 million to $400 million, reflecting business growth and continued strong operational performance.","And regarding the Group Disability and Life business, we expect full year 2018 earnings in the range of $330 million to $350 million driven by ongoing performance momentum in both our Disability and Life businesses.","Lastly, regarding our remaining operations that is other operations and corporate, we expect the loss of $230 million for 2018. To all-in for full year 2008, we expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $3.08 billion to $3.2 billion, or $12.40 to $12.90 per share.","I would also remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of prior year reserve development or any future capital deployment. Overall these expected results represent a competitively attractive outlook and underscore the strong performance of our diverse and differentiated portfolio of businesses.","Now moving to our 2018 capital management position and outlook, overall, we continue to have excellent financial flexibility. Our subsidiaries remain well capitalized and are generating significant free cash flow to the parent with the strong return on capital in each of our business segments, while we maintain significant free cash and leverage capacity available at the parent company.","Our capital deployment strategy and priorities remain, first, funding our businesses to support long-term growth, next, pursuing strategic M&A and lastly, after considering these first two items we would return capital to shareholders primarily through share repurchase.","Regarding free cash flow, during 2017 we repurchased 15.7 million shares of common stock for $2.8 billion, and we ended the year with parent company cash of $1.2 billion including $250 million held for liquidity purposes.","Considering sources and uses the parent company cash, we expect to have approximately $2.8 million available for capital deployment in 2018 including approximately $260 million we deployed to repurchase 1.2 million shares in January 2018.","Our balance sheet and free cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from industry leading margins and returns on capital in our businesses and the high level of capital efficiency, particularly from our fee-based businesses.","Now to recap. Our full-year 2017 consolidated results reflect the strength for our diversified portfolio of Global businesses and continued track record of effective execution of our focused strategy. The fundamentals of our business are strong, and we are confident in our ability to achieve our full-year 2018 earnings outlook.","With that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Sir, your line is open.","A.J. Rice","Thanks. Hi, everybody. Maybe just a broad question, but earlier this week this sector got little bit rolled by announcement of the three large employers that they will going to try something innovative instead of a joint venture. I wonder if you have opened any question, but one of you would comment on -- are you seeing that kind of activity among other large employers? What kind of opportunities and challenges might that present for Cigna? And I think there were specific discussions in the investment community about whether that had any implications for ASO business which I know is important for you and give you a chance to offer your thoughts on that as well maybe?","David Cordani","Good morning. It\u2019s David. Clearly the announcement was not lost on us. So stepping back I think one way we look at the announcement is, it reinforces something we\u2019ve been talking about for quite some time, which is \u2013 it\u2019s a pretty dynamic industry and the older orientation around focusing only on insurance or a fee-for-service healthcare delivery model is just fundamentally not sustainable as employers and customers demand more.","Secondly, from our point of view, it reinforces the imperative of focusing on transparency, focusing on alignment and focusing on in a demonstrable way helping to ensure that you have the ability to drive healthy productive present employees and making employer's business better and more effective. I would point to as an example something we\u2019re quite proud of not only the lowest medical cost trend in the industry year-in and year-out, but this year for 2017 we ended favorable to the lower end of our improved range, so less than 3% medical cost trend for the benefit of our clients and customers.","Looking forward, we actually see initiatives like this is actually presenting more opportunities than not. To your question there are been other different forms of coalitions forming, although this is a different coalition. Coalitions forming through the national business group on health, coalitions forming, you can look at it through private exchanges. And overtime each of them had presented opportunities interestingly for additional growth for us for both our medical and specialty offerings because we\u2019re oriented around transparent aligned funding relationships.","So, taken as whole we view it as indicative of a changing dynamic environment, indicative of employers seeing this more as a strategic investment in the capital and employers seeking opportunities to get more leverage, more impact for the benefit of running the business and we can more opportunity than not.","A.J. Rice","Okay. That's great. And maybe just a quick follow-up on another topic, Eric, I think you mentioned that the guidance now assumes 3% MA growth this year. I know you're in that sort of rebuilding back to growth. I guess that my question would generally be would -- to get back to like market type of growth what needs to happen over the next six to 12 months and are you optimistic that as you look at 2019 and beyond that you could be get back to a market-based growth in MA?","Eric Palmer","A.J. its Eric. Yes, 3% growth is the number we expected for the year. I think in terms of getting back to our long-term targets which would be high single digits growth rate in terms of the revenue and associated lives in the Medicare Advantage really reflects our momentum and such no obstacle whatsoever from my perspective in terms of achieving that over the longer term. As we entered this year we had the effect of some exits of counties. We didn't open up any new counties or any new markets this year, but as we cleared to that January cycle and look ahead to the future, don\u2019t see any reason why we couldn't get back to our and won\u2019t get back to our long-term averages.","A.J. Rice","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Rice. Our next question is from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Your line is open sir.","Josh Raskin","Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just a quick clarification, you talked about the 150 million sort of an offset on tax benefit. I just want to clear that up. Does that include some minimum MLRs and rebates and things like that? I know you guys have as much risk business, but does that included in the 150 and if so how much? And then my real question is just more on the retail presence and you know, your views on the necessity there maybe remind us have a HealthSpring clinics are working, how many of those you have, and sort of what the plans are? But I\u2019m just curious what your perspectives are in terms of sort of that retail market for healthcare?","Eric Palmer","Josh, it\u2019s Eric. I\u2019ll start with the first part of your question, just be clear, yes, any impact from the minimum MRL, rebates and such are included in the $150 million. The amount is small in terms of a portion to that given the profile of our book of business and such, but that is included in the 150. I\u2019ll ask David to comment on the other item.","David Cordani","Josh, good morning. Two comments specific in general. Specific to your question, think about as today as we operate before we get the HealthSpring. We\u2019re able to operate and deliver quite good services for employer clients through on-site clinic management and coordination, on-site health coaches, management and coordination, in select instances, on-site pharmacy management coordination, so think about that is one retail point of interaction that we do on a highly integrated basis.","Secondly to your HealthSpring question, HealthSpring model, as you recall, there are different footprints and different geographies, we can go as broad as the Cigna owned medical group in Arizona to owning bricks and mortar real estate in Tennessee and having independent physicians rotate through that and everywhere in between. I think more broadly stepping back as it relates to retail footprint, our strategic view is that virtual vertical integration is a preferred approach versus wholesale vertical integration on a hardened basis.","So what we mean by that is we are through virtual vertical integration, we\u2019re able to drive improved alignment, choice and transparency where we aggressively embrace technology to expand access and choice and where we partner to create a more open framework to expand choice and impact through affordability and personalization. So, again, we have a variety of footprints, but we really prefer and are driving aggressively the vertical integration through a virtual mechanism to get that alignment, the impact, the choice and embrace technology.","Josh Raskin","Okay. Perfect. Thanks. ","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Raskin. Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Sir, your line is open.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thanks. Good morning. First, just want to ask about the $18 in EPS in 2021, obviously some of that tax reform, but just looking on a CAGR basis it suggested about 12.5% growth. And if I look at the $16 number was closer to 11%. So, just wanted to sort of bridge that in terms way you expects sort of faster underlying growth beyond tax reform from where we were not that long ago on you threw out the $16 number? Thanks.","David Cordani","Yes, Ralph, when we discuss the $16 number at our Investor Day, obviously we walked through a pretty methodical framing of that. So, stepping back we\u2019re quite pleased to be able to put that forth the framing of the four growth platforms and the very attractive growth profile of each of those platforms led by strong retention, further relationship expansion and net new business adds.","To your question, what\u2019s net new? I\u2019d ask you to think about two things, right. The underlying strength of our platform, we ended 2017 ahead of our strategic glide path period. We delivered an EPS growth rate of 29%. We\u2019re able to step into 2018 with an outlook as Eric articulated to grow our EPS by 19% to 23% before reserve development or any additional capital deployment. So point one is the organic fundamentals ended the year stronger which gives us more leverage power stepping into 2018. Second, is the impact of tax reform and our belief in terms of the combination of both of those enable us to increase the outlook from a very attractive $16 to even more attractive $18.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And just the follow-up, has there been any push back on ASO fees from existing customer just on the fee itself. And then as you look across your book it sort of the average trend that you mention sort of below the 3% level. Do you see differences in trends between large nationals that may not be willing to adopt some your medical management approaches versus the smaller select and mid markets that maybe more willing to adopt your approach? Thanks.","David Cordani","Ralph, first relative to ASO fees, as you may recall from prior conversation we typically don't look at an employer relationship as a fee-only relationship. Our entire approach with our employer clients at all levels. So from select through middle market, through national is to look at the portfolio of services that best suit their strategy, their change agenda and have the highest opportunity for impact vis-\u00e0-vis some of the integrated offerings I made comment on -- before my prepared remarks. And then get an economic relationship with them that work in a quite transparent basis.","So we\u2019ve long since moved from micromanagement of the fee environment and candidly I would view the fee environment as a smaller part of the overall conversation. To your broader question relative to medical cost trend and the like. The positive [Indiscernible] it transcend the portfolio, right, as you recall ASO aided by further shared returns encompasses over 90% of all of our relationships. So that positive medical trend performance is indicative of the entire portfolio and the performance of the portfolio and what tends to drive it to such a powerful level is the alignment with the employer and transparency, highly innovative clinical programs and engagement incentive-based programs and then increasing leverage of the collaborative accountable care relationships that we\u2019re able to deliver for the benefit of our clients.","Eric Palmer","Ralph, it\u2019s Eric, one other point on what David said there and as David noted in his prepared remarks this morning, the effectiveness of the integration of the specialty model helps to drive even more effectiveness in terms of trends. So as we have highly integrated offerings in the smaller end of the market I generally see even the better results than the bottles that are little more a la carte or fragmented.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Zach Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. Zach, your line is open. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question will come from Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Mr. Borsch, your line is open.","Matt Borsch","Yes. Thank you. You know, I was hoping you just maybe extend a little bit on the reaction to the joint venture of the three companies. And maybe just I get the consideration of the employer coalitions and the ones that we've seen before. I think maybe what also rattled investors though is couple of things; the tone of dissatisfaction and frustration with the medical cost outcomes, somehow being just opposed with poor profit orientation in healthcare, as well as the prospect of this gigantic tax behemoth that's disrupted other industries maybe they're just coming in to do this coalition, but perhaps its more than that. Can you just address that? I know it\u2019s wide open, but whatever you can say.","David Cordani","Matt, it\u2019s David. First nice job trying to displace Zach from the call queue; and Zach will get back to you as quickly as we can. Matt, I think just part of your question and I appreciate the way you framed it. I mean, at the end of the day we have talked for quite some time, while the industry as a whole for example may step back and we have a narrative around more stabilized or more muted medical cost trend. We as a company been very consistent, it is still unsustainable. So as I illustrated in the prepared remarks for example, a 1000 life employer experiencing illustratively our medical cost trend versus the industry average is a multimillion dollar savings and we believe we need to do even better.","So, when you look at the size and impact of medical cost trend growth being an industry average of six or seven or our industry-leading trend of below 3% this year, employers will rightfully continue to push for more value from their sizable investment and increasingly they see this disinvestment as a strategic investment and we\u2019ll manage it as a strategic investment to help them run their business more effectively.","Over time we think that creates more opportunity versus less for us, because we seek to be at an integrated partner for the services standpoint providing the services that deliver the value. As you know our industry is capital-intensive, as well as relatively low margin, single-digit margin, so this is not going to get solved with extracting a couple points of margin out of the equation. The solution here is helping to keep people healthier in the first place, to avoid health risk, health consumption, lowering the health risk for the 25% of Americans that are medium and high risk will be chronic or acute in two years of those risk don\u2019t go mitigated and getting the best possible evidence-based care compliance for those dealing with chronic condition and then optimizing care delivery for those confronting acute conditions.","That's how the sustainability of the system is driven and employers flexing their muscle and becoming more vocal in terms of driving and being more demanding around that we actually view as a net positive, because we think the employer market is a positive aggregation of individuals and a way to get strategic alignment. So to recap, we should not view that an industry with stable medical cost trend at 5%, 6%, 7% is sustainable. We\u2019re proud of the fact that we delivered half of that. We need to do better and you do better by engagement, alignment and driving health improvement and getting the best possible quality of care when care is consumed.","Matt Borsch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Borsch. Our next question will come from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Justin Lake","Thanks. Good morning. Just handful of number of questions here from me. First on the 2021 numbers change, sounds like to the great extent this is the improvement in taxes and some improved business momentum. On the tax side you're looking out for years and obviously assuming that a lot of this is sustainable. Can you walk us through kind of your thought process on sustainability of higher effective net income margins as you go through kind of competitive iteration over a few years?","David Cordani","Justin, its David. Good morning. I guess couple of thoughts. First to reinforce, the $16 starting point was based on strong fundamental sustained organic growth for franchise and then effective capital deployment. Yielding is as you would recall, a very attractive result. The step up these two items, I don't want to walk away from the stronger results we deliver in 2017, put us ahead of us to glide path and give us leverage going forward.","Specific to the taxes, as you know in the U.S. we\u2019re predominately a service-based business that has higher transparency versus not, as Eric articulated earlier there\u2019s relatively de minimis impact of the taxes on my minimum MLRs and the like, so we have more flexibility or choice with which to deploy it. For 2018 we made a very disciplined assessment of how to invest if you will those assets for sustained growth on a go forward basis looking at our customers, our clients, our community, our coworkers and our shareholders. And we\u2019re quite confident that it\u2019s a long way -- as we have continued innovation and effective execution we\u2019ll be able to both deliver the value for clients and customers as well as realize a fair return for shareholders. So we see a lot of opportunities as we look for between 2018, 2019 and 2021.","Justin Lake","Great. And then, on the two things; one, Disability and Life, 7.5%, 8% margins is where you were before the issues kind of occur there. By my estimate it doesn\u2019t look like you got back to your 7.5% to 8% margin that you used to do there with the guidance. Is there some reason for that? And is the true? And then on membership growth can you just give us some color on where the segments beyond Medicare Advantage ASO versus commercial risk versus experience rated, where you expect that membership to come? Thanks a lot.","Eric Palmer","Justin, it\u2019s Eric. As it relates to the Disability and Life, we think the guidance we\u2019ve provided is attractive and align with our long-term strategic targets. So again we think that business is performing in line with the strategic targets that we set for it over the long-term. As it relates to membership growth we would note a couple of things that's tying up comments David made in his prepared remarks, first of all, continued really strong momentum in the select segment in the middle market segments in particular we would see a growth there and across the insured versus ASO split again, we\u2019d expect growth across each one of the funding arrangements as we go into 2018.","Justin Lake","All right. Thanks","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Lake. Our next question is from Zach Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open sir.","Zach Sopcak","Thank you. And sorry about difficulty earlier. I just wanted to circle back on the comment Eric made on cost trend for 2018. And he mentioned potentially increased utilization. Is there anything that you\u2019re seeing in January that makes you think that utilization going to up a bunch? Or is it just coming off of a low in 2017?","Eric Palmer","Zach, it\u2019s Eric. Nothing specific I would call out in terms of things that we\u2019re seeing that would \u2013 I would point to you. I think its more just coming off of the low trend that we delivered in the course of the of 2017. In particular we had very favorable pharmacy trend in the course 2017. We finished 2017 with pharmacy trend that essentially zero. We wouldn\u2019t expect that to be the rate going forward, but again, we pull those pieces together overall and nothing I would point to in terms of specifically higher utilization.","Zach Sopcak","Okay. That was it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Sopcak. Our next is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sir, your line is open.","Kevin Fischbeck","Great. Thanks. If you go back to one of deal with Anthem growth, how you outlined about 7 billion of kind of capital available for deployment [Indiscernible] if you wanted to do M&A. Where do we stand in those numbers now? And then, I guess you mentioned that there was foreign tax, one-time tax in a quarter. So that mean, we repatriate in cash in 2018?","Eric Palmer","It\u2019s Eric. Couple of parts to that question there. First of all, as it relates to the seven to 14 items, so we issued the $7 billion to $14 billion range at the time of the Anthem break just to help provide some framing. At that time the $7 billion end of the range represented capital available for deployment that we had on the balance sheet, plus the impact of the break fee, plus the additional leverage capacity that we had to return to more normal range. The upper end of that range represented what we could do if we took additional leverage and pursued a strategic M&A transaction.","Now, as I noted in my prepared remarks, we expect to have your $2.8 billion or so available in 2018 plus still significant balance sheet capacity. So, again, the overall framework that we described in terms of the $7 billion to $14 billion continues to apply, will continue to be disciplined in terms of our approach on deployment and such overall.","On the second part of your question, could you just repeat the specifics, I want to make sure I'm answering it appropriately.","Kevin Fischbeck","I think I thought somewhere in your prepared remarks you indicated that you were -- it was like a one-time tax on foreign earnings as part of tax reform. And I wasn't sure if that meant that you were repatriating cash in 2018 or are you saying cash in 2018 is the question. And if so how much of that is that $2.8 billion.","Eric Palmer","Yes, the specific item there that we talked about in the terms of the tax associated with the foreign earnings is the repatriation portion of the recently reformed tax law. We are not anticipating significant repatriation and the tax law hasn't really changed our plans in terms of how we bring dollars back. We generally have used overseas capital to support the growth outside the United States and we continue to do so.","Kevin Fischbeck","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Fischbeck. Our next question is from Christine Arnold with Cowen. Ma'am, your line is open.","Christine Arnold ","Hi there. Thanks. Two questions. First you're less than 2% trend, can you remind us does that include or exclude buy downs? And if it includes buy downs, could a reduction in the corporate tax rate cause, kind of a pause in that? How are you thinking about that?","And then second you've talked a lot about Medicare Advantage and I understand 2018 is a repositioning year, how do you think about Medicare Advantage long-term? Do you feel like you can get to the footprint and the growth rate you need organically? Or do you feel you know that maybe something more strategic from an M&A perspective might be required in that area? Thanks.","Eric Palmer","Christine its Eric, I'll start with the trend item and then ask David to comment on the Medicare Advantage pieces. So, the trend, the trend statistics we talk about on this call represent our U.S. commercial employer paid claim trends across all of our book of business.","And, again, just as a reminder given that over 85% of our customer lives are self-funded, this statistic represents the amount that our clients are spending per customer per month year-over-year. There's no other adjustment or anything in terms of how we calculate that trend.","Now, the difference between that paid trend or what you might call in a loud trend, the loud trend will help to include the effective cost borne by the individual customer in terms of deductibles and copays etcetera.","Given that we tend to have high customer retention from period-to-period our clients generally have pretty stable benefits from period-to-period that we haven't seen much difference between paid or allowed trends. But if you look at that allowed basis that includes the effect of car-sharing and such for 2017, our trend actually would have been even a little bit lower yet than the paid trends that I talked about in my prepared remarks. David, if you want to tackle the Medicare Advantage question.","David Cordani","Hey, Christine relative to Medicare Advantage in Medicare Growth, we continue to see it is an attractive opportunity to immediate long-term for us. I would ask you to think about it in a couple of ways. First relative to further accelerating organic growth, as Eric indicated, we view 2018 as a transition year. As we step into 2019 and beyond, we believe significant opportunity to open new markets and adjacent counties.","We are aided by the fact that we have a deep collaborative accountable care relationships in multiple states in multiple markets that are highly attractive for us for growth. Those relationships are focused on commercial today and many of those collaborative partners are excited to open up new Medicare Advantage relationships with us.","So, we see the organic new market entry opportunities for 2019 and beyond is very attractive and in addition as you'll recall, we continue to have Medicare and seniors footprint growth as one of our M&A priority. So, it's one of our five M&A priorities. So, we see both opportunities through both organic expansion as well as inorganic expansion to generate sustained growth there.","Christine Arnold ","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Ms. Arnold. Our next question is from Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open sir.","Steve Tanal","Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to circle up on tax reform, may close the loop on this. The $150 million of reinvestment sounds like an after-tax figure, and just using the tax rate, I guess, the pretax amount is maybe closer to $200 million. I just wanted to confirm that the way tax announced yesterday are sort of $45 million of that amount? And maybe get some color on specifics of where the rest will be reinvested. And then just finally, tying up some comments earlier around sustainability of medical cost trend generally, when do you see deflation if the \u2013 we continue down this path?","David Cordani","Steve, good morning, it's David. I'll address the taxes, and I'll ask Eric to talk about the medical cost trend and your interesting twist on it with deflation. Specifically, relative to investments, you've framed it correctly, we're talking about after-tax numbers, what are the implication, etcetera, but we're talking about a meaningful investment back into multiple key constituency group. So, you articulated rightfully, significant amount of investments back into our coworkers.","And the next part that I'd ask you to think about is, furthering investments back in the company relative to innovation and innovative capabilities. We have had a long sustainable track record of designing and bringing new solutions and capabilities to market. We're going to take this opportunity to even further accelerate that in 2018, so a meaningful portion of the $150 million will make its way there.","And then third category we referenced is, returning it back to the marketplace beyond that, so opportunities relative to furthering our community initiatives through our foundation and the like. Taken as a whole, that equates to approximately the 25% in aggregate of the impact that we talked about, making up the $150 million. Eric, if you share your thoughts relative to medical trend?","Eric Palmer","Yes, Steve, on the medical trend. I think a couple of points that I want to make sure land here. First of all, our trend results reflect the power of the incentive line and the power of our integrated model. And again, we're really proud of the result that we generated there. But as David said before, there is more work to be done. Not to -- to be able to predict the day or time that we hit the -- a point of deflation but there's more work to be done and we think there's quite a bit more we could tackle with the integrated model that we bring to the market.","Steve Tanal","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Mr. Tanal. Our next question is from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Gary Taylor","Hi. Good morning. Just wanted a little more detail on some of the segment guidance that you provided. Is it possible just to walk through by segment, what tax rates would look like by segment for 2018 embedded in your guidance?","Eric Palmer","Gary it's Eric. That plan into numbered the exact kind of tax rates by segment, but what I encourage you to think about the things in the following way. So, within the Global Health Care and Group Life and Disability business, the largest share of those businesses are here in the U.S. and that's where the bulk of our businesses, so you would expect to see the biggest impact there. And those businesses the impacted by U.S. tax reform.","The Global Supplemental Benefits business has a net tax headwind year-on-year that some of our non-U.S. jurisdictions have actually increased income tax rates so just a slight increase in terms of Global Supplemental Benefits business.","And then within corporate and other operations, there's a tax rate favorability, but earnings headwind reflecting that segment where operating had a loss in total. So, those would be that piece that I would point you too.","Gary Taylor","And as a quick follow-up. So, when we look at the corporate cost increasing 45% or so year-over-year, there's a tax that's -- I guess, that primary delta you're seeing is the tax treatment within that segment. Is that correct?","Eric Palmer","Gary, year-on-year, there's two things that point there both tax-related. First of all is the effect of the lower tax rate in 2018 and the second is the absence of some tax favorability that we had in 2017. So, some tax-related items, so it's separate from the income tax rate that we talked about earlier in the year in 2017. We don't expect those to return next year.","Gary Taylor","So, the 230, that's a good go-forward on corporate expense though?","Eric Palmer","Yes.","Gary Taylor","Out years. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Taylor. Our next question is from Ana Gupte from Leerink Partners. Your line is open, ma'am.","Ana Gupte","Yes, hi, thanks for the question. So, coming back to the basis of the diamond coalition. I guess, at the end of the day, is it because insurance companies are not communicating the value that they are delivering well enough for? And you should -- the company be thinking of it from the point of view of the American consumer and make it simple? They see lack of transparency on the pharmacy side of the house? And was there anything significant that can be done by Amazon on that?","Secondly, on the buy downs and increase in deductibles. Consumer's think of the insurance at this point is just becoming catastrophic coverage at best. And then finally, on kind of breaking it down between pricing and utilization, do you see the opportunity for the private managed care and to see the improved things on pricing? Or might be even get worse as we are seeing even more consolidation among the large not for profit hospitals at this point?","David Cordani","Ana, it\u2019s David. So, multiple different questions, and let me try to address a couple of themes and invite Eric to add to it. I'm not sure we're going to be able to address every complexity referencing your question.","In the first question, I think about it in a couple of ways, right? As indicated before, this is an example of three large impactful voices, essentially suggesting that there's an opportunity to do more and they're going to lean in aggressively to enable more to be done whether it's through technological leverage, whether it's through insight and data, whether it's through insight and data, whether it's through a variety of items. But each one of those entities, essentially are ASO-serviced.","So, if they're ASO-serviced, they're bearing their own risk and they're going to elevate the demands both for the parties they do business with as well as for their coworkers who are engaging in the overall equation.","To your inference, I think there's opportunity and transparency, there's further opportunity in alignment, there's further opportunity in simplifying the complex. That's all on strategy from our point of view and we believe we have an opportunity to add value in every one of those areas. But it also means that the consumer and the employer need to more aggressively embrace change along the way. Net-net, we see of all of it as a positive.","On your last point, I don't know. I don't know relative to the inference, relative to the consolidation and not for profits cost implications, et cetera. I would put into face of that two forces that are indisputable right now. One, you made reference to yourself, which is a relentless increase drive for transparency and demonstrable value delivery.","And second, reword alignment relative to value-based care. I think those forces are indisputable and will confront any level of change and configuration of the supply chain or otherwise to push for more demonstrable value delivery and then elevation and transparency across care and quality. Eric, anything to add?","Eric Palmer","Ana, it's Eric. Just one other thing I would add relative to your comment about buy downs and such. I think one of the things I've noted -- and I've actually noted in the -- my response to Christine's question about paid versus allowed trend is actually, our allowed trend would have been a little bit lower that's because in 2017 versus 2016, our employers paid a little bit higher percentage of the cost than the employees. So, it's actually the opposite of cost shift in terms of 2017 versus 2016.","I think what's most important, rather than just shift between how much the employer pays versus how much they employee pays is the power of getting incentives aligned with appropriate and well-designed plans to help reduce the overall cost burden of the programs and such overall. So making sure that the smart way design benefit plan helps to bring the cost down for both parties rather than just doing kind of cost shifting as the mechanism for employers to move things.","Ana Gupte","Thanks for the color. Appreciate.","Operator","Thank you, Ms. Gupte. Our next question is from Chris Rigg with Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open.","Chris Rigg","Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to ask about the Global Supplemental business, particularly relative to where you started the year in terms of guidance and where you ended the year. You outperformed that number by about 20%-ish. Can you give us a sense of what drove that outperformance? And then when we think about 2018, it sounds like there might be some kind of tax impact there. But is there any sort of core reset to the profits that you're assuming given the outperformance in 2017? Thanks.","Eric Palmer","Chris, its Eric. I'll start with a couple of comments there for you. So first of all, within the Global Supplemental Benefits business, we're really pleased with the year that we delivered in that segment. That point of three macro drivers in terms of the result that we generated in the course of 2017.","First of all, we've had \u2013 continue to have favorable experience relative to our initial expectations. We've had continued growth in the business, we've been -- continue to be very disciplined in terms of the expense leverage and the expense management that we've delivered there.","Additionally, at the beginning of 2017, based on where the spot rates were at the time, we had anticipated the potential for some potential foreign exchange headwind, and that has actually turned into a headwind for us. So, those are all pulled together in terms of drivers of our results in 2017.","Now, looking forward, the things I would point to in terms of drivers there, we do assume that there would be a bit of normalization in terms of that claim experience as we look ahead to 2018, one.","Two, we, as I noted on the tax rate question from a prior caller, we do expect a little bit higher tax rate on that segment going forward. And then as it relates to foreign exchange or FX, no particular headwind or tailwind we'd call out at this point.","Chris Rigg","Great. I'll leave it there. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Rigg. Our next question is from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open, ma'am.","Sarah James","Thank you. First, a clarification on guidance. Interest rate is expected to increase two times or three times this year. So, does guidance reflect increasing interest rates as a benefit to investment income either for the 2018 guidance or the 2021 guidance?","Eric Palmer","Sarah, its Eric. As it relates to interest rates, so our guidance and our outlook assume our macro case, which does reflect a bit of rising interest rate. But I note that the impact of interest rates has to play out over a number of years. We tend to be buy and hold investors and as a result, any changes up or down in interest rates outplay themselves out through the P&L over a pretty long period of time.","Sarah James","And no material impact on your 2018 guidance then from interest.","Eric Palmer","No, nothing that I would call out, Sarah, as a driver.","Sarah James","Okay. And in the past, you stated that there is some interest in LTSS. But if I looked historically, companies with a strong Medicaid background are primarily the winners. So, would you be opening -- open to strengthening your process by acquiring Medicaid assets with some mixed books, including high and low acuity? If not, how do you feel that Cigna can get an edge in competing on LTSS without a track record of cost savings and Medicaid?","David Cordani","Yes, it's David. Our review has been and continues to be that over time, states will continue to modify their approach to populations both as defined today, but defining on a go-forward basis, additional sub-segments of the population and then seek the vendors, carriers or partners that can give them the best value relative to the populations.","As you articulate today, we're not a large player in any of those spaces. But over time, we see that marketplace change as a potential future opportunity for growth and we will leverage both organic capabilities and opportunistically, inorganic activity relative to that. But we think the marketplace is going to evolve over time and this presents an additional possible long-term growth opportunity for us as the marketplace changes.","Sarah James","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Sarah. Our next question is from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Your line is open.","David Windley","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to come back to Medicare Advantage. David, I think you've talked about 2018 being a year where you will maybe improve margins but not get back to target levels in 2018. So, point of the question number one would be kind of what's your view on glide path on M&A margins?","Second that I would presume in that you would expect growth to help you leverage that business and bring margins back up. You've talked about 3% enrollment growth over the course of this year. It looks like your performance, at least in the AEP [ph], was strongest in what would have been HealthSpring and Bravo had a long-standing markets and less well in maybe some of the more recent expansion markets.","Curious what that -- what your views are? What that tells us about the ability to expand that HealthSpring specific model into adjacent markets? And how you view that over the next year or two? And then finally, STAR's mitigation and how that influences that growth as well over the course of 2018 for 2019? Thanks.","David Cordani","Yes, packed a lot in there. So, maybe quickly and simply, we see further margin expansion opportunity period relative to the line of business over time both driven by disciplined performance in the MOR range as well as expense leverage that you articulated. So, we'll opportunity to further expand the margin over time.","Second, your articulation of the growth profile in terms of the immediate timeframe is right. That was deliberate in terms of our positioning of those market places, and it further validates or reinforces that where we have highly aligned value based physician relationships, the performance and the value return to customers, beneficiaries and physicians is quite strong, but we don't -- the value proposition is a bit less strong.","As I mentioned in prior remarks, we're delighted with the fact that we now have multiple markets with quite mature, highly performing collaborative where we have demand from those physician groups or integrated hospital systems to aggressively enter the M&A marketplace over time. So, it's a good reinforcement and learning relative to the value having the aligned physician relationship and the proven performance, as opposed to starting that build from scratch.","Lastly, relative to STARS, we were in 2018, about 60% from a four STAR+PLUS plan with all of our mature markets by one performing where we expected it today. For 2019, we are optimistic that we will get recognition to the proper positioning of our products and our capabilities. Our Net Promoter Score and [Indiscernible] outcomes continue to be quite strong and we have multiple leverage and tools to work with CMS to ensure they were properly positioned for 2018. So we are looking forward to the 2019 selling season.","David Windley","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you Mr. Windley. Our last question will come from Michael Newshel with Evercore ISI with Evercore ISI. Mr. Newshel, your line is open.","Michael Newshel","Hey good morning, thanks for taking me in. So, last summer you had announced collaboration with CVS to leverage pharmacy interactions in the clinic. Is there any change to how you see that evolving given that pending transaction with Aetna? And are you considering doing anything similar with other partners? And also is there any change you are thinking about the future of your PBM relationship with Optum given the recent actions among your peers?","David Cordani","So Michael two points, you are correct. First stepping back we are \u2013 we view partnering with others as a critical capability. In fact you might recall from a investor day dialogue being the undisputed partner of choices and have borne strategic comparative to continue to drive the right value for our customers and clients and as we go forward. That relationship we entered into the CVS down in Florida was an innovation that both parties wanted to do to try to drive improved outcomes. We don\u2019t have any discernable deliberate differentiated outcomes to point to at this point in time, but it\u2019s indicative of our test and learn approach, our collaboration and are willing historically multiple partners, so you could view that is indicative of both today and in the future which would be to have multiple partnership arrangements up in running today.","As it relates to the PBM, as Eric articulated we delivered a pharmacy trend in 2017 potentially zero with high clinical outcomes and continue to grow that business. So our proprietary owned PBM continues to perform quite well, back to partnership we have an orientation round, willingness and ability to partner with others to increase value for the benefit of our customers and clients and I think its a spectacular example of smart, well aligned partnership capabilities and being able to deliver better value for customers and clients is indicative of high clinical quality outcomes growing the platform and zero medical cost trend. So we view partnership as mission critical on a go-forward basis and a lot of bright spots to point to over the recent past.","Operator","Thank you Mr. Newshel. I will now turn the call back over to David Cordani.","David Cordani","Thank you everyone. Let me just move to wrap up our call with a few headlines. First, overall we delivered very strong result in 2017 with key performance across all of our priority growth platforms. Commercial employer, U.S. Senior, Global Supplemental Benefits and Group Disability & Life led by delivery of continued industry leading medical cost trend.","In addition, in 2017 Cigna grew to serve more than 95 million customer relationship worldwide. Relative to overall expectations for 2018, we will continue to create differentiated value for our customers and clients and as a result for your shareholders through consistent focus on delivering affordability and personalization as well as partnering with healthcare professionals to ensure our customers receive the highest quality healthcare.","Each of our four growth platforms remains well positioned for sustained growth, in addition we have an exceptionally strong ongoing capital position. We expect to deliver revenue growht inline with our long term objective of high single digit growth rates and we have an outlook for 2018 that anticipates a 19% to 23% EPS growth rate over 2017 all of which gives us confidence to increase our long term EPS target from $16 per share to $18 per share by 2021.","We thank you for joining our call today and look forward to further conversations.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Cigna\u2019s fourth quarter 2017 results review.

At this time, all callers are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference, and review procedures and how to enter keys to ask questions at that time. [Operator Instructions]","As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the question-and-answer session is being recorded. We will begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Will McDowell. Please go ahead, Mr. McDowell.","William McDowell","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today\u2019s call. I am Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom McCarthy, Cigna\u2019s Chief Financial Officer.","In our remarks today, David and Tom will cover a number of topics, including Cigna\u2019s second quarter 2016 financial results, as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2016. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures which are determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP.","Specifically, we use the term labeled, adjusted income from operations and earnings per share, on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is contained in today\u2019s earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com.","In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2016 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today\u2019s earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.","Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures.","In the second quarter, we recorded an after-tax charge of $26 million or $0.10 per share for merger-related transaction costs. And we reported this charge as a special item. As described in today\u2019s earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations in our discussion of second quarter 2016 results.","Also, consistent with past practices, when we make any prospective comments on earnings or EPS outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future capital deployment or additional prior year development of medical costs.","And with that I will turn the call over to David.","David Cordani","Thanks, Will. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. It\u2019s been over a year since we\u2019ve held formal earnings call due to our pending combination and clearly much has happened. We wanted to take the opportunity to connect directly with you, first to reaffirm our goals and how we are delivering on our strategy; second, to provide an update around this quarter\u2019s results and the actions we are taking to remedy this specific performance headwind that has caused us to miss our expectations; and third to provide some perspective regarding the actions from the U.S. Department of Justice to block our proposed combination with Anthem.","After I share my remarks, Tom will briefly highlight our second quarter financial results and updated outlook in more detail and we\u2019ll take your questions. After that, I\u2019ll leave you with a few closing thoughts following the Q&A portion of the call.","I\u2019d like to begin by underscoring that over the past year our goals had been clear, first and foremost to continue to effectively run and operate our businesses with a focus on our customers and clients and on delivering long-term value for you, our shareholders; second, to support and guide the proposed transaction through the regulatory process, as Anthem leads that process and we support it; and third, to keep the company well positioned with optionality in a variety of scenarios, given the uncertainty around the regulatory approval process.","We are delivering our strategy. We have maintained focus, and continue to grow and invest in our businesses, while delivering differentiated value for our customers and clients; and also this quarter, deliver on our shareholder commitments.","While our results underperformed expectations in the second quarter, to be clear, our diversified businesses remain grounded in solid fundamentals and we continue to innovate and deliver a notable array of capabilities that are truly differentiated.","Our relationships with employers, providers and partners continue to strengthen. We continue to add new customer relationships in addition to maintaining high retention levels for existing customer and clients. We are maintaining a strong pipeline for future growth in all of our businesses and we continue to generate and warehouse historical levels of deployable capital and balance sheet capability.","While this is our media backdrop, it is important to remember our long-term strategic goal of 10% to 13% compounded annual growth on average for earnings per share. And over the last six years, we have delivered 13%, which is at the high-end of that range.","I\u2019ll now turn to our results in the second quarter. Our Global Healthcare and Global Supplemental Benefits business delivered strong 2016 second quarter financial results for our portfolio, which were tampered by disappointing performance in our Group Disability & Life segment.","Our second quarter 2016 consolidated revenue increased 5% to $10 billion over the second quarter of 2015. We reported adjusted income from operations for the second quarter of $515 million or $1.98 per share. Our revenue growth is fully in line with our expectations; however, the earnings were pressured by temporary impacts on our Group Disability & Life segment.","Given that as a backdrop, let\u2019s discuss our group operations, specifically performance, issues and actions.","The quarterly results were significantly below our expectations in both Disability and Life businesses. The poor performance in Disability is a result of modifications made to the disability claim process, coming into the first quarter this year, where we are investing additional resources in the upfront medical review of claims to conduct further physical examinations, perform deeper medical history reviews and enhanced documentation.","These modifications has resulted in longer claim cycles, thereby increasing the disability durations and our claim inventory which has contributed significantly to the unfavorable financial impact we have experienced in the first-half of 2016 for this business.","We are currently making the investments necessary to strengthen the operational processes in a manner that will provide an improved customer experience as we lower claim volatility and further improve the quality of decisions, all at a lower operating cost. While we have to realize the long-term benefits associated with these changes, it is important to recognize that they are both customer-friendly and aligned with regulatory best practices.","As a result, our disability operating results are expected to improve over the balance of 2016 and into 2017, as these changes take hold. And see this differentiated disability model with unique focus on productivity and health continues to deliver value for our customers and clients as evidenced by our sustained growth and stable performance up to this point.","Now, to round out group insurance and add to the disability pressure in the second quarter, our Group Disability and Life earnings were significantly impact by unfavorable life claims. Where claims emerged unfavorably early in the quarter, claims in last month of the quarter were more in line with our expectations. It is important to know for context, we have had periods of life claim volatility in the past and expect life claims to run closer to historic levels over the balance of the year. Do in part as a rapid reversion of the short terms spike-in claims to historic levels. And some reserve strengthening of pricing actions that we are taking.","We understand the results in this business did not your expectations and to be clear they did not meet ours. We are taking actions to ensure they will improve and they present in earnings trajectory opportunity for us as we look to the future.","Additionally and importantly, our client and customer performance has been strong, despite the financial impact of these challenges in the second quarter. Overall, our Group Disability and Life business remains an important part of our portfolio. As for the rest of our portfolio, we continue to post strength in our employer healthcare book and our Global Supplemental business. While, U.S. individual business has experienced softness similar to the rest of the industry overall our commercial book-to-business is performing well.","Additionally, our U.S. Medicare continues to perform in line with our expectation recognizing we did incur increased temporary costs associated with our CMS audit response.","Now turning briefly to our pending combination. As you\u2019ve recently seen United States Department of Justice has sued to block the proposed combination with Anthem. Given the nature of the concerns raised by the DOJ in the overall status of the regulatory process, which under the merger agreement is led by Anthem, we step back briefly to evaluate our options, consistent with our obligations under the merger agreement.","As part of this evaluation, we obviously sought to deeply understand the various and significant concerns of the DOJ and the states that have joined on, as well as past possibly address their broad and specific concerns. So to be clear, we have and will continue to fulfill our contractual obligations. If there was a successful combination to be completed it is clearly our intent and commitment to continue to provide the support as we have dedicating significant resources, time and effort to do so. If there is not a combination to be completed, we will seek to improve shareholder value by accelerating growth in our core strong performing businesses, improve the results of our underperforming business, seek to pursue additional growth opportunities.","And finally seek to further create shareholder value with the tremendous capital flexibility we have created over the last several years. Reflecting on all these challenges and the criticality of the work we do, which impacts more than 90 million customer relationships around the world. I\u2019d also like to take a moment to thank to Cigna team. And recognize their steadfast passion, resilience and focus on our customers and clients during the past year.","I have to summarize, Cigna\u2019s performance this quarter includes solid revenue and earnings contributions from our Global Health Care and Global Supplemental benefits business. And performance from our Group Disability and Life segment that did not meet our expectations, we believe these results will improve meaningful over the remaining 2016 and 2017 timeframe. Are highly engaged passionate and extremely resilient team will continue to create value for our customers and clients by leveraging the strength of our diversified businesses and our differentiated capabilities.","We remain committed to our long term objective to continue to deliver competitively attractive long term EPS growth of 10% to 13% annually on average, all while continuing to invest in our company\u2019s business portfolio.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn to call over to Tom.","Thomas McCarthy","Thanks, David, good morning, everyone. And my remarks today, I will briefly review key aspects of Cigna\u2019s second quarter 2016 results and discussed our outlook for the full year. Overall, key highlights in the quarter are consolidated revenue growth of 5% to $10 billion. Consolidated earnings of $515 million, quarterly earnings per share of $1.98 and continued to strong capital efficiency and free cash flow in line with our full year expectation.","Regarding the segments, I will first comment on our Global Health Care segment. Second quarter premiums and fees grew to $26.9 billion. Second quarter earnings were $486 million reflecting medical and specialty business growth and continued favorable medical cost and quality outcomes particularly in our commercial employer group business. These drivers were partially offset by higher medical costs in our individual business and increased costs related to our Medicare advantage CMS audit response.","Turning to our Global Supplemental Benefits business, on a currency adjusted basis, premiums and fees grew 12% and earnings grew 15% quarter-over-quarter to $83 million. This was another strong quarter for our Global Supplemental Benefits business.","Group Disability and Life reported a second quarter loss of $12 million, results in the second quarter reflect continued impact, modification to our disability claims process and poor experience in group life claims. While, second quarter results in our disability business were better than results in the first quarter, the improvement was less than we have expected.","Results in the Group Life business were also below expectations. We experienced elevated claims early in the quarter, our life claims were more in line with expectations later in the quarter. This quarter\u2019s results also included $17 million after tax unfavorable impact from reserve study on our life business and for comparative purposes the second quarter of 2015 results included $37 million after tax favorable impact from our reserve study on our Group Disability business, resulting in a $54 million after tax unfavorable variance from reserve studies quarter-over-quarter.","Over the balance of the year, we expect life claims experience to run closer to historical levels and we continue to expect disability result to improve, though at a slower pace than previously expected. As the process modifications implemented in the first quarter take time to mature and long term benefits begin to emerge.","Overall, our second quarter results reflects solid revenue and earnings contributions from our Global Health Care and Global Supplemental Benefits business and continuing pressure in the Global Disability and Life results. We also continue to generate strong free cash flow from our business and had significant financial flexibility.","Now, I\u2019ll discuss our outlook for 2016. We continue to expect consolidated revenues to grow in the mid-single-digit range over 2015 results. Our outlook for full year 2016 consolidated adjusted income from operations is now in the range of approximately $2.02 billion to $2.11 billion, or $7.75 to $8.10 per share. This represents a reduction of $1.23 per share at the midpoint from previous expectations and it\u2019s driven by and approximate $0.30 per share reduction due to higher than previously anticipated costs associated with our CMS audit response and higher medical costs in our individual business. And an approximate $0.90 per share reduction due to higher claim costs in our Group Disability and Life business.","Provide greater transparency within our outlook, we are introducing segment level guidance for full year 2016. We expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of approximately $1.9 billion to $1.93 billion. The assumptions reflect in our Global Health Care earnings outlook for 2016 include the following. Regarding, Global Medical Customers, we continue to expect 2016 customer growth in the low-single-digit percentage range.","Turning to medical costs, our 2016 outlook continues to assume some increase in medical utilization, which has been reflected in our pricing. For our total U.S. commercial business, we expect full year medical costs trend to be in the range of 4.5% to 5.5%. We continue to deliver medical costs that reflects better health outcomes and strong clinical excellence for our customers and clients as a result of our deep collaborative relationships with physicians and our focus on personalization of care.","Now, turning to our medical care ratio outlook, for our Total Commercial book of business, we expect 2016 medical care ratio to be in the range of 78.5% to 79.5%. The MCR that reflects continued to strong performance in our commercial employer business in some continued pressure in individual medical costs. For our Total Government book of business, we expect 2016 medical care ratio to be in the range of 84% to 85% reflecting the continued benefit for physician engagement model within our seniors business.","Regarding operating expenses, we expect our 2016 Global Health Care operating expense ratio to be in the range of 21% to 22%, which includes the impact of spending on our CMS audit response.","For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we continue to expect strong top line growth on a currency adjusted basis and earnings in the range of $255 million to $275 million.","Regarding the Group Disability & Life business, we now expect full year earnings in 2016 in the range of $40 million to $80 million. Group Disability and Life earnings are well below our previous expectations and reflect results to date and continuing pressure over the balance of the year.","Regarding our remaining operations, that is Other Operations and Corporate; we expect a loss of $175 million for 2016. So all in portfolio 2016 we now expect consolidated adjusted income for operations of $2.02 billion to $2.11 billion or $7.75 to $8.10 per share.","I would also highlight that we expect earnings and EPS between the third and fourth quarter to be more evenly distributed than historical patterns. And I would also remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of additional prior year reserve development or any future capital deployment.","Regarding free cash flow, year-to-date we have repurchased 785,000 shares of common stock for approximately a $110 million. We ended the quarter with parent company cash of approximately $2 billion. After considering all sources and uses of parent company cash, we expect to have approximately $2.75 billion and parent cash available during the balance of the year, including $250 million held for liquidity purposes.","Our balance sheet and free cash flow outlook are strong and remain in line with our expectations. Now, to recap the fundamentals of our Global Healthcare and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses remain strong. We are also taking the appropriate steps to address the challenges we are facing Group Disability & life.","We are confident in our ability to achieve our revised full year 2016 earnings outlook. And with that, we\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from Matthew Borsch of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Matthew Borsch","Thank you. And thank you for your decision to hold the call. I think it makes sense in light of where we are and also the volatility and results. Would you mind just stepping into little more detail on the Group Disability & Life? And help us understand the $0.90 lower outlook. How much of that is Life? And I gather on the Life side, that\u2019s just pure variability. There really isn\u2019t any causation that you can point to there nor any reason why we should expect that to repeat.","And on the Disability side, how much of it is because you put in this new systems process that you missed some of the claims expense from earlier periods or maybe I\u2019m misunderstanding what it is?","David Cordani","Good morning. It\u2019s David. Let me try to paint the picture on your various questions for both the Disability and Life piece. First, just to frame our group insurance business has been a strong and consistent performer. We recognize we\u2019re having an audit pattern year. We understand that and as I noted in prepared remarks, we are taking specific steps to improve that.","Let me talk about Disability first and then Life and I think I\u2019ll put all your questions into that context. From the Disability standpoint, first, we made operating changes to our business processes. Very importantly, these are not systemic changes or changes in technology. These are business process changes starting at the first quarter of this year with a goal of improving our customer service, driving further efficiency and effectiveness over the long-term, all while complying with a merging regulatory best practices.","It\u2019s clear that the operational disruption is more significant and prolonged than we have planned for. Importantly, our customers continue to see good strong service. However, as we noted, the financials have suffered. We\u2019re already seeing improvement in the patterns as we go through the second quarter. So we see the pattern improving and expect to continue to see that improve throughout 2016 and as we step into 2017.","These are not catch-ups for prior year claims. Don\u2019t think about it that way. It\u2019s operational process changes of meaningful magnitude and we\u2019re already seeing improvements to the pattern and we will see improvements throughout 2016 and into 2017.","Relative to the Life book, your basic hypothesis is right, we have a meaningful book that over time has performed very well. Unfortunately, from time to time our Life book of business has a temporary dislocation or spike. And the second quarter of this year was one of those years. Order of magnitude, operating-wise in the quarter, about $45 million after-tax; it\u2019s important to note that the claims did settle back, generally speaking, within historical patterns by the end of the second quarter.","Additionally, as you\u2019d expect, we conducted a variety of detailed analysis to see if there were any other unique causes to the pattern we saw a spike, and we found none. Also, as we noted, we completed reserve study in the second quarter, that resulted in a reserve strengthening of about $17 million after tax. So when you think about Life, taken together from an operating standpoint and from the reserve standpoint, altogether a little more than $60 million after tax.","So net-net, clearly not happy with the results, we clearly believe they\u2019re temporary. Life will recover more quickly for the reasons you stated and disability will continue to recover throughout the remaining portion of 2016 and into 2017. As to the latter part of your question, you could think about the current year change in the outlook. It\u2019s split roughly 50-50 between the two lines of business.","Matthew Borsch","Okay. Thank you for all that. I appreciate. And just so I understand though, that the - as you made these process changes, did that result in a lower level of catching disability claims that should have been remediated differently. And so in seeking to improve things it\u2019s gotten temporarily worse, is that the right way to think about it?","David Cordani","Matthew, a way to think about that is, as you change the processes, and as I noted in my prepared remarks, more upfront and broader medical reviews, what you have is essentially, we\u2019ve triggered a temporary environment of longer claim durations and higher inventory, which we will work down throughout the residual part of this year as I noted. And we\u2019re already starting to see improvement relative to that.","Matthew Borsch","And last question if I could, on the Medicare sanctions. Any outlook there, any - are you hopeful that you will get them resolved? Are you optimistic you\u2019ll get them resolved before open enrollment?","David Cordani","Yes, Matthew, relative to the CMS audit, our team continues to work to resolve the issues and to drive the sustainable operational improvements that are necessary. As per timing, as you might frame there is three variety of alternatives here. We can get it remediated and validated before AEP, Annual Enrollment Period. We can get it remediated and validated during the cycle, or thoroughly we can get it remediated and validated after the cycle.","Our team clearly understands the importance of that, but our broader objective here is to ensure that we successfully remediate all the issues and create a sustainable environment on a go-forward basis. And we will manage the next several months to make sure we\u2019re within the right position.","Matthew Borsch","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Matthew. Our next question is from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Justin Lake","Thanks, good morning. I just to want to follow-up first on the Disability & Life business, David, you talked to this segment creating an earnings trajectory opportunity going forward, so looking for some more color here. What\u2019s a reasonable expectation in terms of the trajectory back to historical margins and earnings power in this business and how does that happen? Is it simply like you said, fixing the claims processing issue and Life reverting to normal? Or do we have to do some meaningful re-pricing here?","David Cordani","Justin, good morning, your former conclusion is proper. We believe that the Life results will return to historical patterns and the Disability results, we continue to start seeing improvement throughout the second quarter and it will continue throughout the course of the year.","Long term, we believe the - both the growth and earnings and margin profile of the business remain intact. We have work to do to establish that. And we will do that in the second-half of this year with a positive trajectory and continue that trajectory into 2017.","Justin Lake","So, David, I mean, on the margins. I mean, your margin is going to be 1% to 2% this year on a business that historically been closer to 8%, let\u2019s call it. So can you just give us some color in terms of how should we think about that trajectory back to 8%, I mean, can you get half-way there, the 4% to 5% next year on the way back to 7% to 8% in 2018. Do you expect to get all the way back there next year? I mean, just can you help us with some visibility there?","David Cordani","Yes. Justin, first and foremost just to make sure, we are clear on your first part of your initial question. I want to underscore this is an operational problem in disability, not fundamentally a pricing problem for us relative to the book of business. Hence if you, bring it across to your margin question, I think, a way to think about it is this arguably presents the single largest earnings step up opportunity for us, as we step from 2016 to 2017. So if you think about the headwinds and tailwinds, this is our number one tailwind.","We expect to see meaningful improvement. We\u2019re not going to give you 2017 guidance at this point in time but away punctually that is as I noted in my prepared remarks, we expect to see the life business recover more rapidly. We expect to see the disability business continue to improve its performance throughout 2016 and into 2017.","So for that, I would ask you to think about an ongoing improvement trajectory for the disability of portfolio flow through the second-half of this year, as well as into 2017. Giving us a good run rate, as we step out of 2017 into 2018.","Justin Lake","Great. And then, just my follow up on capital deployment, I think, investors would love to hear anything you could share with us plan B, if this deal doesn\u2019t go through. I mean, I know the focus on getting the deal done. But it\u2019s not. You\u2019re going to have with a breakup fee something like $4 billion of cash that deploy and in under lever balance sheet. Can you share with us any thoughts there?","David Cordani","Sure. So first and foremost, we have a long and clear track record of strong capital deployment and capital management. And it\u2019s part of that. We understand the importance of not letting surplus capital lie idle for any length of time. Our priorities remain clear and the same for supporting our business. Second strategic M&A and third returning excess capital to shareholders.","To your point, we fully recognize the tremendous both capital as in free cash flow, as well as capital through balance sheet leverage flexibility we built over the last several years. In the event, taking your statement that the DOJ process is not successful. Our view is that as we look towards the second-half in later part of 2017, we would have $5 billion, a bit more than $5 billion of deployable cash plus a balance sheet. In the current situation, it sits at about 27% leverage.","Our view is that normal course of business, we could add 10 points to that leverage. For strategic M&A, we could add 15 points to that leverage. So taking together truly tremendous value creation opportunity for shareholders in the event the DOJ process is not successful. We fully understand that and would expect to responsibly deploy that.","Justin Lake","Great thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you Justin. Our next question is from Josh Raskin of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Joshua Raskin","Thanks. I guess, I\u2019m just a little confused as to why this is also temporarily right. It sounded like last quarter, maybe let\u2019s start with disability in life. It sounded like that was considered a timing issue it doesn\u2019t sound like - it sounds like it\u2019s gotten materially worse. So I guess, I\u2019m just confused to why a process change would increase your actual incidents or is it not incident. It\u2019s just the inability to manage down these claims quickly. And I guess, I\u2019m just curious why that disappears so fast and then on life business, it doesn\u2019t sound like we kind of know the driver of the spike. So I\u2019m curious why your confident will get better.","David Cordani","Good morning Josh. Very fair. So we\u2019ll take in a reverse order. Let\u2019s take life first. If you look at the life industry, players in the life industry unfortunately, it\u2019s the nature of the book of business will experience short-term temporary spikes or dislocations in cost. It transpires ideally, we like that not to happen, because you want consistent predictable environment.","So to add to your point, as we noted that spike to a place in the early portion of the second quarter and as I noted in my prepared remarks and my comments, we saw a reversion of the life pattern within historical ranges towards the later part of the quarter. Secondly, we did a significant analysis to try to determine whether or not there were any unique drivers of that, as you would expect. And we didn\u2019t find any, and thirdly, there was a reserve study which was triggered a $70 million after tax strengthening, a way of looking at it otherwise it only triggered in a $70 million after tax strengthening.","Specifically, disability you\u2019re right, we flagged this last quarter. Their operating changes that we put in places we noted, the results step down meaningfully in the first quarter, as I noted in my prepared remarks. We\u2019ve already seen progress in the second quarter relative to the improvement albeit any slower pace than we would like or projected. And we expect to continue to see that progress going forward and that offset ultimately the longer claim durations in the insurance rates that we\u2019re incurring currently as well as the elevated claim inventory.","So important to know, we are seeing improvement in the disability results through the second quarter and expect that pattern to continue throughout the remaining portion of this year and into 2017.","Joshua Raskin","And David, did you say, it\u2019s a 50-50 split on the $0.90 reduction in guidance between life and disability?","David Cordani","Yes. Maybe let me try to - I did say that but I was looking at kind of where we are intra-year versus a full year. When you look at the full year pattern, I think it\u2019s a little safer to look at that is a two-third, one-third, because of the recovery pattern of the life being more rapid versus the disability pattern. What we have intra-quarter, I mean, it\u2019s a good $60 million delta in for quarter, but you have the two-thirds in the disability side and the one-third in the life over the course of the full year.","Joshua Raskin","Okay. That makes more sense. And then follow up just on the healthcare business. Could you parse out - I guess one, I\u2019m a little surprised on the CMS cost, right. You guys knew about those sanctions before last quarter was announced, so is the process more onerous? Is it going to take a little bit longer? What\u2019s causing the CMS sanctioned response cost to be higher? And then how big is your individual book and maybe what\u2019s the size of the - how much of the $0.30 is individual versus CMS?","David Cordani","Hey, Josh. I will start on the CMS piece, and I\u2019ll frame a little bit of the Individual, and then ask Tom to time to enhance that piece. First and foremost relative to our MA book of business. The fundamentals of the MA book of business continued to perform well. Very important and we\u2019re pleased with the performance both the service performance as well as the overall earnings performance of the book. You\u2019re correct, our cost of remediation is grown, we are seeking to ensure that the remediation is both completed is rapidly as possible, but also as comprehensively as possible. And it\u2019s unfortunately the case when you are doing a variety of complex bodies of work sometimes they are more complicated.","Our number one priority, though, is to get this issue fully remediated and create the sustainable platform for the growth in the ongoing performance we expect for many years to come. So ultimately what transpired is more complexity to the work, necessary to build sustainability that we want for the growth profile, we see over the long term. But the operations in the day today fundamentals of the earnings performance to the base book of business continued to be strong.","As relates to the Individual book of business, I last time to talked about the financials, but as you recall with continued to take a very focused and disciplined view to the marketplace primarily because we viewed from day one, the 2014, 2015, and 2016 would be, as we call it Version 1.0 of the marketplace, underscored by a smaller aggregate size and we initially projected, we call it a little bit of a choppy operating environment for the new marketplace as well as we projected for the industry to have more loses than not. And in hindsight, that\u2019s demonstrating itself.","So I will ask Tom to describe a little bit about the financial impact for us.","Thomas McCarthy","Josh, you are right, Individual is a small component of our business unfortunately sometimes it has more impact and we\u2019d like, particularly, it just sticking about the MCR, in fact this year quarter-over-quarter it explains most of the variability in our Commercial MCR, so small business, but shows up in some metrics that we don\u2019t like.","And if we think about the revised outlook for the year, I\u2019m not going to give specifics, but let\u2019s say there\u2019s big chunks of both driving that maybe 50-50 somewhat in that range.","Joshua Raskin","So the individual - Tom, do you have what the premium level or just a revenue number on the individual book is? I thought you guys were somewhere around 100,000 lives or something?","Thomas McCarthy","A little more than that, I mean, that is disclosed - but that all those details are disclosed in the step supplement. Now if you\u2019re suggesting that, gee, how can it have that much of an impact. If you do the math, it actually can have that much of an impact.","Joshua Raskin","Okay, all right. Maybe I will follow up with the math off-line. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, Josh. Our next question is from A.J. Rice of UBS. Your line is now open.","A.J. Rice","Thanks. Hello, everybody. I know you hadn\u2019t given your medical cost trend for the commercial before, but I think you came out and said 4.5% to 5%. Can you just comment on away from the individual business, what are you seeing there? Any buckets that are running hot or any that are particularly positive? That cost trend obviously is lower than what others are saying they are seeing.","David Cordani","A.J., Thank you, yes, we are really pleased with our medical trend results and we continue to build an very strong trend result we reported for several years as you pointed out with industry leading medical cost trends. Since most of our commercial customers are in self-funded arrangements and you recall they directly benefit from this well-managed medical trend. Our outlook has remained consistent this year with a full year trend outlook of 4.5% to 5.5% range decided. And that is in line with our 5% trend we reported in 2015, so consistent result.","So overall, we\u2019re expecting to deliver another year of competitively strong medical trends and that reflects our focus on engaging customers in healthcare professionals to improve quality and affordability of care. And I wouldn\u2019t really call out any specific major changes in the underlying components.","A.J. Rice","Okay. And then just my follow up I ask, I appreciate the comments David, you offered about the DOJ process and so forth and it makes sense that they came out with a decision to challenge the deal and you want to evaluate your options. Am I hearing you right to assume that, that sort of evaluation process whatever entailed has happened. And that now signals basically view, as we\u2019re going to play out the litigation and the interaction with the DOJ through to its conclusion and whatever evaluation was done has concluded. Is that the way to think about it?","David Cordani","A.J., yes. But so you\u2019re absolutely correct in my prepared remarks. So I indicate that we briefly step back we wanted to make sure we understood the fact statements from the DOJ and that states quite well and deeply and understand that. The bad aspect of it means we were fully engaged, continue to be fully engaged in the process. We both support our contractual obligations as we have provided. So but to continue on that dialogue to be clear as we noted, Anthem has been running the regulatory process which is consistent with the contract.","Anthem independently decided to pursue the lawsuit with the DOJ, as such we are party of that suit. We will take the appropriate steps obviously, to protect the interest of our shareholders, which includes ongoing evaluation and monitoring more options as they unfold. But we are fully engaged in the process as you noted. And we should think about that, but it\u2019s a dynamic process right. There is no static process season life and this is not a static process, but we\u2019re fully engaged.","A.J. Rice","Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you A.J., our next question is from Gary Taylor of J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.","Gary Taylor","Hi, good morning. A few questions, first, just going back to the disability segment, on disability itself how much of the quarterly, your annual premiums are short-term versus long-term disability, ballpark?","David Cordani","Follow up with that. I mean, much of our short-term disability business is so oriented, but we\u2019ll follow up with you exactly.","Gary Taylor","Okay. And you talked about an improvement in the segment, particularly in the life and the near term and obviously the implied guidance for the second-half of the year and the segment is much better than the first-half, then you talked about improvement in the 2017. Is it fair to say that if we take I believe the implied guidance for disability might for the second-half of the year is $37 million to $77 million.","If we annualize that is it fair to say that would be the low end what 2017 should be. Given that, you think there is an improving trajectory.","David Cordani","Gary it\u2019s David. Again, we\u2019re not providing 2017 guidance. We have expectations for ourselves to dramatically improve the result as we step into 2017. We think, we have the opportunity to obviously to see the life results revert to historical patterns more rapidly and the disability pattern will continue to improve overtime. I don\u2019t want to validate your numbers again, because we\u2019re not providing 2017 guidance, but as I mentioned to Justin, this represents the largest contributor or largest tailwind. And as when we step from 2016 to 2017 and we hold ourselves to the higher expectation to achieve those numbers a better.","Gary Taylor","Two more quick ones if I could. Could we just go back to, you keep saying this disability which is an operational, as you\u2019ve driven by these medical claims or views. So are you saying that you\u2019re doing more detailed longer duration reviews and it\u2019s causing to pay out more days of disability than you believe it will be on these claims in the future. And\u2026","David Cordani","Gary, at a macro level the picture you carry is I think, directionally correct. Just stepping back and add to that. So more resources, clinical resources, specialties and other wise, added to the front end of the processes to enable more comprehensive reviews than even was being done before, over long-term enhances, further enhances customer experience, further enhances the efficiency of the overall process. And it is aligned with emerging regulatory best practices for the space. Over the immediate term, the description is some of the effect that you may reference to. And we are rapidly working to improve those results, day in, week in, month in, month out.","Gary Taylor","So these are self-inflicted delays, basically, you are trying to fix.","David Cordani","That is absolutely correct.","Gary Taylor","And last question. I think in response to Justin, you talked about taking leverage potentially into the mid-30s if the Anthem deal doesn\u2019t move forward on possibly other strategic M&A, or just conceptually willing to do that. What about for share repurchase? How much would we be willing to move debt to cap for accelerated share repurchase, or is the same ballpark in the scope of possibilities?","David Cordani","Gary, the - we don\u2019t parse in terms of which of the deployment components we would prioritized moving leverage up or down for, other than as I noted in the prior comments, strategic M&A enables your from our point of view to temporarily expand leverage at even further. I think your broader point and to reiterate, we recognize that is there is in unsuccessful DOJ process, as you go into the latter part of 2017, we would have ordered magnitude $5 billion or $5 billion plus of deployable cash.","A current environment of leverage situation of approximately 27% in the ability to add at least 10 points to that in the various scenarios we identified. And share repurchase would be a part of the calculus we would be looking to. Net-net under a variety of scenarios the opportunity to create significant shareholder value off of both the cash-on-hand and leverage capabilities.","Gary Taylor","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, Gary. Our next question is from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Kevin Fischbeck","Great. Just wanted to clarify a question earlier, when you were saying the breakout in group and life being one-third, two-thirds for the year, that\u2019s on the $0.90 you are saying, basically that $0.30 is life and $0.60 is disability. Is that what you were saying?","David Cordani","Correct.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. And then I guess just wondering if you\u2019ve seen - obviously you\u2019ve had the deal out there for a year now. Wondering if you\u2019ve seen any impact to the core business at all from the customer perspective, either on retention or as you go out to bid? Is this creating an overhang as far as your ability to retain or to win new business?","David Cordani","Hey, Kevin, good morning. This is David. So broadly speaking our team has done an outstanding job of ensuring we first and foremost are delivering on our promises to our existing customers, which is job one, hence, our client and customer retention levels have been very strong, and we are pleased and proud with that.","Second, we expected as we announced this deal that given the long regulatory timeframe we anticipated that over that timeframe as it continued to extend, it may cause a bit lower traction on new-new business. And I say new-new purpose, because in between that is new business off of existing relationships. So point one is our retention has been strong and outstanding due to great service deliver by the franchise, and high attention, and then support from our customers and clients, and we obviously work very hard for that every day.","Two, we\u2019ve been able to successfully expand relationships throughout our various lines of business. And three, we have been able to grow new relationships. Net-net, our covered lives are up and our portfolio penetration is up. We have seen some impact of a little lower close ratio in some situations where some clients want to weighted out, but I would say that\u2019s the smallest portion of the overall equation. When you put a bow around the whole package, we are pleased to have achieved our revenue outlook thus far for the year and is aided by that very strong retention rate in the strong expansion relationships.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. And then just I guess on the MA side of things, I guess we\u2019ve obviously seen how the MA membership has gone from an attrition perspective from quarter to quarter with the sanction. Is this way you will think of - if we assume a negative outcome, and you are not able to get this fixed by the open enrollment period, would that transition from kind of Q4 to Q1 be a similar drop in your view? Is that the way to think about it, or would you think that that would be a more disruptive time period around membership?","David Cordani","So Kevin, let me just make sure I understood your hypothesis for starters. A way to think about 2016 is we started the year with good covered life growth for MA mid- to upper- single-digits. And we expect that to flatten out throughout the course of the year due to the non-ongoing enrollment and disenrollment pattern that would unfold. Therefore, under your hypothesis, if we are not active in any dimensions of the annual enrollment period, obviously we wouldn\u2019t be picking up the new lives and you\u2019d have attrition throughout the course of the year.","And I would actually think about it is that - attrition throughout the course of the year, not attrition in any one might - obviously the annual enrollment period is an important marker that would manifest itself. So we\u2019ve seen continued attrition throughout the course of the year coming more to a flat result at the end of 2016, in terms of net life growth, and there would be arguably stated a similar pattern overall for 2017 in the event of your scenario, but we wouldn\u2019t be starting with step-up point that we started up for 1-1-2016.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. The question is, if you have to go through an open enrollment period where you can\u2019t get new lives and there\u2019s going to be theoretically some shopping, I was just trying to understand how persistent you think your core business would be in that scenario over the next year. Is it just a situation that we always lose, I don\u2019t know, 5%, but you always gain 15%, so you are growing 10%?","Now you would be entering an open enrollment period where you lose 5% and there\u2019s no ability to pick something up. I just wasn\u2019t sure if that Q4 to Q1 was going to be a more disruptive drop point or if that membership is just more sticky?","David Cordani","I think, first and foremost your normal kind of pattern of assumptions is more direct. Secondly, our retention rate in this portfolio tends to be quite strong, especially when we have relationships that are onboard for over one year in our MA book of business. Those relationships become very well established with our physician collaborative model and have a high retention, and we would expect to carry a very strong retention rate in, but your notion relative to not having the new business would be an offset. I wouldn\u2019t view any unique event would transpire beyond that.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, Kevin. Our next question is from Ralph Giacobbe of Citi. Your line is now open.","Ralph Giacobbe","Great, thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to clarify, yes, last quarter, in the release, it was cited that the timing of reserve review on the disability and life would move from second to third quarter, and I think I heard you say you did do the review this quarter? Is that fair, so there shouldn\u2019t be risk of further adjustment? And then a couple of times, David, you\u2019ve cited emerging regulatory processes. Just hoping maybe you can provide some color on exactly what that is.","Thomas McCarthy","So Ralph, it\u2019s Tom. I will address the reserve study dynamics first. So we completed this quarter with a life reserve study and that study covers in fact claim development factors interest rate assumptions, all the normal things you look at life businesses.","What we highlighted last quarter was that we\u2019re deferring a disability claims study to later in the year given the changes in the visibility claims process. And in fact, we haven\u2019t completed that study. We still are completing it - expecting to complete it in last half of the year. And of course, we won\u2019t know the results of that study until it\u2019s completed. But I would just observe to maybe get to the heart of your question, that given the current environment any significant impact from that study one way or the other seems unlikely.","David Cordani","Relative to the regulatory question. First, we have a very differentiated disability model, despite the earnings issues we\u2019re confronting in 2016. Like all of our businesses, they all come under a variety of regulatory forces. Relative to the disability space, specifically emerging best practices are pointing towards more. While we always have had upfront medical resources. For example, emerging best practices are pointing towards more upfront resources, more user specialists, more comprehensive physical examinations upfront for a broader variety of scenarios. And those are illustrative of the types of changes we are putting in place, as we see where the regulatory direction is going. And we want to ensure that we continue to position this book of business as an industry leader, as it relates to the disability management process and the disability productivity management process. So those are illustrative of some of the right type of emerging regulatory patterns.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay. All right. Fair enough. And then, just in terms of the financial flexibility that you cited, I think, commentary last quarter in the release that was unlikely that you\u2019d make sort of further repurchase above and beyond what you had done through I guess, May, and make any incremental this quarter. That language wasn\u2019t sort of in the release this time around. I guess, I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019re open to or maybe remind this what you can do in terms of share repurchase at this time. And how we should think about sort of capital deployment if there is a challenge that goes into next year? Thanks.","David Cordani","Sure. Ralph, so we carry the flexibilities. You asked a broader question on capital deployment. You asked relative to share repurchase. Let me take the other dimension of it. Under the merger agreement, we have the ability to be active from an M&A standpoint. There are mutual limits going in both directions. The mutual limits point toward in aggregate over the life of the contract $600 million and a transaction cap of $200 million.","So transactions up to $200 million and cumulative transactions up to $600 million, that mutual going in both directions, relative to share repurchase, there are also limits in both directions specific to us we have about $725 million of capacity left under those contractual obligations. At this point in time, again with the transaction pending we view it as less likely that would be the significant share repurchase over the immediate term horizon. But we do have the capacity to do so under the merger agreement and as I noted, approximately, $725 million of remaining capacity.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you Ralph. [Operator Instructions] our next question is from Andrew Schenker of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Andrew Schenker","Hey, thanks. I just wonder, if you could just help us maybe try to quantify in total the CMS audit costs incorporated in 2016 earnings, including the new assumptions you heighted today. And then just how we should be thinking about some of this cost. I mean, how much of them are one-time just preparing for the audits versus what are really actually now ongoing cost that we needed to strengthen your MA systems to help your positioning there? And then how is that reflected all in your bids for next year, assuming the sanctions are lifted. Thank you.","Thomas McCarthy","So Andy, its Tom. You\u2019ve got couple dynamics going in there. First, we are spending more than we expected on CMS audit remediation costs. And the total spend in the second quarter was about - or year-to-date was about $30 million, at second quarter it was about $30 million after tax. So that kind of gives you an order of magnitude of the size of the total spend we\u2019re talking about. So we haven\u2019t mentioned exactly the overall outlook for the year. But you can - based on that spend, you can expect a sizeable amount. Some of that probably does end up back in the run rate and at least in the near term as we institute more robust processes. But much of that is one-time spend to get us to the remediation period. And I don\u2019t think, we\u2019ve seen any significant impact on our bid related to that dynamic.","Andrew Schenker","Okay. And then, for individual, once again always with the caveat that I understand it\u2019s a small portion of your business, but a volatile one. I mean, can you maybe talk about how you did position that book for next year? It looks like you are maybe actually entering a few new market. So do you think total costs or profitability for individual is actually going to approximately decline next year. Given new market entrants or given any repositioning in existing markets? Could we see overall profitability for individual actually go up next year. Thank you.","David Cordani","Andy, good morning. It\u2019s David. So as for the results just for your context as we noted we continue to experience losses within elevated impact in certain markets. Important to know, we have seen the performance of what we look at as our newest offerings as being markedly better than the traditional offerings that we had placed in the market and many have in the market. So those new offerings are aided or driven by very focused and aligned collaborative delivery system models. And those are performing better. As well as in 2017, you\u2019re right. First and foremost at this point we plan for and expect to continue to participate. We\u2019ve taken posture to position ourselves in a limited number of new markets, where we have the ability to put in place those aligned collaborative delivery system models. And also relative to the disruption we\u2019re seeing from a results standpoint, we continue to have active engagement and dialogue with both CMS and state agencies to ensure that we are mutually enabled to be focus on those areas and programs, where we could address this sustained value which really are pivoting of those collaborative delivery system models.","We would expect to improve our performance year over year, but this is a volatile marketplace which is why we kept it is a relatively speaking small portion of our portfolio.","Andrew Schenker","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you Andy. Our next question is from Christine Arnold of Cowen. Your line is now open.","Christine Arnold","Hey, I\u2019m still confused on the disability situation. I\u2019m just not a disability expert. I would think that if you are doing more upfront examinations and medical specialist intervention, you\u2019d find people who really aren\u2019t qualified for the disability benefit, maybe the fakers and the frauders. So how - I don\u2019t understand how the upfront medical management improvement is actually resulting in an increase in disability claims.","David Cordani","Christine, good morning. It\u2019s David. So as they indicated, as we put these process changes in place to be clear and obviously we expect the net result of it to be on improved outcome. Half of a book of business that has generally and consistently delivered industrial-leading productivity and financial performance in part for some of the hypothesis you make reference to, to make sure we\u2019re more pinpointed, even more shortly pinpointed in terms of the disability events. The result though of changing the processes, the staffing, the workflows etcetera has resulted in the temporary disruption. Not one that we like and that is more prolonged than we have planned for. But the outcome and result will be improved customer experience and improved overall efficiency and effectiveness. And that\u2019s what your comments point toward. So we are fully aligned with that.","Christine Arnold","So the fact that we have all these specialists reviewing means that for those that are legitimate they are on disability longer because we are spending more time with them, but I don\u2019t see how that reverses.","David Cordani","Christine, a different way of thinking about it is, if you think about a multi-location significant workflow change, staffing model change, operating protocol change. What\u2019s transpiring is in your question your base hypothesis of where the engagement destination is right, but in the interim, what\u2019s happening is actually in some cases more people on disability or longer duration disability events which are temporary until, we work through and finalize the process enhancements.","And as I noted, we\u2019re already seeing improvements in those patterns in the second quarter, albeit not at the rate and pace we would like them to be and expect to continue to see that improvement pattern Q3, Q4, Q1 as we go forward.","Christine Arnold","Okay. And then the government loss ratio was up year-over-year kind of more than consensus and certainly what we expected. Is that because of the sanctions? Are we experiencing maybe a higher loss ratio, because we are not getting in the healthier MA numbers? How do I think about that, what appears to be an elevated government loss ratio? Thank you.","David Cordani","Christine, that isn\u2019t a factor at all. So underlying the MCR, our focus on physician engagement continues to deliver exactly the results we\u2019d expect - quality and affordable care to Medicare Advantage customers. So the sanctions have not had an impact. The quarter-over-quarter impact is two major factors. First, there\u2019s less favorable impact from prior year development - from favorable prior year development, so we had significant favorable prior year development last year de minimis amount of prior year development this year.","Second, we are seeing some impact from the growth in the recent market expansions, and those markets, when we first did launch a market, tend to run at a higher MCR than our established markets, so that\u2019s somewhat shown up as a little bit of an increase in the quarter-over-quarter comparison. But underlying the results, so excluding the prior year, our Medicare advantage business results in the MCR are very consistent with our expectations.","Christine Arnold","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Christine. Our next question is from Scott Fidel of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Scott Fidel","Thanks. I had a question just on the CMS review and the interplay in terms of M&A, and David, saw you highlighted that you have the ability under the agreement to do some acquisitions. So just interested in terms of on the Medicare side, are there restrictions on whether you can participate in doing acquisitions, while you have a sanction in place, or is that sort of a separate dynamic?","David Cordani","Good morning, Scott. We expect to see M&A opportunities as we go forward in the marketplace. So as you recall first broadly, one of our priorities for M&A has been and continues to be seniors and MA in a broader sense of the word. We are not aware of any impediment in any way, shape or form correlating the sanctions to our ability to be active from an M&A standpoint even in the current period.","Scott Fidel","Okay. And then just a follow-up question. Just on individual, can you just give us an update, Tom, on where you are expecting the individual margin to be for 2016 in the guidance now?","Thomas McCarthy","Scott, I don\u2019t think, we are going to give specific details, but you can rest assured it\u2019s going to have a negative sign in front of it.","Scott Fidel","Okay, all right. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, Scott. Our next question is from Chris Rigg of Susquehanna. Your line is now open.","Chris Rigg","Good morning. Just wanted to come back to disability quickly here. Historically, you would guide by segment and I guess because of Anthem you just threw out a blanket number. Clearly, you substantially overhauled the business. Can you give us a sense for what was in the original baseline, how much earnings pressure you were expecting versus the $0.60-ish we are seeing now? Thanks.","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","One moment participants. We are just experiencing a technical issue.","Chris Rigg","Hello.","David Cordani","Again, apologize, it sounds like we temporarily had a line issue.","Chris Rigg","Hi, David. Chris still here. Can you hear me?","David Cordani","If you don\u2019t mind starting over your question, unfortunately the line blanks out for period.","Chris Rigg","Okay, yes, I just asked what was in the original baseline for disability and life given you didn\u2019t provide guidance by segment. How much pressure were you expecting because of the overhaul of the disability business in the original outlook versus the $0.60-ish of additional pressure we are seeing now? Thanks.","David Cordani","Yes, so, Chris, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful to reconcile in detail. But a way to think about it is, and we tried to be very clear both in the press release and our comments today, you could think about, as we step from the first quarter results to this quarter, taking everything into consideration for the impact of the Disability business and the Life business, we noted a $0.90 change for the full-year to our EPS outlook.","And to the prior comments, we indicated - you could think about that as approximately driven by two-thirds of the Disability portfolio and one-third by the Life portfolio.","Chris Rigg","Okay. But just to - Sorry to come back to this, but were you originally expecting earnings in the Disability segment to decline in 2016 relative to 2015?","David Cordani","We have not provided segment outlook for you. But as we stepped into the year, our expectations stepped down from start of the year through the first quarter. We knew we had operational changes. And as I noted in my prepared remarks, it is clear that the magnitude of the impact and the timeframe to remediate is longer. So we understood we are putting those processes in place. We believe we made provisions for that. But the impact is, order of magnitude is significant to that.","So I think the, A, understanding, we knew we\u2019re making the process changes; B, put some provisions forward for that. But at the end of the day, the most important part for you to think about is that $0.90 impact for the year as we sit today, with the majority of that and two-thirds of that were specifically being driven by disability.","Chris Rigg","Okay, I\u2019ll leave it there, thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Chris. Our next question is from Ana Gupte of Leerink Partners. Your line is now open.","Ana Gupte","Yes, thanks, good morning. So I was trying to figure out your normalized margins and your outlook for some of your segments. And on the Medicare segment, I think you said that the development issue or the lack thereof is not because of the sanctions. I think you are running at fairly low single-digit margins now after a huge amount of margin-compression post the HealthSpring acquisition. Might we still think of your ability to expand margins into next year or have these sanctions and the claims audit process or anything there CMS is asking likely to put some more pressure there or at least leave your margins flat from where they are right now?","David Cordani","Good morning. It\u2019s David. So, first and foremost, the core MA business, absent the step-uping cost for the MA sanctions activity is performing well; two, as we look to 2017, to the core of your question, we would expect to improve margins, in part driven by the run-off or absence of the sanction costs; and three, maybe broadly inferring your questions, we continue to look at this as attractive in both growth and earnings segment, from the ability to both grow it and have attractive margins over time, as we leverage the proven physician engagement models we have.","Ana Gupte","Okay, great. Then next, the other segment that\u2019s really a big growth segment is your Select segment with the stop-loss. And there was a change in the national definition originally to 100 they then got back from that. Certain States still do it, but maybe they are putting some restrictions on small groups that are trying to do ASO plus stop-loss. How do you see this playing out and might you still see double-digit growth in that segment from a membership perspective on an ongoing basis?","David Cordani","Yes, Ana, thank you. First just to define for everybody\u2019s benefit, when we talk Select segment for our company, this is for employers with 51 to 250 employees, so the over 50 marketplace. We have focused on bringing innovative, transparent, both engagement and incentive-based models. And over time, our results here have been tremendous, not just from a growth standpoint, earnings standpoint, but from the value we deliver back to those employers and employees by having those aligned models.","As for results, we yet grown again this year, our customer base and the pattern, at least on a year-to-date basis, is similar to last year\u2019s pattern. And to core of your question, we continue to see this as an attractive growth market as employers in that space continue to look more aggressively toward alternatives that again are transparent and aligned and these programs are performing well and we\u2019re excited and optimistic about the future for this business.","Ana Gupte","And then finally, just one follow-up on the individual, if I may. What\u2019s the pressure on continued on off-exchange? I recall you had something in the first year of Obamacare, or is this now on-exchange business, so the claims experience is coming in ahead of your expectations?","David Cordani","Well, Ana, we\u2019re seeing pressure both in the on-exchange ACA compliance and the off-exchange ACA compliance.","Ana Gupte","And you expect both?","David Cordani","Expect both, meaning our assumption for the remaining part of the year, yes. And as we noted before those programs that have the most advanced models with the physician lines collaborative are performing better. And our expectation is to position as many markets as we\u2019re going to be in with those models into 2017.","Operator","Thank you, Ana. Our next question is from Peter Costa of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Peter Costa","Thanks. Help me with my math here a little bit. I think you talked about the Life business having $62 million in charges in the quarter. So that got like $0.24 and then Disability, you said $0.60 for the year. So if it\u2019s going to improve through the year it\u2019s at least $0.21 this quarter. And then, CMS you described is about a $0.12 problem, so all told, little over $0.60 in pressure this quarter. You only missed consensus by about $0.40.","Was there some business, that outperformed in the quarter or did we just have the seasonal pattern wrong and so we missed your expectations by a much bigger amount, and then like accounting the individual business, which would have also impacted the quarter.","David Cordani","Peter, good morning. It\u2019s David. As we noted, our employer healthcare business and our global supplement or our global individual business continues to perform very well. Obviously, that performance was eclipsed by the items you made reference to. So as you\u2019re looking for offsets or the positive forces, the positive forces come out of those two large well-performing businesses with the offsets that you made reference to.","Peter Costa","And then, that would imply that there is some further negatives going on in the back-half of the year in those businesses or something you should - unless the numbers were wrong relative to before as well.","David Cordani","Peter, I\u2019d ask you to think about, every business has seasonality patterns that will capture them. So for example, in the employer healthcare business, we always have an uptick in spending in the latter part of the year to prepare for 1-1 activities and enrollment activities et cetera. That\u2019s illustration of moment of seasonal patterns in the book of business. The MORs tends to perform differently because of the high deductibility plans et cetera.","Peter Costa","Which is theoretically was already accounted for, I understand that. But I\u2019m trying to figure out if there is something incrementally negative in the back part of the year in those other businesses that wasn\u2019t laid out.","David Cordani","Simple answer is no.","Peter Costa","Okay. And then, just as part of that, if you don\u2019t mind. Relative to the CMS audit have you started to change your marketing plans at this point. If you\u2019re not yet approved, there is going to be a point where you have to start marketing. And we\u2019re getting towards. So is there any impact at this point in terms of your marketing plans for seniors?","David Cordani","Peter, obviously, a very important point you raised. We\u2019re quite cognizant of the timing of the decision criteria, et cetera. And our team is poised to be able to dynamically manage that as the next 30 day window unfolds in front of us and we\u2019re prepared to make whatever trade up decisions we need to make as our final judgment around the enrollment cycle unfold.","Peter Costa","Do you believe you\u2019ll have a ruling from CMS before certainly the minimum amount of time for you to still be able market for next year as we\u2026?","David Cordani","I\u2019m not going to comment or speculate on CMS\u2019s conclusion. Most important piece is we are 100% focused on fully remediating and getting the validation as quickly as possible so we can put ourselves in a sustainable position. Obviously, we\u2019ll update you as soon as we have clarity and conclusions at our final step there.","Peter Costa","If you don\u2019t market what would be the earnings impact? And that\u2019s my last question.","David Cordani","I\u2019m not disclosing at this point in time. As we noted, we expect as we look forward for 2017, we have margin improvement opportunities in the Medicare book of business, in part driven by the removal of the remediation costs. And then we\u2019ll talk further as the year unfolds relative to 2017 guidance more comprehensively.","Operator","Thank you, Peter. Our next question is from Tom Carroll of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Thomas Carroll","Hi, there. Just a follow-up on the Disability side of things, will the changes being made take you back to kind of your 7% or 8% margin level or will the process, hopefully improvements being done create a longer term perhaps higher level of margins in this business than we have seen?","David Cordani","Tom, it\u2019s David. Broadly speaking, we\u2019ve been quite pleased over elongated period of times for both the intersection of the service and productivity service delivery provide the clients and customers. The ongoing growth of that portfolio of business in very difficult economic times, low interest rates, low employment or growth rates, et cetera, and a tremendous margin level, our strategic objective has been to maintain margins in line with our historic performance and continue to grow that book in that portfolio.","These investments will put us in position to continue to further improve the customer experience, as I note before, be aligned emerging regulator best practices and be in position to, again, achieve those margins on a long-term basis.","Thomas Carroll","Okay. So kind of impact the - or make better the infrastructure, but not necessarily move you to a different margin level, it sound like I\u2019m hearing.","David Cordani","I think that\u2019s a good way of thinking about it. And as we think about infrastructure as I noted before, this is not a technology program, it\u2019s a workflow and human capital program.","Thomas Carroll","Right, and then just one administrative follow-up, did you say, you\u2019d be willing to raise your debt to total cap level higher than the 10 percentage points that you mentioned for a strategic opportunity that was compelling?","David Cordani","So to be clear, we operated about 27% today, low based on historic levels, low based on our goals and objectives. Okay, we see the ability to raise that 10 points where I\u2019ll call it ordinary course of business and illustratively 15 points for strategic M&A.","Operator","Thank you, Tom. Our next question is from Sarah James of Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open.","Sarah James","Thanks for taking me in. Can you help us understand what portion of the MA annual sell-in costs are variable, something you could scale back on if sanctions weren\u2019t lifted in time for the normal marketing and selling season? And what\u2019s the timeline of when you have to commit to things like outside call-center contracting, ad-buys, print marketing materials?","David Cordani","Sarah, good morning, it\u2019s David. Broadly speaking, you should think about the vast majority of the cost and resources for purposes of annual enrollment period as largely being variable. So if you\u2019re putting them in buckets, nothing has ever hit 100%. But you should think about them as largely variable. Two, as noted by prior callers, the timeframe is rapidly coming up on us to make final decisions relative to ramping and staging. That\u2019s both beneficial that is not a cliff decision in terms of your structure, that\u2019s the variability aligned with the longitude of dial-up and dial-down.","And we would expect to be confronting some focused decisions over the near-term 30-plus-day window and how we focus on that.","Sarah James","Got it, and can you remind us how you are thinking about Medicaid? Is that an attractive business in your opinion? And is there a portion of that market that you are more inclined towards?","David Cordani","Sarah, historically, we prioritized Medicaid below certain other segments, so seniors or Medicare, expanding our global footprint, expanding our retails capabilities as examples. We have a view that over time that the Medicare marketplace would continue to move more toward, we\u2019ll use the broad term, managed Medicaid, programs within States to focus on high-risk populations where we believe we have the opportunity to create differentiated value through physician collaborative or clinical models, et cetera.","And we believe over time that will continue to present opportunities, be it organically or inorganically. So as a subset of the Medicaid world as it allows where we believe we could actually differentiated values through either clinical engagement, physician engagement or both.","Operator","Thank you, Sarah. Our last question comes from Dave Windley of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Dave Windley","Hi, thank you. Thanks for squeezing me in. So if I read a couple comments in the press release correctly, you talk about lack of meaningful prior-year reserve development in the current quarter and you say a relatively small amount or less than last year in Medicare. Does that imply that the commercial PYD was actually negative or was it just a very small number, small positive number?","David Cordani","Dave, I\u2019d think of the prior-year this way. And so in the quarter we had about the same level of favorable prior-year development in our commercial employer business this year and last year, but we have reductions in both individual and Medicare and that resulted in an overall de minimis amount for the entire company.","Dave Windley","Okay. Okay, so kind of answered my follow-up. It was going to be, as it relates to trend, and, Tom, I think you commented on this earlier, but it\u2019s consistent with where you started the year, I don\u2019t think you really commented on individual buckets. But maybe you could comment on any bias within the range? Is the commercial part of the group part of that trend? I don\u2019t think you include individual in trend. But how is that biased within the range, perhaps?","Thomas McCarthy","Well, Dave, actually individual is included, but so is our broader employer business. So in the overall scheme of things individual is a smaller contribution to the trend result. And as I said, when this came up earlier, we really don\u2019t see any significant changes in the underlying trend factor in the components.","Dave Windley","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Dave. At this time I would like to hand the call back to Mr. David Cordani for closing remarks.","David Cordani","Thank you. So just briefly to conclude our call, I\u2019d like to highlight some key points. Cigna\u2019s second quarter results reflected solid revenue and earnings contributions from a Global Healthcare and Global Supplemental Benefits business, and a disappointing financial performance in our Group Disability & Life segment, reflective of short-term challenges that will improve.","The 40,000 outstanding members of the Cigna team around the globe work diligently every day to fulfill our mission of improving the health, well-being, and sense of security of the people we serve.

We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedures on how to enter the queue to ask questions at that time. As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the question-and-answer session, is being recorded.","We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Will McDowell. Please go ahead, Mr. McDowell.","William McDowell - Cigna Corp.","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I am Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric Palmer, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Eric will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's second quarter 2018 financial results as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2018.","As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. Specifically, we use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and earnings per share on this same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, shareholders' net income, is contained in today's earnings release which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com.","In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements including statements regarding our outlook for 2018 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.","Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, I note that in the second quarter we recorded an after-tax special item charge of $109 million, or $0.44 per share, for transaction-related costs. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations in our discussion of financial results. Also, consistent with best practices, when we make any prospective comments on earnings or EPS outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future capital deployment or prior-year development of medical costs. Finally, our outlook for 2018 does not reflect the impact of Cigna's combination with Express Scripts which we continue to expect to close by the end of 2018.","With that, I will turn the call over to David.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Thanks, Will. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Today I'll begin by highlighting Cigna's second quarter financial results which reflect substantial revenue and earnings growth, with outstanding performance in each of our business segments. Next I'll highlight how Cigna's differentiated service-based model fueled by actionable insights and analytics continues to drive value in a dynamic market environment, and how this value creation will be further accelerated by our combination with Express Scripts.","Regarding our combination, I'll also provide a brief update relative to the overall market forces, the Department of Justice and state level review process and the integration planning work that Cigna and Express Scripts teams are advancing together. Eric will then address our second quarter results and our increased full year 2018 outlook in more detail. And then following Q&A, I'll conclude the call with a few closing remarks.","Turning to the quarter, we had exceptionally strong second quarter operating results where we delivered double-digit revenue growth, 27% earnings growth and continued industry-leading medical cost trend. For the second quarter, consolidated revenue increased by 10% to $11.5 billion and our earnings per share increased 34%to $3.89.","Turning to our business segments, in Global Health Care, we increased revenue by 12% while driving earnings growth of 34%, with strong contributions from both our Commercial and Government businesses. In our Global Supplemental Benefits business, Cigna grew revenue by 16% over the second quarter of 2017, with earnings increasing to $118 million. And in our Group Disability and Life business, earnings grew 24% relative to the second quarter of 2017, to $103 million.","I would remind you that our results are building off a very strong 2017 result. Our results for the first half of 2018 demonstrate tremendous momentum across our portfolio of businesses and these results give us confidence we will achieve our increased 2018 outlook.","Now stepping back, we continue to operate in a highly dynamic and disruptive environment, with evolving competitive, governmental and technology forces. Within this environment, significant gaps remain into how health care is accessed, consumed and financed, which places tremendous pressure on individuals, employers, governments and health care professionals. To date, much of the societal dialogue has revolved around health care expenditures which are rising at about three times the overall inflation rate. But the conversation, too often, overlooks the more fundamental challenges of improving individuals' health and maximizing the value of health services when they are consumed.","We believe that Cigna's differentiated service-based model, fueled by actionable insights and analytics, embraces market challenges, drives more effective partnerships with our clients and with health care professionals, improves health outcomes and addresses the root cause of escalating costs, and openly delivers superior experience and value for our customers.","I'll provide two examples that illustrate how in a highly localized fashion our service-based model enables us to partner with clients and health care professionals to achieve superior outcomes. I'll begin with a client example. Cigna worked with the city of Naples, Florida to incentivize and support our customers in achieving personalized health goals, measuring progress through changes in body mass index, tobacco usage, cholesterol and a variety of additional metrics. As the program gained traction, our collaboration grew to include other biometric outcome-based goals as well as Cigna's MotivateMe preventative care screening program. Today, the program includes even more extensive resources, ranging from exercise and healthy cooking initiatives to fitness challenges and health fairs, all focused to help employees meet their health goals.","Fast forward approximately three years from the program's inception, and Cigna's helped the city of Naples achieve a series of powerful health outcomes, including an annual well visit completion rate that is now nearly 35% above industry norms, and breast cancer screening rates that are 13% above industry average. In addition, Naples has realized substantial returns on investment through our population health and disease management programs, and for the past four years has had no premium increase for employees or for the city.","Let's look at the second example. This one involves a health care partner. In 2013, Cigna formed a collaborative accountable care partnership with Franciscan Central [Central Indiana]. Franciscan is a large health system of provider groups in hospitals throughout Indiana. Franciscan has embraced the use of Cigna generated data, including quarterly, monthly and daily reporting to help manage performance in critical areas of care quality and cost. We established incentives focused on a number of costs and quality measures, including 17 distinct clinical and customer experience indicators, such as in the areas of diabetes care, depression management and a variety of preventative care measures.","Through the work of our collaborative arrangement, Franciscan is delivering exceptional care with demonstrable improvements and market outperformance in a wide variety of clinical quality measures. For instance, last year, their patients with new episodes of major depression achieved medication adherence rates that were 36% better than market. And in 2017, Franciscan achieved a medical cost trend that was a full 700 basis points better than the market. The city of Naples and Franciscan Central are just two examples of how Cigna has successfully delivered industry-leading medical cost trend over the last five years and are on pace to do so again in 2018.","Now while we're pleased to be delivering these strong results for our customers and clients that we serve, we recognize that today's health care environment continues to be disruptive, with market forces continuing to push for greater affordability and overall value from care delivery and health care services. For example, pharmacy costs have rapidly grown and now compromising (sic) [encompassing] nearly 25% of overall cost equation in the United States. And specialty pharmacy, which is two-thirds of this category, is the fastest overall growth category in health care.","Further, pharmacy services continue to be a leading cause of gaps in care which are inconsistent delivery of evidence-based care for customers. Our combination with Express Scripts is directly responsive to these market forces and further accelerates our strategy of Go Deep (sic) [Deeper] (09:30), Go Local and Go Beyond. More specifically, the combination will enhance our ability to further improve affordability, expand our distribution reach and further strengthen predictability for our customers and clients, all while maintaining significant financial flexibility and delivering attractive returns for our shareholders.","Recognizing that more than 150 million Americans have at least one chronic disease, customers and clients want and need access to appropriate medications and coordinated care management programs all at the lowest total cost. Cigna and Express Scripts have individually distinguished track records with this approach, with Cigna delivering 0% pharmacy trend in 2017, and Express Scripts delivering 1.5% pharmacy trend in 2017, each leading our respective care groups.","To be clear, the health care supply chain's reimbursement mechanisms, including rebates, discounts and the like, are complex. At Cigna, we believe strongly in the need and case for change and will drive further alignment for value, simplification and transparency. Relative to the current state, Express Scripts customizes solutions to meet the complex needs of some of the largest and most sophisticated employers and health plans in America. For these clients, Express Scripts provides advanced clinical management programs, medication safety programs, specialty care access, coordination and care delivery, as well as home delivery pharmacy services, just to name a few.","Cigna and Express Scripts share the goal of ensuring customers have the highest level of access to the right medications and therapies in a clinically coordinated fashion at the lowest overall cost. And each company seeks to manage all the levers and tools to achieve this goal on behalf of our respective clients and customers. Rebates are one component of the reimbursement mechanism for pharmacy services.","Regarding pharmacy services specifically, Express Scripts passes through approximately 95% of purchase discounts price reduction to rebates back to the commercial and health plan clients. Additionally, almost half of Express Scripts clients have opted for full direct pass-through arrangements specific to rebates. For these cases, clients agree to different funding and financing arrangements to pay for the services they are consuming. This demonstrates that amongst a variety of funding arrangements that exist today, clients are able to choose the services and funding arrangements that best fit their objectives.","As we look to the future, our combination with Express Scripts, we look forward to further accelerating incentive alignment, care coordination and value-based delivery for customers and clients aided by expanded transparency. This includes a meaningful expansion of outcome-based relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers, where they are rewarded for superior clinical outcomes rather than simply for the consumption of drugs.","The next key milestone of our combination with Express Scripts is on August 24 when both companies hold their special meetings with shareholders and seek shareholder approval. As we've discussed previously, we strongly believe that the combination is in the best interest of our shareholders as it delivers immediate and long-term value for our shareholders in the form of strong EPS accretion, significant free cash flow generation and exceptional financial flexibility in a dynamic marketplace.","Transitioning through the regulatory approval process, we are making good progress on both the federal and state levels. On the federal side, we are actively working with the Department of Justice as they conduct a review of our transaction and as we respond to their second request. We will maintain an active dialogue with the Department of Justice over the course of the review, and we expect to be in position to certify our compliance with the second request this month.","As is customary in second request reviews, we have entered into a so-called timing agreement with the Department of Justice that, amongst other things, gives them 90 days, after we certify substantial compliance, to complete the review of the transactions. We will use that time to continue to actively engage with the Department of Justice on any questions that may arise. On the state side, we continue to make good progress where we already have Form A approvals or exceptions in approximately 40% of the states where that filing is required.","At the same time, the Cigna and Express integration teams are working very well together as we prepare to operate as a new company, and even stronger company. Tim Wentworth and I, with senior members of our respective teams, are leading the integration management office. Our 11 integration work streams are organized around the overarching objectives of approving affordability, expanding our addressable market and further strengthening predictability for the benefit of our clients and customers.","We are very pleased with the progress we have made to date. Our integration work has reinforced our shared view of the marketplace and of cultural alignment between our organizations, including our mutual focus on the needs of our customers and patients as well as clinical partnerships where we have the opportunity to deliver additional value. As a result, we have even greater confidence in our ability to create value for the benefit of our customers and clients, and for you, our shareholders.","Now to summarize a few points before I turn the call over to Eric. Cigna once again delivered outstanding results in the second quarter with substantial revenue and earnings growth. Taken together, our continued momentum across our portfolio of businesses gives us confidence we will achieve our increased 2018 outlook.","Looking ahead, we believe that Cigna's differentiated service-based model, fueled by actionable insights and analytics, embraces market challenges, drives more effective partnerships with our clients and with health care professionals, improves health outcomes and addresses the root cause of escalating costs and ultimately delivers superior experience and value for our customers.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Eric.","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll briefly review key aspects of Cigna's second quarter 2018 results and provide an update to our full year outlook. I'll also discuss our capital position and free cash flow generation which remain very strong and will be meaningful enhanced through our combination with Express Scripts.","Key financial highlights in the quarter are consolidated revenue growth of 10% to $11.5 billion; consolidated earnings growth of 27% to $955 million, including double-digit earnings growth in each of our ongoing business segments; quarterly earnings per share growth of 34% to $3.89; and continued strong free cash flow and financial flexibility. Our results this quarter and for the first half of this year demonstrate continued focused execution of our strategy and underscores strong fundamentals across our businesses.","Regarding our business segments, I'll first comment on Global Health Care. Second quarter operating revenues in Global Health Care grew 12% to $9.2 billion, driven by Commercial customer growth and expansion of specialty relationships as well as premium growth, reflecting the return of the health insurance tax and underlying cost trends.","We ended second quarter 2018 with 16.2 million global medical customers, an organic increase of 329,000 lives, year-to-date, led by growth in our Select, Middle Market and Individual segments. We continue to earn the right to serve more medical customers in both risk and ASO funding arrangements as our industry-leading trend results continue to resonate with the market.","Second quarter earnings increased 34% to $789 million, reflecting growth in medical and specialty customers, continued effective medical cost management and a lower tax rate compared to 2017.","Turning to our medical care ratios, our second quarter 2018 total Commercial medical care ratio, or MCR, of 76.3% reflects ongoing strong performance of our Commercial business powered by our integrated medical solutions, better-than-expected results in our U.S. Individual business, and the pricing effect of the resumption of the health insurance tax. Our second quarter 2018 total Government MCR of 83.7% reflects solid execution in both Medicare Advantage and Part D. Second quarter 2018 Global Health Care earnings included favorable prior-year reserve development of $23 million after-tax.","Moving to operating expenses, for second quarter 2018, our total Global Health Care operating expense ratio was 22.7% which reflects ongoing investments in growth and innovation, continued effective expense management and the impact of the return of the industry tax, which added approximately 100 basis points to the expense ratio in the quarter. Overall, our Global Health Care business delivered very strong results in the second quarter.","Turning to our Global Supplemental Benefits business, operating revenues grew 16% to $1.1 billion. Second quarter 2018 earnings grew 12% to $118 million, reflecting business growth and strong operating expense management. This business continues to deliver very attractive revenue growth and margins as we further deepen our customer relationships and broaden our distribution capabilities in our targeted markets.","For our Group Disability and Life segment, second quarter operating revenues were $1.1 billion. Second quarter earnings in our Group business grew 24% to $103 million, reflecting favorable life results, solid performance in disability and a lower tax rate. Overall, as a result of the continued effective execution of our strategy, our second quarter results reflect strength across each of our business segments as we delivered strong customer, revenue and earnings growth.","Now I will discuss our outlook for 2018. We expect 2018 to be another year of exceptionally strong financial performance for Cigna. For the full year, we now expect consolidated revenues to grow approximately 8% over 2017. Our outlook for full year 2018 consolidated adjusted income from operations is now in the range of approximately $3.34 billion to $3.42 billion, or $13.60 to $13.90 per share. This reflects an increase of $0.65 to $0.75 per share over our previous expectations and represents per share growth of 30% to 33% over 2017.","I will now discuss the components of our increased 2018 outlook starting with Global Health Care. We now expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of $2.83 billion to $2.87 billion, reflecting continued strength in both our Commercial and Government businesses. Key assumptions reflected in our Global Health Care earnings outlook for 2018 include the following. Regarding global medical customers, we continue to expect growth in the range of 400,000 to 500,000 lives over year-end 2017, reflecting the strong growth we have seen across our Commercial market segments.","Turning to medical cost, for our total U.S. Commercial Employer book of business, we now expect full year medical cost trend to be in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%, an improvement of 50 basis points versus our previous expectations. As David discussed, this industry-leading medical cost trend is aided by our strong partnerships with health care professionals and employer clients. Through these partnerships, we align incentives to reward healthier behaviors for individuals, higher quality care delivery and more effective management of total medical costs.","Now turning to our medical care ratio outlook for our total Commercial book of business, we now expect the 2018 MCR to be in the range of 77% to 78%, an improvement of 50 basis points versus our previous expectations. For our total Government book of business, we now expect the 2018 MCR to be in the range of 83% to 84%, also an improvement of 50 basis points versus our previous expectations.","Regarding operating expenses, we continue to expect our 2018 Global Health Care operating expense ratio to be in the range of 22.5% to 23.5%.","For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we continue to expect strong top line growth and now expect earnings in the range of $400 million to $420 million, reflecting the strength of the results in the second quarter. And regarding the Group Disability and Life business, we continue to expect full year 2018 earnings in the range of $330 million to $350 million. Regarding our remaining operations, that is other operations and corporate, we continue to expect a loss of $220 million for 2018.","So all in, for full year 2018, we now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $3.34 billion to $3.42 billion, or $13.60 to $13.90 per share. This represents an increase of $0.65 to $0.75 over our previous expectations. I would also remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of additional prior-year reserve development or any future capital deployment.","Now moving to our 2018 capital management position and outlook. Our subsidiaries remain well-capitalized and are generating significant free cash flow to the parent, with strong return on capital in each of our business segments.","Regarding free cash flow, we ended the second quarter of 2018 with parent company cash of $1.2 billion. After considering all sources and uses of parent company cash, we continue to expect capital available for deployment to be $2.8 billion in 2018. As a reminder, in the first quarter of this year, we deployed approximately $130 million of parent company cash to repay current maturities of long-term debt, and we repurchased 1.3 million shares of stock for approximately $275 million. As previously discussed, we do not expect to conduct additional share repurchases prior to the closing of the Express Scripts transaction.","During the second quarter of this year, we announced plans to acquire OnePath Life Insurance from ANZ Bank in New Zealand. This acquisition, which we expect to close by the first quarter of 2019, enables us to go deeper in an existing geography with an expanded set of solutions and capabilities to create more value for our customers and exemplifies our continued focus on, and capacity for, effective capital deployment to drive long-term growth.","Looking ahead, our pending combination with Express Scripts greatly enhances our capital strength and flexibility, enabling us to accelerate our ongoing investments and market-leading capabilities, and to deploy capital to drive additional growth and value creation. As communicated previously, we project the combined company will generate free cash flow of at least $6 billion in 2021. As David noted, we're making good progress in our planning for the integration with Express Scripts and our work to date has reinforced our confidence in achieving the targets we have set for the combined company.","We are excited by the capabilities our combined company will have to drive continued innovation and growth while maintaining financial strength and flexibility as we deliver differentiated value to our customers, clients and our shareholders.","Now to recap. Our second quarter 2018 consolidated results reflect strength and momentum in our diversified portfolio of global businesses and continued effective execution of our focused strategy. The fundamentals of our business remain strong as evidenced by these results, which reflect strong revenue and earnings contributions from each of our business segments, ongoing strategic investments in differentiated capabilities for the benefit of our customers, clients and health care partners, industry-leading medical cost trend and high clinical quality and continued strong free cash flow.","Based on the strength of these results, we are confident in our ability to achieve our increased full year 2018 earnings outlook. We look forward to accelerating our growth strategy through the Express Scripts combination and delivering on the very attractive financial commitments we have established for the combined company.","And with that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","One moment please for the first question. Our first question comes from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.","A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks. Hi, everybody. I appreciate all the comments around the transaction, what you're doing, maybe I'll try to flesh out one other aspect. You're about six months since the announcement, not quite, but close to it. I guess if I think about what's developed in the last six months, you've had obviously the selling season for 2019 for pharmacy benefit managers, you've had the Trump administration come out at least at a high-level with some blueprint for change, which I know, David, you alluded to a little bit in your comments. And you've had this period of integration that you've been working with these integration teams.","I wonder, A, is there anything that you would highlight? It sounds like you're at least as confident as you were day one. Are there any specific things that you've learned from any of these three items that you'd highlight for us that makes you either feel better or that present modest challenges for you as you go forward? And I guess I should technically ask you, do you reaffirm \u2013 are you reaffirming the year one double-digit guide \u2013 accretion and the long-term $2.00 to $3.00 per share accretion that you think you can get out of the deal?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","A.J., good morning, it's David. A lot in that, let me try to address it. So relative to 2019 selling season, maybe a specific piece and then stepping back more broadly, and then I'll address the accretion framework. On the 2019 selling season, if you process the facts that Express put out yesterday afternoon, it reinforces very strong performance, starting with as we like to talk to a Cigna, retain, expand, add.","So their strong performance that they put forth in the second quarter with their results reinforce very high and exceptionally strong client retention levels, that's validation of value proposition delivery; expansion of services through additional clinical programs, be they clinical programs, medication safety programs, specialty programs, et cetera, and some very exciting new wins. So it portends for market dynamism where the clients continue to look for total cost, total quality value creation, which is on strategy for Express, on strategy for Cigna and will be on strategy on a go-forward basis.","More broadly, your points reinforce a very dynamic environment, and we stepped into this combination expecting and projecting a very dynamic environment, as I noted in my prepared remarks, from governmental forces, from competitive forces from the ever present push for further affordability and value, and I think some of the items you referenced reinforce that.","Within our integration planning work as I noted, our teams remain quite excited both in what we are doing but in the way we're working together; the commonality of cultural focus on customers or patients, the respect and collaboration with the clinical community, and the targeted points of innovation and value creation, and the significant amount of affordability improvement we'll be able to drive together, including clinical quality and service improvement leveraging our collaboratives, we remain even more excited relative to that.","As it relates to the environment, I, think in a nutshell, it reinforces strategic flexibility, capital flexibility, a cultural commitment to change and innovation, and partnering with the clinical community to drive quality improvement and affordability improvement. As it relates to financial outcomes, yes, we remain committed to mid-teens accretion in year one and significant accretion, as you noted, within the 2021 EPS number we put out of $20 to $21 a share.","A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Great, and maybe just a quick follow-up question. I think you're the only one, at least of the national companies, that have updated their medical cost trend outlook favorably this quarter. Any particular areas where you're seeing better results?","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","A.J., thanks for noting that, our trend results really continue to reflect the power of our integrated model and the effectiveness of aligning incentives across clients and customers and health care professionals. And as you know, we've got a large portion of our book or 85% of our U.S. Commercial customers is self-funded, so this is their money and their savings that goes directly to their benefit.","In terms of the different categories of trend, I wouldn't call it anything in particular. We continue to see all of inpatient, outpatient, professional and pharmacy in that low to mid-single digits range, overall, just seeing a bit of favorability as we've gotten through the first half of the year, and line of sight into the improved result that we put out this morning.","A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Rice. Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. You may ask your question.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. I wanted to go back to your comments about the PBM profitability. You mentioned that Express already has half of its customers in these transparent arrangements, which is a interesting data point to bring up because it shows, in your view, the fact that they can kind of keep their profitability. Do you have any sense of whether the profitability actually is the same in those transparent funding arrangements versus the ones where there is a rebate opportunity? How comfortable are you that the company isn't over-earning in certain parts of its business?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Kevin, good morning. First, specific to the macro term of over-earning, as we noted and as you very well know, Express as well as Cigna, but speaking specifically of Express, they are serving some of the largest most sophisticated commercial employer clients' health plans and, obviously, of governmental agency business as well. So you have very advanced buyers, very advanced process, whereby they value the quality of the services in the overall value equation that Express is able to deliver.","As I noted, they deliver an outstanding medical cost trend result. And if you go back and look at their disclosures from yesterday, they indicate that through the first half of this year, they're on track to deliver a better result than that. Last year's result was 1.5% trend. They're on track for the first half of this year to deliver a better result relative to that.","So point one, it all comes down to the aggregate value delivery for those clients, be they health plan clients, be they commercial clients, et cetera. Express also continues to innovate in the area of clinical programs, medication safety programs, care coordination programs, formulary optimization programs and their leadership in specialty care, all that comes together such that they're able to get a basket of services that work for clients and a basket of economics that work for Express and their shareholders.","Specific to parsing the economics, no, I can't parse the economics between a partial pass-through and a full pass-through but, in aggregate, the return profiles are attractive because the returns to those clients are very positive and attractive as reinforced by their outstanding client retention levels and continue to expand those relationships.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. And I guess as really the follow-up question on that, how comfortable are you in their ability to maintain their margins (34:10) (34:13)","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Look, Kevin, as we've talked in the past \u2013 I'm sorry. Did you have more in your question?","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Well, yeah, I wasn't \u2013 you were saying that (34:21) be able to do this on their own, or the fact that you combined with them actually creates a better positioning to maintain that profitability?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Sorry, you're breaking up a little bit. I apologize for interrupting you. So I don't think it's helpful to parse them alone, us together, et cetera. Stepping back, as we've discussed in the past, at Cigna, we believe fundamentally, that every business has an inherent growth headwind and margin headwind and every business must continue to innovate to deliver more value to its respective clients and customers, to maintain the trajectory or improve the trajectory. So a standalone Express Scripts has to continue to innovate to create more value, as standalone Cigna does, and a combined company will as well.","The exciting part is the complementary leverage of the two companies coming together. And take a concrete example: the ability to further accelerate care quality, care coordination and affordability when we're able to average 500 collaborative accountable care relationships like Franciscan that I made reference to in my prepared remarks.","So I can't speak for Express on a standalone basis, but every company needs to continue to innovate. And they have a proven track record of innovation. We have a proven track record of innovation. And together, we'll have more capabilities with which to innovate from for the benefit of clients and customers, which is why we're so passionate about, objective number one of the combination which is further improving and meaningfully so, the affordability for the benefits of our clients and customers.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Fischbeck. Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. You may ask your question.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. I guess just sticking on sort of the PBM side of things, will you be proactive in transitioning away from rebate framework? And if not, if there's essentially a force for you to do so, do you think you could sort of \u2013 I guess, and do you expect to maintain profitability or would you expect sort of some hiccups depending on sort of the timeframe that's allowed to make that transition?","And then the last piece of that is you talked earlier about meaningful expansion of clinical outcomes. Hoping you could just kind of frame that in terms of maybe where we are to what that opportunity could look like.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Ralph, it's David. So a couple points. As I noted in my prepared remarks, we are quite passionate about the need for and our drive for further alignment, further transparency, and specific to the topic at hand, accelerating the movement to value-based care reimbursement programs, in this case within the pharmaceutical industry, to pay for and reward for superior clinical outcomes as opposed for simply the consumption of drugs or medications.","So we are driving that on a sovereign basis. The combined company will drive that on an accelerated basis. We think society at large is better off as a result of that, and the highest performing pharmaceutical manufacturers will benefit as a result of that. But more importantly, individuals and employers will benefit from better quality, better cost through that lens.","As it relates to your second subpart of your question, we don't foresee or project a forced march, but we are on a journey to driving that and driving that improvement with and for the benefit of our clients and offering choice with and for the benefit of our clients. And that's the important subset. Clients want a variety of different mechanisms to work for them on their change agenda and strategy, and today we're in position to be able to do so. And the combined company will have even broader capabilities relative to that.","As it relates to clinical outcomes, I'll just cite a singular example. We know, and the clinical data supports, that individuals dealing with a chronic disease, and as I mentioned, 150 million Americans deal with at least one chronic disease before you get to the polychronic population, have a multiplicatively higher probability of dealing with clinical depression. I profiled in the prepared remarks the tremendous outcomes in the collaborative with Franciscan in terms of a 35%-plus improvement in medication adherence rates for those dealing with major new bouts of depression.","That alone is a coordination between the medical and the behavioral community and incorporating effective, highly coordinated, in that case, pharmaceutical clinical management programs is quite powerful to have the mind-body connection and get the overall quality and overall cost equation to work. The combined companies will have expanded capabilities, for example, including that.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Just switching gears for the follow-up. I know it's early for 2019 guidance, but can you give a sense of visibility around Commercial growth next year coming off of a strong 2018, and with some debate around how much HIIF may have helped the ASO business particularly this year? Thanks.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Yeah, Ralph, so big picture, we continue to feel very good about the Commercial marketplace. And just to reinforce, we have been very consistent in our view that the Commercial marketplace presents an attractive growth market through our orientation around subsegmenting in detail, understanding Commercial clients needs and being consultative to put a proper solution suite together for them, and 2018 marks another strong year for us in terms of high retention, expansion of relationships and new business growth.","We're not providing detailed guidance for 2019 as you know at this point in time, but we would expect to continue our momentum in the Commercial space and all the indicators we're seeing, relative to the way in which our value prop or our solutions are resonating in the marketplace today, continues to reinforce. We see a very attractive growth outlook in the Commercial space in 2019, leveraging our proven medical cost trend, our consultative solutions and our integrated portfolio.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you Mr. Giacobbe. Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Your line is open. You may ask your question.","Steven J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So just another question for me on the PBM. I know we're only at the early stages of Amazon entering the drug dispensing business, and Express Scripts has stated publicly, previously, that they would welcome Amazon as a pharmacy provider in their networks, and would try to work with Amazon, despite the fact that Amazon would be a competitor in mail-order.","I guess I'm just curious if you plan to defer to Express Scripts management on that subject, assuming that the merger closes, or whether you have different views on other mail-order dispensers and pharmacy networks? Let me just open the discussion here on Amazon as, obviously, it's perceived as a risk to the PBM business model. Thanks.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Steven, good morning, it's David. As we've discussed multiple times, the marketplace continues to change, the competitive landscape, the supply chain landscape continues to change and evolve. A key tenet relative to the way Cigna approaches the marketplace today and the key tenet relative to the combination is what we talk about in terms of a choice-based customer-centric kind of open architected framework, where you offer to your clients and customers multiple but coordinated touch points or access points to best meet their needs, be they retail in this case, or home delivery, be they face-to-face from a clinical standpoint, or digital or virtual delivery, be they on-site at an employer or how they coordinate it and augment it in a physician's office, et cetera. So it's a deep belief set within the way we run our business within Cigna.","And I think, to your point, that you referenced relative to Express' comments, it's reinforced there as a open-mindedness and a relentless pursuit to explore options that increase value for your customers and clients, even if it's disruptive to your current model, your need to continue to innovate relative to that. So we take that same open-mindedness relative to having the multiple modalities, open architected and being open-minded and being a differentiated partner of choice. So we have a similar point of view relative to that.","Steven J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Valiquette. Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Your line is open. You may ask your question.","Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Question is just can you remind us, as you considered alternative uses of capital had you not been able to reach an agreement with Express Scripts and\/or something from a regulatory perspective would preclude you from doing that, can you just remind us what your alternate use of capital would be? And then, anything changed \u2013 I know you reiterated last quarter the $20 to $21 in EPS in 2021, any change there and\/or within the mix of those earnings? Thanks.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Josh, it's David, I'll take the first part, and I'll ask Eric to expand on the second part. So relative to more macro alternative uses of capital, I'm going to step back just to our capital use framework and reiterate our M&A priorities, which we've been quite clear on.","First, relative to our capital use framework, as you know, we have highly efficient business portfolio today and we have a successful mechanism of converting a high amount of earnings to free cash flow. To that end, we deploy that free cash flow or discretionary capital in ensuring the businesses have what they need to grow, and fueling our innovation portfolio. Second, high strategic and high financial return M&A; and third, returning additional capital to shareholders with our primary mechanism being share repurchase.","As it relates to M&A, to remind you of our priorities, when we refreshed our strategy mid-2017, these are not in priority order, but they have to be stated obviously in order to be able to communicate them: further our global footprint, further our U.S. seniors capability, further our physician engagement and pharmacy services capability, further our retail base capabilities, and expand, as we describe, our state-based risk programs as we view that over time, risk programs will continue to evolve from a state standpoint.","So our capital framework remains consistent and our M&A priorities remain consistent. For example, Eric referenced in his prepared remarks an on-strategy, highly attractive financial combination we identified in New Zealand that we executed upon. Eric, I'll ask you to speak about the accretion framework.","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Yeah. Josh, it's Eric. Just on the $20 to $21, just to step back. We had established a goal of $20 to $21 earnings per share in the year 2021 as part of the combination. We think that's a really attractive result. When we developed that goal, we had a range of different scenarios in mind that could get us to there. So there's not just one scenario that built it to that $20 to $21, rather a range of different scenarios in terms of business environment, context of businesses, et cetera, and we continue to be fully supportive and fully on target to achieve that $20 to $21. Again, continue to stand behind that, and I feel like we're on track to accomplish that","Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Raskin. Our next question comes from Zack Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Zachary Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for the question. Switching topics a little bit. Could you just talk a little bit about the positioning for Medicare Advantage as we get closer to 2019, how you're thinking about pricing and having now come out of the CMS sanctions for a year, how things are progressing versus how you expected?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Good morning, it's David. First, our team, our seniors team as well as our collaborative partners, were really pleased to be back in the market for 2018. I would remind you, as we stepped into 2018, we had a high focus relative to our existing markets. We were unable for 2018 to open up new adjacent counties or new markets for 2018, and we had some counties that we had exited.","Overall for 2018, we're tracking about in line with our expectations, but with a good foundation. Importantly, as we look to 2019, we sit in an environment with a bit over 70% of all of our Medicare Advantage customers in 4-star-plus plans. We like that foundation, and we like the strong results we're delivering this year. I would note that Eric indicated, in addition to the Commercial medical cost trends and MCR strength, we had a further improvement of our seniors MCR.","As we look to 2019, our team is quite excited relative to the individual MA growth portfolio that we see in our existing markets with our collaborative accountable care partners, the ability to expand in adjacent counties, that that work is, as you'd expect at this point in time, well underway and getting back to opening a new market that is quite exciting for us. So we're very excited about the 2019 outlook, and even more so as we look to 2020 as we build on that momentum, and then get the benefit of the Express Scripts contributions to further affordability improvement for the benefit of both the Medicare Advantage value proposition as well as the PDP. So good base in 2018, momentum building, core performance in 2019 off of that 70-plus-percent in 4-star-plus star ratings, new counties to enter or new markets to enter in 2019, and then further momentum going to 2020.","Zachary Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. And apologies for asking one more pharmacy benefits question, but in one of the prior responses, you talked about in value-based outcomes working with higher performing manufacturers, can you talk a little bit how you think about that transition and working specifically with pharmaceutical manufacturers? Historically, there's probably a somewhat antagonistic relationship when you think about formulary placements and negotiations. Do you see a similar type of relationship as we transition to value-based care, or is this something that you see as being more collaborative? Thank you.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Zack, it's David. Obviously, the marketplace is going through change. If we step back, there is a singular common force that everything spins around, and that is a relentless need for further improvement in affordability, while we improve quality and service delivery. But that focus by every stakeholder on improving affordability is the centerpiece.","And in a way, you could associate your question back to a decade ago-ish, relative to the medical proposition, where the primary way in which \"an insurer\" or health service company works with the medical community, was \u2013 I'll use your words \u2013 a little bit more antagonistic relative to negotiating discounts. And as we've proven at Cigna over the last decade, we now have 500 collaborative accountable care relationships, the vast majority with integrated physician groups, but over 100 with hospital systems where we continue to build on momentum around shared alignment to deliver better value through clinical quality, costs and service quality for their patients or customers and share rewards in a different way. That same attitude, that same orientation, starting with the customer first, needs to be brought back to the pharmaceutical industry.","We have some bright spots at Cigna within our PBM where we have some proof-of-concept, value-based care arrangements, but they need to be accelerated dramatically because society at large cannot continue to pay at the current level and in the current consumption-based framework.","Zachary Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Sopcak. Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning. David, just to come back to the PBM again, Express last night talked about passing through 95% of rebates and discounts for core customers. This is different than the 90% pass-through number that they had talked about previously, post the deal announcement. It appears they added some terminology here, like mentioning discounts as well as rebates and also talked of core customers versus overall. I'm just curious if you could talk to how the 95% number compares to the 90% number in terms of rebate pass-through given all the debate on the topic.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Hey, Justin. Good morning. As you articulate the two different points of measure, both of which are correct. So an isolation of rebates alone, the 90% number, was the pop orientation. The market at large is defining it more broadly. And the economics, when you look at a total cost and total value proposition, you need to look at not just rebates because it's a piece of the equation, an important piece of the equation but nonetheless a piece of the equation, there's discounts, there's other price reduction frameworks, et cetera, that exist to get to that overall value equation. And what I believe Express Scripts did in the second quarter within the disclosure is provide some additional insights that are also more consistent with the way other competitors are talking about the economic flows, which provide again, that framework in terms of the magnitude of the, I'll call it, value creation in pass-through for clients, be they commercial clients or health plan clients, which reinforce why, in many ways, their retention rate is truly outstanding, what I think the statistics they put forth is about 98% retention of their client base and new business growth.","So yes, the framework is different but it's more inclusive, it's more indicative of the total cost and total value equation, and it's consistent with the way others in the industry are speaking about it from that standpoint. I would just highlight additionally, as we noted in prior questions and in prepared remarks, there's a variety of mechanisms that work in the way those large sophisticated commercial clients and health plans want to structure their economics, and Express Scripts has a variety of funding mechanisms as Cigna does to be able to meet their needs at a given point in time and evolve them at a given point in time but, hopefully, that helps a bit.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","That definitely does. And just the framework you talked about makes a lot of sense. The discussion of core customers, anything there, like for instance, I'm just curious if they removed Anthem, for instance, when they calculate the 95% because Anthem is obviously going to be transitioning.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Justin, as we have talked about the combination, we've talked about the accretion framework, for example, excluding known transitioning clients and customers. So even the mid-teens we talked about accretion in the first year, that excludes known transitioning clients which are obviously additive to that from that standpoint. And as you articulate, Express has been talking about their business with known transitioning customers in a separate category, because the core of the franchise is the ongoing annuity, that's the ongoing framework, that's the ongoing dynamism. So it's ongoing clients excluding the known transitions.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Got it. So the 90% included all customers, the 95% excludes the transitioning customers.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","I appreciate you rearticulating that. In both \u2013 I would say the 95%, to be very clear, is a more comprehensive measure of all discounts, all price reductions and all rebate mechanisms across their core framework of go-forward customers and clients. The 90% was a separate measure specifically and solely looking at rebates. So I think the instructive part is focus on the 95%, that's the way the industry talks through pass-through economics in the aggregate value creation. It's a more common, inclusive definition, and it's indicative of the health of the underlying book and the ongoing customer portfolio.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Lake. Our next question comes from Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. You may ask your question.","Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Sorry, here. At the risk of beating a dead horse, a couple more on the merger outlook. One, I think where some of the skepticism is focused is on the prospects for Express Scripts on a \u2013 well, I don't want to say standalone because it will obviously be merged with you, but the Express Scripts business' ability to actually grow in the next three years, albeit I know what you've assumed is a very low growth rate. That was my first question.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Matthew, good morning. I'm not sure you asked a question as opposed to made a statement, but let me try to address that. First, the second quarter results, I think, are encouraging relative to the marketplace reception to their evolving value prop and their proven innovation. So stepping back and looking at the retention and the new business growth rate is quite strong.","Two, we operate in an environment where we are rapidly approaching 25% of the overall cost equation being pharmaceuticals and two-thirds of that being in specialty pharma, with specialty pharma being the fastest growing overall category. And in some prior dialogues, we articulated that in today's marketplace, specialty pharma is about $300 billion and projected to grow to about $1 trillion of U.S. spend in the next 10 years. So the imperative relative to that care coordination, affordability and value improvement that exists today continues to grow on a go-forward basis.","As it relates to the combination, we couldn't be more excited about the ability to further improve affordability. We came forth with a strategic goal aided by the combination to deliver medical cost trend that more approximates CPI in 2021. That's a more sustainable indicator of success. We're well on our journey to deliver that. We delivered a significant step function toward that in 2017, and as Eric articulated, our 2018 results were improved to 3.5% to 4.5%, but the combined company will be able to accelerate even further improvement and affordability on a go-forward basis, and we think that resonates quite well.","On a final note to underscore, as you indicated and as Eric referenced before, we do not have revenue synergies in our $20.00 to $21.00 EPS outlook for 2021. That's all upside for us as we're able to prove an acceleration to the value prop. So we like today's base. We like the proof points relative to further improving affordability, and we're confident that, that will further accelerate growth going forward.","Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Well said to my non-question question. If I could just add, if the Safe Harbor on the rebating were to be eliminated, let's say, for 1\/1 next year, is that something that would impact your outlook in any material way over the next three years?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","So Matthew, clearly, when we talk about a dynamic market, another force of dynamism. So the current dialogue relative to Safe Harbor, as you know, being driven through the administration HHS pertains specifically to the government-based programs, MA, PDP and the like. From our point of view, a change in that in an immediate timeframe, as you articulate, does not materially impact the profitability of MA or PDP, given how those programs are designed and given how the economic flows work. However, I would note our evaluation of it indicates that it will actually increase cost to beneficiaries, not decrease cost to beneficiaries. So we're relatively cautious on that at a unilateral level.","More broadly, we do not believe that portends to be a change that will translate into the Commercial marketplace. As I noted, the large sophisticated employer clients and health plans that are currently served, they're focused on low total cost. Additionally, as we've had the discussion here, there's a variety of pass-through mechanisms that work and a variety of tools and financing mechanisms that work whether or not an employer or health plan decides for full pass-through of a rebate, as an example, or partial pass-through for a rebate.","So if there was a change in the immediate term, yes, we expect that it would change the mechanisms within MA and PDP. We don't believe it would dramatically change the profit profile immediately from those businesses. We are concerned of the impact on beneficiary costs as it would pass through, and it does not create a change mechanism in the immediate term relative to the Commercial marketplace.","Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Borsch. Your next question comes from David MacDonald with SunTrust. You may ask your question.","David S. MacDonald - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning. Just two quick questions. David, I was wondering, can you talk just a little bit about the level of enthusiasm internally amongst your clinical folks just tied to the incremental capabilities from not only Express, but also having eviCore in-house?","And then secondly, you mentioned with Express the strong selling season and retention rates, but it also sounds like the penetration level of some of their solutions accelerated pretty meaningfully. So, A, is it fair to say you have meaningfully better visibility on the 2019 Express book? And also, can you comment on the increased ability to bend the cost curve from further penetration of some of those programs?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","So, David, a lot in there. I really appreciate your first comment. Stepping back, both companies are service companies. So if you start with the framework that you're a service company, your team, your talent is mission-critical as it relates to their passion, enthusiasm, desire to improve people's lives, help people, support people, assist in navigation, and in both of our businesses, doing that in a collaborative fashion with the clinical community is quite important.","So we start from a really strong framework of a customer-patient orientation, a deep respect for the clinical community and a desire for continuous change. As such, as you articulate, as you came back to the clinical community, while it's broadly a lot of energy in both companies, our clinicians are extremely excited. And when we have our clinical leaders together in terms of the integration work streams, it's hard to calm them down and slow them down relative to the art of the possible, because the leverage effect in terms of the best of both companies to get better outcomes, in terms of what Express is doing extraordinarily well and what Cigna is doing extraordinarily well is really powerful.","The two pieces I would highlight further, you articulated eviCore, a lot of energy. We consume their services today as a client and a lot of energy in terms of what we could build on a go-forward basis. And then finally, the power of those 500 collaborative accountable care relationships where we work in a different fashion today with physicians and hospital systems, just a ton of energy relative to accelerating that.","To the second \u2013 I'd say second and third part of your equation, yes, both companies continue to make progress relative to deepening our relationships with our clients. But the deepening of relationship with the clients is not so-called cross-selling. The deepening of relationships with clients is driven by deep analytics and insights relative to needs, and then how do you design solutions that meet those needs to further improve affordability and further, to your point, bend the cost curve by improving clinical quality, closing gaps in care, driving additional engagement or care coordination with physicians.","We believe that not just the capabilities, but those nuances to how those deepening parts of the relationship and clinical programs evolve, are mission-critical relative to further bending the cost curve. And I would simply assert, based on our proof points, our own Cigna medical cost trend is heavily influenced by those deeper relationships within the integrated framework of our clinical programs and behavioral programs, and the way we work with physicians and it'll fuel us going forward as a combined company.","David S. MacDonald - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. MacDonald. Our next question comes from Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just back to the quarter and the results. Clearly, you're continuing to outpace the market on Commercial enrollment growth. Strong results in both ASO and risk, which sounds like you attributed this morning and pretty consistently, frankly, to the cost trend you guys are putting up. But if we're looking at that total Commercial enrollment being up 4% and guaranteed cost up 18%, trying to understand why you think that is. Are there certain elements of the guaranteed cost product that you think are resonating more in the market these days?","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Steve, it's Eric. Maybe just a couple of comments on that front. So as it relates to guaranteed cost enrollment being up 18%, it's up about 180,000 or so. Note, first of all, the Individual growth, as an important part of that, is almost half of our guaranteed cost curve. The other portion is the employer portion in terms of year-to-date. I wouldn't call out anything that's changed relative to the guaranteed cost offering versus our shared returns offering or relative to our self-funded offering, other than we just continue to have strong resonance in terms of the message of the integrated offering we bring to market and the effect and the power of the attractive trend that we're able to deliver and such. But again, we're pleased with the performance. It's performing consistent with our expectations and look forward to continuing to grow that portion of the business over the balance of the year.","Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you Mr. Tanal. Our next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. You may ask your question.","Unknown Speaker","Hi there. it's Dave Stablo (01:04:15) in for Windley. I won't go to the PBM but I'll stick with the Commercial here and just ask a little bit more about the Commercial MLR. So it beat by 250 basis points this quarter and that comes on top of a 230 basis point beat last quarter, and at the same time, you guys had only reduced the full year outlook by 50 basis points. So just trying to get our arms a little bit more around is there a fair degree of conservatism still in that guidance, or do you think perhaps the Street had mismodeled the loss ratios over the first half of the year?","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","It's Eric. Thanks for that. Just a couple of things I'd call out in terms of the forward component of the loss ratio \u2013 the Commercial loss ratio versus the year-to-date results. As you think about the back half of the year, the things I'd encourage you to think about, first of all, our guidance does not include the effect of prior-year development. We did have prior-year development in the second half of last year. As you know, we don't forecast that in our outlook, one. Two, we continue to have visibility into the effect and the shape of deductibles in terms of the seasonality as that plays through. Different years have different mixes of business. This year has more Individual business in the risk book, and that carries a little bit more exaggerated shape of seasonality as the deductibles all come on into the effect in the loss ratio in the back part of the year.","And then last but not least is there's the pricing effect associated with the 2019 suspension of the Industry Fee. So as we get closer to the January timeframe, we'll be taking the Industry Fee back out of the pricing, consistent with how this has been handled as the Industry Fee has come and gone over prior years, but that will put a little bit of pressure in the back part of the year as well in terms of the metric. Fully contemplated in our guidance, consistent with how we've approached the Industry Fee being a pass-through, but it does cause the metric to move around a little bit over the course of the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Two parts. The first I'm sure you're confident about shareholders approving the Express transaction as are we, but I just wanted to clarify, if the shareholders did not approve the transaction that there's no termination fee that Cigna pays. And the second part was just going back to the Individual market, given the finalization of the short-term medical plans released by the administration last night, as you think about exchange Individual business going forward, are you trying to grow that business in 2019, new markets? And do you think there's a risk of adverse selection from these short-term medical plans?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Morning, Gary, it's David. Relative to the shareholder vote, we are confident in terms of our ability to get a successful vote on August 24 based upon the strategic rationale of the transaction, all the ongoing conversation we have with our shareholders, the very strong accretion profile, the exceptional free cash flow generation, and the significant strategic and financial flexibility which positions, for both short-term and long-term, meaningful shareholder value creation.","As it relates to the transaction, the contract obviously is filed as we disclosed previously and I'd invite you to go back and take a look at the contract. Specific to the Individual marketplace, first, in our public exchange business, as you know, we've had a really consistent orientation relative to the market dating back to its inception in 2014, a focused but limited entry into the marketplace and a belief that it was going to be not profitable for Cigna nor the industry at large for 2014, 2015 and 2016, which manifested itself. During that timeframe, we were able to prove some innovations that are working for us around the way in which our collaborative accountable care partners work in that value proposition. We expected to and, fortunately, did turn a slight profit in 2017, and we expected to expand our performance both growth and profitability in 2018 and we're realizing that.","As it relates to 2019 and with the change in the marketplace you articulated, we're currently evaluating the marketplace conditions. So it's a pretty dynamic decision-making process. We continue to have a bias to participate, and we highlight the fact that, again, those collaborative accountable care relationships have been integral to enabling our value prop to work for the benefit of our customers, the Individual customers and for the benefit of collaborative partners. And again, our bias is to continue in a highly focused basis, participate in the markets in 2019, but that evaluation is going on as we speak.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Taylor. The next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. You may ask your question.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. A couple days ago, we saw the national average Part D bids, and they were down 11.5%, kind of closer to 13% if you count risk normalization. That's the biggest decline we've seen really since the second year of the program. Do you feel it's more competitive at this point in time? And how does the national average bid compare your bids relative to low-income subsidy members that you have? And what do you think is going on there with the pricing coming down as much as it is?","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Peter, it's Eric. I'll be starting, and if David wants to add anything else, I'd certainly invite him to. Overall, this is been a competitive market from the start. We've seen a nice amount of innovation and continued evolution of the structure of the offerings and things along those lines. I wouldn't call out a particular change, but would just note that it's been a competitive market from the start and continues to be a competitive market.","As it relates to the specifics of the bids and the like, actually, we weren't surprised by where the statistics came out and such overall. Our bid positioning landed very consistent with our expectations in terms of our region-by-region pull-through, and where we'll qualify under the benchmarks, and the like. We haven't publicly disclosed all of those yet. That will come out later in the year, as you know. But again, the initial read is consistent with our expectations.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And regarding Express, can you comment on their positioning, as well?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Nothing I'd comment on at this point in time.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Costa. Our next question comes from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. You may ask your question.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Yeah. Thanks for fitting me in. Yeah, David, it's a time as you see of enormous disruption right now, rebates would have thought of going away. Amazon, potentially, getting more than just into mail order. You have health systems like Northwell walking away from Express Scripts in pharmacy, and Ascension coming back into insurance.","Your competitors are doing a lot around backward integration into care delivery, but you keep talking about open architecture and your 500 collaboratives. At one point you were happy with your OptumRx third-party relationship on PBM, but then you bought Express Scripts. If something changes and you change your strategy on backward integration, does the land grab for the assets and the scarce resource issue pose a risk at all?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Ana, good morning. You paint a, I think, a pretty interesting picture relative to the marketplace and I think reinforce the fact that the competitive marketplace continues to be an environment of continuous change. Stepping back, we believe, and thus far we've proven that our partnering orientation model with the health care professionals works quite well to get the access profile to work, the clinical profile, and allow and enable the experts to perform what they do, and support and partner with the experts to create even more value for clients and customers.","Specific to your point, we are not concerned relative to a land grab or not having access, as this marketplace has continued to evolve, and ebb and flow. We are excited to have a partner-based model, a less capital-intensive model, and a more aligned model than being in competition with a subset of the delivery system partners. And if anything, the changing marketplace right now elevates the proposition of our collaboration, elevates the proposition of working with others for the benefit of their patients and our customers.","Having said that, we recognize the marketplace is dynamic. Our strategy contemplates that and is fully oriented around the notion of additional improvements and proven improvements in affordability, clinical quality, with the right service proposition, which includes a more access-friendly framework than an access-light framework. So we agree with the changed environment, but we're really positive relative to our strategic positioning and outlook.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Hey, thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you Ms. Gupte. Our last question comes from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. You may ask your question.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you. I just want to follow up here on Ana's question. So if we think about the ways that Cigna can move more into point of service, but without being capital-intensive, how is telemedicine factoring into that for you? And are there ways that you can expand your presence there that can complement some of the partnerships that you already have instead of being sort of a competitive factor the way that you thought going into a retail presence could be?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Sarah, good morning. It's David. You touch on another important, we'll call it, channel or modality. So in our model, we view \u2013 telemedicine, in the broadest sense of the word, is it evolves from, we'll call it, traditional care delivery to CARE Coaching to behavioral services and the like, as a tremendous asset and chassis going forward. And it's a mechanism where by having a more choice-based framework, I'll call it, a capital-light framework whereby one is not beholden to owning a tremendous amount of care delivery assets that you have to feed, but rather you're able to offer more choice, we see that as a positive versus not because consumers increasingly want that choice of access, but doing so in a highly coordinated fashion.","So for example I had the great pleasure about half a dozen months ago spending time with one of our really meaningful collaborative partners where, jointly, we develop some new tele-med capabilities, but the tele-med fulfillment is actually being fulfilled by them and their care resources. So it's not a, if you will, a channel of conflict for them, it's actually complementary and extending their access, and extending their brand and their reach with their patients but we're doing it together in a highly coordinated fashion and we have the data flows and the information.","So you touch on an important part of the innovation that we at Cigna see as positive and then the combined company sees as very positive in terms of our more open-architected consumer choice-based model in partnering with physicians versus an ownership model alone.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ms. James. At this time, I'll turn the call back to David Cordani for closing remarks.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Thank you. So just to wrap up our call, I'd like to reiterate a few points from our discussion. Cigna delivered outstanding second quarter operating results driven by strong performance across each of our business segments. We generated substantial revenue and earnings growth and continued industry-leading medical cost trend. Taken together, our continued momentum across our portfolio of businesses gives us confidence we will achieve our increased 2018 outlook. We believe that Cigna's differentiated service-based model, fueled by actionable insights and analytics, embraces market challenges, drives more effective partnerships with our clients and our health care professionals, improves health outcomes and addresses the root cause of escalating costs and, ultimately, delivers superior experience and value to our customers.","We remain on track from a regulatory, integration and shareholder standpoint to close our Express Scripts acquisition by the end of the year. And this acquisition brings exceptional EPS accretion, strong free cash flow generation and attractive strategic and financial flexibility as we look to the future.","We thank you for joining our call today and look forward to our further discussions.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Cigna's second quarter 2018 results review.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the question-and-answer session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Ted Detrick. Please go ahead, Mr. Detrick.","Edwin J. Detrick","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I am Ted Detrick, Vice President of Investor Relations, and with me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ralph Nicoletti, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer.","In our remarks today, David will begin by commenting on Cigna's full year 2012 results and how our clear, strategic direction positions us well for continued success in 2013 and beyond. Next, Ralph will review the financial results for 2012 and provide our current perspective on Cigna's financial outlook for 2013. We will then open the lines for your questions. And following our question-and-answer session, David will provide some brief closing remarks before we end the call.","As noted in our earnings release, Cigna uses certain financial measures, which are not determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, when describing its financial results. Specifically, we use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and earnings per share on a same basis as the principal measures of performance for Cigna and our operating segments. And a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com.","Now in our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking comments. We would remind you that there are risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations, and those risk factors are discussed in today's earnings release.","Now before I turn the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our results and disclosures. First, I remind you that we recently announced the change in our segment reporting, which became effective with the reporting of our 2012 financial results this morning. This change in segment reporting was driven by Cigna's recent realignment of our businesses in order to more effectively execute on our global strategy and better position us to drive sustained business growth by delivering on our mission to the people we serve around the world. In connection with this realignment, our results will now be aggregated based on the nature of our products and services rather than the geographies in which we operate.","We will continue to report our results through 3 ongoing business segments but under a different configuration. Major changes in our segment reporting are to report our Global Health Benefits, or Expatriate business, as part of our Global Health Care segment. And we now report our International Health Life and Accident business as the newly formed Global Supplemental Benefits segment. Our third business segment continues to be our Group Disability and Life business. And the remaining reporting segments remain unchanged.","As a result of these segment changes, there is no change to our historically reported amounts for consolidated shareholders' income, consolidated adjusted income from operations, earnings per share or shareholders' equity. And to facilitate the investment community's understanding of these segment reporting changes, we have included exhibits showing both restated prior-period amounts and fourth quarter 2012 results on the former segment basis in our quarterly financial supplement, which can be found in cigna.com.","Now moving to results for the quarter. I would note that in the fourth quarter, we recorded an after-tax charge of $68 million or $0.24 per share for litigation-related matters, which we reported as a special item. I would remind you that special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations in today's discussion of our 2012 results and full year 2013 outlook.","Relative to our Run-off operations, earlier this week, we announced that we exited this business effective February 4, 2013. However, prior to the effective date of this transaction, we are required to continue to report the results of this business. Our fourth quarter shareholders' net income included an after-tax noncash gain of $7 million or $0.02 per share related to the Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefits business, otherwise known as the GMIB. As a reminder, the results of our GMIB business are excluded from adjusted income from operations and, therefore, also excluded in today's discussion of 2012 results and our full year 2013 outlook.","Also please note that when we discuss our full year 2013 outlook, it will be on a basis of adjusted income from operations, which excludes realized gains and losses on investment results and special items. It also excludes the effects of future capital deployment, and it will be on our new basis of segment reporting.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave.","David M. Cordani","Thanks, Ted, and good morning, everyone. Before Ralph reviews our results and outlook in more detail, I'll briefly touch on our 2012 results. Then I'll discuss Cigna's perspective on the opportunities we see in the dynamic global environment we operate in, also provide an update on how our clear, focused strategy continues to create differentiated value for our clients and customers and, by extension, our shareholders. And finally I'll provide some brief comments on our expectations for 2013 and beyond.","2012 was another strong year for Cigna. We exceeded our growth in earnings expectations, driven by -- primarily by the strength of our Global Health Care businesses. This marks our third consecutive year of effective execution of our Go Deep, Go Global and Go Individual strategy, which is providing differentiated value for our clients and customers and delivering strong returns for our shareholders.","Our 2012 consolidated revenue increased by 33% to $29.1 billion. We reported adjusted income from operations of $1.73 billion or $5.99 per share, which reflects a 21% increase from 2011. At the same time, we saw a healthy increase in our global medical customer growth, which grew by approximately 1.4 million people, or 11%, to total of more than 14 million customers worldwide. These financial and operating results reflect strong organic revenue and earnings contributions from each of our ongoing businesses, as evidenced by our high customer retention rates, continued expansion of those relationships and success winning relationships, whether they are with individuals, employers, or governments.","We also added to our capabilities and strengthened our market position through strategic acquisitions, most notably HealthSpring. We are pleased with the integration of the HealthSpring business today and its contributions for 2012. We are also on track as we continue to expand into new markets to position this business for future success. Our HealthSpring acquisition is a clear example of how we are effectively managing capital to invest in our business to create sustainable customer and shareholder value.","Additionally, the strength of our 2012 results positions us with a strong balance sheet and free cash flow outlook for 2013 to further enhance shareholder value. Our capital deployment strategy remains focused around several core tenets: supporting our ongoing businesses with the necessary capital and free cash flow to operate; pursuing mergers and acquisitions and partnerships to further accelerate growth and create strategic competitive differentiation; and finally, returning capital to our shareholders.","To recap 2012, we are very pleased with our results. Over the past 3 years, we have successfully executed our strategy, and this focus and discipline have enabled Cigna to deliver strong and sustained results for our customers and for our shareholders.","As we look forward and assess the transforming economic and regulatory environment, we see good opportunities for continued innovation and growth. The demographic shifts and economic pressures are creating a search for solutions, especially in the health care sector where the need to control medical cost and provide affordable care is prompting a number of legislative and regulatory activities, including in the U.S. where health care reform is well underway. Within this environment of change, Cigna's global capabilities, coupled with our focused strategy and track record for delivering high-quality results, are enabling us to thrive.","Specifically, Cigna has the scale and experience to deliver effective solutions to developed, developing and emerging markets as we leverage our 3 critical differentiators. First is putting our customer at the center of everything we do, aided by deep analytical insights that allow us to better understand their needs. Second, we leverage that understanding and more effectively identify the right solutions for the right customer at the right time. And this is where our consultative-selling capability really shines. Our third differentiator is our best-in-class physician engagement and partnership programs, which improve quality and overall affordability.","As we leverage these capabilities at Cigna, we see 3 indisputable global trends that are creating exciting growth opportunities for us: first, shifting demographics, such as a growing global middle class and an aging population around the world; second is a growing segment of globally mobile individuals and employers; and third, a changing benefits marketplace that is focused on value-based solutions that put the individual customer at the forefront of more health care decisions. I'll briefly touch on each of these.","Around the world, we're seeing shifting demographics, such as a growing middle class and aging population, both of whom are seeking value-added health and benefit services. Cigna is pursuing these opportunities by continuing to go deep in our existing markets and selectively expanding our operations. We're also drawing on our deep understanding of these customers by leveraging our physician partnerships as well, all anticipating and adapting to our customers' evolving health care needs.","Relative to the growing global middle class, we have a strong track record in countries such as Korea, where we recently celebrated our 25th year of operation, in China, where we now have our 1 millionth policy in force. Our success in China is grounded in our ability to address the needs of the emerging middle class, and we're leveraging the strength of our joint venture partnership with China Merchants Bank. Relative to strategic expansion, we recently entered Turkey and India, where we believe the individual group markets, when coupled with our distribution capabilities, will deliver attractive growth as we position for the future. As for the aging demographic, in the U.S., HealthSpring's proven track record of differentiated results, leading customer solutions and collaborative physician relationships come together to help the seniors we serve improve their health, lower their cost and live more productive lives.","The second trend we're seeing is a growing number of mobile individuals who require sophisticated, adaptable solutions. The breadth and depth of Cigna's networks, service capabilities and locally deployed teams allows us to more effectively address and capitalize on the market opportunities presented by these customers. This is one of the areas where our consultative-selling capability plays a critical role. Our ability to meet the evolving needs of our customers and provide optimal solutions in geographies around the world uniquely positions Cigna to grow relationships in a borderless the global economy we operate in.","Regarding the third trend, we see a changing benefits marketplace. Our deep analytical insights allows us to quickly adapt to a marketplace that is becoming increasingly retail versus wholesaler oriented, underscoring the value of Cigna's emphasis on becoming a customer-focused company. This is illustrated in part by our expanding portfolio of capabilities, which inform, assist and engage Cigna's customers to make better buying and lifestyle choices.","We inform our customers through tools such as myCIGNA.com, which allows Cigna's customers to assess medical quality and cost alternatives, then review available health spending account funds before choosing their physician. We've also created services that assist our customers, including My Personal Champion, which helps customers with multiple chronic illnesses or acute challenges to navigate the fragmented U.S. health care system they face. Others tools we developed are helping customers improve their health, their wellness-related activities and actionable information. These tools are creating the needed transparency to help Cigna customers improve health outcomes and better manage their overall cost.","Lastly, we seek to engage customers with their physicians through our best-in-class physician partnerships. In the U.S., we're continuing to strengthen our physician partnerships through our more than 50 Collaborative Accountable Care initiatives that, today, span 22 states, which when combined with the HealthSpring senior solutions, are already serving nearly 1 million customers. We continue to view our Collaborative Accountable Care relationships as the leading approach to improve health outcomes, improve affordability and deliver differentiated value for our customers, all while expanding the rewards with top-performing physicians and integrated health care systems. Our differentiated capabilities, leveraged against these established market trends, create tremendous growth opportunity for Cigna as we look to the future.","Now to summarize before turning it over to Ralph. We had a strong year in 2012 that exceeded our expectations, marking our third consecutive year of profitable growth, effective strategy execution and sustained investment to position us for the future. Over the last 3 years, we delivered 17% compound revenue growth and 15% compound EPS growth. We continued to have a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, which was further enhanced this week by our agreement with Berkshire Hathaway to effectively exit the VADBe and GMIB businesses. This track record gives us confidence in our long-term outlook, which is an EPS growth rate of 10% to 13%, on average, over the next 3 to 5 years. And based on the record of success and the momentum we carry from 2012, we are confident about achieving our outlook for 2013.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Ralph.","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I will review Cigna's 2012 results and our current outlook for 2013.","We had a very strong 2012, continuing to build on our excellent track record. And I'd like to highlight several key accomplishments, specifically another year of strong top line and customer growth, successful integration and strong performance of the companies we acquired in 2012, most notably HealthSpring, and earnings per share of $5.99, representing 21% growth.","Our fourth quarter results punctuated our consistent execution of the fundamentals, which drove strong revenue and earnings growth, while we continue to make significant strategic investments in capabilities in each of our businesses. The strength of our 2012 performance provides us with solid momentum going into this year and confidence in our 2013 outlook.","Our full year consolidated revenues grew 33% to $29.1 billion, driven by continued contributions from HealthSpring acquisition and growth in our targeted markets globally. 2012 earnings were $1.7 billion, which represented growth of 27% over 2011.","Regarding the segments, I'll first comment on our Global Health Care segment. Overall, Global Health Care results for 2012 were strong across both our Commercial and seniors businesses. 2012 premiums and fees for Global Health Care grew 45% to $21 billion, reflecting strong contributions from the HealthSpring acquisition and organic growth. Excluding the effect of HealthSpring, premium fees grew 8%.","Full year earnings were approximately $1.5 billion, representing growth of 34%, driven by several factors: strong contributions from HealthSpring; revenue growth, in particular due to strong ASO customer growth and specialty penetration; favorable medical and pharmacy costs; continued underwriting and pricing discipline and operating expense efficiencies. We ended 2012 with 14 million global medical customers, representing growth of 1.4 million customers, of which 1 million represents organic growth.","Turning now to medical costs. We're pleased with the results we delivered for both our Commercial and seniors books of business. These results demonstrate our consistent track record of improving health outcomes for the benefit of our customers, driven by our effective engagement with physicians and a focus on delivering value-based solutions for our clients and customers.","On the Commercial side, we continue to deliver differentiated value relative to medical outcomes for our clients and customers. The medical trends are among the lowest in the industry. And because nearly 85% of our U.S. Commercial customers are in ASO funding arrangements, we directly benefit from these favorable medical costs. For our total U.S. Commercial book of business, full year medical cost trend was slightly less than 5.5% for 2012.","Regarding medical care ratios, in our U.S. Commercial guaranteed cost business, our full year 2012 medical care ratio, or MCR, was 80.2% on a reported basis. Excluding prior year claim development, U.S. Commercial guaranteed cost MCR for 2012 was 81.3%. In our seniors business, our full year 2012 MCR for Medicare Advantage was 80.9% on a reported basis. Excluding prior year claim development, the Medicare Advantage MCR for 2012 was 81.5%.","Moving to operating expenses. In 2012, the total Global Health Care operating expense ratio is 22.6%, which is a 390 basis point improvement over the 2011 expense ratio, primarily driven by the effect of the change in business mix associated with the HealthSpring acquisition, benefits from our cost-savings initiatives and offset somewhat by our continued strategic spending to support our near- and long-term business growth and service capabilities. Overall, we had a very strong year in our Global Health Care business.","Now I will discuss the results of our Global Supplemental Benefits business, which continues to deliver attractive growth and profitability. Premiums and fees grew -- for 2012, grew 30% over 2011, driven by strong customer retention and growth, as well as contributions from our recent acquisitions, most notably Great American Supplemental Benefits. Full year earnings in our Global Supplemental Benefits business were $148 million, representing a 48% increase over 2011 and reflecting business growth, particularly in Korea, improvements in operating expense efficiencies and favorable claims experience while continuing to invest in products, distribution and geographic expansion.","For Group Disability and Life, full year results were solid, considering the challenging economic environment. Group premiums and fees for 2012 increased 9% over 2011. Full year earnings in our group business were $281 million, which was down 3% from 2011, due to unfavorable claims experienced in the disability business, partially offset by favorable life claims experience.","Results for our remaining operations, including Run-off Reinsurance, Other Operations and Corporate, totaled to an after-tax loss of $175 million for the full year 2012. Overall, as a result of the continued effective execution of our strategy, our 2012 results reflect strong revenue and earnings contributions from our ongoing businesses, as well as the generation of significant free cash flow.","Now I will discuss our outlook for 2013. We are well positioned to continue to deliver differentiated value for our customers and, as a result, strong financial performance for our shareholders, based on leveraging our global capabilities, optimizing our diversified portfolio of business from multiple sources of growth and continued effective capital deployment.","We continue to expect consolidated revenues the grow in the range of 8% to 12% over 2012. We've increased our outlook for full year 2013 consolidated adjusted income from operations to be in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.83 billion or $5.85 to $6.30 per share. I will remind you that consistent with prior practices, our outlook excludes any contribution from additional capital deployment, as well as any prior year claim development.","I'll now discuss the components of our 2013 outlook, starting with Global Health Care. We expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of $1.43 billion to $1.52 billion compared to 2012 results of $1.41 billion, excluding prior year claim development.","Now I summarize some of the key assumptions reflected in our Global Health Care earnings outlook for 2013, starting with the customer base. Regarding global medical customers, we continue to expect 2013 customer growth of approximately 1% to 2%. Our outlook on medical costs for our total U.S. Commercial book of business, we continue to expect full year medical cost trend to be in the range of 6% to 7%, which reflects the expectation for an increase in medical services utilization during 2013.","There are variety of moving parts within our medical care ratios in 2013 resulting from changes we are making to our business, as well as changes in underlying business mix. From a pricing standpoint we continue to price to our underlying medical costs. Importantly, Commercial risk margins are expected to be essentially consistent year-over-year, after excluding prior year claim development. Based on changes to our operations and business mix, we expect the 2013 medical care ratio to be in the range of 83.5% to 84.5% for our U.S. Commercial guaranteed cost book of business.","For our seniors business, our Medicare Advantage MCR for 2013 is expected to be in the range of 82% to 83%. This range is slightly higher than our 2012 results, excluding prior year claim development, reflecting steps we have taken to better position ourselves in selected markets regarding the pending MCR floors in 2014.","Regarding operating expenses for 2013, we expect to continue to improve our Global Health Care operating expense ratio by at least 50 basis points over 2012. We would expect a similar pattern of earnings in 2013 as we saw in 2012 for the Global Health Care segment in which earnings are greater in the second half of the year due to the seasonal nature of our business.","Now moving to other components of our outlook. For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we expect continued, strong top line growth and expect earnings in the range of $160 million to $180 million. Regarding the Group Disability and Life business, we expect full year 2013 earnings in the range of $270 million to $290 million. And regarding our remaining operations, that is Other Operations and Corporate, we expect a loss of $160 million for 2013.","So all-in, for full year 2013, we have increased our outlook for consolidated income from operations to a range of $1.7 billion to $1.83 billion or $5.85 to $6.30 per share. This represents an attractive outlook coming off a strong 2012.","Now moving to 2013 capital management position and outlook. Overall, we continue to have good financial flexibility. Subsidiaries are well capitalized and are generating significant free cash flow to the parent with strong return on capital in each of our ongoing businesses. We ended the year with parent company cash of approximately $700 million. And after maintaining our parent company cash target of $400 million to $500 million and considering other sources and uses of capital, we continue to expect to have approximately $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion available for deployment. This outlook fully reflects the $100 million parent company cash outflow for the transaction to exit our VADBe and GMIB businesses. Overall, our capital position and updated outlook remains strong, and our capital deployment strategy and priorities remain unchanged.","Now to recap. Our full year 2012 results reflect the strength of our differentiated portfolio of global businesses, continued track record of effective execution of our focused strategy, strong growth in our targeted markets and customer segments. We expect the momentum from our strong 2012 performance will position us well for 2013, highlighted by: attractive growth in revenue, customers and earnings, as well as EPS growth, with the opportunity for excess cash deployment; exiting our VADBe and GMIB businesses, which has effectively eliminated earnings volatility associated with these businesses; and while continuing to target strategic investments, which will enable sustained growth into the future. Based on the strength of these results, we're confident in our ability to achieve our full year 2013 outlook.","With that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","My first question -- and I realized this is not the biggest item for you. But as we are moving towards the deadline for budget sequestration, have you reflected that in your guidance? And let me just ask, I'm sort of calculating that on your Medicare Advantage revenue, which is a little over $5 billion annualized, that the sequester would be, I guess, about $100 million on that. And if you pass through 75% of that, it would be about $15 million after-tax or about $0.05 EPS. Is that all correct? And do you have that in your guidance?","David M. Cordani","Matthew, it's David. First, as you frame the Medicare book of business, we have started -- when you think about our seniors portfolio, on which I want to go back to the HealthSpring model, is based on a model that the reimbursement structure with the vast majority of the physicians are actually tightly correlated to Medicare reimbursements. So the alignment there is very tight. That enables us to be able to flex the model as we go forward in any movement in Medicare reimbursement, point one. Point two, as you know, we have a range with any of our outlook and guidance. And point three is you should look that the range of our outlook and guidance contemplates any reasonable movement from a sequestration standpoint in 2013.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. Okay. Just on a different topic here, can you comment on what you're seeing in the ASO and risk side of the pricing environment, and to the extent you see any behavioral change in the industry worth noting as compared to 12 or 18 months ago?","David M. Cordani","Matthew, it's David again. In a macro level, I would say no change in overall market conditions, patterns and otherwise. And just to elaborate on that a bit, as we've talked on the past, our view is that the marketplace is an appropriately competitive marketplace, and we've seen no major change in pattern. I would underscore, we continue to see a high demand from employer clients for the more transparent products, health, wellness and incentive-based programs and products. That bodes well for us. But from the overall macro environment, be it ASO or risk, no major change in posture or pattern in the marketplace.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Sticking with Medicare Advantage, I was wondering if you could give us update on -- CMS data was a little tough to read. So I'm just curious how your January open enrollment membership came out in Medicare Advantage, and then maybe you could give us your expectations around the 45-day notice and anything we should be thinking about there.","David M. Cordani","Josh, it's David. First, as you frame MA and the MA outlook, as you know from an MA standpoint, the legacy HealthSpring model is predominantly focused on -- or solely focused on the individual MA portfolio of businesses. Two, we're pleased with the early enrollment data and early enrollment success we've had. I mean, we'd expect to see, in the early part of the year, enrollment in the 5% to 6% range and, over the course of the year, an overall enrollment pattern of approximately 10%. And we're pleased with that, both in terms of the overall number, as well as the geographic pattern. To the second part of your question, that you're indicating growth to the 45-day notice, there's nothing that we would expect based on our knowledge of that. On a retrospective basis, that is, I'll call it, disturbing or bothersome to our expectations for 2013. And we expect it to obviously lay out a set of expectations and assumptions for the 2014 bidding process, which, as you know, will be upon us in the near term. So good movement in overall membership outlook and enrollment for 2013, both in terms of aggregate, as well as geographic concentration. And I would say early insights relative to the 45-day notice, no surprises for '13 or early indications for '14.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So David, maybe on that 45-day notice, could you give us an expectation in terms of -- or even a range of what you think the rate will look like all-in for 2014? And then...","David M. Cordani","Yes, Josh -- sure, Josh. I appreciate the question, but I don't think it's helpful to speculate on that. As you very well know and as the market knows, we have an inordinate amount of moving parts as a country relative to the overall programs, and I don't think it's healthy to speculate at this point in time. Stepping back from a Cigna's standpoint, as I mentioned to Matthew's prior question, the core of the HealthSpring model is a tightly aligned reimbursement structure and then a shared value-creation model with the physician community for the benefit of individuals. And we continue to believe that any movement in the marketplace, based on changes in regulation or reimbursement, we will be very well positioned to compete on a relative basis in our chosen markets.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right. And I think that's one of the main reasons HealthSpring's growth rate was higher in more competitive times in MA. So that's sort of where I was getting at. I guess maybe as that -- one last one instead of that one is just the medical -- the minimum MLRs. It sounded like you guys were looking to reposition the book in front of the minimum MLRs for 2014. So I'm just curious, are you going off of sort of commercial-like definition? And what exactly did that repositioning mean? Did that mean more generous benefits, or how did you do that?","David M. Cordani","Sure, Josh. Just directionally, and to the core of your question, as you know in the way you asked the question, is the final specific regs are not punctuated. So we stepped back and we've made some assumptions and estimates, as I would believe others are doing, and using the directional guidance of the conclusions that were made for the commercial market. Taking that as a backdrop, we have a very strong performing book of business. We've taken steps, as Ralph noted in his prepared comments, in a market-by-market basis, to step forward in 2013 to prepare for the implementation of those loss-ratio thresholds in 2014. And while we're not going to go through market-by-market or our benefit strategies, you should think, in general, our approach was been to enrich -- further enriching the benefits for the benefit of our customers in those market in 2013 that we think is going to bode well for us in '13 and beyond.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess I want to go into the guidance. And just -- you guys obviously changed the presentation a little bit. Can you talk a little bit about the moving parts within the Health Care international business from when you provided guidance at your Investor Day to when you provided it now? Because it looks -- combined, the earnings there are a little bit lower and that most of the guidance range in Disability and a little bit lower of Corporate expense. Am I reading that right? And if I am, where within Health Care international -- what's the delta?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Kevin, it's Ralph. I guess first, overall, back on the guidance, feel very good about the growth that we're showing here and the range we provided, and again, just want to reinforce from the remarks David and I both made about our confidence in delivering those. Yet relative to where we were at Investor Day with the prior look, I think the way you should look at this is, first, across all the businesses, the fundamentals and the momentum that we're carrying out of 2012 into 2013 remains unchanged. So I think -- underlying that. Now when you look at the reporting side of it, I think -- first, let me focus particularly on international, which is where we had the biggest change, effectively, we had 2 high-performing businesses within our previous International segment, the global HL&A business, which we now see separated in their segment reporting, and then our global health benefits business, primarily focused on expatriates, is now part of our Global Health Care business. Both of those businesses are growing very nicely. As you could see in our outlook, for the Global Supplemental Benefits business, we're projecting strong double-digit top line growth and bottom line growth in the 8% to 22%, actually, on the Supplemental business. And then the solid growth of the Global Health Care -- the global health benefits business that's part of Health Care also is contributing solid growth. It just gets muted a little bit now because it's a smaller piece of that larger segment. But I think the key takeaways should be the fundamentals on both of those businesses remain very strong as we now report them separately within the 2 segments.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So you don't see is this guidance providing a major -- any sort of significant change versus what you did -- I think what you outlined few months ago?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","No.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then second question is on the cost trend outlook. I think last quarter, you guys had talked about cost trend being around 6% and actually kind of highlighted that maybe some costs are starting to rise, and now you're saying you ended the year at 5.5%. So it seems like a pretty big drop in trend. And frankly, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing or how you ended the year? Was it a decelerating cost trend as you exit the year? And I just want to understand that progression a little bit.","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Kevin, couple of cost questions sort of in there. Let me talk about the overall year first and then come back to the trend itself. It's -- whether thinking about it sequentially as you asked. First, overall, we came in well in line with our expectations and feel good about the overall medical cost trend and the medical care ratio on the year that was reported. And now I'm really speaking to the guaranteed cost book of business on the commercial side, to focus it. So as we entered the fourth quarter of the year, we did see us come in at the lower end of the range, essentially on the full year, again, in line with our expectations. The -- sequentially, what we saw was some -- quarter over -- I'm sorry, so sequential increase, primarily due to: one, the seasonal nature of the business where we have high deductible plans; and then secondly, we did have some impact in the fourth quarter for elevated level of flu-related costs this season, which we appropriately reserved for in the quarter. So we feel good about the overall trend. The sequential trend that we saw going from Q3 to Q4 was in line with our expectations, and we've effectively accounted for some of the uptick in utilization, particularly as it relates to the flu.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christine Arnold with Cowen.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","First, on the Commercial MLR guidance. It looks like you're guiding for better than a 200 basis point increase, yet the trend in 2012 came in lower than you expected. Can you talk about the factors that bring you to the conclusion that the MLR would rise that much?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Christine, it's Ralph, a couple of things I want to highlight. First, as been noted in my remarks, we continue to price to our underlying expected medical costs. And as a result, our Commercial risk margins are expected to be essentially consistent with 2012. Now I also noted in my remarks that there's some moving parts in here that I think you have -- to be considered. One, there is the absence of favorable prior year development, because we don't include prior year development in any outlooks. Also, I alluded to some shifts in business mix, as well as some changes in some of our business practices, all which, while it don't affect our risk margins per se, do have a impact on the reported MCR going into 2013 versus 2012.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So the 81.3% excludes PPD. You're still looking for over 200 basis points. Could you help me understand what the changes in business practices might be that would result in such an increase?","David M. Cordani","Christine, it's David. First, to reiterate and then to answer your specific business practice, the most important message is that the underlying margins year-over-year, '13 relative to '12, are expected to be essentially equal. So now we're dealing with a reconciliation of the way we're going to be reporting and talking about MCRs in '13 versus '12. Specific to your question around business practices, think about a meaningful direction in change in terms of how we would be handling go-to-market cost around broker and intermediary commissions and the like as a moving part in the way the calculation takes place but a 0 impact to the underlying margin. So that's why the headline here was the underlying margins, as we've demonstrated over the past couple of years, consistent, strong and disciplined execution. There's moving parts as we change the way we go to market and the way we recognize. In this case, the biggest moving part here you should think about is commissions and related selling expenses, dealing with intermediaries...","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Got it. So you're excluding those from premium revenues and sticking them in SG&A.","David M. Cordani","Yes. Again, a change in how we're handling that on a go-forward basis. But the conclusion, hopefully, you're drawing here is that no fundamental underlying change in the quality of the business, the quality of the underwriting, the quality of the earnings and, therefore, the margins.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. Okay. And then follow-up. You have very little in the way of small group, only about 20,000, so you don't -- we don't have to worry about employer dumping in that segment. When we think about some of the other parts of your business that may be affected by reform, for example, voluntary limited benefits, where do you see that going? I think it's about $280 million in revenue and then kind of retail hospitality restaurant. Is there anything lingering we should be thinking about in some of these other businesses as we look forward to 2014?","David M. Cordani","Christine, it's David. So broadly, just to reinforce your conclusion, we don't have an under-50 life of block of business that's going to be disrupted. We have a de minimis individual block of business from a disruption standpoint. As you look forward and you roll forward reform, you identify, for example, a small piece in the grand scheme of things, so several hundred million dollars of revenue in residual contributions that goes from that. You should expect us, though, to continue to innovate off the base of those capabilities, so we're able to offer and be responsive to employers who are looking for additional solutions. I'd say the macro level, given the size of the franchise we're operating, you should view that as something we should be able to manage in the day-to-day operations as a corporation, and you should view that the disruption, as we step into 2014, is manageable, fully contemplated in the range of the outlook we gave you, both in terms of revenue growth and earnings growth, which I would note is another year of positive underlying earnings growth for the company.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Any other areas I should be worried about in '14, other than this voluntary?","David M. Cordani","A lot of change in '14. But as we talked about, net-net, the change in disruption in the marketplace, we see as creating more opportunity than disruption for us. So no, I don't think you should be.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First, I want to just ask about some of the success you're seeing in sales in the Select market from conversions of fully insured business to ASO. And is there a way that you can estimate -- if you look at the 21% membership growth that you had in Select in 2012, which was around 150,000 lives, what percentage of that was sort of ASO sales from competitors, products that were previously fully insured?","David M. Cordani","Scott, it's David. First, relative to the Select segment, which again for grounding, think about employers with 51 to 250 employees. Two, very importantly, we're a bit agnostic in terms of our go-to-market approach, in terms of the funding solutions employer takes, and that's a strength for us. We're able to sit with an employer through consultative selling and offer them a variety of means of financing their benefits, whether it'd be an ASO program, a shared-return program or a risk program. And that's a fundamental underlying strength of ours. And we built a business model that we could thrive under either scenarios, of a risk scenario or an ASO scenario. Specific to your question on ASO, you should think about, directionally, a little bit in excess of half of our new business sales being in that category. So what that reinforces for you is that there's still a thriving, rich block of business, but a bit greater than 50% of our sales, and ramping is in the ASO space. And then finally, we see that as a preferred mechanism to align the transparency between ourselves and a client and the client and their employee around the incentives, around the way in which money is spent, around the way in which clinical quality and care is improved on a go-forward basis. So net-net, about 50% of it from an ASO standpoint. But we see it thriving, both risk business, as well as ASO business, as we look into the future.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just the follow-up question, maybe just give us an update on the PBM. And I know you had talked about the first half is where you're thinking about giving us an update on strategic view there. Any update on timing? And then just relative to the business itself, it looks like you had around 8% sequential revenue growth in mail order pharmacy revs, and I think that was up around 12% or so for the full year . So clearly, there is good organic growth there. How much of that is being driven off of this growth that you're seeing in the Select and middle markets and, again, from being able to sell in ASO plus other specialty offerings from new sales?","David M. Cordani","Scott, it's David. First, to the second part of your question drawing back, the PBM continues to be a well-run and highly performing asset for us, and it continues to be a very important part of what we'll call our health improvement and health engagement strategy. We've been able to prove that we can grow it. We were able to grow it in part in terms of both the segments and the type of employers we're focused on where more integrated solution makes sense. We could demonstrate that total value of what we're able to service for them. It's superior versus an alternative. So number one, we like the underlying performance of the asset. And to your point, we've been able to demonstrate a positive growth trajectory off of that. As it relates to the first part of your question, we decided to step back, as you know, given the acquisition of HealthSpring and the significant scale, increased opportunity that presents, to make sure we understand all opportunities for running this asset on a go-forward basis. And I've been very consistent to say that the right timeframe to make a decision for that is in the first half of the given year, so in the first half of the year we're in. So you're in position for the ensuing years' selling cycle. And I would say, broadly speaking, we're on track for that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carl McDonald with Citigroup.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So I wanted to go back to the benefit design changes on Medicare and minimum loss ratio and get your view on whether the revised or the new guidance for '13 essentially gets you all the way to minimum loss ratios, assuming that the -- your definition is roughly accurate, or is that -- should we think of that as a step-up function? You step up a loss ratio in '13. You may have to step it up a little bit more in '14.","David M. Cordani","Carl, it's David. So again, just to be very specific to your question, when you ask a question in terms of all the way, I wouldn't want you to conclude that we're telling you that we have the perfection of execution, that every aspect of the business is perfectly positioned for 2014. Stepping back from that, we took a decisive step to position market-by-market. In aggregate, you should think about that loss ratio as being a responsive loss ratio to be compliant in 2014. And then pragmatically, you should think about, probably, some tweaks in 2014 market-by-market based upon the underlying performance of those markets in 2013 as we think about our bidding cycle, so significant step forward. In aggregate, the book of businesses is appropriately positioned. But given the mix of the business and the underlying performance in 2013, you should expect us to continue to make tweaks of that as we go into 2014.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So basically, to summarize, you're saying decisive action this year, tweaks in '14. So I take from that, that you expect that the magnitude of the change in '14 to be substantially different than what you're showing this year.","David M. Cordani","In aggregate for the portfolio, that's correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies & Company.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Slightly different tweak on some prior questions. When thinking about your ASO business and selling strategies there, are you seeing a market increase in employer interest in self-funded arrangements in light of the premium taxes and other costs that they will bear in a fully insured environment headed into 2014? Is that an accelerating opportunity now?","David M. Cordani","David, it's David. I would say yes and no. So are we seeing an increase in demand and interest in terms of self-funded and fully transparent programs and services? Yes. No, I would not say we've seen a correlation to employer's interest in it tied around changes in premium tax and the like. The primary driver we see is that employers see that transparency as an opportunity to align the incentives, to understand how their significant investment is performing, to be in a position to make changes throughout the course of the year, to be in position to communicate more effectively with their employees and align incentives. And that's really where we think the power is. So yes, from a demand and trajectory standpoint; no, as a corollary to the premium tax movement.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then my follow-up around -- is around progress on a couple of Commercial fronts. One, I wonder -- you've talked about your Collaborative Accountable Care efforts and intent to hit about 100 in 2014. Wondered if you would be willing to put a number of members and the size the membership that you think that you would have in that? And then kind of similarly but different, you've, I think, launched some Commercial product into what were formerly HealthSpring-only markets. And I'd be curious about your early returns on Commercial membership in those markets from, I think, kind of narrow network efforts there, please.","David M. Cordani","Sure, Dave. Several different questions, let me see if I could package an answer around it. You ended with the term narrow networks, so I actually want to pick up from that, because philosophically, we don't think about it, our go-to-market strategy, as narrow networks. We think about a body of evidence around the highest-performing, highest-value networks, and we believe there's a significant opportunity to position those for the benefit of clients and customers, just as -- just a philosophical orientation. To your very specific question, one, as I noted in my prepared comments, we're approaching 1 million members or 1 million customers that are already in either the Collaborative Accountable Care relationships or the more sophisticated HealthSpring model in relationships, so we feel great about that. Two, I appreciate your recollection of strategic objective is to have 100 Collaboratives up and running in 2014, and we're well on our way to that direction. The way I'd ask you to think about it, broadly, your rightful question in terms of lives and targets, our more macro objective is that we expect to have approximately 80% of all of our U.S. customers in a performance-based reimbursement model as we step out of '14 and into '15, right? Collaboratives will be a piece of that, but using performance-based reimbursement. Because philosophically, we believe that rewarding physicians in integrated health care system based upon quality and value of outcome versus volume is the way of the future, and there's a variety of way to get those performance-oriented systems to be operating. And that's the key for us for our organization on a go-forward basis. Lastly, specifically, to your HealthSpring question, you're correct. We've split up some Commercial alternatives off of their very successful MA structure. And I would say early indications are positive, but it's early in the trajectory. We have some large cases we've carved into those delivery systems and are seeing early traction already. So early indications are positive, but it's just early in the cycle.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Lake with JPMorgan Chase.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question, I just want to follow up on Medicare Advantage. The industry has appeared cautiously optimistic on the ability to grow Medicare Advantage membership and earnings in '14 despite the headwinds that we know on rates and taxes and MLR floor. So I was just curious in terms of your early view here.","David M. Cordani","Justin, it's David. Maybe -- what I'd like to do is address '14 more at a bit more of a macro level than in individual line of business, and feel free with follow-up questions to keep pushing. But obviously, we're not giving 2014 guidance. I appreciate the desire to understand the underlying economic for '14. And two, by way of a backdrop, we've been able to demonstrate meaningful both operating earnings growth and EPS growth. As we sit here today, to be very clear, we would expect to grow both underlying earnings and EPS in 2014 for the franchise, and I think that's the most important headline as you think about the underlying earnings power of Cigna stepping into 2014.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's good to hear. And then, okay, let me ask a follow-up question on the ASO for the stop loss side. Can you walk us through how small a membership base you will offer ASO and stop loss coverage to? And then in terms of margins, I can't remember the last time there was really volatility here. So can you remind us what factors or what kind of change in cost trend it would take or other factors that would drive volatility in the stop loss business and economics specifically?","David M. Cordani","Justin, it's David. First, if you think about the ASO stop loss proposition, first, by way of backdrop, historically, this has been a proposition that has thrived in what is known commonly in our industry as the bread-and-butter middle market. And systematically, think about it as having come down market through 500 life employers, 400 life employers, 300 life employers. Specific to Cigna in your question, think about the bulk of our success down market is being in that 100 to 250 life employer space, but the ability to go below that. That's point one. Point two to your question, we've not laid out -- so you haven't missed it. We've not laid out a -- I'll call it, a medical trend sensitivity that says with the following medical trend sensitivity, this is what you should expect from a stop loss standpoint. Because I think it would be an inappropriate indicator. There's a variety of different products, programs and services that make up a broad pool of stop loss. And as we've been able to demonstrate, we've been able to run that portfolio of businesses very successfully. And we've been able to demonstrate we've been able to deliver on or exceed our medical trend outlook as a franchise to each of the last 3 years. So I would suggest to you that I can't answer that specific question the way you asked it. But broadly speaking, know that, that is a very well-run block of business at a modest movement in medical cost trend, think 1 point, think 100, 150 basis points in a given year, you should not think of having a shock impact on that book of business the way it operates.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Dave, maybe you can then tell us, when was the last time or give us the last example you remember of stop loss being a real issue? What -- when was it and what caused it?","David M. Cordani","Justin, I have a good memory, but time's a blur. If I think back over the last 3 or 4 years, we have not talked about stop losses other than a very strong growth and earnings driver for the corporation. So if I think over the last 3, 4 or 5 years, I do not have a ready example for that. And I think it's indicative of -- we have a dedicated business unit. We have a dedicated segment focus. We have dedicated product distribution, business expertise that's oriented around this. It is a complex product to manage, which is why we have dedicated expertise around it, and we've been able to prove sustained strong performance. Justin it's also important to note, as I indicated to your prior question, we don't view it as a one-size-fits-all solution. So we don't believe that an ASO stop loss solution configured in the right way is going to work for an employer. We're not going to push that, because that's a lose for us and it's a lose for them. We'll present an alternative solution. So I can't give you a timeframe or an issue to your question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just one maintenance question here. Have you guys disclosed the new growth rates under the new accounting by segment for the -- on the top line, so what you're expecting in Health Care and the in the Supplemental, et cetera?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Chris, it's Ralph. No, we haven't disclosed it by segment. We do -- we did provide it, and you heard it in my remarks, on the overall franchise, with our outlook being between 8% and 12%. And that's consistent with what we discussed when we had our Investor Day.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Sure, okay. But can you give me a sense for, at least, on the Health Care and the Supplemental what we should expect?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Directionally, what we've said in the past, and I think it fits well within there, is on the -- going -- at least going into '13, on the Commercial side of the business, into the mid to high single-digit growth; in seniors, mid to upper teens. I think importantly, I just want to point out there, in '13, there is an extra month of the HealthSpring business in our results. The mid to upper teens on seniors; and then in the Global Supplemental Benefits business, you could think about that in the low-20s; and then within group, in the mid-single digits.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then -- I know everybody likes to talk about the PBM and what you may or may not do strategically there. But the one business segment that first stands out is Disability and Life in terms of sort of revenue growth versus profit growth. And I guess strategically, when you guys look at your businesses, is the Disability and Life business in your --- do you generate a lot of synergies between that segment and, call it, Health Care and Supplemental? And if not, is it something that you would consider doing some -- something strategic with at some point in the future?","David M. Cordani","Chris, it's David. To your question and you oriented on the Disability and Life, as you orient to in our focused strategy, we've been focused on the Disability portion of that business as a point of differentiation. We're able to offer good value proposition from a Life standpoint. If you step back and you think about Disability, just about every disability is correlated up against some medical issue. So there are synergies there for sure. We're able to offer an integrated value proposition to employers to both reduce the volume of short-term disabilities and decrease the duration of disabilities by more actively managing and actively coordinating care for individuals with physicians over time. So there are, indeed, synergies. Over time, it's been a very well-performing block of business for us. We've been very clear in these current market conditions. These current market conditions are very challenging for that line of business and for the industry. And even within that environment, we've been able to deliver very good value proposition for our clients and customers. And I would suggest a reasonable return, given the low-wage growth environment, the unemployment environment and the sustained low interest rate environment. There is an impact on the returns for the reserves. So at this point, we continue to be very pleased with the business. We recognize that it is not growing. That's not lost on us. We continue to invest in it to make sure the capabilities are differentiated, and we have expectations over the intermediate term to have it return to an attractive growth rate on the bottom line, as well as the top line.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sarah James with Wedbush.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","On the commercial medical cost, you've guided up, about 50 to 100 basis points for next year. So how does that compare to cost trends exiting 2012 or so far this year x the elevated flu that's non-recurring? And is there anything you're seeing in the claims data, maybe on the hospital side, that's supporting that assumption?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Sarah, it's Ralph. First, as we look into next year, and as I mentioned in my remarks, 6% to 7% was the trend outlook, which is a step up from what we experienced now in 2012, which was a little below 5.5%. You can think of that as really an uptick in utilization. And inclusive in that is, in our expectation, particularly in the first quarter of the year, that we're going to continue to see elevated claims related to the flu, but that's within our trend of 6% to 7%, so higher utilization versus '12 inclusive of some experience on the flu that we'll see in the first quarter.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Are you seeing anything in your claim status so far that would support that increased utilization assumption, or is that just a reversion to the mean thesis?","David M. Cordani","Sarah, it's David. I give you 2 points. One is we positioned last year, stepping into 2012, used the term reversion to the mean. We had indicated that the overall utilization level was below historical standards. And without multiple years of track record to reinforce why, we took a little bit of a conservative posture stepping into 2012 that we felt was prudent. And as you see, our medical cost trend unfolded somewhat favorably, as you noted. Some of that same posture is being taken for 2013 as well, just given the environment we're operating in. Ralph commented on the flu. We see some early indications of that, obviously, in the fourth quarter, and therefore, some caution as we step into the first quarter of this year. The last point I would give you though, which is very important and it's unique to our book of business, with 85% of our customers being ASO, think about those customers being self-funded or ASO. Seeing both their existing medical cost spend in trend and us using that to consult with them to project their 2013 medical cost in trend. Secondly, even within the risk book of business, on average, our case sizes are a bit larger. We're not in the under-50 pool block of business. So in many cases, clients are actually seeing a subset of their overall medical cost performance as well. Point being is there's a lot of transparency case-by-case as we're converting this in the marketplace. But to your broad point, there is a bit of underlying assumption of a little bit of a reversion to the mean. And if that doesn't transpire, we'll obviously be communicating that with you quarter in, quarter out as we go forward.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then you talked about the PBM in terms of growth opportunity. But another aspect of the equation is unit cost savings. So can you just remind us how much of your medical spend is in the pharmacy category? And as you think of unit cost, how much saving is there really to be had between where you sit now and maybe the optimal or industry-leading unit cost?","David M. Cordani","So Sarah, I'm going to take your question maybe in reverse order. We've been able to demonstrate in the marketplace that our total cost proposition as it relates to the pharmacy is fully competitive. So you should think about our aggregate cost proposition, in terms of units, severity or mix and cost per unit as it couples together. You should think about our pharmacy value proposition being fully competitive in the market. And it's best reinforced by the fact that we're growing it and we're growing it profitably, and we're growing it and growing it profitably in a variety of segments. Now having said that, is there an opportunity to further improve that overall cost equation? There's always opportunities for further improvement, and that's why we're pinpointing to see are there meaningful opportunities that we could take a step forward in terms of moving forward on. As it relates to the cost proposition, it's important to note that when we think about PBM or pharmacy, we think about the -- I'll call it, the oral prescription, and then the fastest-growing category being the injectables. As you very well know, the injectables show up in a variety of places. A small amount typically shows up in the PBM or pharmacy line, and the majority of it shows up in the professional and outpatient services line. That's an important part of the equation. Stepping back to pharmacy, think about -- of the total medical cost spend, think about that being somewhat greater than 10% and somewhere less than 20% of the overall cost equation, depending on how you're slicing and dicing within there.","Operator","Our final question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered. But I just want to ask about the pension. Did you talk about what the unfunded portion was at year end and how much you expect to contribute this year, one? And then just a follow-up question. Given the exit of VADBe and sort of your strong cash flow generation, stability of the operations for some time now, any increased appetite on the dividend side to maybe see a raise there?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Ralph, it's Ralph. Just regarding the pension, in terms of our unfunded liability, that actually came down as we move towards year end, driven by the return to the portfolio relative to our assumptions. So we exceeded that. We also funded around, as we've done in prior years, about $170 million after tax of contributions into the pension plan, but offset by a lowering of our discount rate assumption, which you'll see in our 10-K coming up later this month, to be 3.5%. So when you put all those together, our unfunded liability moved down to about $1.6 billion at the end of the year.","David M. Cordani","Ralph, it's David. Picking up on the second part of your second question, and it correlates to the capital deployment. First, our funding strategy has not changed. We're earmarking approximately $200 million to $250 million per year pretax, and you should think about that as $150 million, $160 million after tax per year on a go-forward basis, which is well greater than any minimums that we need to fund into the overall program. That bridges across to your question around capital deployment strategy and, specifically, dividends. First, to start that conversation, as Ralph noted in his prepared remarks, we continue to have a very attractive outlook for 2013, $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion available for deployment, in addition to that, $400 million to $500 million at the parent company level. So we have very good starting point. Our strategy has not changed in terms of deployment priorities. And as it relates to dividend and the overall decision in terms of how to best deploy it, that's a dynamic process that we continue to consider throughout the course of the year. But we have an outstanding starting point as we step into the year to make those decisions.","Operator","I will now turn the call back over to Mr. David Cordani for closing remarks.","David M. Cordani","In closing, let me just emphasize a few points from today's conversation, most notably 2012 was another strong year for Cigna. We exceeded our growth and earnings expectations, reflecting contributions from each of our ongoing businesses, particularly in our Global Health business. It's evidenced by our high customer retention rate, continued expansion of those relationships and ongoing success winning new relationships, whether they are with employers, individuals or government entities.","As we look forward and assess this transforming global economy and regulatory environment, we see significant opportunities for continued innovation and growth, driven by our differentiators of customer insights, collaborative selling, and best-in-class physician engagement.","We continue to have a strong balance sheet and solid financial flexibility, which was further enhanced this week by our agreement with Berkshire Hathaway to effectively exit our VADBe and GMIB businesses.

At this time all callers are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedures on how to enter queue to ask question at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded.","We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Will McDowell. Please go ahead, Mr. McDowell.","William McDowell","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I am Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me this morning are; David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric Palmer, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Eric will cover a number of topics including Cigna's second quarter 2019 financial results, as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2019.","As noted in our earnings release when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues which are not determined in accordance with Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income, and total revenues respectively is contained in today's earnings release which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com.","We use the term labeled Adjusted Income from Operations and Earnings Per Share on this same basis as our principle measures of financial performance. I will remind you that as previously disclosed, we exclude contributions from transitioning clients from adjusted income from operations, and adjusted revenue.","In our remarks today we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2019 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.","Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, in the second quarter we recorded an after tax special item charge of $115 million or $0.30 per share for integration and transaction related costs. We also recorded a special item charge of $64 million or $0.17 per share, for our litigation matter. ","As described in today\u2019s earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations, in our discussion of financial results. Please note that consistent with best practice, when we make prospective comments, regarding financial performance, including our full year 2019 outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future share repurchases or additional prior year development of medical costs. ","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to David. ","David Cordani ","Thanks, Will. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our call. Today I'll highlight Cigna's strong second quarter financial results, which reflect continued momentum across our businesses. I'll also discuss how our differentiated health service model fuels our ability to drive innovation and accelerated growth and build a more sustainable healthcare system.","I'll begin with our second quarter performance, which included continued innovation, which drove strong revenue and earnings growth, exceptional service delivery, and deepening of our customer and client relationships. Cigna's consolidated adjusted revenue for the quarter was $34.4 billion, and we grew our earnings to $1.6 billion. Our results [indiscernible] Health Services and Integrated Medical segments, with Health Services delivering strong revenues and earnings that were modestly above our expectations and our Integrated Medical segment delivering a 10% increase in revenues with earnings growth of 8%.","In addition, Cigna continue to deliver solid performance across our international markets and other businesses. Overall, we're pleased with our second quarter results, which continue to demonstrate momentum across our portfolio of businesses. We're also making very good progress on our integration priorities. As we continue to provide excellent services across our portfolio of businesses, retain and meaningfully grow our client relationships, deliver leading medical and pharmacy cost trend, drive medical and pharmacy synergies for the direct benefit of our customers and clients and deliver on our synergy capture for the benefit of our shareholders. All in we're on track to achieve our integration goals.","Collectively, our second quarter performance gives us confidence to again raise our revenue in earnings outlook for 2019, representing 17% to 19% EPS growth over Cigna's strong 2018 performance. Our strong results and confidence in continued long-term sustainable growth are fueled by the same thing. Our portfolio of leading assets that we connect to provide better care, greater choice, and approved affordability for those we serve. We are led by clear mission and more than 74,000 talented colleagues focused on improving health, well-being and peace of mind for those we serve.","Our four growth businesses give us a path for attractive growth in a dynamic marketplace and regulatory environment. In commercial, we are executing our plans to expand our go deep markets by 25% over the next three to five years, building on the success of our proven strategy. In Medicare Advantage we expect 10% to 15% average annual customer growth, driven by both product and geographic market expansion beginning in 2020.","In our Health Services business, we see meaningful opportunities for sustained growth through innovative new products, cross selling opportunities, and further geographic expansion, given the modest overlap between our Health Services and Integrated Medical businesses. We also continue to serve commercial clients while we further expand and deepen health plan and governmental agency client relationships.","And in international markets, we continue our product and distribution channel expansion to drive sustained attractive growth. By leveraging these distinctive assets, and guided by our clear strategic direction, Cigna is accelerating the future of healthcare. ","We began this journey almost a decade ago, when we moved from the transactional phase of healthcare to leading the transitional phase, where we demonstrated that improving health, engaging individuals and supporting and incentivizing healthcare professionals does work and yields real value. That value includes delivering lower medical costs trend fueled in part by our leading portfolio specialty capabilities, which includes behavioral health and coaching programs that serve as the cornerstone of our coordinated care approach. Our approach has earned us a privilege to serve more than 165 million customer relationships around the globe. ","Now, our transformative model of healthcare is building on the progress we have made to position us to lead the industry including a better, more sustainable healthcare system. Our focus is in three critical areas, treating the whole person body and mind, targeted rapid innovation to meet customers need for more affordable, personalized solution, and leveraging data and technology to serve as a connective tissue between our customers and their health care professional partners of choice. ","Let me briefly touch on these components beginning with the first two, treating the whole person and investing in targeted innovation to meet the needs for more affordable personalized solutions. We see extraordinary opportunities to achieve better whole person health by building personalized solutions at scale in a way nobody else does. As we offer holistic, connected approach to addressing emerging threats to health.","For example, it is clear to us that conditions such as stress, loneliness and depression, each impact overall health and vitality, as well as overall cost of care. Often we see people having one or more of these conditions. Further data demonstrates that behavioral and medical conditions are highly interrelated. ","Having both behavioral and medical conditions can increase cost of care by up to 2 to 3 times, compared with the cost of treating a patient without a behavioral health condition. For example, chronic stress is becoming a major concern around the world. It is linked to reduced workplace productivity, and costs employers hundreds of billions of dollars a year in the United States alone. In most cases, in the United States, and the world for that matter, behavioral and medical services remain uncoordinated.","At Cigna, we are addressing these costs and conditions in a better more coordinated way. We have more than 1,000 coaches and specialists helping individuals set goals and improve their behavioral and mental health conditions. We have 600 nurses who visit our customers' homes every day, we have more than 650 aligned collaborative accountable care relationships who are now rapidly expanding services to include behavioral health programs. And we have game changing connected data, thanks to the combination of Cigna and Express Scripts.","I'll provide two examples of the benefit of our integrated approach. The first relates to our work to address the mental health needs of first responders. 85% of firefighters, police officers and paramedics and other first responders have experienced symptoms related to mental health issues. However, many have trouble accessing coordinated local care.","In a first of its kind initiative, we work closely with the City of San Diego, and local healthcare professionals to give first responders easy, coordinated access to behavioral wellness treatment. We're bringing together our capabilities with data and technology to help first responders cope with traumatic and high stress situations while on the job, thereby improving their overall health and well-being.","The second example is our partnership with a large global client to help employees avoid work related stress. In this example, our client's employees are tasked with sorting through social media content, some of which can cause symptoms and health challenges similar to PTSD.","Collaborating with our client, we developed the first end to end stress management application that incorporates artificial intelligence, virtual reality capabilities, and personalized behavioral coaching. Through this approach, we've created a solution that measures individual stress levels real time, identifies social media content, most likely to trigger that stress, and alerts dedicated wellness coaches to engage with individuals who may be exhibiting high levels of stress, helping them through their greatest time of need.","The third way we're working to transform healthcare is by leveraging data and technology to serve as a connective tissue between our customers and their healthcare professional partners of choice. To be clear, our strategy guides us to work with partner and enable healthcare professional partners, as they provide care to their patients, not compete with, or disintermediate them. ","More than ever, people expect coordinated personalized experiences that are similar to those they receive from other industries. This means understanding each person's engagement preferences, health needs and treatment protocols to help us to deliver better, more affordable care one person at a time.","Let's take a simple yet critically important example. We know that 50% to 60% of people with chronic illness, miss taking the medication, or take the wrong dose or discontinue treatment prematurely. The cost of inconsistent and incomplete care is staggering, $300 billion in the U.S. alone. Approaching almost 10% of what our country spends on annual health care costs. ","One way we're addressing this challenge is by turning it into an opportunity, one individual at a time, leveraging technology to empower patients and providers to address condition specific challenges like diabetes, which impacts more than 30 million people in the United States. ","Our glucose monitoring technology enables targeted clinical intervention for people with diabetes, by generating personalized real time analytics, and alerts to inform targeted outreach and coaching from our diabetes specialist pharmacist and clinical teams.","Through our diabetes care value program, we provide physicians with the data they need to help people better manage their diabetes. In addition to improving the adherence and clinical outcomes, it also improves quality of life. And within our commercial plans, for example, those enrolled in this program saw a 4.3% decline in spending in 2018 versus a 4.1% increase for these conditions overall.","So, as you can see at Cigna, our focus on whole person health is more than just words. It's a clear strategic intent, a focused guide to action, and a catalyst for the development of products, programs and services. Additionally, our approach along with our technology and innovation capabilities has helped us create personalized, high impact, life changing solutions that truly matter to our customers and clients. These are just a few tangible examples of how Cigna is shaping and defining the future of health and wellness. One person, one provider, one client at a time.","Now to wrap up, Cigna delivered strong second quarter financial results, reflecting continued momentum across our businesses, including consolidated adjusted revenue of $34.4 billion, and earnings of $1.6 billion. Collectively our second quarter performance results gives us confidence again to raise our revenue and earnings outlook for 2019, representing a 17% to 19% EPS growth rate over Cigna's 2018 performance.","Our strong results and our confidence in continued long-term sustainable growth are fueled by a portfolio of leading assets that we connect to provide more complete whole person care for those we serve. And as a result, improving affordability and predictability, as well as personalized quality and sustainability, as we drive for medical costs growth no greater than CPI by 2021.","Our four growth businesses give us a path for sustained attractive growth in a dynamic marketplace and regulatory environment, including through ongoing innovation and expansion of our health services, commercial, government and international markets businesses. We remain on track to deliver $20 to $21 of EPS in 2021 and will deliver 10% to 13% average annual EPS growth over the long-term. We're also making very good progress against each of our integration priorities and are on track to achieve our integration goals.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Eric.","Eric Palmer","Thanks, David. Good morning everyone. In my remarks today, I will review key aspects of Cigna's second quarter results and discuss our updated outlook for the full year.","Key consolidated financial highlights for second quarter 2019 include adjusted revenues of $34.4 billion, earnings of $1.6 billion after-tax, earnings per share of $4.30, reflecting continued growth and deepening of customer and client relationships across each of our businesses, underlying strength in medical and pharmacy cost performance, operating expense efficiencies, and the quarter was further aided by the favorable resolution of a tax matter. Second quarter results also included strong cash flow from operations, driven by continued strong execution across our businesses.","Regarding our segments, I will first comment on Health Services. Second quarter revenues were $24 billion and pre-tax earnings were $1.16 billion. Results for second quarter reflect organic growth with the addition of 236,000 pharmacy customers in the quarter and $1.9 million customers on a year-to-date basis, strong volumes with 294 million adjusted pharmacy scripts fulfilled in the quarter and continued growth in specialty pharmacy, driven by strong volumes.","Overall, Health Services performed very well in the second quarter. Consistent with the seasonal ramp of earnings in this business, Health Services earnings in the second quarter were significantly higher than the first quarter. And as expected, Health Services earnings for the second quarter 2019 were lower than the Express Scripts second quarter 2018 earnings on a comfortable basis. We remain on track for a full year outlook for this business, and I'll provide more commentary on this momentarily.","The fundamentals if this business are strong, and we're driving innovation and growth with solutions that deliver differentiated value for our customers and clients.","Turning to our Integrated Medical segment, second quarter revenues grew 10% to $9 billion, driven by customer growth and deepening of customer relationships, premium growth reflecting underlying cost trends, and the inclusion of the Express Scripts, Medicare Part D business. We ended the second quarter with 17 million global medical customers, driven by an organic increase of 207,000 lives over second quarter 2018, led by growth in our select and middle market segments, partially offset by lower national accounts enrollment.","Second quarter earnings grew 8% to $1 billion, reflecting strong medical and specialty contributions and continued effective medical cost management.","Turning to our Medical Care Ratio or MCR, our second quarter MCR of 81.6% reflect strong underlying fundamentals including continued effective medical cost performance. Compared with second quarter 2018, our MCR increased, as expected, due to the inclusion of Express Scripts, Medicare Part D business, the pricing effect of the suspension of the health insurance tax, and a higher MCR in our individual business. As we've discussed previously, we expect margins in our individual business to be lower in 2019 than last year.","Second quarter 2019 Integrated Medical earnings benefited from $28 million pre-tax, a favorable net prior year reserved development, compared to $20 million pre-tax in second quarter 2018. Overall, Cigna\u2019s Integrated Medical segment delivered strong results in the second quarter.","Turning to our international markets business, revenue grew to $1.4 billion, representing 8% growth over second quarter 2018, on a currency adjusted basis. Second quarter earnings grew to $207 million, reflecting continued business growth and strong margins, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts.","For our Group Disability and Other Operations segment, second quarter revenues were $1.3 billion. Second quarter earnings for this segment were $149 million, driven by solid performance in both disability and in life. ","For our Corporate segment, the second quarter 2019 loss was $453 million, primarily driven by $428 million of interest costs. ","Lastly, I would note that the second quarter results include a $45 million non-recurring benefit from the favorable resolution of a tax matter. Overall, Cigna\u2019s second quarter results reflect continued strong revenue and earnings growth led by our Health Services and Integrated Medical businesses.","I\u2019ll now discuss our outlook for 2019. For full year 2019, we now expect consolidated adjusted revenues in the range of $136 billion to $137 billion. This represents an increase to our prior outlook of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion, reflecting higher pharmacy contributions. Our increased revenue outlook for 2019 includes approximately $1.5 billion of incremental revenue from the transition of Cigna Pharmacy Script volume from OptumRx, which began in July. ","We now expect full year consolidated adjusted income from operations to be in the range of $6.34 billion to $6.46 billion, or $16.60 to $16.90 per share. This represents an increase of $0.25 to $0.35 per share over our prior expectation, and represents growth in the range of 17% to 19% over 2018. For 2019, we now project an expense ratio of less than 10%, which reflects additional revenue leverage, including the in-sourcing of pharmacy services from OptumRx, ongoing efficiencies, and administrative expense synergies.","For 2019, we now project the consolidated adjusted tax rate in the range of 23% to 24%, an improvement of 50 basis points from our previous outlook, primarily reflecting resolution of the tax matter, I mentioned earlier. ","I will now discuss our 2019 outlook for the Health Services and Integrated Medical segments. For our Health Services business, we continue to expect full year pre-tax earnings in the range of $5.05 billion to $5.2 billion. Consistent with this outlook, we continue to expect Health Services earnings to be higher in the second half of 2019, than the first half due to several factors.","First, we've executed a number of supply chain initiatives in the first half of the year that will take full effect in the second half. I would note that the impact of these initiatives is more heavily weighted to the back half of 2019 compared with the pacing of initiatives in 2018.","Second, in the second half of 2019, we expect continued strong performance in specialty pharmacy, including the full run rate benefit of specialty generics introduced earlier this year. And finally, the realization of administrative expense synergies associated with the Cigna Express Scripts combination. These second half growth drivers are partially offset as previously communicated by stranded overhead costs associated with the early termination of the Anthem contract.","We now expect adjusted Pharmacy Scripts in the range of 1.21 billion to 1.23 billion scripts, an increase of approximately 40 million scripts from our previous outlook. The increase to our script outlook reflects volumes we expect to transition from OptumRx in 2019.","Additionally, for Health Services, we now project a 2020 retention rate in the range of 97% to 98%, an increase of 50 basis points from the midpoint of our previous expectations as our innovative pharmacy solutions continue to resonate in the marketplace, and enable us to deliver greater value for those we serve.","For our Integrated Medical business, we now expect full year earnings in the range of $3.78 billion to $3.85 billion, an increase of $50 million to $80 million from our previous outlook. This outlook reflects strength and growth in our businesses, driven by deepening customer relationships, industry leading medical cost trend performance, and well managed administrative expenses.","Key assumptions reflected in our Integrated Medical earnings outlook for 2019 include the following. Regarding global medical customers, we now expect 2019 growth of approximately 200,000 customers. Our updated guidance reflects continued growth in the select and middle market segments. Relative to previous expectations, while we continue to project attractive customer growth in middle market and international, our updated outlook now assumes lower growth in those segments.","Turning to medical costs, for our U.S. commercial employer book of business, we continue to expect full year 2019 medical costs trend to be in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%. We continue to expect the 2019 medical care ratio to be in the range of 80.5% to 81.5%. I would note that our outlook for both medical costs trend and the medical care ratio is unchanged and is indicative of both stable underlying cost trends across our commercial and government businesses. And our leading approach to driving better clinical and cost outcomes through advanced consumer engagement, physician partnership and further aided by our combination with Express Scripts.","We also continue to expect solid contributions from our international markets, group disability and other businesses, as we continue to innovate in the marketplace and deliver a differentiated value for our customers. All in, for full year 2019, we now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $6.34 billion to $6.46 billion, or $16.60 to $16.90 per share, this represents 17% to 19% growth over 2018.","I would also remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of future share repurchases and any additional prior year reserve development. Overall, our updated outlook reflects continued strong execution across our four differentiated growth platforms. Our 2019 outlook is also consistent with our multiyear growth expectations and we remain confident in our ability to achieve our 2021 earnings per share target of $20 to $21 per share.","Now moving to our 2019 capital management position and outlook. As previously communicated, our top capital deployment priority is accelerated debt repayment, and we are on track to return our debt to capitalization ratio to the upper 30s by the end of 2020. On an ongoing basis, our capital priorities remain as follows: first, reinvesting back into our businesses for innovation and growth; second, strategic M&A on a targeted basis; and third, returning capital to shareholders primarily through share repurchase.","Consistent with these priorities in the second quarter, we deployed $1.3 billion to repay debt and we repurchased 2.6 million shares of stock for $406 million. Additionally, in July, we repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares for $196 million. Our debt to capitalization ratio was 47.2% as of June 30, 2019, down from 50.9% as of December 31, 2018.","For 2019, we continue to project cash flow from operations of approximately $8 billion. In the year, we continue to expect to deploy approximately $4.2 billion to debt repayment. We continue to expect to have capacity for $1.5 billion of share purchases in 2019. And through the end of July, we had already deployed $1.1 billion of that total. Our balance sheet and cash flow from operations outlook remain strong as our capital efficient businesses continue to deliver attractive margins and returns on capital.","Now to recap, our second quarter consolidated results reflect continued strong execution and focus on creating differentiated value for our stakeholders. We're well positioned to achieve the attractive financial targets we've established for 2019, and we maintain strong visibility toward our $20 to $21 earnings per share target for 2021.","Further, our clear strategic focus, strong fundamentals across our businesses, and outstanding financial flexibility, give us greater confidence in our long-term targets for growth in revenue, earnings and earnings per share. ","And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. ","Question-and-Answer Session","[Operator Instructions] First question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. You may ask your question.","Q - Josh Raskin","Hi, thanks. Good morning. I guess, I'll start with David, you mentioned the thought around increasing the level of go deep markets by 25% over the next couple of years. I'm curious how we should be thinking about that in terms of what segments and products are going to be leaders and sort of how do you think about those specific markets in terms of identification process.","David Cordani","Josh, good morning, it\u2019s David. First as you know, we've been very successful for quite some time with our go deep approach, in terms of looking at markets MSA by MSA to understand the characteristics the makeup of the client opportunities in those markets, the makeup of the delivery system configuration in those markets, taking into consideration the regulatory environment. And we pretty dynamically managed our portfolio of intense go deep markets and then cultivating additional market opportunities to bring into that portfolio. We see a meaningful growth in front of us so about 25%.","As it relates to the products and solutions, you should think about it as from that standpoint, the core of the franchise being leveraged against it. So the select framework, the middle market framework, targeted national accounts opportunities, and very importantly, Medicare Advantage opportunity. So we cross reference all of those. And then finally, we look at the individual or the public exchange business. So this is more on the integrated approach and the integrated side of the house. They're separate initiatives and separate focus on the health services portfolio side of the house. ","So, successful past, attractive opportunities in front of us and the ability to leverage those product portfolios through core commercial, individual commercial and MA off of our successful collaborative accountable care relationships.","Josh Raskin","Got you. And then just a quick follow up, I got Eric here as well, just on the PBM retention, any more color on sort of bringing up the low end of the previous range is that sales driven, were there a couple of accounts just sort of weren't sure about that have signed on, et cetera? ","Eric Palmer","Josh, it\u2019s Eric. I would just think of the increase there as we've gotten additional visibility as we continue to move through the year and getting our clients lined up. We're really pleased with the progress that we've had and the dialogue that we've had with our clients, we think 97% to 98% is an outstanding result and pleased to be able to deliver that now two years running in terms of the retention in that segment.","Josh Raskin","Perfect. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Raskin. Our next question comes from Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. You may ask your question.","Matt Borsch","Yes, just on that the more near-term, could you talk to the lower enrollment target on the medical side, and just related to that, how you're seeing the mix of preferences, if I could put it in terms of risk versus ASO and whether maybe the reintroduction of the Obamacare industry fee might be playing some role there? Thank you.","David Cordani","Good morning, it's David. So, relative to the membership outlook for the medical customers. First, to be clear, we're very pleased with our track record of sustained commercial growth now that spans 10 years of sustained organic growth. For 2019, we recognize that our outlook is lowered a bit to 200,000 lives still an attractive result that is largely driven by lower commercial national accounts, and a little lower performance at the upper end of the middle market portfolio.","I\u2019d remind you that those buyer groups are typically less integrated offerings. We\u2019ve retained outstanding focus in select and core middle market and as such, continue to have strong underlying life growth as well as specialty growth including behavioral, dental, pharmacy, et cetera. ","As it relates for the mix of business, we have seen a bit more guaranteed cost our risk business over the recent past to complement our ASO strength. And as you recall, we go to market with a diverse portfolio of funding mechanisms and offer choice, it's an inherent strength of our organization. And we believe that the sustained strong medical costs trend performance we've been able to deliver in the marketplace again, posting the lowest rate of growth year-in year-out is resonating well and we\u2019re complementing sustained ASO performance and Stop Loss performance with a bit higher guaranteed cost performance.","We do not see that as a corollary to changes within the marketplace year-in year-out. That's a more sustained medical costs performance outlook for us. So good balance in funding mechanisms. And we think that'll continue to perform as we step into 2020.","Matt Borsch","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Borsch. Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question.","Justin Lake","Thanks. Good morning. Appreciate the comments on the healthcare services result being above expectations. Wanted to follow up there and ask whether you can tell us how this business looked on a year-over-year basis adjusted for all the moving parts. Basically the same way you indicated, it was down modestly in the first quarter, at the Investor Day. And then given we're more than halfway through the year and all the focus on the PBM, I was hoping you might give us a view on where you expect to come in relative to the guidance range at $5.05 to $5.2. Any thoughts whether we should expect to kind of higher end or lower end given we\u2019re seven months into the year. Thanks.","Eric Palmer","Justin, it\u2019s Eric. I'll start here. So first of all, just to reiterate the second quarter results were consistent with or even a bit ahead of our expectations, and reflect the strong performance of the businesses there. And particularly strong, especially pharmacy performance and the growth in the volumes as we had expected. As you alluded to, the number of different items in terms of adjusting comparability for this year's second quarter versus Express Scripts standalone items that were reported last year. And I\u2019d point you back to the same factors that we talked about at our Investor Day in terms of that reconciliation is being present here.","Also, as you might expect, there are number of different supply chain activities that were on hold kind of at the time period leading up to the close of the combination that we executed over the first part of this year. And we've got good visibility into those in terms of driving results in the back half of the year.","So overall, that helps to inform the pattern. So year-on-year we\u2019d characterize the results for the second quarter versus second quarter is down in the single-digits percentage for the quarter. And I\u2019d note as we look ahead then, as you might expect in the third quarter, we expect the pattern to flip. We expect we'll be up mid-single digits, or single-digits in terms of the performance for the Health Services business relative to the Express Scripts piece from last year's third quarter.","So we'll bring those capabilities online. The effect of the supply chain initiatives and such will drive us to the growth over the back half of the year.","David Cordani ","And part of your question relative to the range, we're pleased to be performing solidly throughout the first half of the year, as Eric noted and see a ramp throughout the second half of the year. With the pattern flipping in the second half of the year, as relates to performance in the range. I mean, stay tuned for more. That's right in pace of our execution of our synergies that's in front of us and rate and pace of investments. And we see an exciting into the year and a good start to next year in front of us right now.","Justin Lake","Okay. And, Eric, just to be clear, you said mid-single digits down in the second quarter?","Eric Palmer","Single digits down in the second quarter. Think about the single digits up in the third quarter.","Justin Lake","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Lake. Our next question comes from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. You ask your question. ","Sarah James","Thank you. When you talk about medical costs trends going to the CPI range in the next couple of years. Should we think about that being ratable so we could see a step down in 2020 cost trend outlook from what you're experiencing this year. And I know it's a small book for you guys where you take risk. But does the lower cost trend correlate to lower pricing? And could that create any SG&A de-levering? Thanks.","David Cordani ","Sarah good morning. As you may recall from Investor Day, we walked through a little bit of a crosswalk of some of the tools, levers, initiatives we've been executing now for many years to generate a lower medical cost trend in the industry at large. And you may recall Matt Manders walked through a framework that over the last seven years or so we've delivered about a 4% medical cost trend with the last few years being a little closer to 3%. ","So point one is sustained, point two is trending downward or even more favorable going forward. We're not providing guidance for 2020. So I don't want to tell you anything is ratable. There's dynamism in the portfolio. We're pleased that here in 2019 we're setting about 3.5% to 4.5% medical cost trend outlook, which is by far and away best in the industry yet again, and we have a variety of tools and initiatives in front of us to step down that medical cost trend for the benefit of our clients, customers and patients as we look forward.","So, again, I don't want to talk about ratability, rather, the trajectory is positive, it benefits our clients and customers and enhances our overall value proposition. ","To the last part of your comment, I would not correlate the size, shape and scope of our portfolio and diversity of our funding mechanisms, we do not -- to be very clear, we do not view that a lower medical cost trend environment could generate less revenue growth, could generate SG&A deleveraging, that is not an issue that we worry about. And I would encourage you not to worry about that, in terms of the diversity of our portfolio and how we deliver services.","Sarah James ","That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Ms. James. Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. You may ask your question. ","Kevin Fischbeck","Great. Thanks. Just wanted to be -- you guys raised guidance by less like it\u2019s in the upside that we saw in the quarter. So I just wanted to see how you were thinking about that. Is there anything in the back half of the year that you're kind of now incorporating into the outlook?","Eric Palmer","Kevin, it's Eric. Well, first, I just note, we're really pleased with the strong results in the quarter and with being in position to be able to raise the guidance again for full year 2019. So I think the 17% to 19% growth coming off of a strong 18% is a good result and reflects the accretion from -- Express Scripts coming through and good momentum and the underlying business.","In terms of the outlook pieces, the main thing I\u2019d note here would just be around us continuously managing the rate and pace of our investments and capabilities and such for the future. And so we're taking the opportunity to continue to invest into capabilities and the like. So that'd be the main thing I'd call out in terms of a difference of how we\u2019re seeing the back part of the year versus our prior outlook.","Kevin Fischbeck","I guess, one thing that you did kind of change was -- that you're I guess now taking on or including taking on Cigna\u2019s, some of the Cigna\u2019s volume. It sounds like you're just really updating the revenue in the script number, you're not updating the earnings contribution at all. How should we think about that, and does bringing Cigna on add earnings contribution at some point in 2020 or 2021?","Eric Palmer","Yes, and that one, go back to some of the dynamics we talked about at our Investor Day in terms of the impact of once we're through the transition and such. But overall, would note and I think you've got the major dynamics, correct there, that the update to revenues, the update to script counts this year primarily are the impacts of the transition do not think of that as a driver in terms of net income as it relates to 2019.","Over time, we'd expect the transition to be slightly accretive as it gives us additional fixed cost leverage and the like, but in the short-term and the near-term, wouldn't really think of that as driving the bottom line income.","Kevin Fischbeck","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Fischbeck. Our next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question.","Peter Costa","Good morning, my question is on Medicare Advantage growth for 2020. And I know you're not giving guidance for 2020, but you sort of open the door with your commentary. Are you expecting Medicare Advantage to grow about 10% to 15% in 2020 itself? Or was that something over the three to five years. was that -- appeared to me, whether three to five years just apply to the commercial part of your guidance?","And then, with Part D, and also part of Medicare, bids came down 7.2% on average. Do you think you're going to get growth out of your Part D program given where the national average bids are? ","David Cordani","Peter, good morning, it's David. Let me take the first part of your question. I'll ask Eric to take the second part of your question. First, to be very clear, the three to five years, as you recall that was specific to the timeframe to drive the 25% growth in our go deep market. So you're correct in terms of isolating that acceptable.","To the specific part of your question, we see tremendous growth opportunity in MA, starting in 2020. It will be driven by further in market growth and traction. Expanding into new markets. We have multiple new HMO markets and even more markets from a PPO standpoint, which is topic three, expanding into the PPO space. ","We had highlighted that that 10% to 15% organic customer life growth is our customer life growth over the near-term to intermediate long-term range, that\u2019s in front of us and we will be at the lower end of that range in 2020 as we ramp the initiatives going forward. ","o you don't have to wait three to five years. But think about it the lower end of the range as we step into 2020 and ramping up as we go forward. I'll ask Eric to answer the second part of the question. ","Eric Palmer","Yes, Peter, on the Part D benchmarks again, not providing the specific guidance in terms of 2020 at this point. But I would just know that the benchmarks were actually quite consistent with how we were thinking about them. There weren't any big surprises in terms of our view of where the benchmarks came through.","Overall, we'll be in a better position to provide customer growth guidance as the full visibility into all the competitors positioning is kind of region by region comes into view. And we work through our marketing plans there, but overall, no surprises in terms of where the benchmarks came through.","Peter Costa","Thanks. That's helpful. Just as a follow up, David, the 10% or so growth, that you're talking about for 2020. You also talk about county expansions, the first year you see the growth in membership that\u2019s usually not in Medicare, very profitable. And the county expansions are usually fairly costly. Can you -- so do you think Medicare can be a drag on your earnings in 2020 and then grow from there?","David Cordani","We haven\u2019t provided 2020 earnings guidance, we will do that as the year comes to a close. Step up in the overall portfolio will have attractive growth in our overall enterprise earnings portfolio for 2020 that guides us to 2021. So stay tuned for the guidance as we provide for 2020 from that standpoint, but we think we have a very attractive both growth and overall fundamental earnings profile for the business.","Peter Costa","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Costa. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. You may ask your question.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thanks, good morning. First just wanted to go to the MLR [ph] that came in a little bit higher, I know you contributed -- you attributed to a few of the different things it seemed like the incremental piece, maybe the individual business at least relative to kind of 1Q. If you could just maybe break out what you're seeing there, and maybe your commitment to expansion in that market? Thanks.","Eric Palmer","Yes, Ralph, it\u2019s Eric. On the loss ratio, so a couple of different comparison points to think about there. The biggest driver from a sequential perspective versus 1Q is just up to the normal seasonality of things as we work through the customers kind of coming through deductibles and working through that ramp.","In terms of the drivers, in terms of the second quarter year-on-year, really three things that I would point to, and they're each about the same impact. So roughly a 30 each, that's the inclusion of the Express Scripts is being part of the loss ratio this year and not part of the calculation last year, the Part D business specifically, one. Two, the pricing effects of the suspension of the industry fee.","And third, is the IFP, the individual segment margin this year versus last year. Each one of those three factors is about a third of the variants when we think about things quarter versus quarter.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay, that's helpful. And then just quickly wanted, I hope, you could flush out the lower enrollment growth commentary, specifically in select middle markets. I think you said in the prepared remarks, you've obviously had a lot of success there for some time and done well with sort of bundling your specialty lines. A lot more recently your peers have talked more aggressively moving in that direction. So, just hoping if you could give us a little bit of sense as sort of the competitive dynamic there both as it relates to sort of the medical side as well as some of those specialty lines in terms of competition. Thanks.","David Cordani","Ralph, good morning, it's David. Very specifically our select portfolio continues to perform very well. And within the select portfolio, you're correct, we go to market with a fully integrated solution. We\u2019d remind you that we use the full breadth of the funding mechanisms that exists if you will, asking and allowing and working consultatively with our employer clients one by one to determine how they want to best finance their solution that resonates quite well for us. And then we continue to drive very good targeted innovation in our clinical programs and our coaching programs and our service programs, et cetera. ","In the core middle market capabilities, we continue to perform very well, and as I noted in a prior question, we have seen a little lower performance in the high end or the upper end of the middle market, where there's a little less integrated offering. ","Lastly to the overall, point of your question, the marketplace is competitive has been competitive and will be competitive going forward. So it's a dynamic market. Our points of differentiation continue to resonate well. And importantly, our underlying fundamental medical costs performance continues to resonate well. And then, as Eric noted, we continue to invest in on ongoing innovation, so we're poised for continued strong growth in the space.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Giacobbe. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with J.P. Morgan. You may ask your question.","Gary Taylor","Hey, good morning. I appreciate the commentary about the PBM and given how focused the Street is on that metric. I just want to clarify that we're on the same page. So if you look at the second quarter of 2018, ESI reported $1.395 billion of core EBITDA if we grow that mid-single digit 5%, that's about $1.465 billion, which would represent about a $250 million sequential increase. I just want to make sure those are sort of the numbers that we're talking about for the 3Q?","Eric Palmer","Yes, Gary, it's Eric. So I would say my commentary in terms of our expectation for growth on 3Q would be on an apples-to-apples basis. So once you take the Express Scripts reported numbers and adjust for the items that we talked about at the Investor Day our re-segmentation, the changes in terms of depreciation and amortization, the change in terms of the enterprise value initiative, and then the work from there. Once you get to that baseline, then we would grow from that baseline. That's the basis that we're speaking to. ","Gary Taylor","So on an adjusted basis, not as reported basis, so I'm glad I clarified that then. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Taylor. Our next question comes from Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. ","Steve Tanal","Good morning, guys. You\u2019ve obviously covered a lot of ground, I guess just one thing, maybe if you could give us a little bit more commentary on sort of MCR by line of business, maybe thinking year-on-year, but if you could just touch on sort of the key things there commercial, Medicare, Medicaid, how those performed relative to expectations.","And then maybe just within that line thinking about all the good growth and market share gains you've had in the commercial risk side of the business, how are those margins sort of relative to the overall average or base business if you wouldn\u2019t mind commenting there? Thanks a lot.","Eric Palmer","Steve, it's Eric. So on the loss ratio it\u2019s kind of by business, actually, we really put both of them right down the middle. So consistent with expectations and consistent performance in both the commercial and the government business. So feel good about those. The Medicaid business is a small business for us, but has actually performed consistent with our targets as well. So, again, certainly no variation that I\u2019d call out in terms of the commercial versus the government versus the Medicaid business, to note in the quarter.","David Cordani","And Steven, relative to the question relative to -- I think your -- second part of your question around the margins and margin differentiation by funding mechanism or type of business. If you step back from that, you may recall that our approach to the marketplace is such that we're a bit funding mechanism agnostic. So that enables our sales force our client managers, et cetera, toward client by client to determine the last step which is once the right solution is put in place in terms of clinical programs, network design, service program designs, et cetera. How do you want to fund and finance it.","So backing into that, that means that when you look at on an apples-to-apples basis, in general, the margins and the returns across the various funding mechanisms are attractive and have some similarity relative to them. There are some nuances, but think about the margins as being strong and differentiated in guaranteed cost. Think about the margins, that are being strong and differentiated in our core packaged ASO Stop Loss portfolio businesses. Hope that helps.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Tanal. Our next question comes from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question. ","A.J. Rice","Hello, everybody, just maybe a post mortem on the selling season and a quick clarification with Eric, on the PBM selling season. I know when -- I think when I was out there, in a headquarter visit back in the spring, there was a discussion about the fact that this year there was less business in Express Scripts side up for renewal than there had been last year. ","So you'd be more on the offense and it sounded like that was the expectation for 2020. And I want to see if you still -- so next year selling season. And I also -- there has been some discussion by peers about people delay because of all the change in the marketplace, on RFPs and postponing for a year. I wanted to see, do we think that the RFPs have been pushed out till next year. And we'll see a big overall opportunity that way next year?","And then just a quick point of clarification for some discussion on guidance, as Eric said, because I know you won't comment on it, if you don't comment on this call. Is there anything did you guys would say about the Q3 versus Q4 split, I know you're talking about synergies and PDB seasonality, which would tend to push people into the fourth quarter versus the third, relative to historic trends. Is there anything you want to say about the Q3-Q4 split?","David Cordani","A.J., it\u2019s David, let me take your first question. And, obviously, Eric will take the second piece of it. So your recollection is pretty clear, the 2019 selling season for the core pharmacy services business had higher volume of business on a relative basis. That's cycle time. So there's cycles on the contracts and it was a more intense cycle. And as Eric noted, just outstanding client retention. 2020 selling season, which is far into the season right now. ","From that standpoint, is shaping up very favorably from a client retention level again, which underscores the strong sustained service level delivery, the strong sustained clinical delivery, the strong sustained overall cost delivery and continued investment from an innovation standpoint. And as articulated at I-Day we expect fundamentally to grow that portfolio businesses in 2020 aided by outstanding retention as well as new business growth.","To the last part of your question, no, we don't believe or see any unique pent up volume for our fees being held back versus not because you're dealing with large sophisticated helpline contracts, large sophisticated commercial employer contracts that are typically on a multiyear cycle. So we do not see a bubble coming on the immediate horizon from that standpoint and see our value proposition is resonating very well as evidenced the growth in 2019 and our growth outlook for 2027.","Eric, I'll ask you to take the second question. ","Eric Palmer","Sure. A.J., just on your seasonality, we're not providing a specific guidance in terms of third quarter versus fourth quarter. But there are a handful of items I\u2019d point you to as you think about the expectations over the back part of the year. ","First of all, our Integrated Medical segment, as you know, has income that tends to be bias towards the early part of the year, just given the normal seasonal impact of deductibles and such. Second of all, the Health Services business tends to be biased later in the year due to both customer behavior and growth in script volumes and just the timing of generic launches. And we've talked about the ramp that we\u2019re on 1Q to 2Q to Q3 to Q4 over the year for that business.","And additionally, this year specifically, you should expect the synergies to continue to build throughout the year and the impact of deleveraging to continue to play through the corporate segment over the course of the year. So those will be the major moving items that I\u2019d think about as we look sequentially into the next couple of quarters.","A.J. Rice","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Rice. Our next question comes from David Windley with Jefferies. You may ask your question. ","David Stybloin","Hi, there. Good morning. It's Dave Stybloin for Windley. Just want to come back to the MLR. It sounds like overall that was largely in-line with how you guys were thinking it would be. I guess, maybe you could help us understand how it's changed a little bit in the first couple of quarters because as we look at that in the first quarter, it was up 140 basis points year-over-year, and then this quarter, it's up 260 basis points. So wondering, what explains that increase? And then, I guess, guidance implies for the rest of the year that it would come back down to right around 200 basis points. So, maybe just understanding the cadence of the spike up in 2Q would be helpful.","Eric Palmer","Dave, it's Eric. So just on those pieces, I think you've got the math right there in terms of the moving pieces and the components. The things I would point you toward would be just the timing of which the prior year reserve development has kind of unfolded and in year development of cost, this year's second quarter versus last year's second quarter. Last year's second quarter, we had more in year development in the second quarter than we had this year, just to given the favor ability that we experienced an individual book of business last year.","So I really think of it more as an adjustment to the last year first Q -- first quarter to second quarter dynamic versus anything else going on this year, broadly would characterize the loss ratio dynamics in our second quarter this year is aligned with our expectations.","David Stybloin","Okay, great. Thanks. And then any quick color on the national accounts since the enrollments been down sequentially, both in the first couple quarters is there something on the competitive front side or maybe just elaborate there on the erosion?","David Cordani","Good morning, it's David. So specific to national accounts first in the commercial space, so not in the server side of the equation, but in the commercial space. Let me remind you how we define national accounts because we define it differently than the marketplace. It\u2019s commercial only 5,000 or more employees that are multi-state. So very specifically that excludes large single state blocks of business where that's a fundamental part of our middle market business.","For the past year we saw an elevated RFP volume, the cycle we are in, we saw a little bit more elevated RFP volume. We saw reasonable retention levels across our portfolio and reasonable new penetration levels in the portfolio and some new business wins, which resulted in some net overall loss in the portfolio.","I would note that our strategy have continuing to deepen our relationship in our clients is working well. So we're deepening the relationship in our existing national account clients with our specialty portfolio, which result in more value we can deliver for them, as well as an enhanced overall earnings profile.","We do not see an overall change in the market behavior from a purchasing standpoint. We do not see any unique different value propositions resonating in the market. We just saw a little lower retention level and a little lower new business adds for 2019 than we had anticipated.","Operator","Thank you Mr. Windley. Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. You may ask your question.","Steven Valiquette","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So not to beat the MLR topic with that. But since you did sort of touch on seasonality and sequential comparison factors, with the 2Q MLR coming in slightly above the full year range and was it always contemplated, internally assuming that 2Q would be above the full year range. And should we expect that sort of seasonal pattern on an annual basis going forward?","And then just quickly within the individual medical business since you flag that just in the context of the MLR, curious if you received any sort of risk adjustment true up in 2Q 2019 and how that might have compared versus anything you've received in the same quarter last year. And was right in line with your expectations? Thanks.","Eric Palmer","Steve, it's Eric. So overall, with respect to the loss ratio, we continue to be on track for our full year guidance. We've got good visibility to achieving the loss ratio guidance. So, no change there. And as I pointed out, the dynamics in terms of the second quarter were fully contemplated.","Now, specifically on a risk adjustment true up, we did record a risk adjustment item in the individual business in the second quarter this year, order of magnitude $40 million to $50 million pre-tax. So -- and that's an unfavorable true up, that was in the result this year. But again, in line with the expectations in terms of the margin being a bit more compressed in the individual business this year. And we continue to be on track for the full year outlook.","Steven Valiquette","Okay.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Valiquette. Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is Alexa [ph] in for Ricky. Thanks for taking my question. Just to clarify, you guys talked about third quarter being up single digits from an adjusted EBITDA per script perspective. That include the influencing of the Cigna business, or is that just on an apples-to-apples basis?","Eric Palmer","Alexa, it's Eric. So just to be clear, we did not say on a per script basis. We just talked about the aggregate dollars reported in the Health Services segment compared to an adjusted or recast, Express Scripts number to get it to an apples-to-apples basis. We're just talking about the total adjusted income from operations pre-tax will have growth in Health Services segment in the third quarter.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Goldwasser. Our next question comes from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. You may ask your question","Lance Wilkes","Yes, just a couple clarifications or questions on the PBM more on the Health Services segment. For the strength you shown in specialty pharmacy, could you just talk a little bit about how you're achieving that if that is related to sort of supply chain initiatives or steerage and leakage or if it is more OpEx kind of synergies related to consolidation with the Cigna book? And then, I guess, also just interested in your outlook for cross sales in PBM for 2020, in particular, with a stronger capability as you look up market in that segment?","David Cordani ","Hi Lance, it's David. First specific to specialty pharmacy, we're extremely pleased with the performance of our specialty pharmacy services that are delivered through Accredo. Just stepping back for a moment, as you know we deliver an exceptional patient clinical outcome and service outcome one patient at a time. And as such work to deliver the right affordability outcome and our overall costs outcome leads the industry from that standpoint. And this is a validation of the kind of satisfaction level. We have NPS approaching 80 patients that are in our high clinical coordination programs.","As it relates to the growth, think about underlying fundamental growth. So in addition to specialty pharmaceutical costs being the fastest cost growth sector. We have deepening relationships in terms of growing the overall portfolio, legacy attached to the PBM business, we start to convert over the Cigna business. And then importantly, because of the robustness of the Accredo value proposition, Accredo is sold on a standalone basis on a day-in day-out basis to both employers as well as health plans in terms of helping to coordinate the specialty services. ","So strong underlying fundamentals is what you should think about growing it. Not expenses or otherwise through that lens. ","As it relates to your forward looking question, we do say the opportunity for further -- to your point either cross seller penetration opportunities. Because we're able to get the best of both companies. indisputably we get both more structural flexibility in terms of benefit and solution design, attached to the broad portfolio of Express Scripts capabilities, as well as even a further step function to the overall affordability proposition and clinical services proposition.","And we believe to your point that will serve us well, if you will, up market as it relates to cross selling, that standalone value proposition continues to resonate, it continues to resonate in the health plan marketplace, and some of those capabilities will help our commercial sector as well.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Wilkes. Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. You may ask your question.","Charles Rhyee","Yes, thanks. Just two quick ones here. One, can you give us a sense on sort of the pacing we should think about as the -- as you kind of in-source your -- the signal volumes onto the Express platform. And how should we still break it up between maybe think about it between third quarter and fourth quarter the models?","And then, secondly, I apologize, I missed it earlier. Can you give your thoughts on sort of the Senate Finance Committee bill here, particularly as it relates to Part D, sort of the re-envisioning how the structure of it getting rid of the donor hole putting more a larger catastrophic and what that means sort of from the plan perspective, and do you think that that will lead to more utilization as a result of lower cost for seniors? Thanks. ","Eric Palmer","Charles, it\u2019s Eric. I'll start on the kind of pacing item. We haven't provided any specific expectations there other than just the aggregate numbers that we\u2019ve talked about. So as I noted in my prepared remarks, think about the in-sourcing is worth $1.5 billion over the back half of the year, and $40 million to $45 million in scripts coming through over the back half of the year associated with the transition. I'd also refer you back to the material we used at our Investor Day a couple of months back now in terms of the complete impact once we get to 2021, in terms of the volumes and such there.","I\u2019ll let David take the second part of your question.","David Cordani","Charles, good morning. As it relates to specifically the Senate Finance bill or if you step back more broadly, continues to be a significant amount of public policy and legislative activity under consideration that seeks to improve overall affordability and improve specifically overall affordability relative to pharmaceutical services.","Everything we are seeking to do in terms of leveraging the best of both companies is seeking to deliver improved affordability off of a basis of strength. So, importantly, directionally aligned with the initiatives to seek to improve more affordability and choice from that standpoint.","As it relates to the specificity of your question down to PDP, donut hole, et cetera. Once the final terms of a bill, if a bill was to be passed, or determined, we would obviously react an engage from that standpoint. I think more broadly, I'd asked you to think about the capabilities the corporation has are well positioned to make sure we're able to deliver the best possible value, in this case for individual Medicare PDP customers over whether it's pre-donut hole, during donut hole or post donut hole from that standpoint, from a framing around the clinical coordination, access and overall affordability standpoint.","So we're highly engaged and aligned with improving overall affordability. And the structure of our technology and innovative solutions puts us in good position, not just to react to but actually be in a leadership position as the programs change.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Rhyee. Our last question comes from David McDonald with SunTrust. You may ask your question.","David McDonald","Good morning. David, just two quick questions. First on the PBM selling ciders and anything of note that you would call out in terms of plan design changes that you guys are seeing? And I guess to build on Lance's question, are you continuing to see narrowing of specialty networks in the business that you can?","And then secondly, any initiatives in terms of trying to drive incremental mail, just given the likely adherence benefits and the connectivity opportunity it offers with the patients, especially the chronics?","David Cordani","David, good morning. So, a variety of attributes in your question. Stepping back, our orientation relative to benefit design, specialty design, mail order incentive, or design, et cetera. It's a one client at a time approach. ","So I'll try to give you a macro piece, but really importantly, we do not go to market with a product or a preferred solution offering and try to force it, we try to work one client at a time, whether it's a commercial client or health plan client from that standpoint, and try to design what works for them based upon the strategy, the culture, the need set, et cetera. And to your point, we pull from a broad portfolio of capabilities around that.","As it relates to design, more receptivity today than ever relative to pursuing value based care or value based reward configurations, especially in the specialty environment. That may lead to a little bit more focused on some of the subspecialties and recall that Accredo is not for example, one Specialty Pharmacy, there\u2019s 15 sub-specialty pharmacies within that that specialize based on health or disease burden from that standpoint.","Similarly as it comes to mail, you're correct, the -- it's indisputable the dispensing accuracy and the clinical compliance is higher in that highly coordinated fashion of what's delivered there. And in many cases, clients are revisiting that seeking a further step function or value creation for the benefit of their employees, our customers or our patients. And we see good receptivity around that.","But I can't tell you that mail order is kind of binary going from more intensified approach in 2020 than it was in 2019. There is receptivity, but it's client-by-client from that standpoint. And we think that's an inherent strength of our company to be consultative from that standpoint.","Operator","Thank you Mr. McDonald. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks.","David Cordani","Thank you. So briefly just to wrap up our call, I'd like to highlight some of the key points from our discussion. Overall, we're very pleased with our second quarter results, which continue to demonstrate momentum across our portfolio of businesses. ","We are also making very good progress against each of our integration priorities and are on track to achieve our integration goals.","Looking ahead, our second quarter results and our integration progress gives us confidence to again raise our revenue and earnings outlook for 2019, representing a 17% to 19% EPS growth rate off of Cigna's strong 2018 performance. ","And we are on track to deliver our $20 to $21 EPS objective in 2021 as we expect to deliver 10% to 13% on average annual EPS growth over the long-term. In addition, we continue to drive cost trend to a level in line with CPI by 2021. We thank you for joining our call today.

Please go ahead, Mr. McDowell.","William McDowell","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I am Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me this morning are; David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric Palmer, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Eric will cover a number of topics including Cigna's full-year 2018 financial results, as well as our financial outlook for 2019.","As noted in our earnings release when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues with are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income and total revenues respectively is contained in today's earnings release which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com.","We use the term labeled Adjusted Income from Operations and Earnings Per Share on this same basis as our principle measures of financial performance. In our remarks today we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2019 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.","Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. First I remind you that we recently announced changes in our segment reporting. These changes were made to align with the company's organizational structure following the completion of the combination with Express Scripts on December 20, 2018. In connection with this change, Cigna's results are now reported through the following five segments; Integrated Medical, Health Services, International Markets, Group Disability and Other, and finally Corporate.","As previously disclosed, Cigna has also updated our financial reporting practices as follows: first, we exclude contributions from transitioning clients from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenue, transitioning clients reflect contributions from Anthem and Coventry and their clients. Second, at the segment level, adjusted income from operations is now reported on a pretax basis to better align with corporate and segment management team responsibilities.","Third, when Eric discusses our expense ratio, he is referring to our consolidated selling, general and administrative expense ratio, which is calculated by dividing Cigna's total selling, general and administrative expenses excluding special items and expenses from when transitioning clients by Cigna's consolidated adjusted revenues. And fourth, the company's financial statements are now reported on the basis of Article 5 of Regulation S-X which is the general standard for service companies and the basis used by our largest managed care competitors.","Previously Cigna's financial statements were reported under Article 7 general used by insurance companies. The reporting updates I have just described enables Cigna to continue to provide high-quality transparent financial reporting to the investment community. In Cigna's earnings release and financial supplement issued this morning, these changes have been applied retrospectively to facilitate comparisons to prior periods and I want to stress that as a result of these segment changes and reclassifications, there is no change to our historically reported consolidated shareholders net income, consolidated adjusted income from operations, earnings per share, shareholders equity or cash flows.","Moving to results in the quarter, in the fourth quarter we recorded special items totaling to a charge of $389 million or $1.48 per share primarily to reflect the impact of merger-related transaction costs. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues in our discussion of financial results. Please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance including our full year 2019 outlook, we will do so on a basis that reflects on new basis of segment reporting and the addition of financial reporting updates I have described this morning and excludes the impact of any future share repurchases or prior year development of medical costs.","Finally, I remind you that Cigna will be hosting our upcoming Investor Day on May 31, in New York City.","With that, I will turn the call over to David.","David Cordani","Thanks Will. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call today. I'll begin my comments with highlight from our exceptional 2018 financial results with Cigna delivering substantial revenue and earnings growth across our businesses. I will also review how our combination with Express Scripts further strengthens the affordability of our programs, expands choice for those who we serve. Then I'll offer initial insights into our exceptional expectations for 2019 before Eric addresses our full-year 2018 financial results and 2019 outlook in more detail. Eric and I will take your questions after which I'll wrap up our call with a few closing comments.","Let's dive in to review some of our performance highlights from last year where we delivered strong revenue and earnings growth. Our full-year consolidated adjusted revenue increased by 15% to $48 billion and we reported full-year adjusted income from operations of $3.6 billion or $14.22 per share representing a per share increase of 36%. These results were driven by substantial growth in contributions across each of our businesses including strong retention levels, the continued expansion and deepening of our customer and client relationships, and solid new growth across our portfolio.","Cigna also delivered industry-leading medical cost trend for the sixth consecutive year. Our sustained market-leading performance will further be strengthened as we integrate and leverage the core capabilities of Express Scripts. Express Scripts concluded 2018 with continued strong performance and delivered its lowest commercial pharmacy trend on record of 0.4% details of which will be provided next week in our annual Drug Trend Report. Express Scripts also achieved better than 98% client retention for 2019 all while continuing to invest in innovations to benefit customers, patients, clients, as well as healthcare providers.","Overall Cigna delivered very strong results in 2018 with growth across our portfolio of businesses. Our continued growth reflects Cigna's proven approach to service integration and how it delivers real value for the benefit of our customers, patient, clients and healthcare provider partners.","Our recent report on the value of integration which was externally validated show the clients with Cigna medical, pharmacy, and behavioral benefits reduce annual medical costs by an average of $645 for each person with an identified health improvement opportunity. Savings can increase to nearly $10,000 for individuals with certain chronic conditions. As we look forward, Cigna is evolving our definition and approach to integration, driven by the insights we gain from a deeper understanding of our customers, as well as the broader capabilities from our Express Scripts combination.","Our approach to integration focuses on the coordination of services around the individual and their whole person health needs; both body and mind. This approach also further expands choice to accesses available anytime anywhere based on our customer and patient's needs and preferences. To do this we must remove friction and help our customers and patients connect to the services which are best aligned to their health status.","In an environment where some are restricting access in order to nearly drive affordability, at Cigna we see an opportunity to further expand customer choice and to make it easier for people to access the health services they need, how and when they need them. This includes accessing care in a doctor's office, an urgent care center, a retail setting or an employer clinic or for more acute needs at a facility-based setting such as a hospital or outpatient service center. Increasingly, at home in a coordinated fashion and through digital platforms that are linked with the healthcare professionals.","This choice-based delivery model also allows us to guide our customers and patients toward solutions that help the healthy stay healthy, better predicting address risk factors for the healthy at risk and ensure we deliver affordable high quality healthcare choices for the chronically ill as well as those facing acute conditions. Making it easier for our customers and patients is important, but is also critical for healthcare provider partners.","At Cigna, we see our roles being the connective tissue that links customers and patients with the healthcare providers in order to help them improve their health and well-being. We continue to partner align with and enable healthcare providers rather than seeking to own, compete with or disintermediate them. Our combination with Express Scripts strengthens and accelerates our focus on coordinating services around our individual customers and patient needs.","One of the steps that is essential for Cigna to unlock additional value for stakeholders is the effective integration and leveraging of Express Scripts' capabilities. Our immediate priority is to ensure we deliver on our commitments to customers, patients and clients in 2019 and our position to do so in 2020. This includes the strong service delivery we were able to create in January 2009 an important implementation period.","I couldn\u2019t be more proud and appreciative of our teams' focus, passion, and delivery as we stepped into 2019. As a health service company we see our 74,000 coworkers around the world as the greatest asset we have in carrying out our mission and delivering exceptional value for those we serve.","As we move through 2019 and beyond with a focus on improving affordability, expanding choice, and broadening our reach, we have three key areas of focus; first, to optimize the significant medical and pharmacy costs synergy opportunities which will directly benefit our customers, patients, and clients and help to improve affordability; second, to harness the breadth and depth of our combined data to better predict and identify conditions or behaviors and improve connectivity between our customers, patients, and healthcare providers; and third, to leverage new growth opportunities and expand reach across our businesses as we enter new geographies and broaden our solution portfolio.","Let me use Accredo as an example of how we will create real value in improving affordability and leveraging data, the first two items I referenced. Accredo, Express Scripts' specialty pharmacy business brings a comprehensive patient-centered care model to improving, prescribing, adherence, and clinical program coordination. Accredo has more than 500 specialty pharmacists and a field force of 550 nurses providing in-home care across the United States.","In fact, an Accredo at-home nurse is within just one hour of a home visit for 85% of Americans today. Cigna plans to begin leveraging specialty pharma services from Accredo in 2019 to deliver affordability improvements and better health outcomes for our customers and clients. Considering the specialty pharmacy is the fastest growing cost category in healthcare today, this will create clear and meaningful affordability benefits.","Second, when looking at leveraging data, today Accredo and Express Scripts apply advanced informatics to identify patients who are likely to be non-adherent or have demonstrable gaps in care. For example, Bluetooth-enabled health monitoring devices tied to blood glucose monitors or rescue inhalers track patient's health in real-time basis and trigger targeted outreach and support.","Moving forward, we will further strengthen and deepen the actionable sites for this type of pharmacy data by connecting with our medical and behavioral data. Additionally, we will share resulting insights with our collaborative accountable care physician partners to further improve their patients health outcomes. Connecting our physician partners with these actionable insights is especially important when supporting people who suffer from chronic conditions.","For example, those with chronic conditions are seven times more likely to suffer from depression and as many as six in 10 Americans live with at least one chronic condition, all of which further demonstrate the importance of effectively leveraging medical, pharmacy, and behavioral data to drive better health.","Building on the consultative selling success, Cigna and Express Scripts teams, our teams are already on a targeted basis identify and pursuing new enterprise growth opportunities. An example includes expanding PBM services for some health plans that we currently serve through Cigna's payer business. Additionally, we have already engaged in targeted expansion opportunities for Cigna health management capabilities to be offered to Express Scripts health plan clients. Taken as a whole, our integration and value creation initiatives are off to a very strong start and we look forward to discussing this in more depths with you at our Investor Day on May 31.","Before I close, let me briefly comment on our 2019 outlook. Our growth [indiscernible] has a proven track record of delivery and provides multiple paths for sustained growth in 2019 and beyond. For 2019 we expect revenue growth, attractive EPS growth, and strong free cash flows, all positioning us to deliver 15% average annual EPS growth over the next three years and enabling us to achieve our $20 to $21 EPS target in 2021.","To conclude, our team, strategic framework, along with capital position and significant free cash flow position us to lead in an environment of continuous change, improve affordability, expand choice and enhance predictability for our customers, patients, and clients all while focusing on treating the whole person; both body and mind. We are positioned to continue delivering attractive sustainable growth. We have significant strategic flexibility and financial flexibility and high visibility towards achieving our 2021 EPS target of $20 to $21 per share.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Eric.","Eric Palmer","Thanks, David. Good morning everyone. In my remarks today I will review Cigna's 2018 results and provide our outlook for 2019. Key consolidated financial highlights for 2018 include adjusted revenue growth of 15% to $48 billion, earnings growth of 33% to $3.6 billion after-tax, earnings per share growth of 36% to $14.22, and continued strong operating cash flow. These results reflect the underlying strength of our business and provide us with considerable momentum as we drive growth and advance our integration priorities in 2019.","Regarding our segments, I'll first comment on Integrated Medical. 2018 revenues grew 13% to $33 billion, driven by commercial customer growth and expansion of specialty relationships, as well as premium growth reflecting underlying cost trends. We ended 2018 with $17 million global medical customers driven by an organic increase of $584,000 lives led by growth in our select, middle-market and government segments.","As we completed our eighth consecutive year of organic medical customer growth, we continue to grow in both risk and ASO funding arrangements with a highly consultative approach that aligns affordable solutions with the needs of our customers and clients. Full-year earnings grew 20% to $3.5 billion on a pretax basis reflecting growth in medical customers and specialty relationships, continued effective medical cost management, and favorability in our U.S. individual business.","Turning to medical costs, for our total U.S. commercial book of business full-year medical cost trend for 2018 was 3.6%. We are pleased to have delivered industry-leading medical cost trend results for a sixth consecutive year and we are focused on further expanding our capabilities to improve health outcomes and medical cost performance which drives increased value for customers and clients as they continue to confront challenges with the affordability of healthcare.","Our combination with Express Scripts accelerates our ability to create that value enabling us to drive further personalization of services and deeper engagement and collaboration with customers, patients, clients and healthcare professional partners. Our total medical care ratio or MCR of 78.9% for full-year 2018 reflects the continued effectiveness of our medical cost management capabilities in both our commercial and government businesses, favorability in our U.S. individual business, and the pricing effect of the resumption of the health insurance tax.","Full-year 2018 Integrated Medical earnings benefitted from $97 million pretax a favorable net prior year reserve development including $8 million of favorable prior year development in the fourth quarter. I would note that Days Claims Payable or DCP was 40.7 at December 31, for the Integrated Medical segment, reflecting an increase of 0.7 days over the prior year and a decline of 2.9 days sequentially due to the normal fourth quarter claim payment seasonality in our STAR+PLUS business and consistent with prior years.","Days Claims Payable is generally lower for the Integrated Medical segment than for our previous Global Healthcare segment as a result of the reclassification of International Healthcare Products which had higher than average Days Claims Payable due to longer claim payment cycles. That business transitioned to the International Market segment. Overall, Cigna's Integrated Medical segment delivered very strong financial results in 2018.","Turning to our Health Services business, full-year 2018 revenues were $6.6 billion and pretax earnings were $380 million. Results for 2018 reflect solid performance from Cigna's mail order pharmacy operations and support of our integrated value proposition and contributions from Express Scripts business following the close of the combination on December 20.","Turning to our International Markets business, our full-year 2018 results reflect continued attractive growth and profitability as revenue grew to $5.4 billion, an increase of 9% and full-year 2018 pretax earnings grew 12% to $735 million, reflecting solid business growth, continued administrative efficiency, and strategic investments for long-term growth.","For our Group Disability and Other Operations segment, full-year 2018 revenues were $5.1 billion. Full-year pretax earnings for this segment increased to $529 million with strong performance from our life business offset by unfavorable disability claims. Overall, Cigna delivered strong growth and profitability in 2018 across each of our growth platforms.","As I turn to a discussion of our outlook for 2019 and specifically our expectations for continued attractive growth relative to our 2018 performance, I will start by highlighting the headwinds and tailwinds that we've quantified previously. Specifically, the 2018 earnings per share performance should be adjusted for the following three items; a reduction of $0.40 per share of U.S. individual business outperformance, a reduction of $0.30 per share of favorable prior-year reserve development, and finally an increase of $0.20 per share associated with the industry tax, was in place for 2018 but is suspended for 2019. While adjusting for these impacts, Cigna's 2018 earnings per share was $13.72.","As we continue to drive strong value for our customers and clients, we step into 2019 with momentum in each of our businesses. We remain intently focused on delivering on our promises to the marketplace of outstanding service delivery and clinical quality, continued innovation, and deepened customer and client relationships, all while we continue to advance our integration priorities.","I would remind you that our outlook for 2019 adjusted revenues and adjusted income from operations excludes contributions from transitioning clients. For full-year 2019 we expect consolidated adjusted revenues in the range of $131.5 billion to $133.5 billion. We expect full year 2019 consolidated adjusted income from operations to be $6.2 billion to $6.4 billion or $16 to $16.50 per share. This represents very attractive growth in the range of 17% to 20% over our 2018 baseline.","We would expect the cadence of earnings per share in 2019 to be approximately 45% in the first have and 55% in the second half of the year, taking into consideration seasonality patterns within our businesses with our Health Services segment in particular, driving a greater proportion of its earnings in the second half of 2019, as well as continued progress on realization of administrative expense synergies throughout the year.","For 2019 we also project an expense ratio in the range of 10% to 10.5%, which reflects ongoing efficiencies and administrative expense synergies in line with our previous estimate of $112 million pretax. I would also note that our outlook includes approximately $200 million pretax of temporarily stranded operating costs associated with Anthem's early termination of pharmacy services. For 2019 we project a consolidated adjusted tax rate in the range of 23.5% to 24.5%. Additionally, our outlook excludes any contribution from future share repurchases as well as prior year reserve development.","I'll now discuss our 2019 outlook for the Integrated Medical and Health Services segments. We expect full-year Integrated Medical pretax earnings in the range of $3.65 billion to $3.80 billion. This outlook reflects strength and growth in our businesses driven by continued benefits from organic customer growth, deepening of customer relationships, and effective medical cost management. This outlook also contemplates a return to more normalized margins in our U.S. individual business.","Key assumptions reflected in our Integrated Medical earnings outlook for 2019 include the following; regarding Global Medical customers we expect 2019 growth in the range of 300,000 to 400,000 customers, driven by continued strong customer and client retention and new growth in our commercial business, as well as mid-single-digit percentage growth in Medicare advantage enrollments and our outlook for medical customer growth also contemplates an expected enrollment decline in our U.S. individual business of approximately 70,000 customers.","Turning to medical costs, for our U.S commercial employer book of business we expect full-year 2019 medical cost trend to be in the range of 3.5% to 4.5% with the expected increase over 2018 full-year trend due to expected higher utilization of services as well as continued benefits from our initiatives to improve affordability, including those we are further enabling through the combination with Express Scripts.","We expect the 2019 medical care ratio to be in the range of 80.5% to 81.5% reflecting continued strong performance of our commercial and government businesses, the impact of the health insurance tax suspension in 2019, as well as changes in business mix. For our Health Services business we expect full-year 2019 pretax earnings in the range of $5.05 billion to $5.2 billion. For 2019 we expect adjusted pharmacy claims in the range of 1.17 billion to 1.19 billion claims.","I would note that this range includes all claim volumes associated with Cigna's mail-order and specialty pharmacy operations in addition to claims associated with the acquired Express Scripts business. Our 2019 guidance range is consistent with Express Scripts previous expectations of 2% to 3% growth in core adjusted pharmacy claims. Our guidance does not include Cigna pharmacy claim volumes we expect to transition from OptumRx and consistent with all of our key performance metrics, this guidance range does not include pharmacy claim volumes associated with transitioning clients.","We also expect strong growth in contributions from our International Markets, Group Disability and Other businesses as they continue to deliver more personalized and affordable solutions for the benefit of those we serve.","Regarding interest expense, we expect total costs of approximately $1.7 billion pretax in 2019 inclusive of approximately $900 million of incremental interest associated with the financing of the combination with Express Scripts in the Corporate segment. All in, for full-year 2019, we expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $6.2 billion to $6.4 billion or $16 to $16.5 per share. This represents 17% to 20% growth over our 2018 baseline.","I would also remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of future share repurchases and prior year reserve development. Overall these expected results represent a very attractive outlook aided by strong performance of our diverse and differentiated portfolio of businesses and the highly accretive combination with Express Scripts. These expected results are also consistent with our multiyear growth outlook and position us well to achieve our 2021 earnings per share target of $20 to $21 per share.","Now moving to our 2019 capital management position and outlook, our subsidiaries remain well-capitalized and we expect them to continue to drive exceptional free cash flow with strong returns on capital even as we continue reinvesting to support long-term growth and innovation. In 2018 we deployed $130 million of parent company cash to repay current maturities of long-term debt. We completed our debt offering to finance the combination with Express Scripts and we repurchased $1.6 million shares of stock for $329 million with the resumption of share repurchase following the close of the combination.","We ended 2018 with a debt to capitalization ratio of 50.9%. As previously discussed, our top capital deployment priority is accelerated debt repayment with the objective of returning our debt to capitalization ratio to the upper 30s and debt to EBITDA ration in the mid 2s within the next 18 to 24 months. For 2019 we project capital available for deployment of approximately $6.2 billion. In 2019 we expect to deploy approximately $4.2 billion to debt repayment and approximately $0.8 billion to capital expenditures.","As we have communicated previously, while we reduce leverage over the next two years we expect to also have capacity for additional capital deployment which could be allocated toward reinvestment back into our businesses to drive further innovation and growth, strategic M&A on a targeted basis and\/or returning capital to shareholders primarily through share repurchase. In January 2019 we repurchased $1.1 million shares for $209 million. Our balance sheet and free cash flow outlook remained strong benefiting from a highly efficient service-based orientation that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and returns on capital.","Now to recap, our full-year 2018 consolidated results reflect considerable strength and momentum across our diversified portfolio of global businesses and continued effective execution of our focused strategy. The fundamentals of our business is strong and we have entered 2019 intently focused on delivering on our commitments to the marketplace, while we advance our integration priorities, and are well positioned to achieve the attractive financial targets we've established for 2019 through 2021. We are confident in our ability to achieve our full-year 2019 earnings outlook and have strong visibility into our $20 to $21 earnings per share target for 2021 which represents a 15% average annual growth rate over the next three years.","With that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. You may ask your question.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thanks, good morning. Just hoping you could help with the bridge or the underlying assumptions a bit more within the guidance. I know you mentioned the jumping off point being closer to 1372. I think in the past you talked about sort of high single digit growth in the legacy Cigna business.","Even if we use 7% that's kind of 1465 and I think at the time of the deal you said core Express would be mid teens accretive, which I think is at least $2 dollars sort of in incremental and would sort of suggest above the high end of guidance. So just hoping you could maybe help with where that's off or if something has changed from your initial view and just the assumption in underlying core performance between the segments? Thanks.","David Michael","It's David, good morning. Let me frame and offer for Eric to add on to my framing. First, big picture for 2019, our outlook is in line with our planned expectations broadly speaking and puts us on the trajectory to deliver on our 2021 commitment of $20 to $21 of EPS. Two, I appreciate you walking through the bridge. You take the core portfolio, the core legacy Cigna portfolio is performing well and will continue to perform well. We step into 2019 with strong performance within Express Scripts from that standpoint, not to grapple with you on the math, but you are about right, it is about $2 going back to the announcement.","I would just point you to one additional data point, Eric emphasized and highlighted the fact that within our assumption for 2019 right now is approximately $200 million before tax of temporally stranded overhead tied to the early termination that's temporary. We will eradicate that through three mechanisms; one, execution of EBI which remains on track, but there'll be some temporary dislocation; two, additional leverage from organic growth; and three, the significant capacity leverage that will be created as we utilize Express Scripts for the Cigna volumes over the near term future. So when you pull all that together we are on track both delivering an outstanding result in 2019 of 17% to 20% of EPS growth even including that stranded overhead. Eric, anything I missed?","Eric Palmer","I think those are the major headlines David. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Giacobbe. The next question comes from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","A.J. Rice","Thanks, and thanks for all the comments around guidance. I guess you guys are the first guys to have a conference call since the HHS release last night, so I'll probably ask you about that since that's a top, the main topic for a lot of us. Can you \u2013 there is a lot of aspects to that. I guess I would just ask you broadly, do you see any particular challenges there, opportunities or what would the key open questions from that proposal be?","And then always the question, I know HHS is saying they don't have the regulatory authority to implement anything in the commercial market, but if this goes forward, do you think we'll maintain a 2-Tier system where the Medicare Part D will have its one set, and the commercial market will stay pretty much as it is, any thoughts around those or sense will be helpful?","David Cordani","A.J. good morning it\u2019s David. So just appreciate the questions. Stepping back we are 100% committed to providing affordable, high quality health and wellbeing services to our customers, patients and clients in the U.S. and across the globe. A key driving force behind our strategic combination with Express Scripts is to further improve on affordability and we built off our strength with another year of outstanding medical cost trend in the Cigna business portfolio of 3.6% six years in a row and just a phenomenal result in the Express Scripts portfolio at 0.4% pharmacy trend.","The headline number one is, the proposed rebate rule will not have a meaningful impact on our growth or earnings trajectory. Specifically, as you noted, the proposed rule as will be evaluated over the next 60 days applies to Medicare Advantage and PDP. The mechanisms that exist in terms of the way rates are built up for Medicare Advantage as well as PDP largely by design, flow and respect, the rebates and pass through the way the rates are billed. So we don't see a major implication [ph] to that business portfolio. And then inferred in your comment, it does not apply to the commercial marketplace.","We do see some opportunities in the proposed rule as articulated. For example, it provides a mechanism to even further accelerate value based care programs with the pharmaceutical manufacturers. You'll recall from the day we announced our proposed combination on March 8th we talked about that as an important initiative that we passionately believe in. This will provide some further accelerant to that, as well as potentially open up some additional chassis to work with pharmaceutical manufacturers to get better alignment. But big picture, we do not see it having a material effect on the business portfolios configured and are on track to deliver the 17% to 20% EPS growth in 2019.","A.J. Rice","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Rice. The next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Your line is open.","Josh Raskin","Hi, thanks good morning. First one is just a clarification, are you guys saying that Express is indeed $2 accretive in 2019 as part of the guidance and then the rest is legacy core with the $200 million of stranded? And then my real question is, just the combined company and sort of when do you come to market with that pitch? And I know you guys have been laying the foundation for that integrated approach, but when does sort of that broker\/consultants education begin, when does the large employer group starting to hear that and when do you think that actually starts resonating, how do we start thinking about changes in direction around membership growth especially on the on the U.S. commercial side?","Eric Palmer","Hey Josh, it\u2019s Eric, I'll take the first part of the question. I think to the nearest dollar, $2 is probably the right number that\u2019s actually a little bit less than that, so we think of it in the $1.50 to $2 range in terms of the accretion from the Express Scripts acquisition for next year. David I'll let you take the other portion of the question.","David Cordani","Josh, first specific to the go-to-market proposition, important to note that each portfolio and each platform is performing well and growing well. We're delighted that we're able to step into 2019 with very strong growth within the ESI portfolio and another year of strong organic growth within the Cigna portfolio.","Additionally, important to highlight as it relates to growth as we look even to 2020 within our organization growth starts with outstanding retention, deepening of relationships in addition of new business relationships. Within the Express Scripts portfolio they'll be a lower percentage of their business that's out the bid for 2020 than was for 2019 and you recall a phenomenal retention result for 2019.","Think about that as about 30% less business out today for 2020 versus 2019. The early look in that has the health plan part of the portfolio which is the earlier part of the portfolio, that is up for renewal in terms of the decision making process and we're pretty well through that process with all of them clients thus far making decisions renewing and no known losses from that standpoint, so strong platform.","We'll step forward through 2019 and 2020 with evolve value propositions to answer the core of your question. Interactions are starting to take place with the broker and consulting community and that will happen in a phased mechanism. There will not be a singular new product offering that is pushed on the market, rather additional capabilities that will offer more choice, both through the legacy of the Cigna distribution model, as well as through the Express Script distribution model, so strong foundation an early look at outstanding retention, stepping into 2020 within the Express portfolio already today and then emerging momentum around expanding choice as we sit here in 2019 with building momentum to 2020.","Josh Raskin","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Raskin. The next question comes from Gary Taylor with J.P. Morgan. You may ask your question.","Gary Taylor","Hi, good morning. I just had a question around the new Healthcare Services segment, the guidance of $5.05 billion to $5.2 billion, can you tell us what growth that would represent year-over-year, what legacy Cigna PBM plus Express would represent essentially because might sort of back of the envelope looks like that would be flat to down slightly, but there is obviously some disclosure we don't quite have?","Eric Palmer","It\u2019s Eric. A number of moving pieces in there, so probably not constructive to walk through all of the different kind of ins and outs and dynamics there. Fundamentally, we've got growth reflected in terms of the operations that make up the Health Services segment as well as the Integrated Medical segments there is good growth in both, but really not able to kind of pull the pieces apart on the call today.","David Cordani","And Gary, it\u2019s David. I just want to add on and maybe we'll ask Will and team to followup with you afterward. As the new business segments are configured you may recall and I know it's all net new is, a portion of the Cigna pharmacy business for example has moved into the Health Service business, the mail order aspect et cetera, however the integrated aspects of the pharmacy business remain in the Integrated Health portfolio. So we could take that offline with you and follow up to walk through the pieces, but at the end of the day there's solid organic growth in both of those portfolios driven by our retention and expansion relationships and the net new business adds.","Gary Taylor","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Taylor. The next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question.","Justin Lake","Thanks, good morning. I just wanted to clean up the $200 million commentary and then I had a question. So to be perfectly clear, you're saying that 2019 is carrying this overhead reduction of this $200 million. Is that the total number of lost overhead contribution from Anthem or is there going to be more in 2020?","Eric Palmer","Justin it's Eric. So I think of the $200 million as the amount stranded in 2019 associated with the transitional time at about $0.40 earnings per share. Ultimately, as that business transitions we will hit those costs out of the system. We're on track for our $20 to $21 in 2021. The final exact timing will play out in terms of cost coming out this year versus next year as the Anthem works through their transition plan and such. But again, think of that as the amount we've estimated for this year that we will absorb and that will need to come out of the system as we go into 2021.","Justin Lake","Okay and to be clear that's a drag on the services business. So even though it might look like there's not much growth there that would be $200 million that you didn't expect to have this year. And is that also a drag versus the accretion number given you probably didn't expect to have that as well because of the timing, should you track those dollars off the accretion that $2 of accretion?","Eric Palmer","That's correct on all fronts, So think about that as almost entirely within the Health Services segment and think about that as in the short term a drag on the cost. It is temporary and we still are on track for our long term expectations there.","Justin Lake","Okay and then if I could just sneak in my question on rebates, Express historically put out a number of $400 million. I know you don't think it all goes away with commercial and all, but can you give us an update there, worst case scenario, if rebates go away where do you think that would be in any comment, CVS put out some discussion on rebate guarantees being affected by inflation, anything there that you see as a headwind for 2019, those two things would be helpful? Thanks.","David Cordani","Justin, it's David, good morning. You\u2019ve effectively put in about four questions. Let me try to wrap a couple of them together. First, specific to the commercial side of the equation as noted previously, the rebate rules articulated and proposed does not affect the commercial market. As you go back, you're correct. Let's go back and use the numbers that we put out. First, for Express Scripts about 95% of all rebates, discounts, et cetera are passed back.","Second, per prior conversation about 50% of all clients within Express Scripts opt for today full pass through rebate models. That covers importantly about two-thirds of the volume. So there's a little disproportionality of that. The net of that is we have multiple funding mechanisms already in hand today and align payment models that work for clients across the commercial health plan and government agency sector that work for them and work for us to get levels of alignment and we'll continue to evolve those over time.","Specific to the rebate guarantees, you'll note that we did not call that out as a headwind, stepping back our industry broadly speaking has guarantees as a part of it. Whether that's in the formal nature of a guarantee cost offering, a discount guarantee, a rebate guarantee, a trend guarantee or otherwise and both legacy organizations have a great track record of effectively gaining alignment and managing those on a go forward basis.","Lastly, I would just add that Express Scripts had some visibility into the decelerating trend environment as such took appropriate actions with their services contracts. So again, we have not called that out as a headwind.","Justin Lake","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Lake. The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.","Kevin Fischbeck","Great, thanks. I wanted to go to the cash flow guidance that you guys are providing here. The numbers that you've been giving generally speaking have kind of excluded Anthem as a client, does that $6.2 billion number include any cash flow that you'd be earning from Anthem acquisition clients this year or it is excluding that? And then just trying to think about this number as kind of a base to think about next year, is there anything one-time in this number or is this a good number to think about for 2020 cash flow available for the parent if we just add earnings growth per se to that?","Eric Palmer","Kevin its Eric. And so overall think about the $6.2 billion figure that I referenced as all in. So it is comprehensive for the enterprise in terms of capital generated. There will be - the rate and pace of achieving our synergies, the rate and pace of capital investments and the rate and pace of our debt repayment will be the main things that will go into - that come to mind in terms of the kind of the top tier impacts. But we would expect to have in excess of $6 billion for each of the next couple of years available in this framework.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay, so even though Anthem goes away, earnings growth kind of makes up for that and the $6 billion a starting point before all the other uses of cash.","Eric Palmer","Right, Kevin.","Kevin Fischbeck","All right, great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Fischbeck. The next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. You may ask your question.","Steven Valiquette","Great, thanks. Good morning David and Eric. So I guess from me just another quick question here on the early Anthem PBM transition. I guess other than the stranded cost that you alluded to, I just want to hear your view hopefully confirmatory that there really should not be any other unexpected consequences in 2019 for the remaining PBM business that Cigna-Express related to things like either let's say less purchasing power or lower rebate collections or something like that because of the early Anthem transition. Thanks.","David Cordani","Steve, good morning it\u2019s David. No, there will not be any impact. We - from the day of the announcement we excluded transitioning clients from all aspects of how we looked at the combination, the business, the outlook, et cetera, but there are no other impacts that you need to be concerned about.","Steven Valiquette","Okay and just a quick MLR question here on the guidance 80.5 to 81 could you just remind us again how that compares year-over-year on an apples-to-apples basis when adjusting for the half to the 78.9% you just posted in 2018, is that essentially flat when you do the adjustment or is it a little higher or a little lower, I just want a little more color there as well. Thanks.","Eric Palmer","Yes, Steve it's Eric. So in terms of the moving pieces with the MLR, I think the industry fee suspension, this is the single biggest piece, the other changes I would call out would be more also factors we've already talked about. So industry fee suspension is the single biggest piece. We've talked about the normalization of our individual plans, margin and then the absence of prior year development in our outlook. Those would be the pieces that would account for the movement from this year into our guidance for next year.","Steven Valiquette","Got it. Okay, great thanks.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Valiquette. The next question comes from Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Stephen Tanal","Good morning guys. Thanks for the question. Just had two sort of topics I wanted to touch, one is just thinking about the long term earnings growth algorithm or target, the 10% to 13% you guys used to put out there, how are you thinking about that now? And then secondly, just to round out kind of the discussion on the earlier transition of Anthem, I guess could you kind of just give us what the new level of year one accretion assumed in the low and high end of the guidance provided is now? And how comfortable are you that those costs are truly temporary?","And I guess just separately, like why was an earlier transition of Anthem business not sort of contemplated in the initial accretion targets provided given the change of control provision in the contract? ","David Cordani","Steve it\u2019s David. First, relative to your broader or big picture question, first by way of background, we've delivered approximately 15% EPS CAGR since 2009, so take 2009 the initiation of our strategy to 2018, we've been above the high end of the articulated 10% to 13% range. Over the next three years, the next chapter of our strategic horizon, we are on track again to deliver 15% EPS accretion on average over the next three years and we look forward to refreshing our long term outlook as we go forward. So we'll have an excess of a decade of 15% EPS growth out performing our long term targets.","As it relates to the latter part of your question, all along we understood that we had transitioning clients and we excluded transitioning clients from our EPS outlook, our accretion outlook, et cetera. No one could predict the rate pace and timing of terminations. The termination is an early termination. It creates a temporary dislocation as Eric articulated of approximately $0.40 of EPS or $200 million before tax.","Even with that, we're able to deliver 17% to 20% EPS CAGR year-over-year off of a tremendous base in 2018 and we did anticipate it. Hence EVI initiatives are underway, but we're taking those in a paced fashion and we will deliver on the EVI initiatives as well as tremendous organic growth. So those costs will be eradicated. There was just a temporary dislocation that takes place in 2019 and even with that we're able to deliver the 17% to 20% EPS growth.","Stephen Tanal","Thanks and so just with that, I guess it sounds like maybe you're still guiding to double-digit accretion ex the $0.40 or at the midpoint of guidance or any color on that part?","David Cordani","The way I would think about it Stephen is, we've discussed before, the core accretion fundamentals of the combination remain intact. Hence, we're on target for about $20 to $21 and the core fundamentals of the Cigna business portfolio remain intact. As Eric referenced in the prior question that was asked, if you take the accretion that would have been inferred and date of announcement of mid teens of about a $1.90 you're back off about $0.40 for the temporary dislocation of overhead and you want to back into a build up you're about right there in 2019 and even with that we're delivering to 17% to 20% EPS growth rate. Thanks.","Stephen Tanal","Perfect, thank you.","Operator","Thank you Mr. Tanal. The next question comes from Zach Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Zach Sopcak","Hey, thanks for the question. So I want to ask about the other transition with your members shifting from OptumRx. Two questions, one is there - how straightforward of a transition is that and is there anything in that process that you're concerned about in terms of the member experience? And two, like I understand it's not going to impact 2019 earnings, but is it at all a significant contributor to that 15%-ish CAGR to get to your 2021 target range? Thank you.","David Cordani","Zach, good morning it's David. So stepping back I'll remind you, today we own and operate our own PBM and successfully done so for many years. We also implemented a successful strategy five, six years ago to break it into modules and to partner with others to perform some of those modules for us, initially Catamaran that transitioned to Optum and it's worked quite well and successfully with Optum as a good constructive partner.","Earlier this year we announced an aligned plan and timeframe with Optum in terms of our shared view in terms of an orderly transition that will take place. That positions us in a way to have a very disciplined orderly transition of those services and relationships and there's a good track record of transitioning services to them and transitioning services back to us within their respective modules and that will take place over the next approximate two-year horizon.","It will create some significant volume uptake for Express Scripts which is a positive. One way you could think about that is the Cigna volumes on today's basis when internalized within Express Scripts make up order of magnitude $75.00 maybe a little higher 75% of the loss volumes from Anthem. So it is quite significant, but it will take place on a ratable basis over the next couple of years. And again, we have a successful track record of in a very disciplined basis of transitioning services to and from other providers. I hope that helps.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Sopcak. The next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. You may ask your question.","Peter Costa","So along that line David, can you explain, have you accelerated the Optum timing of bringing that business in-house relative to Anthem choosing to go early away from you and when did Anthem notify you of their decision to go early?","David Cordani","Yes, good morning. The answer to your question is no. We had a very orderly and disciplined process laid out and we have a very successful and growing captive PBM. We have a very successful strategy approach that we've been executing within the captive PBM and a very strong partnership relationship with Optum around shared value delivery.","We laid out in a very orderly timeline that allows for a disciplined two-year transition putting our customers front and center and the coordination services with our physician partners. So that timeline and the strategy around that is commensurate what we believed was appropriate and highly aligned with our service provider partner.","Peter Costa","And then when did Anthem notify you of their decision and should I assume that 75% of the $0.40 of stranded overhead goes away with just from Optum coming in-house?","David Cordani","I'm not going to get into dates and timing. I think Peter, to the second part of your statement a way to think about the overhead that we articulated before, there are three mechanisms to dispatch of that and it will be removed. First and foremost a very disciplined EVI plan that was laid out and is being executed on an orderly basis; two, good organic growth and then we start 2019 with good organic growth in the Express Scripts portfolio; and third, the very disciplined leverage of the Cigna volumes within the portfolio. All of that will contribute to and the EVI program was put in place to actually take out the cost structure, so we see some additive opportunities as we look to the future from the sustained organic growth and the leverage of the Cigna capabilities.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Costa. The next question comes from David McDonald with SunTrust. You may ask your question.","David McDonald","Yes, good morning. David, just one quick question, you now have a meaningfully scaled mail order business. I was wondering if there is an opportunity to potentially sell additional products or services through that channel over time, and now that you have deepened the combination of pharmacy and medical, is there also an opportunity to expand and further leverage some of the incremental clinical horsepower Express brings, things like Evercore therapeutic resource centers, et cetera?","David Cordani","David, good morning. So to your first question, I appreciate it tremendously and Express Scripts is built in has a proven track record of having a pretty phenomenal mail order fulfillment capability, so it's a service capability that\u2019s aided by quite innovative technologies, patents, et cetera. And we will on a disciplined fashion continue to look at how that core capability that you come back to, potentially could be used and leveraged for other services that benefit customers, patients or clients on a go forward basis and I appreciate the call out. Specific to the clinical integration and clinical leverage, absolutely, absolutely.","A core part of what both organizations got excited about from early conversations was the shared leverage. I articulated in the prepared remarks a little bit between leverage around the Accredo capabilities relative to the deep clinical excellence they have coupled with the Home Health coordination services that exist and bringing some of that together.","Secondly, from a data set standpoint, the ability to enrich insights for practicing clinicians to more comprehensively understand the life or health needs of patients, and as you articulate within the core Evercore capabilities, there are tremendous opportunities where we are on a focus basis already working through additional step function improvements in the clinical capabilities of the combined Corporation which going back to benefiting our customers and clients and further improving affordability and clinical quality. So yes to both points and we couldn't be more excited on the early traction on the second point already.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. MacDonald. The next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. You may ask your question.","Scott Fidel","Hi, thanks. Good morning. I had a question just on, I know you are not giving specific earnings guidance anymore for International Group Insurance, so just interested if you can give us maybe some more qualitative or directional commentary on how you're thinking about earnings trends for those two segments in 2019?","Eric Palmer","Hey Scott, it's Eric. Thanks for that. A couple of headlines that come to mind for me there, so first of all will continue to have good growth momentum in both businesses. We would expect that we will continue to grow in both and the differentiated return to work platform with regard to the disability business continues to services well and again continues to be a growth chassis for us.","In the International Markets business, again continue to grow that platform as well. We closed on November 30, on our acquisition of OnePath Life in New Zealand and this is an example of the continued expansion of the International Markets platform and chassis and so continue to move that forward as well, but overall, really no changes to the underlying growth story and the momentum that we've gotten into those businesses.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Fidel. The next question comes from Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. You may ask your question.","Matthew Borsch","Maybe just if I can ask a question this way on the rebates relative to the draft rule understanding the commercial payers are not immediately into or not impacted by this rule, but if so, so if rebates were to disappear entirely in theory what would be the earnings impact at this point for commercial as well?","David Cordani","Hi, good morning, it is David. We don't have a theoretical EPS answer to the theoretical action you articulate. Stepping back in an attempt to be helpful again about 95% of all discounts and rebates within the Express Scripts portfolio pass-through and shared about 50% of all clients opt for today full pass-through rebate relationships and that equates to - because of the scale of those clients it equates about two-thirds of the volumes and previously indicated Express Scripts retains about $400 million, that's a before tax number.","I would add the reason why I think your question is unanswerable is the model continues to evolve. So the evolution of value based contracts and our share direction in terms of continuing to move toward and more comprehensively toward total cost, total value relationships with our clients, whether they are commercial clients, health plan clients or governmental agencies, is the direction that Express Scripts was on. It's the direction of the Cigna, has been on and it's the direction that the combined corporation goes forward on.","So those tools and levers continue to evolve and you will see us continue to move away from trying to perceive maximize a single lever as opposed to maximize the overall value which is total cost and total qualities go forward.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Borsch. The next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. You may ask your question.","Charles Rhyee","Yes, hey thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask, you obviously reaffirmed the 2021 target of $20 to $21 a share, I just wanted to put that into context with your previously kind of guided synergy target about $600 million. And then if we think about now with the transitioning of Anthem a little bit early, when we think about that number 2021 in relation to the guidance and then you obviously outlined some sort of growth opportunities and optimizing the medical and pharmacy side of it.","What pieces contribute that trajectory towards a 2021? And I guess what I'm really asking is, can you start to kind of quantify for us a little bit, sort of sizing what you think these other opportunities are in relation to the 600 because if I recall correctly that $600 million was largely an overhead kind of a synergy target. Thanks.","Eric Palmer","Charles it\u2019s Eric. I'll start with a couple of the pieces and maybe ask David to give some more overall color and commentary. So at a Macro level we continue to be on track with the synergies as assumed and as we discussed back in 2018 and as we disclosed in last quarter last year, the synergies that we put out and that were quantified there, primarily reflect the administrative costs and we had expected that those would occur over multiple years over the first four years of the transaction.","We're generating $112 million of pretax administrative synergies for 2019 and that builds to $600 million in 2022. You're correct that we expect to generate meaningful additional improvements, in the pharmacy and medical costs, through the combination both through the clinical combinations and some of the other items as David discussed today. Those benefits will primarily in order to the benefit of our customers and client. As it is again, in terms of the synergy pieces those are the pieces you should think about and we are on track and consistent with how we teed up the transaction initially. David will give some additional color here.","David Cordani","Yes, and so just bridge, when you think about today to 2021 we try to articulate there's three major building blocks to get to the $20 to $21 per share. The underlying base performance of both assets, the synergies that Eric just made reference to and you articulated the $600 million before tax synergies and the impact to the P&L of the de-leveraging which were already on board for the de-leveraging path, that's the basic cross-walk between 2018 and 2021.","Additional opportunities above and beyond that which we've said are not built into the accretion model are further leverage and enhancements of the growth chassis of the portfolio as we go forward and identify additional opportunities for growth, whether it's net new growth or further deepening of relationships, anything beyond what the core businesses are performing is excluded from that today as well as potential additional value at a shareholder level versus passing back to the customer and clients from the leverage of Express Scripts for the transition of the Cigna portfolio into the Express Scripts portfolio. So the basic cross-walk is base performance, synergies and de-leveraging to get us from 2018 to 2021.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Rhyee. The next question comes from Ana Gupte with SVB Leerink. You may ask your question.","Ana Gupte","Hey thanks, good morning. Can I follow up on the \u2013 just the question just now, on the Express synergies more on a near term basis both administrative and medical, can you talk about on the administrative side is there anything you can do to accelerate the schedule you had provided in the S4 or in today's guidance and how much of it is potentially even going to retain your business in the July renewal season or 11\/2020 season given Anthem is now talking about $3 billion in savings much sooner, Optum is 250 and 300 and PMPY savings just from Rx?","And then to followup on David your commentary around the power of Express and Cigna together, when will we see proof of concept on that combined business as far as medical costs trend or medical loss ratio impact or you know accelerated share gains and growth?","David Cordani","Ana, good morning, it\u2019s David. Let me try on the points to be responsive here. Specifically as Eric has articulated a couple times there's a $112 million of synergies show the synergies we signed up for in 2019, so a step towards the $600 million. You'll note we're being very disciplined. We are making sure that the expenses come out in an orderly basis. We may outpace that, but the business plan and the guidance we've articulated doesn't assume that and with that and with the transitioning client impact, et cetera, we're delivering 17% to 20% of EPS growth.","Specifically as it relates to the medical and pharmacy cost synergies and value creation, that will unfold throughout 2019 and 2020 and benefit our clients and customers on a client or customer basis depending on the products, programs and services they have. And I would note that we have very good growth and outstanding retention in all of our business portfolios stepping into 2019. We're going to have another good growth year and I articulated an early glimpse to Express Scripts renewals for 2020 which are tracking very, very favorably right now.","As it relates to proof of concept, you should not think about Cigna coming back to you with a net new proof of concept of something De novo we are seeking to build that doesn't exist today as a concept to roll out in the marketplace, rather we are systematically further enhancing the value propositions for our commercial clients, for health plan clients, for governmental agency clients and offering more choice which will unfold in 2019 and 2020 with expanded capabilities and further clinical integration and effective use of data.","At our Investor Day we will seek to bring some of those to life with both words, examples, and challenge ourselves to give some tangibility even in terms of some of the supporting technologies and workflows, but it is not a net new concept. The capabilities unfold pretty rapidly throughout 2019 and we will expand additional choice for the benefit of clients and customers as we step into 2020.","Operator","Thank you, Ms. Gupte. The next question comes from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question.","Frank Morgan","Good morning. Thanks for the color on the Anthem-Optum swap of businesses as 75% of that volume could be recovered. But when I think about it from a profitability standpoint, how should you be thinking about the profitability on the Anthem book loss versus the savings you'll realize by bringing that back in-house? That's number one.","And then number two, was just one of the headwinds you're calling up for the year was the outperformance you saw last year in the Integrated Medical segment, I think mainly the individual segment, is there anything specifically that you would like to call out as to why that should revert or it just simply conservatism? Thank you.","David Cordani","Good morning, it's David. On your first question I would ask you not to think about the profitability of those two components. Step away from it. We've excluded the transitioning clients from all aspects of our conversation from the day we announced the proposed combination and the earnings impact of that from an EPS standpoint have been excluded.","We have in 2019 this temporary dislocation of overhead that from a full transparency basis we will walk through laid out $200 million before tax and that will be removed from the system in a pretty expeditious fashion and we have multiple levers to address that. But I would ask you not to think about profitability of the Cigna portfolio versus the Anthem portfolio because they're not comparables from that standpoint.","As it relates to the individual market, you are correct. We articulated in our third quarter call the fact that, we're quite pleased with the performance of the individual portfolio of businesses. We expected to be profitable in 2018, it is.","It has outpaced the high end of our strategic margin threshold and for 2019 planning purposes we believe it's prudent when you look at that program and the design of that program to plan for margins that are more in line with our strategic margin trajectory which is somewhere between 4% and 6% before tax and for 2019 and we've planned for it to be at the higher end of the range which we think is a more sustainable indication of what that portfolio programs.","There is nothing systematic beyond in terms of dislocation in that marketplace. We just believed it was appropriate to plan for in view that that marketplace runs in a 4% to 6% before tax margin versus a significant margin that was delivered above and beyond that in 2018.","Operator","Thank you. Mr. Morgan. The final question comes from David Windley with Jefferies. You may ask your question.","David Windley","Hi, thank you. Good morning, thanks for squeezing me in. David, the Disability business has been on a journey to kind of evolve process and bring margins back up to normal levels and then the score calls out some unfavorable claims. Are those things at all related, do any actions need to be taken relative to the unfavorable disability claims? And then one last clarification on the $200 million, if you were as you have said excluding Anthem from all the results, were those $200 million allocated to that exclusion and now they become real or another way to think about it, weren't those $200 million stranded from the very beginning because of the assumption that Anthem would be excluded?","Eric Palmer","Yes David, it's Eric. So maybe I'll take second one first on that. Really just thinking about the $200 million just kind of a timing matter right, so the cost that would have been allocated to the contract they would have been gone away for all the reasons David described earlier in the Q&A session here. I'm thinking about it as timing just because of the earlier transition now that those costs won't be able to be allocated to the volumes that would be going away through there, but think about it that way.","On a group wise and disability, we've talked in a number of different calls over time about the variability that can happen on any one line quarter by quarter or things along those lines, but we didn\u2019t call out anything particularly, systemic or anything along those lines, but just that we had favorable life insurance experience and a little bit unfavorable disability experience in the quarter here.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Windley. And now we will turn the call back to David Cordani for closing remarks.","David Cordani","Thank you. To wrap up our call I'd just like to highlight some key points from our discussion. Cigna delivered substantial earnings and revenue growth across our businesses in 2018. We are committed to broadening our approach to integration which focuses on coordination of services around the individual and their whole person health needs both body and mind. This approach also further expands choice, so access is available anytime anywhere based on our customers and patients needs and preferences.","We have a well positioned portfolio of businesses with multiple paths for sustained growth in 2019 and beyond.

We would remind you that there are risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations and these risk factors are discussed in today's earnings release.","Now before I turn the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our results and disclosures. Regarding our results, I would note that in the first quarter, we recorded 2 charges to shareholders net income, which we reported as special items. The first special item was an after-tax charge of $507 million or $1.75 per share related to our previously announced exit of the Run-off Reinsurance businesses, which was effective February 4, 2013. The second special item was an after-tax charge of $51 million or $0.18 per share related to a regulatory matter within our Disability business. I would remind you that the special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations in today's discussion of our first quarter 2013 results as well as our full year 2013 outlook.","And relative to our Run-off Reinsurance operations, our first quarter shareholders net income included an after-tax non-cash gain of $25 million or $0.09 per share related to the Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefits business, otherwise known as GMIB. As a reminder, the results of our GMIB business are excluded from adjusted income from operations and, therefore, also excluded in today's discussion of our first quarter results as well as our full year 2013 outlook.","Now regarding our disclosures, our GAAP cash flow statement explicitly discloses in cash flows from operating activities the amount paid in the quarter to Berkshire Hathaway in connection with our exit of the Run-off Reinsurance businesses. Adjusting for this one-time payment, which we view as a cost to dispose of the Run-off businesses, operating cash flows for our ongoing businesses were $670 million in the quarter, representing 1.3x our adjusted income from operations.","And also, please note that we when we discuss our full year 2013 outlook, it will be on a basis of adjusted income from operations which, again, excludes realized gains and losses on investment results as well as special items, and it also excludes the effects of future capital deployment.","And with that, I'll turn it over to David.","David M. Cordani","Thanks, Ted. And thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. Today, I'll briefly touch on our first quarter performance. I'll address how Cigna's strategy continues to create value for our clients, customers and shareholders in a dynamic and disruptive environment. I'll also highlight how our global mix of businesses, differentiated capabilities and emphasis on our customers positioned Cigna to continue to grow going forward. And finally, I'll provide some brief comments on our expectations for the balance of 2013 and beyond. Following my remarks, Ralph will discuss our financial performance in a bit more detail, and then we'll take your questions.","We are pleased with our first quarter results, which demonstrate a strong start to the year for Cigna. Our performance was a direct result of continued effective execution of our strategy and the strength of our diverse portfolio of businesses. Our first quarter performance was driven by our commercial health care and global supplemental businesses.","In commercial health care, we continued growing in our target markets by achieving strong customer retention, expanding our existing customer relationships and adding new customers. And we posted another quarter of high quality medical outcomes and competitively attractive medical costs for the benefit of our customers and clients.","In the Global Supplemental Benefits business, we delivered a healthy increase in revenue and earnings, reflecting solid customer growth, effective cost management and contributions from recent acquisitions. Our Seniors business performed well, demonstrating the quality of our physician partnerships and the value we deliver to our customers. And the results in our Disability and Life business reflected challenging economic and interest rate environment we operate in.","Moving on to the specific financial results. Our first quarter consolidated revenues increased by 21% to $8.2 billion. We grew our global medical customer base by 277,000 people, or 2%, to more than 14.3 million medical customers worldwide. We reported adjusted income from operations of $497 million or $1.72 per share, which reflects a per share increase of 39% over the first quarter of 2012. And during the quarter, we further enhanced our financial flexibility through the exit of our Run-off Reinsurance business.","Our first quarter results are indicative of our leading employer, individual and senior solutions and capabilities, which drove 17% compounded annual revenue growth and 15% per share growth over the last 3 calendar years.","Looking ahead, companies and individuals alike will continue to demand health, well-being and security solutions that are of high quality and affordable. We will also see ongoing changes in the way customers access health care and wellness solutions, whether through evolving individual, employer and government-based channels or emerging changes in public and private exchange models.","At the same time, needs of customers will keep evolving as populations age, chronic diseases become more prevalent, middle classes continue to grow and customers become increasingly engaged and well-informed. Cigna's sustained strategic investments and continued expansion of our portfolio of employer, individual and senior solutions and capabilities positions us to continue to deliver differentiated value to our customers and clients in this dynamic global environment.","I'll now comment briefly on initiatives and investments we are driving for the benefit of our employer clients, individual customers and physician partners. From an employer standpoint, Cigna recently helped to convene, the first of its kind, Global Healthy Workplace Summit, where executives from nearly 30 countries participate in a dialogue of best practices for healthy productive workplaces. An example of shared learnings is that we are beginning to see best practices emerge globally as employees and countries, such as China and Indonesia, extend the healthy habits they learn in the workplace to the communities and homes.","Additionally, it is clear that employers continue to play a meaningful role in the health and productivity of their employees. From a solution standpoint, our consumer-driven health plans, which leverage choice and transparency, continue to grow and deliver attractive returns. Our clients have lowered their costs by an average of 13% in the first year by choosing CDHP while simultaneously improving the overall health profile of their employees. Cigna's customer base for these offerings increased by 26% in 2012.","For individuals, we further strengthened our individual market position and consumer engagement capabilities last quarter through initiatives such as launching new first-to-market products for dementia in Taiwan and new critical illness programs in Korea. In Turkey, we introduced new products to allow individuals to protect their own sense of security by helping them better save for health care and retirement needs. We also launched the myCigna app, which gives our customers instant access wherever they are to personalize health care information to help them find a doctor, view their account balances and deductibles and research drug prices at 60,000 pharmacies, just to name a few examples. We also continue to strengthen our partnership with physicians and health care professionals through our ongoing expansion of our Collaborative Accountable Care, or CAC, initiatives. We are now engaged in 58 CACs that cover 24 states, reflecting more than 10 new CAC relationships in the first quarter alone.","When taken together with HealthSpring's proven physician engagement strategies, these programs create a sustainable model to improve health, access to care, affordability and patient experience. We believe that this type of enhanced care coordination anchored by strong physician partnerships has, as demonstrated by HealthSpring, and will continue to yield superior results.","To further fuel our growth in the space, we continue to invest in our programs, which now support nearly 1 million Cigna customers across our commercial and Seniors business, and we are collaborating with more than 23,000 doctors.","In summary, we've invested wisely in a portfolio of capabilities that enables us to effectively anticipate our customers' and clients' evolving needs and successfully manage the enterprise in an evolving dynamic global marketplace.","Looking ahead for the balance of 2013, we will continue to build on our sustained track record of success, advancing our strategy to create differentiated value for our clients and customers as well as our shareholders. We are pleased with our first quarter results, and the strength of those results give me confidence that we will achieve our increased 2013 earnings outlook.","Turning to 2014, there is no doubt that the finalization of the CMS guidance for Medicare Advantage for 2014 introduces significant change that will cause customer, market and earnings disruptions. Having said that, our goal is to leverage our diversed, well-positioned portfolio of businesses to continue to drive competitively attractive revenue and earnings performance for 2014 and over the long-term. As you know, we continue to target earnings per share growth of 10% to 13% on average over the next 3 to 5 years.","Now to summarize before turning you over to Ralph, our first quarter results are strong and represent sustained success in executing a clear, focused strategy. At Cigna, we continue to succeed in a dynamic global environment, building on our strong track record of attractive financial results dating back to the introduction of our Go Deep, Go Global and Go Individual strategy in 2009. Our company remains grounded in customer centricity with a commitment to putting the customer at the center of all that we do. Our team of 35,000-strong across the globe continues to bring our differentiated value proposition to life each and every day for the benefit of our customers and clients. And lastly, the combination of our clear strategy, consistent execution and sustained investments positions us for continued competitively attractive results as we look to the future.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Ralph.","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I will review Cigna's first quarter 2013 results and our increased outlook for 2013. We've had a very strong start to the year, demonstrating the strong fundamentals of our businesses as we continue to build upon our excellent track record. And I'd like to highlight several key accomplishments, specifically another quarter of strong top line and customer growth, quarterly earnings per share of $1.72, representing growth of 39% over first quarter 2012, and strengthening our financial flexibility through the successful exit of our Run-off Reinsurance businesses. The strength of our first quarter performance provides us with solid momentum for the balance of this year and confidence in our increased outlook.","First quarter consolidated revenues grew 21% to $8.2 billion, driven by growth in our targeted markets as well as an additional month of HealthSpring revenues. First quarter consolidated earnings were $497 million, representing 38% growth over first quarter 2012.","Regarding the segments, I'll first comment on our Global Health Care segment. Overall Global Health Care results were strong, particularly for our commercial business. First quarter premiums and fees for Global Health Care grew 20% to $5.8 billion, reflecting strong contributions from both our commercial and Seniors businesses. We ended first quarter 2013 with 14.3 million global medical customers, growing by 277,000 customers, or 2%, over year-end, with solid growth in commercial and Seniors.","First quarter earnings grew 44% to $427 million and were driven by revenue growth, primarily due to strong ASO customer growth and specialty penetration and an improved operating expense ratio.","Turning now to medical costs. We continue to improve the health outcomes for the benefit of our customers, driven by our effective engagement with physicians and delivering value-based solutions for our clients and customers. Our commercial medical trends are among the lowest in the industry and given that nearly 85% of our U.S. Commercial customers are in ASO funding arrangements, our clients directly benefit from these favorable medical cost results.","Regarding medical care ratios in our U.S. commercial guaranteed cost business, our first quarter 2013 medical care ratio, or MCR, was 77.6% on a reported basis or 80.3% excluding prior year reserve development.","In our Seniors business, our first quarter MCR for Medicare Advantage was 84.3% on a reported basis or 84.7% excluding prior year reserve development. The flu season resulted in elevated medical and pharmacy costs for our Seniors population and impacted our Medicare Advantage MCR by approximately 100 basis points. Across our commercial and Seniors risk books of business, our first quarter earnings included favorable prior year reserve development of $48 million after-tax compared to $41 million after-tax in the first quarter of 2012.","Moving to operating expenses. For the first quarter, the total Global Health Care operating expense ratio is 20.7%, which is a significant improvement over the first quarter 2012 expense ratio. This reflects leverage associated with our continued customer and revenue growth, realization of benefits of cost-saving initiatives and timing of investments and new capabilities in the quarter. We would not anticipate this operating expense favorability to carry through the full year as we expect our investment-related spending to ramp up over the first quarter levels over the remainder of the year. To recap, we have a strong start to 2013 in Global Health Care business on all key metrics.","Now I will discuss the results of our Global Supplemental Benefits business, which continues to deliver attractive growth and profitability. Premiums and fees grew 36% quarter-over-quarter, driven by strong customer retention and new customer growth as well as contributions from our recent acquisitions, most notably Great American Supplemental Benefits.","First quarter earnings in our Global Supplemental Benefits business were $55 million, representing a 28% increase over first quarter 2012 and reflects business growth, favorable operating expenses, product mix and favorable claims experience. Relative to operating expenses, it's important to highlight that we continue to invest in product, distribution and geographic expansion within this segment.","For Group Disability and Life, first quarter results reflect the impact of a challenging economic environment. First quarter earnings in our group business were $49 million, which were primarily impacted by unfavorable claims experienced in the Disability business. Results for our remaining operations, including Run-off Reinsurance, other operations and corporate, totaled to an after-tax loss of $34 million for the first quarter 2013 consistent with our expectations.","Turning to our investment portfolio. We are pleased with our results in the first quarter. We recognized net realized investment gains of $93 million after-tax, coupled with the strong net investment income result. These net realized investment gains were primarily related to disposition of investment assets associated with our exit of the Run-off Reinsurance business.","Overall, as a result of the continued effective execution of our strategy, our first quarter results reflect strong revenue and earnings contributions from our ongoing businesses as well as significant free cash flow.","Now I will discuss our outlook for 2013. We expect to continue to deliver strong financial performance based on focused execution, leveraging our diversified portfolio of businesses with multiple sources of growth and continued effective capital deployment. We continue to expect consolidated revenues to grow in the range of 8% to 12% over 2012. We have increased our outlook for the full year 2013 consolidated adjusted income from operations to be in the range of approximately $1.74 billion to $1.87 billion or $6 to $6.45 per share. This represents an increase of $0.15 per share over our previous expectations.","Consistent with prior practices, our outlook excludes any additional contribution from additional capital deployment and any additional prior year reserve development for the balance of the year.","I will now discuss the components of our 2013 outlook, starting with Global Health Care. We now expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of approximately $1.47 billion to $1.56 billion, an increase of $35 million. This increased outlook for Global Health Care primarily reflects the first quarter favorable prior year reserve development and continued effective execution. Additionally, I would note a variety of items that partially offset this favorability in our full year forecast, including the expected increase in strategic spending in the second half of the year as well as the impact of sequestration.","I will now summarize some of the key assumptions reflected in our Global Health Care earnings outlook for 2013, starting with our customer base. Regarding global medical customers, we continue to expect 2013 customer growth of approximately 1% to 2%. Relative to medical costs, for our total U.S. commercial book of business, we continue to expect full year medical cost trend to be in the range of 6% to 7%, which reflects an expectation for an increase in medical services utilization during 2013. We now expect the 2013 medical care ratio to be in the range of 82.5% to 83.5% for our U.S. commercial guaranteed cost book of business, which is 100 basis points lower than our previous expectations, driven by favorable reserve development in the first quarter. For our Seniors business, our Medicare Advantage MCR for 2013 continues to be in the range of 82% to 83%.","Regarding operating expenses, for 2013, we continue to expect our total Global Health Care operating expense ratio to improve by at least 50 basis points over 2012's full year ratio of 22.6%, recognizing that the balance of the year has an increased level of investments in growth initiatives and enhanced capabilities relative to the first quarter.","Now moving to other components of our outlook. For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we continue to expect strong top line growth and earnings in the range of $160 million to $180 million. I would note that the first quarter earnings are elevated relative to the remainder of the year due to the timing of operating expenses related to ongoing investments in our growth initiatives and better-than-expected claims experience, which we expect to normalize over the balance of the year.","Regarding the Group Disability and Life business, we continue to expect full year 2013 earnings in the range of $270 million to $290 million. And regarding our remaining operations, that is, other operations and corporate, we continue to expect a loss of $160 million for 2013. So all in, for full year 2013, we have increased our outlook for consolidated adjusted income from operations to a range of approximately $1.74 billion to $1.87 billion or $6 to $6.45 per share. This represents an attractive outlook coming off a very strong 2012.","Now moving on to our 2013 capital management position and outlook. Overall, we continue to have good financial flexibility. Our subsidiaries remain well capitalized and are generating significant free cash flow to the parent, with strong return on capital on each of our ongoing businesses. We ended the quarter with parent company cash of approximately $620 million.","During the first quarter, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of Cigna common stock and we, subsequently, repurchased an additional 2.3 million shares through May 1. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 3.9 million shares of stock for approximately $250 million. Additionally, as of April 18, 2013, we completed the payment of the reinsurance premium to Berkshire Hathaway in connection with our transaction to exit the Run-off Reinsurance businesses. After considering all sources and uses of parent company cash, we now expect to have approximately $1 billion to $1.1 billion available for deployment during the balance of the year.","Overall, our capital position and updated outlook are strong and our capital deployment strategy and priorities are unchanged.","Now to recap, our first quarter 2013 consolidated results reflect the strength of our differentiated portfolio of global businesses and the continued track record of effective execution of our focused strategy with strong growth in our targeted customer segments. The fundamentals in our business remained strong as evidenced by our first quarter results, which reflected attractive growth in revenue, customers and earnings with the opportunity for excess cash deployment; the successful exit of our VADBe and GMIB businesses and the completion of payments to Berkshire Hathaway; and continued targeted strategic investments, which will enable sustained growth into the future.","Based on the strength of these results, we are confident in our ability to achieve our increased full year 2013 outlook. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First question, I just wanted to follow up on Medicare and see if you can give us your estimated all-in rate impact for 2014 from final rates, including the industry fee. And then, just talk about the effects of the risk adjustment model changes that you're expecting on HealthSpring and if you can flag any particular markets where you expect on to see more impact from that.","David M. Cordani","Scott, it's David. Just maybe a backdrop comment and then I'll address the rates, specifically because I think it comes into your risk adjustment point. First, as I noted on my prepared remarks, the 2014 rate adjustments, I've made no doubt about it, are disruptive and will be disruptive to the marketplace. Specific to our model broadly, we believe that the HealthSpring model continues to be a winning approach in the marketplace and it's positioned for ongoing success. Largely due to your ability to partner effectively with physicians and work around health engagement and care coordination on a go-forward basis, we think it's been proven as the only sustainable way to really improve health and lower health care costs and generate a level of affordability. So now to put that in context of the rate impact, in your question about risk adjusters and the like, for us, as you would imagine, the rate impact varies by market. You could think about the average of that being in the mid single-digits. That excludes the industry tax. So that's the rate impact excluding the industry tax, just so you know what the industry tax looks like. On a perspective basis, when you think about the capabilities we have, we have 2 large sets of capabilities. One, on average, a richer or more comprehensive benefit offering in our respective markets that we targeted because of the efficiency of our portfolio. So a little bit more latitude to work within those benefits and make adjustments and still have a competitively differentiated benefit. And then the physician partnership, to work with those physicians to get to the best efficiency and quality outcome for the benefit of their patients, our customers, as we work forward.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And David, just to confirm. So the variability that you're citing was sort of mid single-digit down vers, let's say, industry peers x the industry tax at maybe more like 3% or so, is that variability mostly off of the risk adjustment model impact?","David M. Cordani","Scott, it's -- time will tell, obviously, as the final rates converts to benefit offerings in the market. But I would say, again, my numbers are mid single-digit on average, and our view of the peer marketplace is in more of the 4% to 5%. So you might argue there's a point, a point plus of difference. I would not benchmark to your notion of a 2.5-point or 2-plus point difference. And you could argue that, that is largely the result of both geographic variability, and then, secondly, the efficiency of our program and effectiveness around the risk adjusters having a little bit larger bite out of it.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got it. And then just my follow-up. I just wanted to shift gears and just ask about the outlook for ASO conversions in 2014, just hearing a lot of market feedback about increased interest in converting to ASO. And particularly, just in the Select Segment, what type of growth pipeline do you expect to see as a result of this since that's a particular area of the market where we're just hearing a lot of interest in ASO for 2014?","David M. Cordani","Scott, specifically to ASO or self-funded, as you know, the bulk of our corporation's U.S. business is in self-funded, think 80% to 85% of the business each day. As it relates to broad themes, we see a continuation of the broad theme from the last 3 or 4 years to just continued openness and a positive appetite for ASO. So we don't see it as a sea change by any stretch of the imagination. In the Select Segment, to your specific point, which we defined as employers with 51 to 250 employees, give or take, we've seen continued positive appetite there as well, so positive momentum, strong portfolio of capabilities and increase openness and receptivity in the market for that. If you look back to our growth results, our regional segment and our Select Segment results continued to be outstanding from a retention, business expansion and new business growth, and we would expect that to continue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Lake with JPMorgan Chase.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question on 2014. In your prepared remarks, you talked about your confidence of being able to attract -- grow at attractive rates over the next several years. But specifically, you'd previously communicated confidence in the ability to grow earnings next year. I'm curious if you can give us an update on your thoughts there.","David M. Cordani","Sure, Justin. As you commented in my prepared remarks, we feel as though the positioning of our diverse businesses will enable us to deliver competitively superior both revenue and earnings growth in 2014 and beyond. We remain committed to our long-term EPS growth objective of 10% to 13% on average per year. And as you know, we've been able to deliver that over the prior years. Specific to 2014, given the disruption that the Medicare rate environment has introduced and our need to see how those rates convert to offerings in the market through the second quarter and then the offerings going into third quarter, we think it's early to comment relative to 2014 outlook. But I think the most important headline is we're confident that we're positioned to deliver competitively superior result in 2014.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And so if Medicare Advantage is clearly the area of disruption, can you delineate what you're thinking in terms of membership growth versus margins?","David M. Cordani","Specific to MA, Justin?","Justin Lake - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes.","David M. Cordani","Yes. So I'll be careful in terms of my comments because the competitive realities will play out over the next several months. But let's just step back and use a little context here. As we've discussed in the past, whether you look at HealthSpring's history or Cigna's history, both organizations have been disciplined in terms of focus in geographies as well as discipline for sustainable growth. So within that environment, you should assume that there's a bias toward sustainability, so there is a bias toward a balance margin outcome. Having said that, in the disruptive environment we're going to be in, we think 2014 and, arguably, 2015 is going to present some meaningful both organic and inorganic growth opportunities and we remain open to the positive growth story because the HealthSpring platform is positively positioned to deliver, both today and in the future.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. If I could just ask my follow-up again on Medicare Advantage, more specifically around this new risk score model. The -- there has been discussions that in certain markets the rate decline is going to be much more significant than mid single-digits because of the risk score model. Can you talk about how that flows through to your capitated physician groups in terms of in the ability to cut benefit versus your taking the margin decline? And then, obviously, the capitated group getting a percentage of premium, how much of it does the capitated group take there? And how does that kind of affect their view on the Medicare Advantage business?","David M. Cordani","Justin, just a moment of backdrop then on the risk coding and then a little bit of direction how we -- how our model works there. First, just to put it in context, we should think about the risk coding as indicative of the level of both physician engagement with their patients and then active care coordination. So instead, otherwise, the more effective either a medical home, a care coordination or an accountable care organization would be, you'd have a more engaged, a more actively managed chronic population and the risk coding will be higher. And that's a dimension of success, right? You have a much more actively managed organization. To put that in context on what might transpire, take in diabetic, which is quite prevalent in the case of Seniors. In a fee-for-service model, the doctor's really not incented to do all the preventative care measures, to do all the care coordination, et cetera. So it tends to be more uneven. In a coordinated model like we have, you have active monitoring of the diabetic patients, blood sugar levels, proactive exams relative to retinal exams, LDL cholesterol, assessing kidney functionality. And as a result, you get to a much better quality of life for the individual, a better physician-patient outcome that works through and a better overall cost profile. So that's the backdrop. Specific to your question in the model we have, we have a partnership model with physicians bluntly to make sure that we get the right sustainable cost and the right sustainable value outcome in our respective markets. And the body of work we're going through right now, as you'd expect, is to ensure that our net benefit positioning and cost positioning for 2014, has a not only [ph] for 2014, but 2015 and '16. So that's an area where we're pleased with because we are working with our physician partners to get that outcome. We're not working against physicians in a contracting way, but we're working in a very transparent way. And that process is unfolding as we sit here today.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Didn't hear a PBM discussion or update there. I think, you guys have been talking about first half. So 2 months to go, maybe any color there.","David M. Cordani","Sure, Josh. Maybe we're just waiting for your question on the PBM since there really is a lot of interest. As you know, as we've said in the past, that business continues to perform well. And when you talk about that, the service proposition, the clinical quality proposition, the medical trend outcomes, and it's delivering and, of course, the earnings for us. And as we've talked before, the scale addition presented by HealthSpring presented us an opportunity to evaluate a variety of alternatives. And just to make sure we have the right context, those alternatives are all focused on either maintaining or further enhancing our service proposition, maintaining or further enhancing our clinical quality outcomes, strengthening our positioning for ongoing innovation because the constant here is an environment of change and then further approving both affordability value for our clients and customers and earnings for ourselves. The specific update I gave you is our team is making very good progress and we're on track relative to our internal timelines to work through our body of work here.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And that timeline, as you've expressed earlier, was by midyear, right? Is that fair?","David M. Cordani","Correct.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. All right, so no change there. And then just as I look at the guidance, obviously, you took the numbers up slightly less than what just the favorable development in the Health Care segment was. You bought back a little bit of stock and so there's probably some offset to that. And I'm curious, is it just around discretionary investment spending or is there any sort of quantification of other items that you guys are expecting to be headwinds? And I think you've said sequestration now was in guidance. But I thought that was previously in guidance, but just want to make sure I got that right.","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Josh, it's Ralph. Yes, to your point, we feel good about our outlook. It primarily reflects the benefit of the prior year development that we experienced in the quarter. We clearly had planned investments, behind capabilities and further growth in the balance of the year, which didn't come through in the first quarter as we expected, but we do see it coming through the balance of the year, so our guidance reflects that. And to your latter question on sequestration, as we went into the year and talked about our guidance, we did contemplate within the outlook range of that occurring. And our current guidance also contemplates the impact of sequestration as it flows through, starting in the second quarter.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Is there a way to size those investments? Are they higher than what you thought 3 months ago?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","No. I would say not higher than what we thought 3 months ago, if you step back on our operating expenses overall. It's important to point out, we've consistently improve our operating expense ratio while continuing to invest behind the business, behind growth. And as I noted in my remarks, we expect to improve our ratio by at least 50 basis points off of the 22.6% that we ended in 2012, so nothing unusual there. We're kind of marching through the plan that we had going into the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So could you maybe talk about the outlook for '14? Not specifically, but if we think about outside of the Medicare Advantage business, should we think about 2014 being kind of a normal year given that you don't really have impact on your existing business from the commercial and Medicaid side of health reform or are there other angles that we should be thinking about ahead of that?","David M. Cordani","Matt, it's David. So relative to '14, again, most importantly, we believe that we'll continue to deliver competitively attractive both top line and bottom line results. I think, broadly, the way you frame it is a healthy way to frame it. When you think about our business portfolio and you look at the sustained success, for example, in our U.S. commercial business around the regional and the Select Segment, that's the same power that could be used to drive our results, our global individual business. The strength of our cash flow and improved financial flexibility that is built over the last 3 years and further enhanced by the successful exit of our Reinsurance business, all of those are positives. And you highlight the #1 disruptor or headwind. I think the way you're framing it is a very healthy way.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And maybe as my follow-up, if I could ask about your U.S. Disability business and just maybe frame the outlook there in light of the first quarter negative claims experience you had?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Sure, Matt. It's Ralph. Again, overall, continue to be pleased with the Group segment in terms of the margins and returns in the difficult economic environment. We are on track to reach the guidance range. We did see some claims volatility in terms of size of claims in the first quarter, which we expect would more normalize over the period of a year. We're also expecting to continue to see operating improvements, which we've been doing over the last several years and that's actually been our outlook as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just going back to MA, can you all give us a sense of what percentage of earnings MA represents at this point for the company?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Ralph, it's about 15%.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then just in terms of follow-up, maybe talk a little bit about cost trends you saw in the quarter. It sounds like flu had more significant impact on your Seniors book, any impact on the commercial side? And may be if you could just talk generally about utilization, what you're seeing within specific categories and cost trend relative to that 6% to 7% that you mentioned for the quarter?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Sure, Ralph. A few questions in there. First, let me start on the commercial side and then I'll come back on the Seniors side a little bit. Overall, as the quarter came in line with our expectation, certainly, on the commercial piece, a little bit more elevated in the Seniors side because of the flu impact in the first quarter but in line with our expectations, and our trend projection. It does reflect a slight uptick from the first quarter where we were more on the lower end of that range of 6% to 7% but we project a slight uptick as we move through the balance of the year. In terms of the kind of pieces there, I would say no real changes to the historical mix of the different utilization patterns within the trend. And then on the MA side, on the Medicare Advantage side, as I'd mentioned, we did give the impact from the flu in the first quarter, some of that was partially offset by prior year development that we did see in the quarter. And I think it's important to note that as we entered the year, we expected to move our loss ratios up a little bit to position ourselves with the new MLR guidelines in '14.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And if I could just squeeze one more in. Just -- and maybe just an update on where you stand with what the exchanges, how much you think you'll participate at this point and sort of how your rate negotiations are going with providers and what rate you expect.","David M. Cordani","Ralph, it's David. I think your question really goes toward the 2014 public exchange environment. And as you know, we do not have an under 50 life employer block of business to protect and we don't have a material individual block of business. As such, we have a look at this market through a fresh lens. We've been running pilots in a finite number of markets over the last 3 years to learn and be prepared for this change. Looking to 2014, we have a bias to participate. We've done the work and continue to do the work to participate. That bias to participate is quite sharply focused on a limited number of markets. When we think about markets, we think about MSAs. Obviously, you're state-engaged, but we think about MSAs within the states because of localization. Finally, to the notion of your question, when we think about rates, we are also orienting our offerings against those markets where we both deem an attractive environment exist, and we have our most innovative Collaborative Accountable Care relationships because we think the better way to win on a more sustainable basis is, again, working with the physicians as opposed to against them in terms of pounding back and forth our rates. So limited number of markets, bias to action, highly focused work being done and in those MSAs, we'll be where our most sophisticated or innovative collaborative relationships are in place today.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Christine Arnold with Cowen.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","You said a bunch of times that you feel you have a lot of financial flexibility and I heard organic and inorganic Medicare Advantage opportunities, kind of hinting at potential for acquisitions and M&A. As you look at your portfolio, where do you see compelling opportunities from an M&A perspective, recognizing the probably smaller tuck-in acquisitions?","David M. Cordani","Christine, it's David. What I referenced before, you're correct, our financial flexibility is quite strong. Ralph noted it in his prepared remarks an excess of $1 billion -- $1 billion to $1.1 billion. Two, we meaningfully improved our financial flexibility post the Berkshire transaction, so you're correct from that standpoint. Two, we indicated that we believe that the CMS rate environment will create meaningful disruption in the marketplace in 2014 and '15. And that will create disruptive opportunity for growth both organically and inorganically. On the organic side, important to note, we are on track relative to our organic market expansion activities. That started in earnest as soon as we closed the HealthSpring transaction. And we've had good planning, good execution, et cetera, and that's on target. All we're indicating is that we have a go-to platform that we could integrate as you put acquisitions into, we have the financial flexibility and we have a model that has been proven successful in its ability to integrate. Beyond that, you should not read anything more into my comments.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then finally on exchanges, how are you viewing private exchanges for the large- and mid-sized employers? Do you see them gaining traction? Are you interested in participating? Or do you view them as kind of a threat to the shift to ASO that we've been seeing?","David M. Cordani","Christine, it's David again. So relative to private exchanges, first, let's have a little shared context here. There's a lot of early movement in the space, so we're early in the cycle. And within that, private exchanges are coming up to serve a variety of purposes. For example, having an improved retail purchasing experience for individual customers, we think that's a positive. For example, elevating the level of engagement in transparency-related purchases, we think that's a positive within -- as an individual level. There are some that are actually moving forward to share more economic burden or risk, with individual consumers potentially orienting against the defined contribution model. We think that could be a winning strategy so long as the individual is engaged and participative and understands what they're getting involved. And so point one is early in the cycle and a lot of different models unfolding. Second point is you should think about us as having a lot of experience dealing in an environment of choice. When you think about our larger case-size business, we're used to dealing in a choice environment, in the industry where we typically call it slice, where you have a B2B to C relationship and you're needing to market and present your offering for an individual of choice. We are participating and expect to continue to participate in some of the offerings that are in the market. And as we have been in the past, we'll be quite focused in terms of those offerings where we believe the designs are designed to be sustainable and where we could add value and win on a go-forward basis. So that's where we look at the markets today.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Just a clarifying question on the last comment you made on individual. Are you able to compete in just MSAs or do you have to compete statewide? And what's the risk that you get in members in areas where you don't have the competitive cost structure?","David M. Cordani","So Christine, I think your question is now bouncing back to the public exchanges. And we -- first and foremost, we have demonstrated over the last, almost 4 years, that in our chosen Go Deep markets, we have a fully competitive cost structure. Our medical trends have been outstanding. Our client and customer retention rates have been very, very strong, so we feel good about that. Secondly, health care is local. health care is extraordinarily local. In the individual market, it will be even more localized. So we believe our ability to focus on key MSAs and key markets is going to be a winning strategy on a go-forward basis.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just wanted to go back to the MA rate for a second. You guys have previously outlined a plan of entering 2 to 3 new markets per year. I just wanted to see what, if any, impact this MA rate had on those plans, either for 2014 or for out-years?","David M. Cordani","Kevin, it's David. You're correct. We had outlined as part of the acquisition both the opportunity and potential for entering new markets. I referenced earlier that body of work is on track. The team has done an extraordinarily good job in terms of both prioritizing markets. Good news is there is ample market opportunity then focusing on the markets where we think we have the biggest opportunity to go forward. There's no doubt, as I've said before in my prepared comments, that 2014 rate environment changes the profile across-the-board, whether you're looking at a new market entr\u00e9e or existing market. Having said that, we believe our model of partnering with physicians presents an opportunity for sustainability and we're looking at this journey more than a 2014 environment, so we're on track relative to our activity there.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just on the share repurchase side, I just think it's interesting, it looks like the average share price is about $64, which implies that you are buying your stock back after the final MA rate. And I don't know, obviously, it creates some headwinds to 2014, but I don't know if we should be taking that as a signal as far as your optimism in your outlook going forward hasn't changed a whole lot or whether the decision in share repurchases is more a reflection of other uses of cash available as far as maybe deals that look like they're in the short-term, so we shouldn't be reading too much into that. I don't know if you have a perspective or comment there.","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Kevin, it's Ralph. First, obviously, we feel very good about our position and our ability to grow the business over the long-term, I think, very important. And then as we look at our capital management priorities, they have essentially remained unchanged. And as we look at the window of time here in the short-term, we felt that deploying some of the excess capital to share repurchase was the best interest for the shareholders.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ana Gupte of Dowling & Partners.","Ana Gupte - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","My question is about your 2 portfolios in the Seniors business and the competitive disruption that you talked about specifically on Med Advantage and Medicare supplement. Are the segments that buy into each of these products distinct and separate based on either income level or age or other demographic characteristics or is this in fluidity across? And in light of the 2014 rated headwinds, is the disruption just likely to be limited to share shifting among MA players or would you see some reversion back to MedSup despite significantly higher monthly premium on that?","David M. Cordani","Ana, it's David. Relative to your first question in terms of -- I think you're looking at the demographic kind of economic profile and buying pattern profile difference in MA and MedSup. I'm going to make a macro statement, but averages are dangerous, and then try to sharpen it down. Macro average statement, the answer is yes. Then you got to cut down to local markets. And I think, as you know, what you'd see is that your MA penetration as dramatically higher and more mature in urban and suburban areas with a broader delivery system configuration. So you have 2 things. One, you have a little different demographic profile between your typical MA and your MedSup buyer. Two, you have a market bias, where MA is more vibrant in certain geographies, therefore, in other geographies, MedSup is, largely speaking, the only alternative for individuals to fill in against a fee-for-service offering. Fast forward that to your secondary question, the simple answer is, time will tell. And time will tell relative to the value propositions that are put on the table in the competitive landscape as it relates to benefit richness and the comprehensiveness of benefits. Now it's important to note, as you think about MA stepping back, broadly -- this is not a Cigna statement -- but broadly, MA participants, about 14 million seniors today, tend to be highly satisfied if you look at national satisfaction data, actually, extremely highly satisfied relative to their programs relative to alternatives. Secondly, MA participants, on average, have a bit lower income level than MA in totality. So you have a highly satisfied population and they're going to be looking at the level of disruption that's presented to them. So time will tell. The level of benefit offering and richness will be a meaningful determiner in terms of whether or not people view a shift to fee-for-service and buying a MedSup makes sense, but you have a highly satisfied population. And then finally, from a Cigna standpoint, we have deep blocks of business in key geographies where there are deep relationships with physicians and a lot of coordination with individuals. So we would expect to have less than average disruption because of that depth of relationship.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Well, I'll take that to mean based on the satisfaction, the income level, which is slightly lower in the market-specific preferences, that there's likely to be much less disruption than, say, the BBA compared to what we've seen in '14. And then a follow-up on that is no one's really talking about it too much, but there is discussion around the budget deal in Congress and the need to put in a long-term, fee fixed solution, maybe get rid of the sequester. And I think the Administration had a proposal around MedSup, or reducing the -- combining the -- deduct -- the Part A and B into combined deductible and putting a surcharge into MedSup. So let's just say -- firstly, are you having such discussions or any dialogue with D.C. on that? Secondly, let's just say this happens in the fall, then what are the ramifications of that?","David M. Cordani","Ana, I'm going to answer the first part of your question and I'm just not going to answer the second part of your question. On the first part of your question, we have been, we are and we will continue to be proactively engaged in D.C., on both sides of the aisle, relative to sustained program design, et cetera. We feel passionate around sustained evolution of programs, be they commercial, be they exchanges, be they Medicare, be they Duals, et cetera. It is an important part of what we think our responsibilities are. So we are and will be actively engaged in the dialogue, as you referenced, relative to the potential for an A, B combined deductible. Having said that, I don't think it's healthy to speculate what the possibility of outcomes are, given the inner workings of Washington. I'd leave that to your speculation and your debate in terms of the potential and the timing of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","First question, I guess, relates to the comments about operating expense ratio improvement to 50 basis points. Obviously, if you can get that improvement through just leverage in the business or there can be specific initiatives that are designed to get that in, I would assume that you have investments that you're making, as others are talking about, in preparation for 2014, maybe not as much as some of the others. But can you just sort of comment on those 3 factors and how they plan to your objective to get to 50 basis points improvement?","David M. Cordani","A.J., it's David. I think you framed it nicely. First, if you look back over the last several years, we've committed to and we delivered consistent improvements to our expense ratio, and we're pleased with that. In addition to that, we've committed to and we've executed continued, highly focused strategic investments. So you're not seeing a big change in our strategic investment profile, for example, in advance of the public exchanges or otherwise. We continue to target investments within the organization. And obviously, to your point, as we successfully grow the franchise, there is revenue leverage opportunity that presents itself. And I'll end with a \"for example\". For example, last year, we talked to the investor community about a series of targeted investments we were incurring in the early portion of 2012 that would yield sub-finitive benefits to our expense ratio in the second half. Those were technology-related initiatives, vendor-specific, cutover-transpired, those were very targeted. Beyond that, you'd see ongoing efficiency exercises to help us get the productivity gains we need to be able to continue to reinvest going forward. And you should expect us to continue to generate that on a forward-looking basis as we invest back on ourselves.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then my other question would be related to international and sort of open-ended. You -- in the prepared remarks, you mentioned a few areas of strong performance. But -- and I know in the press release you cited, particularly, South Korea. Can you comment on any areas that were particularly strong in the quarter and any areas that might be challenges worth, at least, highlighting?","David M. Cordani","It's David again. Well, the international operation when you think about our global footprint, there's a couple of portfolios of business there. One that both I and Ralph highlighted is the global Individual Supplemental business is performing extremely well. Within that portfolio -- I wouldn't highlight any one area -- I would reinforce the fact that within the delivery of those results, we're continuing to invest in product, we'll continue to invest in distribution channel, innovation. We'll continue to invest in new market entr\u00e9es such as Turkey, which is up and running, as well as India. So that's one section of the portfolio. The second section of the portfolio, which is part of our Global Health Care business, really focus on the globally mobile population need. And that performed in line with our expectations in the first quarter, so I wouldn't highlight anything there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So following on A.J.'s last one. In the earlier days of kind of evaluating ACA, Cigna talked about its ability to, say, import some of the distribution, innovation out, internationally, into the U.S. for individual market, say, Hix Distribution. And coming at that market, that exchange market, in a slightly differently way, is that still in the thinking? I haven't heard you talk about that.","David M. Cordani","Sure, David. It's David. Simple answer is yes. So when you think about our global individual supplemental business, that business is a direct individual distribution infrastructure, where we sell direct to individuals targeted offerings based on segmentations and needs based on life status. We deliver those products or solutions through a variety of distribution channels. Historically, telemarketing. Today, telemarketing, Internet, direct response TV, bancassurance or other affinity channel delivery. It's fueled by a large cadre of, I'll call them, marketing statisticians, product and distribution resources. We have been and continue to leverage those resources within the company. Lastly, the pilots I referenced earlier in a prior question, so we've run 3 years of pilots back here in the United States; manifested, round numbers, 200,000 individual primary lives. Those are driven -- aided by these distribution resources outside the United states as we're just trying to leverage those learnings and we think that gives us a nice advantage as we look to our target markets going forward.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then switching gears to your network development or physician partnering strategy, you've got your HealthSpring capabilities and then you have -- prior to HealthSpring, had already embarked on your a CAC strategy. I guess, I'm wondering how those have -- has, say, maybe melded together? And if you can provide us any metrics or any milestone or signpost as to how many markets you've expanded to beyond the HealthSpring markets, what your target is and over what timeframe.","David M. Cordani","Sure, Dave. So contextually, Cigna started on this path on or around 2008. We split up 8 collaboratives, different models, with the objective to learn. And by the way, you continue to learn as you go forward. Fast forward to today, we have just shy of 60 up and running. Span approximately 24 -- 23, 24 states touching 23,000 physicians. And between the HealthSpring Seniors lives and the commercial lives, we're approaching 1 million lives that are touched, so significant growth. The exciting part is you're seeing coming out of those collaboratives a lot of what HealthSpring was able to prove in the Seniors population. Higher level of engagement, higher level of clinical coordination, higher level of medication compliance for chronics, et cetera. As a result, higher satisfaction for both the patient or customer as well as the physician, and then improved cost. So we believe that there is a tremendous opportunity here as we go forward. Looking to the future, and I think we profiled this a little bit at our I Day, we have potentially a map of the country. And by MSAs, our objective is that, over the course of the next year, you're going to see another significant tranche of growth in the pipeline for new collaboratives. It is rather rich that are in front of us today.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And embedded in that question, if I could, your approach has not included owning that primary care physician layer in any way. Is that -- does that continue to be your expectation or strategy?","David M. Cordani","Dave, I appreciate that. The -- to be clear we have some ownership physicians today. But our preferred approach, to your point, our preferred approach is to partner. And then in markets that are critical, where we don't believe we could have the right partnership opportunities, we are both willing and capable of owning. So that's the way to look at us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Your fastest-growing business was actually Medicaid this quarter. And I believe that's held out from HealthSpring and then one of the targeted areas that they had. Do you expect to continue to focus on growing the Medicaid business going forward, particularly given your strong financial flexibility that you have right now?","David M. Cordani","Peter, it's David. Mathematically, I'm sure you're correct, but you're doing a percent change off of a de minimis base. If you go to another number, that is a large percentage change. Stepping back to the broader frame that you put forward, we've been really clear relative to Medicaid. Base Medicaid, if you will, is not an area, broadly from a national footprint, that we deem to be a strategic priority. In our focused Go Deep markets, where we believe we have an opportunity to differentiate value, is around the care coordination for the high-risk population. We can deem those as dual eligibles, high-risk population cohorts, et cetera, where the care coordination, care management physician partnership models work. So there is an initiative underway with early traction in Texas relative to that. But we need to look at all these as early generation initiatives, where we need to partner with the states to be able to deliver value as well as an early win in Illinois for us on a very targeted basis. But you should look at that as a small nucleus within our company and a highly focused nucleus today. However, an openness to grow in areas and in key Go Deep geographies where we can focus on the high-risk population.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Great. And then just looking at your balance sheet for a moment, you still have a very large real estate portfolio. Was the reinsurance business relatively gone from your sort of forecasting here and in terms of going forward? Do think you'll be taking down that real estate assets based on the duration of those relative to the duration of the rest of your portfolio?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Peter, it's Ralph. It's -- I guess, to your question, on a broader basis, we'll always look at our investment portfolio relative to our liabilities and ensure that we're matching our assets and liabilities and durations. So as the portfolio mix changes, we will make adjustments, not necessarily in any one asset class, but we'll take a look on a broader basis across all asset classes. But I think, over time, you could see the overall investment portfolio mix shift but it'll be in line with managing our overall liability.","David M. Cordani","Then Peter, it's David. I would just make an add to that. It's important to put, on Ralph's comments which are absolutely correct, in the context of a little bit of Cigna history here. We have a deep expertise in this area that is proving tremendous returns and tremendous sustainability to the returns. So you have a core competency there within our organization. To Ralph's point, there's fungibility, but we should think about that as a level of expertise that has delivered sustained results year in, year out, decade in, decade out in areas of headwinds and areas of tailwinds, which is why it's an important aspect as Ralph points to, we'll use within our portfolio.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sarah James with Wedbush.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","One of your peers recently talked to a slow multi-year ramp for the exchanges where year 1 might be more Medicaid and Medicaid-like than commercial for the industry as a whole. So how do you think about the pace of your growth opportunity in the public exchanges? And while on that topic, how prevalent would narrow network products be in your strategy? And how's that influencing where you ended up in the spectrum of pricing with providers?","David M. Cordani","Sarah, it's David. We're in for an environment, as we step into 2014, as a country of disruption in a variety of ways. And exchanges is one of those, just the nature of dealing with change. From a Cigna perspective, our message has been very clear. Again, as you know, we don't have a book of business that we need to protect here. We have new opportunities to focus on. We intend to act. We've taken discrete action within the company, we intend to be highly focused. And from a business standpoint, you should expect us to have kind of a controlled ramp as the level of market change unfolds. So we're in position to deliver on the promises for the new customers we'll be serving. Learn from that and innovate off the base of it. I'm not sure, to be blunt with you, whether or not it's going to be Medicaid biased or none. You could make an argument that there's a good value proposition there because the size and shape of the federal subsidies gets meaningful once you go below 250% of federal poverty level. But the buying behavior for somebody at 250% of federal poverty level is going to probably be a bit different than somebody at a 150% of federal poverty level. That's where the localization and the customer knowledge comes into play. As it relates to narrow networks, I think, the whole notion of transparency in choice is going to be mission-critical. We don't think about it as a narrow network for narrow network's sake. We think about it as, how do you get the highest value network configuration for the subsegment you're going after? And what's factored into our bias, Sarah, very importantly here is where are our Collaborative Accountable Care relationships? Think about it as a Cigna or the HealthSpring model, most mature. And how can you use those partnerships locked arm and arm with the physicians to get in the best value proposition for individuals. So yes, you could argue that the network will be a little bit more narrow, but it won't be traditional narrow network picking based on price. It'll be picked based upon collaboration and total cost outcome and total value.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","So we can think about maybe the markets that you do go into being built off of the areas where you do have this collaborative care model.","David M. Cordani","Absolutely correct.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","And then follow-up question is just on clarification on the one-time items in the quarter. Could you quantify any impact from sequestration delay and discuss what the $51 million regulatory matter was on the Disability book?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Sarah, it's Ralph. First, on the sequestration impact, that isn't reflected in our special items, that's in our ongoing results. And as I mentioned previously, that was contemplated in our outlook range that we have and it remains there. So that's outside of special items. Regarding the $51 million after-tax special item, that is related to our Disability business and a regulatory review that we underwent regarding claims handling procedures, and we have reached an agreement in principle on handling long-term Disability practices. And as a result, we took a $51 million charge. That's really retrospective in terms of its -- of impact. And then going forward, prospectively, we expect that the effect of these claims processes and practices not to have an impact in our margins over time as the industry adopts the new procedures.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Just to clarify. On sequestration, you had built in the fact that there was sequestration or that there was delay expected in the guidance? I'm just trying to understand if there was any difference in how the timing was.","Ralph J. Nicoletti","We factored -- Sarah, again, to be clear, we factored in our original guidance on our current guidance, a range of outcomes within sequestration within our outlook range. And what we're seeing is the result -- the actual sequestration coming in at the lower end of the range that we contemplated given the timing.","Operator","Our final question comes from Chris Rigg with Susquehanna.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just wanted to come back to the cost trend, where -- you had net favorable development in the current quarter, where did the actual trend for 2012 shake out? And can you remind us how things progressed last year? And I guess, the heart of what I'm trying to get to is just how much of an acceleration you guys are actually expecting in utilization at this point over the latter 3 quarters of the year, relative to kind of where you are right now?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Sure, Chris. It's Ralph. First, let me start with 2012. Largely, what we saw is -- and we saw in the prior year development, we finished closer to about 5% on the overall trend for the year. And the shape of that was largely somewhat favorable in the first quarter. We did see some escalation in the second quarter and that begin to moderate over the balance of the year. So there were some shape to it. As we move into this year and look at our first quarter and our trend projections, we've guided to 6% to 7%. We're on the lower end of that range in the first quarter and we're expecting a slight uptick from there overall as we move to the balance of the year. And that's why we're holding our projection to 6% to 7%.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then just one last one on the PDP MLR in the quarter. I guess, all other things being equal, I would have thought by adding in HealthSpring for an additional month, that would exert a down -- or upward pressure on the ratio, but it actually came down. Is there anything notable there, whether it's regard to just a quarter or sort of benefit designs? Any color there would be helpful.","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Chris, I would just say nothing unusual there at all. It's just there was a seasonal pattern to PDP and we recorded a higher loss ratio in the early part of the year, and that's essentially what you're seeing.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay, I'll follow up off-line.","Operator","I will now turn the call back over to Mr. David Cordani for closing remarks.","David M. Cordani","Thank you. In closing, let me just emphasize a few highlights from our discussion today. We are pleased with our first quarter results, which demonstrated a strong start to the year for Cigna.

At this time, all callers are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedures on how to enter queue to ask a question at that time. As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded.","We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Will McDowell. Please go ahead, Mr. McDowell.","William McDowell - Cigna Corp.","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I am Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations.","With me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Eric Palmer, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Eric will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's second quarter 2017 financial results as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2017.","As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. Specifically, we use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. Reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, shareholders' net income, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com.","In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2017 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.","Before turning the call over to David, I will cover one item pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. In the second quarter, we recorded an after-tax benefit of $47 million or $0.18 per share for merger-related income tax benefits net of transaction costs, and we reported this net benefit as a special item. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations in our discussion of financial results.","Also, consistent with past practices, when we make any prospective comments on earnings or EPS outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future capital deployment or prior-year development of medical costs.","With that, I will turn the call over to David.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Thanks, Will. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today.","I'll begin my comments by highlighting Cigna's second quarter operating results, which reflect strong execution and continued momentum across our portfolio of businesses. Then I'll describe how our recently evolved strategy of Go Deeper, Go Local and Go Beyond guides our focus on the multiple avenues we have for attractive long-term growth. As part of our discussion, I'll highlight some of the examples of growth opportunities we are pursuing across our global markets. I'll then turn the call over to Eric for a more detailed overview of our second quarter results as well as our increased outlook for full year 2017. And then following our Q&A, I'll wrap up the call with a few closing comments.","I'll start with this quarter's operating results. In the second quarter, we continued our momentum with organic earnings growth in all of our reporting segments. Consolidated revenue increased to $10.3 billion. And we grew earnings to $750 million, or $2.91 per share, with significantly increased bottom line contributions from each of our businesses.","Turning to the segments, in Global Health Care, we posted another quarter of strong earnings growth, and our unique approach to engagement and incentive alignment continues to generate high-quality clinical outcomes and competitively differentiated medical costs.","Our Global Supplemental Benefits business had another outstanding quarter, and we continue to innovate with solutions and distribution approaches that enable us to address the evolving health and sense of security needs of individuals in our targeted geographies around the world. And our Group Disability and Life business delivered strong results, specifically in disability, where our clinical resources and productivity model continues to generate improved return-to-work results, which benefit our customers and our employer clients. Collectively, these results coupled with our significant ongoing free cash flow and exceptional capital position give us confidence we will achieve our increased 2017 EPS outlook of $9.75 to $10.05 per share.","As we discussed at our Investor Day in June, to further accelerate our strategic journey as a global health service company, we've taken our successful Go strategy to the next level, building on our differentiated results over the past seven-plus years, a timeframe where we delivered 11% compounded annual growth rate for revenue, 12% for EPS, and an average annual TSR of 34%.","Our evolved strategy of Go Deeper, Go Local and Go Beyond serves as a guide to achieving the right balance of affordability and personalization, which we will deliver by being the undisputed partner of choice, accelerating the next generation of integration, and making the complex simple for the benefit of our customers. The Go Deeper and Go Local dimensions of our strategy will drive opportunities for Cigna to capture meaningful growth in our targeted businesses and guide us to expand our capabilities and pursue targeted additional adjacencies.","Today I'll highlight four areas where we see significant headroom opportunities for growth. I'll briefly touch upon employer clients with up to 500 employees, our voluntary solutions, Medicare Advantage, and our international markets.","Beginning with employer clients with up to 500 employees, increasingly we see these employers are eager to benefit from proven market innovations, including greater choice of transparent affordable solutions to help enable a more productive workforce. They're also seeking health engagement capabilities such as onsite biometric screening, health coaching, and innovative clinical programs. Cigna is uniquely positioned to expand and add to these relationships. Our consultative approach, our investments to expand our capabilities, and our flexible and innovative offerings such as One Guide are very responsive to the emerging needs of these clients.","Next, we also see significant growth potential for our differentiated portfolio of voluntary solutions, as individuals are increasingly empowered to make more personalized choices through their employers relative to their specific benefits that best meet their personal needs at a given life or health stage. We view the $8 billion group supplemental market and specifically accident indemnity, critical illness, and hospital care as complementary to our medical and disability offerings, and as such a large growth opportunity for us. Today we are well positioned with a range of distribution, products, and consumer insight capabilities. In addition, we have proven capabilities in the supplemental market through our successful Global Supplemental Benefits business across the globe.","Next, relative to Medicare Advantage, there is an increasing understanding and appreciation for the ability of these programs to meet the health and wellness needs of the rapidly growing seniors population in the U.S. We deliver significant value to seniors through deep physician partnerships and coordinated approaches to care, each of which are aided by our proven approach to incentive alignment. When you combine this with the effectiveness of Cigna's HealthSpring differentiated value proposition, which is a deeply rooted value-based care series of programs, we see the U.S. seniors marketplace as a tremendous growth opportunity, both in our existing as well as new markets.","As a final example, we see meaningful growth opportunities in our targeted international markets. The global health marketplace is large, complex, and changing rapidly, which provides us with potential for attractive growth and ongoing value creation. In each of our international businesses, specifically Global Supplemental Benefits and Global Health Benefits, Cigna brings decades of local experience and expertise in delivering health, well-being, and sense of security solutions to both individual customers and employer clients.","I'll begin with comments on our Global Supplemental Benefits business. We see considerable opportunities for continued growth in our Global Supplemental Benefits business, where today we serve approximately 13 million customer relationships and where we have grown revenue at a compounded annual rate of 18% since 2009.","In terms of market opportunities, the middle class in Asia alone is expected to continue to grow by 9% annually through 2030, with even higher growth rates anticipated in countries such as China, India, and Indonesia, where we already have a strong foothold.","We recognize that innovative distribution is critical to meeting the diverse and emerging needs of this population. For example, over the past several years, we have broadened our distribution channels from what was primarily outbound telemarketing to new capabilities such as direct-to-consumer channels, including direct-response TV, online, and face-to-face sales, particularly in branches of local banking partners.","Further driving demand, medical costs are outpacing inflation globally, meaning health protection gaps will continue to rise. The health coverage gap across the Asia-Pacific region is expected to grow to $200 billion by the year 2020, and Cigna is well positioned to deliver solutions to meet the needs of individuals most impacted by this gap.","Relative to global health benefits, Cigna is the leading provider of health benefits to the globally mobile population today, with a range of solutions for medical, dental, and pharmacy to behavioral, life and long-term disability benefits. We're deepening our solution suite to offer clients an even more flexible range of benefits that can be customized to meet the complex needs of the globally mobile population. We're further driving growth by expanding our global medical and healthcare provider networks and investing in care management and coordination capabilities which leverage global best practices.","Taking all of this into consideration, Cigna is well positioned to capture further headroom in our existing international businesses as well as expand our capabilities through continued product, service, and distribution innovation.","Before I close my remarks, I'd also note how closely tied to our Go Deep and Go Local proposition is our Go Beyond proposition, which further differentiates the services, capabilities, and experiences we deliver as well as our social impact. I'll share two brief examples, the first being our early adoption Net Promoter Score, or NPS, to improve the customer experience, and the second being our commitment to making an even greater social impact for our local communities around the world, where as we know, social programs designed to promote health and well-being too often leave gaps for local communities.","Approximately five years ago, we were the first in our industry to see Net Promoter Score as a more effective way to understand the loyalty and emerging needs of customers and to drive targeted service and program innovations from those insights. Examples of our innovations include One Guide in the United States, which is already serving nearly 2 million customers, as well as our recently introduced global Wellbeing app, which will be available to customers across the globe.","Further ongoing emphasis on community involvement guides Cigna's actions, such as stepping up to the void in the United States relative to the opioid epidemic. Here, we are already seeing meaningful progress toward our goal to reduce the use of opioid pharmaceuticals amongst our customers by 25%. And we are serving as a convening force across the country for community, faith, law enforcement, and healthcare leaders.","We're also deepening our work for the benefit of the veteran community, and we are furthering a range of community-based initiatives to help seniors in key geographies across the world. Taken together, our strategy of Go Deeper, Go Local and Go Beyond will drive additional value creation for our customers, our clients, physician partners, and communities, and as a result for our shareholders.","Now to summarize a few key points before I turn the call over to Eric. Cigna delivered strong second quarter results, with considerable strength across our portfolio of businesses, as we delivered organic earnings growth in each of our reporting segments. Our increased EPS range of $9.75 to $10.05 per share represents a growth rate of 20% to 24% over our 2016 results.","Our strategy of Go Deeper, Go Local and Go Beyond serves as a guide to our actions in order to deliver differentiated value for our customers and clients. We do this by achieving the right balance of affordability and personalization, which we seek to deliver by being the undisputed partner of choice, accelerating the next generation of integration, and making the complex simple for the benefit of our customers. In particular, the Go Deeper and Go Local dimensions of our strategy will drive opportunities for Cigna to deliver significant growth in each of our targeted businesses.","And our performance momentum through the second quarter of 2017 coupled with our significant ongoing free cash flow and exceptional capital position give us confidence we will achieve our increased 2017 outlook.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Eric.","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will briefly review key aspects of Cigna's second quarter 2017 results and provide an update to our full year outlook.","Key financial highlights in the quarter are: consolidated revenue growth of 4% to $10.3 billion; consolidated earnings growth of 46% to $750 million, including significant earnings growth in each of our business segments; quarterly earnings per share growth of 47% to $2.91; and continued strong free cash flow and financial flexibility, with approximately $1.25 billion returned to shareholders through share repurchase on a year-to-date basis.","Overall, the results in the quarter reflect the effective execution of our focused strategy and demonstrates the strong fundamentals of each of our operating businesses. The strength of these results provides us with continued momentum and confidence, reflected in our increased full year 2017 financial outlook.","Regarding our business segments, I will first comment on Global Health Care. Second quarter premiums and fees in Global Health Care grew to $7.2 billion, driven by strong customer growth and specialty contributions across all commercial market segments and partially offset by the expected contraction in our seniors enrollment. We ended second quarter 2017 with 15.7 million global medical customers, an organic increase of 457,000 lives year to date.","Second quarter earnings increased 22% to $591 million, reflecting growth in medical customers and specialty relationships, continued effective medical cost management, favorable prior-year reserve development, and operating expense discipline.","Turning to our medical care ratios, our second quarter 2017 total commercial medical care ratio, or MCR, of 78.7% reflects the strong performance of our commercial businesses as well as favorable prior-year reserve development, offset by the impact of the health insurance tax moratorium. This result also reflects better than expected medical costs in our U.S. individual business and includes a favorable $4 million after-tax true-up related to risk adjustment balances for the 2016 policy year.","Our second quarter 2017 total government MCR of 86.1% reflects the impact of our innovative physician engagement model within Medicare Advantage and favorable Medicare Part D experience. Second quarter 2017 Global Health Care earnings included favorable prior-year reserve development of $36 million after tax.","Moving to operating expenses, for second quarter 2017, our total Global Health Care operating expense ratio was 19.9%, which reflects the impact of the health insurance tax moratorium, business mix changes, and continued effective expense management. Overall, we've had a very strong quarter in our Global Health Care business.","Now, I will discuss the results of our Global Supplemental Benefits business, which David spoke about earlier. This business continues to deliver very attractive growth and profitability, as our customers continue to value the affordable and personalized solutions we deliver through an increasingly diverse and innovative set of distribution models. Premiums and fees grew to $914 million, an increase of 14%. Second quarter 2017 earnings grew 27% to $105 million, reflecting business growth, favorable claims experience in South Korea, and effective operating expense management.","For Group Disability and Life, second quarter premiums and fees were just over $1 billion. Second quarter earnings in our group business were $83 million, with our life business performing as expected and disability results continuing to reflect a better than expected pace of improvement from the claims process modifications implemented last year. Overall, as a result of the continued effective execution of our strategy, our second quarter results reflect strong earnings contributions from each of our business segments. We also continued to generate very strong free cash flow from our businesses and maintained significant financial flexibility.","Now I will discuss our increased outlook for 2017. In 2017, we expect to continue to deliver strong financial performance for our shareholders by leveraging our highly consultative approach that aligns affordable, personalized solutions to the needs of our clients and customers, continuing to invest to expand our capabilities and innovative offerings to better serve our customers and clients, and effectively deploying capital.","For full year 2017, we continue to expect consolidated revenue to grow in the range of 3% to 4% over 2016 results, driven primarily by our strong growth in medical customers and specialty relationships. Our outlook for full year 2017 consolidated adjusted income from operations is now in the range of approximately $2.50 billion to $2.58 billion, or $9.75 to $10.05 per share. This reflects an increase of $0.20 to $0.40 per share over our previous expectations and represents per-share growth of 20% to 24% over 2016.","I will now discuss the components of our increased 2017 outlook, starting with Global Health Care. We now expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of $2.1 billion to $2.14 billion. Key assumptions reflected in our Global Health Care earnings outlook for 2017 include the following. Regarding global medical customers, we continue to expect growth in the range of 500,000 to 600,000 lives over year-end 2016, reflecting the strong growth we have seen across our commercial market segments.","Turning to medical costs, for our total U.S. commercial book of business, we now expect full year medical cost trends to be in the range of 4% to 5%, an improvement of 50 basis points over our previous expectations. Our industry-leading medical cost trend continues to reflect our collaborative relationships with providers, differentiated specialty integration model, and greater incentive alignment for our customers and clients, which result in positive health outcomes and better management of total medical costs.","Now turning to our medical care ratio outlook, for our total commercial book of business, we continue to expect the 2017 MCR to be in the range of 80.5% to 81.5%, now with a bias towards the lower end of the range. For our total government book of business, we now expect the 2017 MCR to be in the range of 84.5% to 85.5%, an improvement of 50 basis points versus our prior expectations.","Regarding operating expenses, we continue to expect our 2017 Global Health Care operating expense ratio to be in the range of 20.5% to 21.5%. I would also note regarding our U.S. individual business, we continue to expect to report a loss for full year 2017, albeit at a lower level than previous expectations.","For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we continue to expect strong top line growth, and now expect earnings in the range of $310 million to $330 million. This is an increase of $15 million over previous expectations, reflecting the strength of our second quarter results.","Regarding the Group Disability and Life business, we now expect full year 2017 earnings in the range of $260 million to $280 million, an increase of $20 million to $30 million over previous expectations, reflecting continued operational improvements in our disability business.","Regarding our remaining operations, that is other operations and corporate, we now expect a loss of $170 million for 2017.","So all in, for full year 2017, we now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $2.50 billion to $2.58 billion, or $9.75 to $10.05 per share. This represents an increase of $0.20 to $0.40 per share over our previous expectations. I'll also remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of additional prior-year reserve development or of any future capital deployments.","Now moving to our 2017 capital management position and outlook, overall, we continue to have excellent financial flexibility. Our subsidiaries remain well capitalized and are generating significant free cash flow to the parent, with a strong return on capital in each of our business segments, and we have significant free cash and leverage capacity available at the parent company.","Our capital deployment strategy and priorities remain: first, funding our businesses to support long-term growth; next, pursuing M&A activity, with a focus on acquiring capabilities and scale to further grow in our targeted areas of focus; and lastly, after considering these first two items, we would return capital to shareholders, primarily through share repurchase.","Regarding free cash flow, we ended the second quarter with parent company cash of approximately $2.2 billion. And after considering all sources and uses of parent company cash, we continue to expect to have approximately $5 billion of parent cash available for deployment in 2017, reflecting strong ongoing free cash flows from our operating businesses and the after-tax impact of the break fee from the Anthem transaction. Further, we have the capacity to generate additional deployable cash by increasing our debt-to-capitalization ratio to the mid-30%, which we would consider a normal range going forward.","These components would bring us to $7 billion of potentially deployable cash in 2017, with additional incremental leverage capacity to raise the debt-to-capitalization ratio to the low to mid-40% in consideration of strategic M&A opportunities.","During the period from May 5 through August 3, we repurchased approximately 5.4 million shares of stock for $910 million, bringing our year-to-date share repurchase to approximately 7.7 million shares of stock for $1.25 billion. As we have noted previously, we intend to complete at least $2 billion in share repurchases by the end of this year.","Our balance sheet and free cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from industry-leading margins and returns on capital in our businesses and the high level of capital efficiency, particularly from our fee-based businesses.","Now to recap, our second quarter 2017 consolidated results reflect the strength and momentum in our diversified portfolio of global businesses and continued effective execution of our focused strategy. The fundamentals of our business remain strong, as evidenced by these results, which reflected strong revenue and earnings contributions from each of our business segments, industry-leading medical cost trends and high clinical quality, and continued strong free cash flow. Based on the strength of these results, we are confident in our ability to achieve our increased full year 2017 earnings outlook.","With that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citigroup. You may ask your question.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks, good morning. So you have the 10% to 13% long-term growth estimate, and you talked at the Investor Day about more accelerated growth, at or maybe above the high end of the range. So I guess \u2013 I know you're not going to give 2018 guidance, but can you maybe just frame into 2018 some of the positives and drags you see relative to that growth estimate that you have for next year?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Ralph, good morning. It's David. Thank you. As you said, it's early for 2018 guidance, so we're not going through the individual components. Let me try to give you just a little color relative to that, all taken against the backdrop, as you said, at our Investor Day, we remain committed to the 10% to 13% long-term EPS growth rate and our strategic objectives to achieve the $16 of EPS out in 2021.","First, as you think about starting any given year, so as we talk about 2018, I would remind you that we always start a year and plan for a year assuming that there will be no prior-year reserve development. So put that back in context, as you know, we have a lot of \u2013 $100 million after tax of prior-year reserve development in 2017. So we would start viewing that as a zero going into 2018.","The macro headlines I'd ask you to think about off of that is very strong momentum off of the core business in 2017, which really is important when you're projecting forward. To be clear, we would expect to grow revenue as well as earnings off of our 2017 base. As noted by Eric, we have a great track record of producing very strong cash flows. We expect that to continue in 2018 as well as to maintain a very strong capital position. So we look forward to carrying the momentum out of 2017 into 2018 with good top line and bottom line growth, noting that the prior-year reserve development would be something we would always plan for and project at zero.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, that's helpful. And then just to follow up, I wanted to go to the Global Supplemental business margins were really strong this quarter. Anything to call out there, how sustainable is it? And then you talked about the big opportunity. The segment right now is about 12% of earnings today. Any willingness to give us where you think that can go over the next handful of years as a percentage of the total business? Thanks.","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Ralph, it's Eric. Just on the margins and such within the Global Supplemental Benefits business, overall, the Global Supplemental business has a great track record of strong revenue and earnings growth, and we're really happy with the results in the quarter. This quarter's results reflected the continued effect of strong growth. It reflected expense leverage as we continue to grow and get that expense leverage opportunity as well as a bit of favorable loss costs in Korea in particular. This business does have variation from period to period. It can exhibit variability from period to period and such, but this is a great quarter.","In terms of the longer-term outlook, we continue to expect the long-term revenue growth in this segment to be in the mid-teens. And so you would expect it to grow as a portion of our enterprise over time. But again, we feel really good about the trajectory that we're on and the mid-teens growth rate in terms of the long-term outlook.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Ralph, to expand on the long-term outlook, clearly this business has, is, and will continue to grow at an organic rate faster than other aspects of our business. We feel great about the overall portfolio of businesses. This has a faster and more robust underlying growth rate. As such, if we were just to simply freeze for any M&A across the franchise, to your point, the percent of revenue to the enterprise, percent of earnings to the enterprise would continue to grow for this business as we look forward. And important to note, as we've discussed in the past, we continue to invest in and expand in capabilities, geographic footprint, talent, et cetera, to continue that growth momentum, so we have good optimism here to see it be a bigger part of the portfolio going forward.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Giacobbe. The next question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS. You may ask your question.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Hello, everybody. First, maybe just to ask, you're lowering the medical cost trend expectations again by 50 basis points. Your expectation was already the lowest in the industry or best managed in the industry, whatever way you want to describe it. I guess I would ask you first. What buckets are you seeing that are making you move this? Is this inpatient? What is it?","And then more broadly, because it does seem like this quarter and following on the first quarter, the entire industry seems to be in another one of those periods where the cost trend and the MLR results and so forth are running better than expected. If you step back, is there some dynamic that you would point to at a macro level? Is it benefit design, high-deductible plans maybe that are having an impact, do you think, or is it medical cost management is taking another step forward? What would you say is driving why we're seeing everyone seemingly having a very good trend on the cost side?","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","A.J., it's Eric. I'll start it off and then maybe ask David to fill in on some of the more macro comments on the back end here. First of all, we are really pleased with our medical trend results. We continue to build on the results that we've reported now for several years. A couple of comments I'd make, we entered the year with the expectation of 4.5% to 5.5%. And as you know, we lowered it to 4% to 5% in terms of the quarter. I think I talked on our call a quarter ago, we had expected each of the categories, inpatient, outpatient, professional, and pharmacy, to be in that low to mid-single-digits range, and that continues to be our expectation. It's just that each one of those are coming in a little bit lower in the range than we had previously contemplated. So overall, I feel really good about our ability to get to the 4% to 5% trend.","And again, I'd note that that is something that's really fundamental in terms of the way that we deliver our overall value proposition to our clients. We think our trend result is driven by continued effective collaborative relationships, and again, overall the value of really good incentive alignment. But again, maybe, David, I'll ask you to take a more macro perspective.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","A.J., on the macro perspective, I think you make some very good observations, and specifically I'd highlight a few points. First, broadly speaking, I think when the industry is having this conversation and to the core of your question, it's really driven broadly speaking by the employer marketplace. And the good news is as you look over the last several years, the employer marketplace, while always has opportunities for improvement, has driven meaningful step-up in innovation. So where does the innovation come from? Improved incentive alignment. Where does the innovation come from? Evolution of clinical programs. Where is the innovation coming from? Beginning to explore across the industry more value-based programs, as have been proven in MA.","Specific to Cigna, we've been deep into those areas for quite some time. And to the cornerstone of your comment, we're seeing a little bit bigger impact of those results on a sustainable basis. I'd also note finally, as we've discussed in the past, there's more adoption of transparent funding programs. That creates better alignment with employers. That helps to create better alignment with individuals, all of which help you get better engagement and better clinical outcomes. So net-net, we see it as a societal good to see this from an industry standpoint, and we're pleased from a Cigna standpoint our results are leading the pack relative to those engagement incentive-based outcomes.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. And if I can ask on my follow-up maybe, so now we have the lay of the land. You've had good success in mitigating some of the pressures on the Star Ratings for MA, and sanctions are behind you all. How fast should we think about your ability to get back on a growth trajectory and enrollment gains there? And if we're thinking the market is going to grow 6% to 8% enrollment on a steady-state basis, how quick can you get back maybe to market growth? Should we give that a few years, or are you more optimistic you can get there quicker?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","A.J., it's David. So first, we're quite pleased to come out of the sanctions process well in advance of the 2018 open enrollment cycle. Our team as we sit here today is actively enrolling for the remaining 2017 months and is highly focused and well prepared for a very successful open enrollment cycle this fall. And for 2018, I would just say very clearly, we expect to grow our MA portfolio.","And I'd remind you that as you think about our proposition, we have a clear track record of consistent sustainable growth in our MA portfolio, which always starts with strong customer retention, and we're aided by those strong customer retention levels because of the fact that we have a high value-based penetration of our programs. 85% of all of our MA lives are in value-based programs. So to be really clear, we're active today. In the remaining 2017 months, the team is prepared and ready to roll for 2018, and we expect to grow.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Rice. The next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, guys, nice quarter. Can you talk a little bit about the 2018 selling season and what you're seeing going on there? In particular, I'm referencing the return of the health insurance fee [HIF] and the impact that that's having on your risk-based business that you're selling, as well as the impact that it might be having on the uptake of alternative funding products that you sell.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Good morning. It's David. Let me give you a little bit of insight relative to the 2018 season. So I'll start with some color relative to the national account market, which is the most tangible market to speak to right now, given that it has a little bit broader selling cycle, and then give you a little bit of insight relative to your question on the HIF.","First, relative to national accounts, I'd remind you that we define that segment a little differently than the industry. Specifically, when we refer to national, it's commercial employers with 5,000 or more employees in multiple states. Secondly, I'd just remind you our strategic goal has been to hold share from an aggregate standpoint but to deepen share with employers who value incentive and engagement-based programs, and then further deepen our relationship with our clients through leveraging our specialty and clinical programs. And I would note that 2017 has been a good year for that business segment.","As it relates to 2018, what we've seen is that the RFP process, so the inbound opportunities for new growth opportunities, are up relative to 2016 meaningfully. I'd note that the 2016 volumes were low for the industry because there was a lot of industry disruption. But the 2018 volumes look a little bit more like 2016, and they're up meaningfully. To put that in context, the percent of our business that's out to bid is up a little bit, but nowhere near as meaningfully as the inbound opportunities. And we would expect as we look at 2018 to continue to have a very strong client retention rate.","As it relates to broader purchasing trends, building on the prior comments, we continue to see across all segments high interest levels in incentive and engagement-based programs, which tend to leverage the transparent funding programs because they just create greater alignment with the employer, and as such, the individual customer employee, and enable you to get better mentally incentive alignment by targeted clinical programs, and we see that trend continuing.","Lastly, as it relates to the HIF, the industry has a mechanism with which to previously pull out the pricing impact of the HIF and now put the pricing impact of the HIF back in. And we do not see a demonstrable change in purchasing patterns as it relates to guaranteed cost or transparent funding program as a result of that.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So pretty similar in terms of the EV uptake of the different products; it's not an acceleration or deceleration relative to the way it was last year, but this year?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Again, just putting it in context, we've seen a continued drumbeat of broader adoption of transparent funding programs across the marketplace, but we don't see that trend of acceleration changing.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Costa. The next question comes from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. Could you just update us on when you are expecting to receive the termination fee from Anthem and the status of any litigation surrounding that?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Gary, good morning. It's David. As I think you know, that's currently in active litigation, and we don't typically comment on active litigation. So I'd like to leave it there.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And the origin of the tax gain you were able to book related to that, just a quick synopsis or summary again of what prompted that?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","I'll ask Eric to expand on that, but the tax gain is more broadly speaking relative to sun-setting the integration activity. Eric?","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Gary, it's Eric. Specifically, the expenses associated with some of the integration work and such that we recorded as special items throughout the course of the pendency of the transaction, 2015 and 2016, those costs were not tax-deductible. Now that the Anthem transaction \u2013 the purchase \u2013 the merger agreement is closed and behind us, those costs became deductible, and so that is what generated the tax benefit.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Taylor. The next question comes from Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks, good morning. First question, just if you can, touch on the individual business and the better medical costs that you saw in the quarter, maybe a little bit on what you were seeing there. And then in terms of the margin profile, I know that you're still expecting a loss. But maybe you can give us a little indication of where the margin profile has changed relative to the prior view.","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Sure, Scott. It's Eric. So overall, individual is a small business for us, as you know. As we noted in my prepared remarks, the first half results were a little bit better than we had expected. In particular, I would call out the solid performance from the markets where we've used our aligned collaborative models. As you might remember, we've talked in prior calls. We entered a couple of new markets this year. We changed the offerings we had in a couple of markets in terms of managing our footprint, and in particular drove our offerings around deep aligned collaborative models. And those models in particular are performing better for us.","As you think about the full year expectation, this business does have a pretty pronounced seasonality. The deductibles in the plan design will drive higher costs over the back half the year, and that takes us to a small loss for 2017, be a better result than last year but a loss nonetheless.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got it, and then the follow-up question just on MA. And we've certainly been hearing in other calls competitors citing how they're plowing some of the upside that they've been seeing in results and to investing a bit more on the MA side for growth next year. Maybe just talk about how you're thinking about investments for MA as a result of some of the favorable experience you've been seeing in what seems to be a pretty competitive environment for MA next year.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Good morning, Scott. It's David. First, just broadly speaking relative to investments, we have a long track record of a continued process of investing back into our portfolio of businesses, whether it be the healthcare business from a commercial standpoint, innovations like One Guide, whether it's the global business innovations like the global Wellbeing app, whether it's voluntary expansion within our group and our Health Care portfolio as well as MA. So broadly speaking, we just have a continued investment orientation within the portfolio.","As it relates to MA, as I noted before, we would expect to grow our MA portfolio in 2018 organically. To be very clear, we did not expand geographically for 2018 because of the previous situation we were in. We would expect to resume our proven pattern of expanding geographies, both adjacent counties as well as new geographies as we look to 2019 and beyond, and we'll be updating you on those investments as we go forward.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Fidel. The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thanks. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on the MLR by the two divisions. I was a little bit surprised that you didn't lower the commercial MLR given that favorable development seems to be on that side and that's where you got 3R [risk adjustment, risk corridor, reinsurance] improvement. But you did raise in the government MLR, which seemed to me at least more in line with what we were expecting. So I was wondering if you could provide a little bit of color. Obviously, you are going to the low end of the commercial MLR range, but I would have thought maybe a reduction there.","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","This is Eric, just a couple of comments I'd make on that. As you note, in terms of the commercial MLR, we are now focused on the lower end of our range of 80.5% to 81.5%, and that just really reflects the year-to-date cost and trend favorability. As you think about the back half of the year on the commercial loss ratio, I think there's some uncertainty around exactly how the individual business could perform in terms of closing out the year. I thought that it was prudent to continue to reflect the range of 80.5% to 81.5%.","As you commented on prior-year development [PYD], year to date our prior-year development has been in the neighborhood of 60% commercial, 40% seniors, so it really has been split across all of our books of business. And as you know, the commercial book of business is quite a bit bigger than the seniors book of business. And so the impact of the experience we've had to date, the prior-year development moved the seniors loss ratio, the Medicare loss ratio, more significantly, and that's why we lowered that range.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. I thought in the quarter you said that it was mostly commercial, but you're saying the first quarter was mostly \u2013 there's more government that caused you to lower the government for the year?","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","In terms of \u2013 the PYD was 60:40 split over the course of the first half of the year. We didn't provide any particular color in terms of the driver of that or the breakdown of that for the quarter.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then I guess as far as the four growth drivers that you outlined earlier, were those listed in the order of importance, or is there some way to think about which one or two might be more important than the others?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Kevin, it's David. They were not in order of importance. We have a well-positioned portfolio of businesses with a number of growth opportunities. And those specific four growth opportunities we spent some time at our Investor Day and further embellishing on them, so we see step-function growth in those four categories. And again, you'll note the diversity of our portfolio enables us to have several unique growth opportunities that we're quite excited about.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right, thanks.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Fischbeck. The next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. You may ask your question.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. On the PYD, coming back to that for a second, I think you had, as you've said, just under $100 million. You've raised Health Care earnings year to date by I think about $45 million at the midpoint. I wanted to get your comments or color on whether some of that excess is going into reinvestment in the second half or how we should think about that relative to your earnings guide.","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","David, it's Eric, just a couple of comments on that. We entered 2017 with good momentum in our Health Care businesses and increased the outlook a couple of times so far this year, so let's start with that. In terms of \u2013 we're pleased with the medical costs that they've developed favorably. And again, I think of that as being another hallmark in terms of the overall favorability we've had in medical cost trend.","As we think about the balance of the year and the amount so far this year, a couple of dynamics I'd point to on that. One, I just mentioned a few minutes ago, caution in terms of the experience or the potential experience in the second half of the year related to the individual business. And second of all, you should expect that we're making adjustments in terms of the rate and pace of strategic investments and things along those lines in terms of the capabilities we've invested and deployed over the balance of the year. But now we feel good about the increase to the full year outlook and our position to achieve it.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Great, thank you. And then in the MA business, I'm curious if you could describe or even quantify the extent to which you're absorbing some negative leverage with the decline in membership this year, and with the return to growth next year how that might reverse.","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","It's Eric. Without question, we did have a decline in revenue, and that has created some pressure. I don't think it's productive to isolate out a specific impact and such there, but you should think of us continuing to operate that business at an expense ratio that we think is attractive, a bit of room for improvement as we go forward and regrow into our long-term footprint.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Windley. The next question comes from Chris Rigg with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.","Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. I just wanted to come back to Medicare Advantage really post the sanctions being lifted. I guess how quickly \u2013 and I don't even know if you can answer this definitively, but how quickly can you tell whether or not people are coming back to your business from direct marketing versus others in the market? Thanks. Like how much share are you gaining over the interim?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","It's David. I think we always start with our growth mantra for our corporation across the globe is retain-expand-add. So we start with the fundamental proposition that if you're delivering strong value to your customers, you should expect the ability to retain relationships at an elevated level. For the aspects of our business that we have the ability to expand the relationship through our specialty portfolio, et cetera, if we're delivering strong value and retaining on a targeted basis, we should be able to identify ways to further expand the value for our customers and clients and therefore expand relationships and targeted adds.","As it relates to MA, that's really retention, in addition, with the process, so I would start with the notion of even during the sanction process, we were able to post a retention rate that was higher than others that have gone through the similar process. And I think that points back to, number one, the deep well-rooted physician partnership models and value-based relationships and strong service delivery, so that's the core. Two, to answer your question, we're selling in the marketplace right now and we're re-enrolling. And the pattern is evolving, so we're back in the market for July 1. We're able to test and see whether or not the momentum was manifesting itself, and we're in the market for August 1. We're able to manifest itself and we'll be in the market through the residual months of 2017.","Secondly, we do know from some of our very well-developed physician engagement models, there's some high energy in those markets and with seniors coming into our program. So we would expect to step into 2018 with net growth across this portfolio, and we don't believe we need a hiatus to re-manifest our growth objectives.","Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just a slightly different area here on capital deployment, you obviously want to emphasize growth areas, but obviously share repurchases are also an option. How do you decide as you move through the year when the M&A environment is just not going to manifest itself or you've spent enough on growth and then you want to switch over to share repurchase? I guess I'm just trying to think about the timing of when you would go back to a more aggressive posture on the share repurchase run. Thanks.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Hey, Chris. It's David. Just again, to put the levers back in context, as Eric noted in his prepared remarks, our capital deployment priorities remain and are very clear: so support the ongoing needs of our growing businesses, and our growing businesses are supported by well-capitalized subsidiaries today; second, strategic and appropriately attractive M&A; and third is share repurchase as a primary means of returning to our shareholders as we sit here today. As we've spent a good time on, we have meaningful capital deployment opportunities in front of us relative to current cash on hand as well as leverage capability, and that's both an exciting opportunity but a meaningful shareholder responsibility that we understand.","I would note that there's not an or proposition. It's not like we have a date certain that we're going to shift from A to B. It's a dynamic portfolio management process, and I would guide you to just reflect back on over our last half a dozen-plus years. We have a proven track record of: A), not letting excess cash or capital sit idle for the benefit of shareholders; B), a very disciplined approach when we do engage in M&A online with our articulated M&A objectives; and over time a very balanced approach relative to M&A as well as share repurchase. In fact, if you look back over the last half a dozen-plus years, it's about 50:50. To your point, it just happened in a little bit more lumpy fashion because of when the M&A opportunities present themselves. So net-net taken as a whole, significant shareholder value creation sits in front us relative to capital deployment, and we get that.","Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Rigg. The next question comes from Jack Wang (52:47) with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, this is Justin Lake. Thanks, just one question. Just getting back to your Health Care performance in the quarter, your performance versus Street consensus and our number was $65 million \u2013 $75 million better in the quarter. Just curious how your performance looked versus your expectations. Were you mis-modeled a little bit, or was there that much upside and you're just reinvesting it back in the second half?","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Justin, it's Eric, just a couple of comments on that. I think our expectations were a little bit higher than where the Street was at. And so again, there's an element of that. Overall, I'm really pleased with the favorability that we generated across each of the businesses. As you think over the balance of the year, the things that we're thinking about related to the back half of the year are just our updated assessment in terms of the seasonality. I've commented in terms of our caution in terms of the individual business, and that's continuing to make investments in capabilities that would advance the areas of focus, a couple of which David talked about in its prepared remarks.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Lake. The next question comes from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. You may ask your question.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Thanks, good morning. I wanted to follow up on the point around value-based care and you lowering the trend. Since this is a spread game, what kind of conversations are you having with the brokers and the benefit consultants? Are the employers now expecting lower rate increases for the remainder of this year and next year, or is it that your business is pretty differentiated around stop-loss or other specialty offerings, so it doesn't really feel as commoditized? What is it broadly for the industry? Are these MLRs going to keep going down?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Ana, good morning. It's David. You bridged two points. The value-based care component, so alignment with healthcare professionals to pay based on the quality of outcomes and the coordination of care, I would ask you to think about it two ways.","One, very deep and broad relative to MA, 85% of all of our MA lives are in a value-based care program, deepening and evolving in the commercial space. So upside opportunities we look forward in the commercial space for sure. The reason why I reference that is in addition to that in the commercial space, what we've been able to do is advance significantly more on the demand side of the process, so individual incentive alignment, individual engagement, care coordination, navigation support, incentive alignment. When you take all those and put them together, as Eric noted, our commercial medical cost trend continues to track very favorably relative to any industry norm and continues to track favorably relative to our expectations in this year.","Now to the clients, I'd remind you that 85% of our employer clients are in self-funded and fully transparent relationships. We like that because there's high levels of alignment, transparency, and visibility month to month, quarter to quarter, year to year, and they're seeing the benefit of this lower medical cost trend for their respective portfolio based upon the actions we're driving and continuing to drive for them. And of the residual 15%, that's split amongst experience-rated relationships where there's high transparency as well as guaranteed cost. And in guaranteed cost, if we isolate the 4% or so of our revenue that's on the individual exchange-based business because we don't play down-market under 50 employees, even those employers tend to be rated based on the credibility of their experience.","My point is there's a high level of transparency and alignment with employers, and therefore we're aligned to try to get the right clinical programs moving forward, and we'll continue to drive this approach in 2018 and beyond.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Fair enough, okay. So following up on that on the specialty side for your ASO heavy book, can you give us a sense for if you increase your penetration as you've talked about voluntary and otherwise, what the potential target could be on the operating income and over what period of time that we can build into our growth forecasts?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Ana, it's David. I'm not sure I can give you a point estimate to build into your growth forecast. I'd bring you back a little bit to the time we spent on this topic at I. Day walking through some dimensions of the respective penetration levels that exist, and some headroom exists across our portfolio.","So point one is we have headroom or additional penetration and growth opportunities across our portfolio. We don't view that as a static result because the dynamics of our employers' needs evolve. Secondly, as we've proven, we continue to innovate new programs and new services for the benefit of our clients, so we don't manage a static book. And thirdly, as I highlighted in my prepared remarks, we see the evolving employer voluntary marketplace as an additional growth opportunity. So as we talk about the retain-expand-add, the expand aspect of our growth strategy continues to have a lot of upside attractiveness both based on our existing specialty portfolio as well as evolved capabilities as we look forward.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks, David. I appreciate the color.","Operator","Thank you, Ms. Gupte. Our last question comes from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. You may ask your question.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you. Can you speak to the atmosphere within your Medicare sales team? There was a period of disruption from the potential merger and the sanctions. So looking at the team now, how is morale and focus as we embark on returning to growth mode? And then was there any more turnover on the sales team over this period than normal? And also, how are you thinking about the marketing push this year compared to a typical year? Is there a step up in 2018 for marketing spend?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Sure, good morning. It's David. I appreciate the question very much. An important part of having a business that has disruption, how do you engage your team and keep them engaged, et cetera? So very importantly, we understood that coming into the sanction process, and my hat is off to our Medicare leadership team. They did a great job of having massive transparency with our colleagues across all aspects of the business, including sales, to your point.","Too, our retention rates have been outstanding. We smartly redeployed a lot of the sales folks and growth-related folks in other aspects of the business. And I think we actually have a net benefit from that, if you look at the silver lining in the clouds, where skill sets and experiences have evolved because they've worked in other aspects of the seniors business over this disrupted timeframe. That team has been refocused now back on growing, as I noted before. We're actively in the small aspect of the 2017 process. The team has spent time together focused on the 2018 preparedness process, and they're ready to roll. That team is proud of the value proposition we deliver, and they're ready to roll to bring new programs and new relationships out to the seniors population to help change more lives.","As it relates to the marketing spend, our team has been prepared, ready, focused on this, and they'll get the appropriate level of marketing support to make sure we're able to have the impact in 2018 we're looking forward to having.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Ms. James. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. David Cordani for closing remarks.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Thank you.","Briefly, just to wrap up our call, I'd like to highlight some key points from today's discussion. In the second quarter, we continued our momentum with organic earnings growth in all of our reporting segments. These results coupled with our significant ongoing free cash flow and exceptional capital position give us confidence we will achieve our increased 2017 EPS outlook of $9.75 to $10.05 per share.","To further accelerate our strategic journey as a global health service company, we've taken our successful Go strategy to the next level, building on our differentiated results over the past seven-plus years.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded.","We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Will McDowell. Please go ahead, Mr. McDowell.","William McDowell","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I am Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me this morning are; David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric Palmer, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Eric will cover a number of topics including Cigna's first quarter 2019 financial results, as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2019.","As noted in our earnings release when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues which are not determined in accordance with Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income, and total revenues respectively is contained in today's earnings release which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com.","We use the term labeled Adjusted Income from Operations and Earnings Per Share on this same basis as our principle measures of financial performance. I will remind you that as previously disclosed, we exclude contributions from transitioning clients from adjusted income from operations, and adjusted revenue.","In our remarks today we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2019 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.","Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, in the first quarter we recorded special items totaling to a charge of $108 million or $0.28 per share primarily to reflect the impact of integration and transaction related costs. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues in our discussion of financial results.","Please note that, consistent with best practice when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance including our full year 2019 outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future share repurchases or additional prior year development of medical costs. Finally, I remind you that Cigna will be hosting our upcoming Investor Day on May 31, in New York City.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to David.","David Cordani","Thanks Will. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining our call today.","Today, I'm going to highlight Cigna's strong financial results in our first quarter as a combined company with Express Scripts driven by growth, innovation and focused execution across our businesses. I\u2019ll then address how Cigna is creating differentiated value in an ever changing landscape as we remain on the path to deliver attractive growth in 2019 and beyond. I'll also update you on how our team is advancing our integration priorities before turning the call over to Eric for a more detailed overview of our financial results.","I'll begin with our strong first quarter performance which included exceptional service delivery to our customer's, patients and clients, strong retention levels, expansion and deepening of our customer, patient and client relationships, and innovation and growth across our portfolio of businesses.","I'll provide just a few examples of our momentum. In Health Services we added $1.7 million new pharmacy customers since the start of the year. We drove 9% organic medical customer growth in the select segment year-over-year reflecting the value of the differentiated fully integrated solutions we bring to that marketplace.","Within our integrated medical business, we further deepened our customer relationships by adding approximately 800,000 behavioral and approximately 600,000 in dental. In addition, Cigna continues to deliver outstanding medical and pharmacy cost trend across our commercial, government and health service businesses.","This momentum has helped to fuel a great start to 2019. Cigna's consolidated adjusted revenue was $33.4 billion and we grew after tax earnings by 48% to $1.5 billion.","Within our business segments, Integrated Medical delivered a 13% increase in revenue with very strong earnings growth of 16%, and Health Services delivered significant growth in both revenue and earnings.","Our other business segments also made solid contributions, as we generated very strong cash flows in the first quarter, while deploying significant capital to both debt repayment and share repurchase. Collectively, our first quarter results demonstrate Cigna's strong performance and momentum and give us confidence we will achieve our increased outlook for revenue, earnings and EPS in 2019.","Looking beyond our strong first quarter results, we recognize that our company operates in a dynamic environment and that customers and patients need even greater value from the health care system. As more stakeholders seek to improve sustainability, we continue engaging with our regulatory client provider and community partners.","Our goal in doing this is to better identify and implement proven solutions that improve affordability, choice and predictability, all while accelerating innovation. This path to sustainability is strengthened by our combination with Express Scripts leveraging our broad services, depth of informatics and healthcare partnerships all to accelerate innovation and the value for those we serve.","Let me provide two recent examples of how Cigna has already leveraged our combination to deliver additional innovations for our customers, patients and clients. The first relates to diabetes. Approximately 24 million Americans are diagnosed with diabetes and about 6 million of them are insulin dependent. To many of these individuals, who struggle to afford their insulin. In fact a recent yield study found that one in four insulin dependent individuals with diabetes cut back on their use of insulin because of cost. We view that as unacceptable and given the importance of the issue, it was when we decided to tackle immediately.","We launched our patient assurance program last month, which addresses the need for greater affordability and increases access to insulin for people diabetes. By ensuring our eligible customers pay no more than $25 for a 30 day supply of insulin. This is a major innovation for people with diabetes, some of whom have to pay hundreds of dollars they can't afford for the 30 day supply. Together, we harnessed our combined strength and accelerated the introduction of this new solution for our customers and patients. Our combination created the opportunity for us to deliver this solution to the marketplace faster than either Cigna or Express Scripts could have achieved independently.","The second example of how we're innovating revolves around improving today's fragmented health care system, which is too frequently marked by episodic uncoordinated care. To help address this, Express Scripts recently launched Health Connect 360, an outcome based approach to delivering highly personalized clinical support for our clients and patients. The capability comprehensively connects health plans, providers, pharmacists and other clinical partners to ensure each person gets the clinical care support they need when and how they want it.","With Health Connect 360, we're able to dramatically expand value based care programs as well benefiting customers, patients, clients and those health care professionals who are creating the most value today.","The platform works by integrating otherwise unconnected data to our care insights hub which provides more comprehensive care programs that lead to better health and greater affordability for our patients and clients. The result is personalized and effective coordination without duplication or confusion. We've already rolled out Health Connect 360 in successful pilot programs covering approximately 500,000 customers and patients. We're receiving significant client interest for implementation later this year and into 2020.","These examples highlight how Cigna is using the full breadth of our capabilities to address the most pressing challenges in healthcare. Fueled by our clear strategic direction to maximize the value we create for our customers, patients and clients, our highly engaged 74000 co-workers, our four well positioned growth platforms, the breadth and depth of our actionable data and analytics which give us the tools to holistically understand and address our customer patient needs, and our strong cash flow which gives us meaningful financial flexibility and strategic optionality.","Relative to Express Scripts integration activities, we're making very good progress. Specifically we're executing well against each of our five integration priorities which include first and foremost, delivering on our commitments to provide outstanding service to our customers, patients and clients in 2019, and as we look to 2020.","In the first quarter, our customer net promoter score across our commercial business saw significant improvement year-over-year. In our health service business specifically, we continue to earn the trust of our clients as validated by the outlook introduced this morning for 96% to 98% retention for 2020.","The second priority is maintaining high level of talent engagement retention. We are encouraged by our early progress with engagement retention levels which are above our already strong pre combination levels.","Third is realizing shareholder synergies from administrative costs and other efficiencies. We are on track with our targets. Fourth, delivering medical and pharmacy cost savings. We are well into our program and we are on track to deliver meaningful savings. And fifth, is keeping our vision top of mind as we collaborate to drive accelerate innovation.","All in, we are pleased with our progress to-date and we look forward to providing you with additional insights on our integration progress at our upcoming Investor Day.","Now to conclude, Cigna delivered strong first quarter financial results which reflect momentum across our businesses in our first full quarter as a combined company including continued customer, growth and deepening of relationships and health services, as well as integrated medical business and strong medical and pharmacy costs results.","In the quarter we generated strong cash flows and deployed significant capital to both debt repayment and share repurchase. Our first quarter results reflect Cigna's strong performance momentum and give us confidence we will achieve our increased outlook for revenue, earnings an EPS in 2019.","Looking ahead, I am very confident and excited about our path forward and we remain on track to achieve our 2021 EPS target of $20 to $21 per share.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Eric.","Eric Palmer","Thanks David. Good morning everyone.","In my remarks today, I will review key aspects of Cigna's first quarter results and discuss our updated outlook for the full year. Key consolidated financial highlights for first quarter 2019 include adjusted revenues of $33.4 billion, earnings of $1.5 billion after tax, earnings per share of $3.90 and continued strong operating cash flow. These results reflect the underlying strength of our business and the value we deliver to our customers and clients.","Regarding our segments, I\u2019ll our first comment on health services. First quarter revenues were $22.5 billion and pre-tax earnings were $994 million. Results for first quarter reflect organic growth with the addition of 1.7 million pharmacy customers year-to-date and strong volumes with 292 million adjusted pharmacy scripts fulfilled in the quarter and strong performance in specialty pharmacy. Overall, health services delivered good results in the first quarter consistent with our expectations and reflecting continued focused execution and the first full quarter following our combination with Express Scripts.","Turning to our Integrated Medical segment, first quarter revenues grew 13% to $9.2 billion driven by customer growth and expansion of specialty relationships, premium growth reflecting underlying cost trends, and the inclusion of the Express Scripts Medicare Part D business.","We ended the first quarter with 17 million global medical customers driven by an organic increase of 224,000 lives quarter-over-quarter and 32,000 lives sequentially led by growth in our select and middle market segments. First quarter earnings grew 16% to $1.17 billion reflecting strong medical and specialty contributions and continued effective medical cost management.","Turning to our total medical care ratio or MCR, our first quarter MCR of 78.9% reflects continued strong medical cost performance in both our commercial and government businesses and the pricing effect of the suspension of the health insurance tax. First quarter 2019 Integrated Medical earnings benefited from $50 million dollars pre-tax of favorable nets prior year reserve development compared with $51 million pre-tax in the first quarter of 2018. Overall, Cigna's Integrated Medical segment had a very strong start to the year.","Turning to our international markets business, revenues increased to $1.4 billion and first quarter earnings were $206 million reflecting business growth partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency movements and spending to strengthen our capabilities to further long term growth.","For our group disability and other operations segment, first quarter revenues were $1.3 billion. First quarter earnings for this segment were $84 million with unfavorable disability claims partially offset by strong performance from our life business.","For our corporate segment, the first quarter 2019 loss was $490 million primarily driven by $449 million of interest costs. Overall, Cigna's quarter results reflect strong earnings, revenue and customer growth led by our Health Services and Integrated Medical businesses.","I will now discuss our outlook for 2019. As we've completed our first full quarter as a combined organization, we are proud of the focus and results we have delivered for our customers and clients. Looking ahead, we have considerable momentum as we continue to innovate to deliver affordability and predictability for our customers, and clients across our portfolio of businesses.","For full year 2019, we now expect consolidated adjusted revenues in the range of $132.5 to $134.5 billion. This represents an increase to our prior outlook of $1 billion reflecting growth in our customers in specialty pharmacy contributions.","We now expect full year consolidated adjusted income from operations to be $6.24 billion to $6.4 billion or $16.25 to $16.65 per share. This represents an increase of $0.15 to $0.25 per share over our prior expectations and represents growth in the range of 14% to 17% over 2018.","Regarding the cadence of earnings per share this year, we now expect 45% to 46% of our earnings in the first half of the year. This now includes the $50 million of favorable prior year reserve development recognized in the first quarter which is not contemplated in our original outlook.","For 2019, we continue to project an expense ratio in the range of 10% to 10.5% which reflects ongoing efficiencies and administrative expense synergies in line with our previous estimate of $112 million pre-tax. I would also note that our full year expense ratio expectation contemplates a higher ratio over the balance of 2019 than the first quarter result due to the timing of planned spending. For 2019, we continue to project a consolidated adjusted tax rate in the range of 23.5% to 24.5%.","I'll now discuss our 2019 outlook for the health services and integrated medical segments. For health services business, we continue to expect full year pre-tax earnings in the range of $5.05 billion to $5.2 billion. We continue to expect adjusted pharmacy scripts in the range of 1.17 billion to 1.19 billion scripts. I would note that this range includes all script volumes associated with Cigna's May order and specialty pharmacy operations. In addition to scripts associated with the acquired Express Scripts business.","Our 2019 guidance range is consistent with Express Scripts previous expectation of 2% to 3% growth in core adjusted pharmacy scripts. Our guidance does not include Cigna pharmacy script volumes we expect to transition from OptumRx. And consistent with all of our key performance metrics for the segment, this guidance range does not include pharmacy script volumes associated with transitioning clients.","We now expect full year Integrated Medical earnings in the range of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion. This outlook reflects strength and growth in our businesses driven by continued benefits from organic customer growth, deepening of customer relationships, and strong medical cost performance.","Fee assumptions reflected in our Integrated Medical earnings outlook for 2019 include the following; regarding global medical customers, we continue to expect 2019 growth in the range of 300,000 to 400,000 customers.","Turning to medical costs, for our U.S. commercial employer book of business, we continue to expect full year 2019 medical cost trend to be in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%. And we continue to expect the 2019 medical care ratio to be in the range of 80.5% to 81.5%.","We also expect strong growth and contributions from our international markets, group disability and other businesses as they continue to deliver more personalized and affordable solutions for the benefit of those we serve.","All in, for full year 2019, we now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $6.24 billion to $6.4 billion or $16.25 to $16.65 per share. This represents 14% to 17% growth over 2018.","I'd also remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of future share repurchases and any additional prior year reserved development. Overall, our updated outlook reflects the strong fundamentals of our four differentiated growth platforms accelerated by our combination with Express Scripts.","Our 2019 outlook, is also consistent with our multi-year growth expectations and reinforces our confidence and our ability to achieve our 2021 earnings per share target of $20 to $21 per share.","Now moving to our 2019 capital management position and outlook. Our subsidiaries remain well capitalized and we expect them to continue to drive exceptional free cash flow with strong returns and capital even as we continue reinvesting to support long-term growth and innovation.","As previously communicated, our top capital deployment priority is accelerating debt repayment with the objective of returning our debt to capitalization ratio to the upper 30s by the end of 2020.","Additionally, while we reduce leverage over the next two years, we expect to also have capacity for additional capital deployment. Our capital priorities are as follows; first, continuing to reinvest back into our businesses to drive further innovation and growth. Second, strategic M&A on a targeted basis. And third, returning capital to shareholders, primarily through share repurchase.","Consistent with these priorities in the first quarter, we deployed $1.9 billion to repay debt and we repurchased 2.5 million shares of stock for $462 million. Additionally in April of 2019, we repurchased approximately 600,000 for $94 million.","Our debt to capitalization ratio was 48.8% as of March 31, down from 50.9% as of December 31 of 2018. For 2019, we continue to project capital available for deployment of approximately $6.2 billion. In the year, we continue to expect to deploy approximately $4.2 billion to debt repayment and approximately $800 million to capital expenditures. Our balance sheet and free cash flow outlook remain strong benefiting from our highly efficient service based orientation drive strategic flexibility, strong margins and returns on capital.","Now to recap, our first quarter consolidated results reflect focused execution and strong delivery of results across our diversified portfolio of global businesses and give us momentum as we continue throughout the year. The fundamentals of our business are strong and sustainable and we are well-positioned to achieve the attractive financial targets we've established for 2019 to 2021. We are confident in our ability to achieve our full year 2019 earnings outlook and continue to have a good line of sight toward our $20 to $21 earnings per share target for 2021.","And with that we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. You may ask your question.","Kevin Fischbeck","I just want to get a little bit more color on the drivers behind the guidance range. Because it looks like on the Healthcare Integrated Medical business, you've raised guidance essentially by the favorable development in the quarter. In fact 0 to 50 versus -- 0 to 40 versus, a 50 million favorite development number. Wasn't sure if there's anything else kind of going on underneath that number. And then for the full year though the EPS numbers raised by a little bit more than the favorable development. So just try to understand that -- that's a share repo or are there any other kind of moving parts underneath that?","Eric Palmer","On the raise, I think you've got the headlines right there. Raising the Integrated Medical segment by essentially the amount of the prior year development that we have reported in the first quarter at the low end of our range. That translates through into the metrics for the enterprise.","Really no other pieces to call noticed earlier in the year but I feel good about our start to the year. In terms of the full year number then it just reflects the strength of the results as well as the updated share count.","Operator","Our next question comes from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.","A.J. Rice","I just want to ask about Express and how that's transitioning? I guess there are a number of moving parts, as we try to get used to the way you're reporting, you've got the Part D business you moved over, out of the Health Services division and I think last time you talked about 200 million of stranded costs that you were going to absorb over the costs over this year as the transition declines.","I think -- can you just makes some -- a little more comments about how that Express legacy business is performing relative to your expectations? How was the EBITDA relative to your internal expectations and then in the press release, you talk about the 96%, 98% retention rate heading into next year. That's obviously a high number. Can you comment on what you're seeing on the selling season and the chance to pick up any new accounts and maybe show growth and covered lives next year?","David Cordani","Let me start with just framing how the transition is going and a little color on the marketplace. And then ask Eric to talk a little bit about the specific metrics in the earnings results et cetera. First at the macro level, we're really pleased with the performance. It\u2019s in line with our expectations and it's quite strong.","Secondly, as I noted in my prepared comments. We're well into our integration plan and the focus execution within the integration plan. The teams are working well together. Most importantly putting the customer client patience service relationships front and center and ensuring that, there's not only no disruption there's continued elevation in terms of just strong performance there from that standpoint.","And then we're quite proud of some of the already targeted innovations we've been able to bring to the marketplace. As relates to kind of hopping over the current results, I'll hand back to Eric in a moment.","We're delighted with the be able to talk about another outstanding year of client retention, it's a combination of the commercial and health plan clients, obviously coming to bear with a 96% to 98% retention demonstrating the value proposition is resonating very well in terms of that strong service delivery outstanding clinical performance, medical cost, pharmacy cost performance from that standpoint and then within the background we're winning new business as well.","We'll look forward to providing a more comprehensive update on the outlook for 2020 and beyond and Investor Day but retention is strong, new business results are strong, so we're pleased with the traction there. I'll ask Eric to talk a little bit about the puts and takes within the segment redefinition in the performance, but again, it's in line with our expectations we're delighted with that. Eric?","Eric Palmer","The major headlines here, the resegmentation impacts we've had a couple of moving pieces when compared to prior Express Scripts dynamics. The headline overall is the result was consistent with our expectations.","As you noted, the Part D business is now part of the Integrated Medical segment, the legacy Cigna home delivery operations are part of the Health Services segment as some of the primary moving pieces versus prior period.","Additionally, there are minor items as we've just conformed different practices across the organizations and such but again the headlines would be the Health Services business performed right in line with our expectation. And I'd know it actually were particularly pleased with the strength in the Accredo and the specialty businesses overall.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question.","Justin Lake","Just first, wanted to follow up on the A.J\u2019s question on the PBM. Can you give us a little more color on the resegmentation on the PBM side. I mean, its clear you had a great quarter on the - look the year-over-year growth on the integrated medical side was very strong but when I look at the PBM and all I can do is match it up to what Express Scripts did last year but it actually looks like it was probably down year-over-year when I add into Cigna mail order.","So I am just wondering if you give us some more color to help us model this thing going forward in terms of what the moving parts are that might have transition back and forth between those two businesses or maybe stated another way, was there actually growth at Express Scripts you know the Health Services business year-over-year?","Eric Palmer","We just had to drill on that a little bit further than. We talked about in my prior answer to A.J\u2019s question. The couple biggest items that move this part of resegmentation but it also note there's normal differences in terms of just timing of different generic launches and things along those lines in any one quarter on.","Two, from an accounting policies of perspective and such as we've looked at the EVI initiatives that Express Scripts had previously announced. A number of the costs that previously would have been below the line at Express Scripts things were including and just the ongoing operating expenses, so there's a little bit of a difference in terms of the expense level that we\u2019re driving through in the segment metric versus prior Express Scripts items.","And there are other kind of minor items in terms of the timing of different expenses and things along those lines. So again, when you pull kind of all of those pieces out and look at the full year guidance, we continue to be on track for a nice growth for that business and again overall consistent with our expectations for the quarter as well.","Justin Lake","And then just a quick follow up on a membership line. Your membership was fairly flat year-over-year. I know you're still or I should say sequentially I know you are still expecting year-over-year growth. Can you give us a little color on where that growth is going to come from through the year and specifically on the stop loss side, it was the first quarter that you guys hadn't seen a double-digit stop loss premium growth in the -- my history of covering the company.","So I was curious just with everyone talking more about these product, these similar products in terms of stable premium whatever you want to call them. I'm curious if you're seeing the impact of competition there what you're seeing in the market. Thanks.","David Cordani","First from a growth standpoint at a macro level, we're really pleased with the growth trajectory we have stepping into 2019 and our ability to increase our revenue outlook by $1 billion here in the first quarter.","Stepping back specific to the book of business performance and the core of your question, we elevated the focus on retention as a critical priority in 2018 as we look to 2019, noting the pendency of our combination and we're pleased with the exceptional retention performance we had across the totality of our business, the integrated medical as well as health services as previously discussed.","Secondly, further intensified the focus relative to deepening the relationships and I noted in my prepared remarks significant success there in terms of 800,000 additional behavior relationships, 600,000 additional dental relationships in addition to that 1.7 million additional pharmacy relationships.","As we look to the remainder 2019, we expect to see strong retention continue, further deepening continue, as well as very importantly additional new medical integrated business, especially in the second half of the year as the underlying strong performance and power of the Select Segment in the middle market business perform throughout the course of the year. So taken as a whole, we're pleased with the start to the result, our intense focus on retention and deepening paid off and we see a good outlook relative to integrated growth.","As relates to stop loss, no change in traction or pass. I think we pivoted maybe to a high single-digit number 9% approaching 10% and we just see continued traction. And I would just highlight, it's the integrated nature and coordinated nature of our programs that are resonating. Not having a product or not having our product on the shelf that integrated nature is performing very well and we're excited about the outlook for 2019.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Your line is open. You may ask your question.","Scott Fidel","I'm just interested if you can update us on how final MA rates came in relative to your expectations and then how you're thinking at this point about the pacing of geographic expansion in MA and 2020 just also in the context of the half returning next year?","Eric Palmer","I'll start you on the rates we are estimate is that it'll be about 2.35% for us, which is a results consistent with how we've been thinking about it. We're in the course of finalizing our bids over the next few weeks here and we'll walk through that market-by-market basis as we typically do. Let David comment on the expansion path.","David Cordani","Specific to MA, macro we continue to see it as a very attractive growth marketplace. We're pleased to be back in the market growing in 2019 with our very focused local individual HMO portfolio and expect to see growth throughout the course of the year. To the core of your question as we look to 2020 and beyond, we expect to see accelerated growth begin to fuel that by market expansion to your point. We have a meaningful amount of demand for new market expansion with our collaborative partners and that work is well underway.","Secondly, continued in-market growth off of our very focused individual HMO portfolio of solutions and third, I'm expanding our portfolio of offerings to individual PPO offerings. So net-net, we're excited about the growth outlook for that portfolio of businesses with or without the half movement on the core fundamentals of our medical cost performance.","Our collaborative accountable care relationships having an access to 75% of our lives in four Star Plus programs. Having a corporate star rating of four and a half stars for new market entr\u00e9e and having the signal whitespace as relates to the individual PPO marketplace, we're excited about the growth outlook there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. You may ask your question.","David Styblo","It's David Stybloin for Windley, a couple of questions on the pharmacy side. First, appreciate the color on the retention of 96% to 98% for next year. I'm curious, how much of the book do you know at this point. In other words, can that number rise as we move throughout the years or up, is there upside to that figure. And second of all David, I'm wondering about within the 2020 selling season as you guys are going to market, how you might be describing market messaging in the market how that\u2019s evolved with the addition of Express Scripts?","David Cordani","The way I would think about 2020 as it relates to the Health Service business and the client portfolio, essentially think about the health plan portion that portfolios complete. And think about the commercial portion of that portfolios completing. So there could be some variability in the number`. We feel really good about the 96% and 98%, proud of the organization's performance in terms of delivery of our service promise. So I did break the book out through that portfolio.","A bit longer conversation than we could have on the phone call relative to the value proposition. But in a nutshell, first and foremost, think about the core aspect of our value proposition and market message as staying intact, which is a very consultative client-oriented approach to putting together the solution suite that best works for our clients, one at a time understanding their culture, their strategy, to help burden their population, their readiness to change and the opportunity for us to drive incentive based programs and collaborative each programs with them.","The add to it is further strengthened in a significant way relative to tremendous breath and flexibility of pharmacy solution and market defining solutions as relates to specialty pharmacy from that standpoint.","As it relates to the Health Services value proposition, the same core proposition exists, that expanded with a broader set of tools and programs that could be offered to commercial clients as well as health plan clients, who want to broaden services and the rate and pace of that is being ramped up as we go forward.","So core same, client focus, value creation engagement-oriented, enhancements on the capabilities as we come forward. But it is one client at a time which we deem to be a very significant strategic advantage as opposed to pushing product that we oriented around designing customized solutions on a modular basis for the benefit of our clients and customers and evolving those over time with them across the portfolio. You can expect to feel more of that at our Investor Day. As we bring it to life, not only in words but with some demonstrations of some of the capabilities behind our programs.","David Styblo","And real quick on the disability, can you spike at how much that drag was. I know it's not a huge part of the business but how much that that drag was, And do you really have visibility to that improving or some of that pressure going to persist for the rest of the year?","Eric Palmer","On the disability piece, we flagged back at the fourth quarter that there is some pressure on the disability line and favorability in the life insurance business. That continued in January, but actually has normalized in February and March. So, not want to mention here but think of it as small in the context of enterprise certainly. And in February and March we\u2019re back to what we call normal and targeted levels of performance.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. You may ask your question.","Josh Raskin","I wanted to get your thoughts on the Medicaid space and sort of as you guys have now created the integrated entity and maybe more specifically, your appetite for operating a bigger size in Medicaid and then maybe an inventory of what capabilities Cigna has today versus ones you think you would need to develop?","David Cordani","So first I'm stepping back. As you know, we've continued to prioritize segments outside of traditional Medicaid as our targeted growth segments in the marketplace. You'll also note that one of our inorganic priorities that we have highlighted in the past correlate around state based risk or performance based programs is we believe that we're going to see accelerated innovation at the state level to take portions of the population and look at a highly integrated clinical offerings that are risk based and performance based. We see that as attractive over time.","Two is as you reference, within our health service portfolio today, we serve Medicaid providers and we serve them well. In fact, recent meaningful wins in the Medicaid specialty space relative to servicing them from a pharmacy, specialty pharmacy and expanding over time of the Evercore platform of services.","And then lastly, in terms of using the best of the both, we see this as a growth opportunity again for the collective franchise over time. Some of the capabilities we have today the point two, to the last part of your question.","One, we're quite successful in terms of servicing the dual eligible population today and the core part of the proposition that drives out or our value base highly engaged physician programs that take the whole person orientation and the continuity of care from the physician's office to home healthcare coordination through social services and the like. And we could coordinate through the long term care dimension. We obviously enter that through the Medicare charity today.","Secondly he is through a credo as you think about the specialty pharmacy capability for prior conversations are at home fulfillment capability is quite powerful. And we essentially have a new credo clinician within an hour's drive of 85% of all Americans. So the ability to go into the home with expanded services beyond specialty of services is quite important from that standpoint.","So those are just illustrations of some of the capabilities we have today. Net-net on a targeted basis we see it as a growth opportunity in both platforms today and over time we see it as a potential additional growth platform as the marketplace evolves.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette of Barclays. You may ask your question.","Steven Valiquette","So for the PBM business just want to drill in a little bit deeper on that. Curious if you're able to discuss the trend of moderating generic deflation. How that may be affecting the Express Scripts profitability so far in 2019 particularly in the mail order business. But also maybe just compare and contrast that with how this may be impacting Cigna profitability overall? Thanks.","David Cordani","Steven it's David. Just big picture as we've discussed in the past. Looking at the call it the deflationary environment more broadly, relative to pharmacy Express Scripts as early to identify that. And continue to make sure they were evolving the products programs and services with those clients as well as manufacturers and recognition to that to Express Scripts as well as Cigna. We\u2019re early and deeply committed to a low total cost proposition balancing obviously appropriate clinical quality.","And so long as you're aligned with your partners, a decelerating environment is actually a net positive across the board although sometimes it may put a little pressure on the traditional measures of revenue for the corporation. So taken as a whole we see that having the broad portfolio of services, the broad portfolio of funding mechanisms and accelerated alignment with both our manufacturing partners as well as our clients via they health client or commercial clients. Is actually a strength to be able to moderate our approach relative to a decelerating or accelerating trend environment. As we focus on delivering a total low cost outcome, that obviously is fueled by tremendous clinical and service quality.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. You may ask your question.","Matt Borsch","Yes, I was hoping that you could, just touch on the integration of Express just in terms of what are the major milestones that you have left. As you work through this year and anything that goes in to next year realizing that, there's also opportunity harvesting on top of that?","David Cordani","In my prepared remarks I comment that on the five specific priorities that we have \u2013 we\u2019re clear for our organization as a whole. Within days after our successful closure of the combination and we remain focused on those. So that guide you back in terms of what we're seeking to accomplish. Most importantly sustained outstanding phenomenal service delivery to our clients and customers to ensure that there is no perception or reality of disruption getting in the way of delivering on our promise. And our MPS outlook and our retention outlook reinforced that.","Secondly throughout the course of this year and into next year we have milestones internally as we're continuing to step up leverage of the phenomenal Express assets for the benefit of the legacy Cigna clients. Early on specialty assets and that's taking place in line with our targets and expectations throughout the course of this year. And then further leverage of the Express core PBM capability for the benefit of our clients. Prior comments that transition takes place throughout 2019 and into 2020 and will be completed by the end of 2020. So a very planned full and targeted approach relative to that.","On a final note something is less talked about our clinical teams are deep at work with our Evercore Partners accelerating, innovation of products programs and services. Now that capability is in-house and there's just tremendous excitement not just for the benefit of our so called integrated portfolio, but for additional products programs and services for our health plan clients and service based commercial clients.","So the five priorities remain, we're well on track, leverage of the Express Script specialty and pharmacy capability is well underway, the broader of pharmacy will be completed by the end of 2020, specialty being accelerated right now and Evercore program development well underway.","Matt Borsch","Let me just ask one follow up. Is there within all of that, is there a system consolidation or some type of event that you had to pay particular attention to where there might be some operational risk. I mean I know that stuff is near and dear to you?","David Cordani","Matthew very important and appreciate it. So stepping back to put in context as you in the marketplace very well know we have a long history of owning operating and innovating are PBM. In terms of the history of Cigna with service partners and modularly successfully managing those service partner relationships over a long period of time while successfully growing our book of business and delivering outstanding results for the benefit of our clients and customers.","That same approach is being taken to this integration and coordination activity. Secondly, we're taking a very disciplined and paced and planned full approach to transitioning from some service partners like our great work with Optum today to Express Scripts over a very disciplined timeframe that will last between 2019 and 2020. I'm not a hurried approach. So no there is not one moment in time or one platform transition. It's very orderly and modular in fashion and we'll leverage our proven track record of managing that way for the last half a dozen years.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Stephen Tanal","I guess given the re-segmentation it's making a bit challenging to kind of compare the underlying results but helpful commentary around sort of seems like everything tracking in line with expectations. So I just kind of wanted to better understand a couple of high level points is the deal still expected to be double-digit accretive in year one. And how would you frame the cadence of that accretion clearly express as a different seasonal earnings pattern and your synergy is ramping.","So I'm just trying to make sure we understand that dynamic and maybe in the process get your thoughts on the cadence of the medical customer growth over the balance of the year. And the sense as well for why the upper bound of Integrated Medical segment pre-tax earnings guidance did not increase by sort of the full amount of the PPD in the quarter?","Eric Palmer","Steve it's Eric, I'll start and then have David add some additional commentary as well so just stepping back. So we talked about when we announced the transaction over a year ago, now our expectation that the combination would be teams accretive in the first full year of operation just to give the color there. Now a lot's happened over the course of the last year plus. We ended up finishing with quite a bit stronger results in 2018 than we anticipated at the time. One, that raise the jump off point.","Two, as we've noted in terms of our initial guidance issuance for the year and such in particular, we had some strong performance in our individual book of business that we didn't believe to be sustainable. We're still performing in line with our targets and expectations, but a step down from 2018 into 2019 and so that's a factor as well. When you adjust for those things, Steve broadly the expectations in terms of income being generated from the various components of Express Scripts that most of which are health services business and the pieces in Integrated Medical and such are in line with where we were expected them to be for the year.","And so again the acquisition case from that perspective are pulled so again those are the pieces. And then on the last part of your question on the prior year development, really we brought up the bottom end of our range by the amount of the prior year development. Again just note it's early in the year and that's why we have a range in terms of the variability of outcome over the balance of the year.","David Cordani","And Steve first and foremost kudos to you to fit, five or six questions into one quite efficient from that standpoint just to recap a couple of pieces. Big picture I think to the core of your question. Our results demonstrate that we're on track to deliver our commitment to $20 to $21 of EPS in 2021. Second, the raise in the first quarter this year early in the year, but the raise has our EPS growth in the mid teens plus for 2019 off as Eric reference and outstanding 2018. And lastly just reinforcing all along the way with tremendous free cash flow production which underlies the kind of quality of the results that we're able to post so we feel great about the results here.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citigroup. You may ask your question.","Ralph Giacobbe","Just wanted to go to the enrolment figures looks like ASO was flat to slightly down. And I know there's the employer segments that we needed that consider there 49.38 but the risk of this was also up. So anything to kind of call out that's either happening in the market and or so your positioning and then just you mentioned the national account losses maybe any details there. And the opportunity with the larger employer base now with Express. And when you think maybe you could see that perhaps start to show better growth? Thanks.","David Cordani","A couple points, first again to set the stage relative to growth. And as indicated previously really pleased with the growth trajectory we're stepping into 2019 with the revenue health the ability to increase our revenue outlook by $1 billion this early in the year we're quite pleased with that. Secondly, we had an intensified focus in 2018 with our eye toward 2019 on retention acknowledging dependency of the transaction and the potential perceived disruption as well as further deepening results. So we look at growth more holistically than a singular measure of medical customer growth although I'll come to that which is a quite important measure.","And as noted we grew our specialty license further deepened relationships quite attractively. As it relates to the Integrated Medical customer growth we feel good about our outlook for the full year. As I noted we will expect to see continued strong performance in trajectory of the select in the middle market portfolio throughout the residual part of the year specifically, the second half of the year. July tends to be an important July 1 is an important month for that portfolio September 1 is an important month for that portfolio and that portfolio will perform well.","We had a little lighter retention rate in national accounts for 1\/1\/2019. Last year we had a bit stronger this year we had a little lighter. There's your way of sowing and so within the context of that. But again we further deepened relationships with the specialty portfolio. On a final note as a combined corporation, we'll be looking again more holistically at those larger account relationships deciding whether or not we're best positioned to have an expanded services relationship with those clients and or an integrated relationship or a combination of both.","So you'll see again the revenue growth be contributed through both segments not just one segment on a go forward basis again taken as a whole we feel really good about the result for 2019.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ana Gupte with SVB Leerink. Your line is open you may ask your question.","Ana Gupte","Just following up on Ralph question again exit 9% [indiscernible] is slightly down and needs to be [indiscernible] single. When you look at this again and this is obviously early days for you on Express against your stated goal and can stop because of the overlapping 30% of that is it because there is a convergence of new competitors like perhaps and some or evenly man house in those segments or is it because we don't have exits here that\u2019s the whole broader transition from fully insured self-insured difference [indiscernible]?","David Cordani","Ana it's David it was a bit hard to hear you with the background noise but I think I got the core of your question. The simple answer to the last part of your question is, no. We do not see a change in performance relative to the competitive landscape. It has been, is and will continue to be a competitive environment. We need to deliver outstanding value and we need to continue to innovate. Specifically, as I noted in my prepared remarks Select segment had an outstanding performance in the first quarter of this year and we'll have another strong year this year.","I remind you that that strike zone is expanded from 50 to 250 to 50 to 500 and we\u2019re successfully selling both our core ASO Stop Loss offering as well as guarantee costs as we offer choice in the marketplace and our full integrated as opposed to a bundled offering but a full integrated offering continues to resonate very well in that portfolio for us as we go forward. Specifically to the larger account portfolio, national either signals definition of that 5000 or more employees commercial and multi-state. It's a smaller strike zone than many of our competitors defined.","And we see that as a marketplace that is essentially in an organic basis for the marketplace as a whole not a growth marketplace but one where we selectively seek to differentiate ourselves and deepen our relationships. And then just lastly the services portfolio will enable us to deepen those relationships as we go forward and we see early traction on that right now that we're pleased with. So net-net we're pleased with the result and we're happy with the position we have for 2019 especially the second half integrated offerings that we have in the marketplace.","Operator","Our next question comes from Zach Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Zach Sopcak","I want to ask about the diabetes patient Assurance Program. It looks like the savings that the patients are seeing is being funded by the insulin manufacturers. 22,000 models that was translatable to either other disease states or other pharmaceutical categories like a benefit use going forward. And then I know it's early but any early feedback from clients on response the program or uptake which I would expect would be pretty close to a 100%. Thank you.","David Cordani","So, as we noted that's an example of the power of the combination and can accelerate innovations that puts the customer front and center or patient and then looks at their specific needs on affordability and predictability.","We're able to essentially and we don\u2019t go through all the details. It's about time as well as a competitive differentiator. We're able to rapidly reengineer relationships and alignment very importantly with a pharmaceutical manufacturer partners to again put that customer patient front and center and provide that level of predictability. And we just couldn't be more pleased with that client feedback early on is extremely positive and we would expect adoption of that to ramp pretty meaningfully over time.","To the core of your question as well which I appreciate. There is a platform within there for other disease or health burden states that our team is aggressively focused on right now. So exciting opportunities to give more peace of mind, predictability and customer a patient derived view of affordability to the marketplace and we stepped into diabetes and insulin specifically because of the size of the population and the needs set to be able to address this. But that platform could be leveraged further.","Operator","Your next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is up. You may ask your question.","Peter Costa","Related to A.J. and Justin ask, when we see strong retention and new member growth combined with what you know look like margin pressure in the health services area. We worry a little bit about pricing and that combined with the proposed rebate rule in Medicare and maybe potential legislation you know on commercial drug rebates, we worry that could mean spread based pricing - spread based pricing is giving way to transparent pricing in the pharmacy benefit area and that may have narrower margins. So my question is where would you see Health Services margins, if we were to move to fully transparent pricing. And is that where you think we're going here?","David Cordani","Let me put this in a couple of blocks. First and foremost, our passionate view is that client retention when you deal with the affordability and the transparency that exists in all of our products and programs today is a direct correlation of the clients view of the value we are delivering to them day-in, day-out. Regrown back to the Health Services portfolio, the commercial pharmacy trend for 2018 was 0.4%, a phenomenal result, not perfection of phenomenal results with strong service delivery and additional proven innovations as we go forward. That's what enables us to deliver that retention.","Two, to your margin question, the margin levels are in line with our expectations. This puts and takes they're aligned with our expectations, they're strong, they're shareholder friendly and we need to get the right balance in terms of alignment with our clients, our customers, our patients as well as from a shareholder return but they're aligned with our expectations.","There will be puts and takes and levers on a go forward basis and we see more transparency as an opportunity to drive more of alignment. We see alignment as a strategic advantage. It's something we embrace, because alignment allows us to accelerate innovation and that allows us to drive lower total costs and higher total quality and a go forward basis.","And we've been able to prove as an organization that delivering that type of value allows you to get a fair sustainable margin and that's what we're on track for. So whether it be spread pricing, a change in posture on rebates or otherwise, those are movements in sub components of the portfolio. The total cost, total value proposition is to work and we've proven the ability to innovate to make sure we're able to get a fair sustainable shareholder return through margin and we're excited about that because we have the ability to lead in that changing marketplace as opposed to resist it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lance Wilkes with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open. You may ask your question.","Lance Wilkes","I had a question on the PBM.As you're looking at the new business coming in at 2019 and outlook for 2020 is that new business coming in sort of average margin or does it slope so maybe you're wanted at a lower margin than average and then kind of gets up to a target margin over the life of a contract. And I guess related to that, how are you guys looking at moving to a kind of full risk models or things that will move your guaranteeing total PBM pharmacy costs. Is that something where you're piloting it or is that something that really doesn't have client interests at this point?","David Cordani","I appreciate the questions. As you might expect we're not going to tell you what the slope of our pricing curve or approach in the marketplace is, big picture though stepping back, we're pleased with the performance, pleased with the financial results, pleased with the positioning of their client-by-client decisions that are made because everything we do in our company is oriented around one client at a time, strategic alignment and sustained innovation going forward and the coexistence of the new business growth with the outstanding retention and the deepening of the relationships reinforces that. So we're pleased with the positioning and the discipline you would expect us to have from a new business standpoint continues in the organization.","As it relates to your second point, there is appetite no doubt for dimensions of or examples of deepening alignment guarantees or otherwise and we have the capabilities within the portfolio to be able to do that. Again that's one client at a time.","And it all comes back to alignments with your partner, making sure we put the programs in place financing or otherwise and then we perform and we have a track record and knock on wood of the performance and the alignment, but there's not a one size fits all guarantee program that we're putting in the marketplace, it's a client-by-client side of relationships and again we see that as an advantage for us both in the integrated portfolio as well as in the services portfolio as we go forward. Again something we embrace and we're driving for the change in.","Operator","Our last question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. You may ask your question.","Charles Rhyee","I just wanted to -- one clarification first and then probably the question on sort of how we think about the cadence here in health services. You know earlier -- I think the question was asked about how do we compare this results to a year ago when you look at the former Express Scripts, is the best way to look at it right now is because I believe last year included Anthem, so the best way to look at it is your existing results before taking out the transitioning clients for compatibility perspective.","You know that's for some clarification but then I guess my question though is you talked about $200 million services traded costs. Can you give us a sense on that kind of front end loaded into a year in terms of the impact on our results and should we have that taper off as we go through the rest of the year. And then lastly related to that you know, is there anything else in terms of the cadence in terms of Express we should be thinking about as we model it out. Thank you.","Eric Palmer","So a couple of different dimensions to that question there. But the first and foremost year-over-year, I'd encourage you on a particular quarter there. There are a number of different moving pieces, so there wouldn't want you to just one adjustment and then you'd have comparability as I mentioned in my prior answer several different dimensions between resegmentation which is normal, timing quarter-to-quarter types of items in that of the conformance of various policies and that just make quarter-over-quarter difficult. The punch line though on the full year in line with our expectations performing well and we'll expect to deliver growth and touch there.","The second part of your question in terms of the $200 million stranded costs that we identified, that's a function of a couple of things. We haven't provided a specific quarter-by-quarter guidance. But think of as the - as the transition in clients as Anthem works through their migration, and the volumes come out. That will increase things but we'll be working to rightsize our expense base so again those will be working to offset each other over the balance of the year.","And then last but not least in terms of just the other items in terms of the sequencing of earnings over the year the note in my prepared remarks continue to expect 45% to 46% of the enterprise's income in the first half of the year. Think about across the segments Integrated Medical tends to be more front end loaded so higher income in the beginning part of the year and that tapers down over the year as customers reach their deductibles and things along those lines. Health services business tends to have the other dynamic where the income builds throughout the course of the year and I think you'll see that in the Express Scripts historic result.","On top of that this year we've got the additional effect of the synergies will build throughout the course of the year and will have the effect of as we work with the deleveraging interest costs will decline throughout the year. So that probably even further puts the income towards the back half of the year than \u201ca normal year\u201d all to be an equal.","Operator","At this time I\u2019ll turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks.","David Cordani","Thank you. Just wrap up our call. I'd like to highlight some key points from today's discussion. Cigna delivered strong financial results in our first quarter as a combined company with Express Scripts, driven by growth, innovation and focus execution across our businesses relative to our Express Scripts integration activities, we're making very good progress and executing well against each of our five integration priorities. Collectively our first quarter results demonstrate Cigna\u2019s strong performance and momentum and gives us confidence we will achieve our increased outlook for revenue, earnings and EPS in 2019.","We remain on track to achieve our 2021 EPA target of $20, $21 per share and we look forward to going into this deeper with you as well as our long term growth strategy at our Investor Day later this month.

Please go ahead, Mr. McDowell.","William McDowell - Cigna Corp.","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I am Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric Palmer, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer.","In our remarks today, David and Eric will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's first quarter 2018 financial results as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2018.","As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. Specifically, we use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, shareholders' net income, is contained in today's earnings release which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com.","In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements including statements regarding our outlook for 2018 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.","Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, I note that in the first quarter, we recorded an after-tax special item charge of $50 million or $0.21 per share for transaction-related costs. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations in our discussion of financial results.","Also, as previously disclosed, effective January 1, 2018, Cigna adopted the new accounting standard titled Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASU 2014-09, which addresses recognition of revenues under GAAP. Cigna has adopted this accounting change on a retrospective basis for the first quarter of 2018 and has recast prior periods.","Additionally, as we discussed at our Investor Day in 2017, we see significant opportunity for growth in the lower end of our Middle-Market segment, employers with 250 to 500 lives, as employers of this size share many of the characteristics and needs of our Select segment clients. As a result, beginning with the first quarter of 2018 for Global Health Care, Cigna is classifying employer clients with 250 to 500 lives in the Select segment, where they were previously classified in the Middle-market segment. Prior-year lives have also been reclassified to reflect this definition.","Also, consistent with past practices, when we make any perspective comments on earnings or EPS outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future capital deployment or prior development of medical costs.","Finally, our outlook for 2018 does not reflect the impact of Cigna's combination with Express Scripts, which we continue to expect to close by the end of 2018.","And with that, I will turn the call over to David.","David M. Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Thanks, Will. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I'll begin by highlighting Cigna's very strong quarterly financial results, which continue our consistent track record of growth and value creation across our portfolio of businesses. I'll then discuss how a combination with Express Scripts advances our proven growth strategy by accelerating our ability to provide greater affordability along with expanded choice and broader distribution reach, all with greater predictability. Eric will then address our first quarter results in more detail as well as our outlook for meaningful growth in customers, revenue and earnings in 2018. We'll then move to the Q&A portion of the call, and following Q&A, I'll conclude the call with a few closing comments.","I'll start with some highlights of our results. For the first quarter of 2018, consolidated revenue increased 9% to $11.4 billion. First quarter earnings increased to $1 billion with earnings per share of $4.11.","Turning to our business segments, Global Health Care revenue increased by 10% with very strong earnings growth. This outstanding result was led by our Commercial Employer business, which once again delivered differentiated organic growth in both risk and ASO medical customers, particularly in our Select and Middle-market segments. Our Commercial Employer business also delivered attractive margins and sustained industry-leading medical cost trend.","And in our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we grew revenue by more than 20% over the first quarter of 2017, with earnings increasing to $112 million.","Collectively, our first quarter results reflect strong momentum across our portfolio of businesses and give us confidence we will achieve our improved outlook for 2018, earnings and EPS.","Our first quarter performance also highlights the significant value we create through our integrated offerings. Cigna's continued and long track record of value creation is especially evident in the Commercial Employer space, where our focus on deep integration of medical, pharmacy, behavioral health and other specialty solutions enables us to more comprehensively support the health needs of our customers and as a result, deliver differentiated value.","Integrating these solutions, coupled with aligning incentives and leveraging our leading engagement and transparency tools, has been at the foundation of Cigna's ability to deliver better clinical outcomes, industry-leading affordability through our differentiated medical cost trend, continued organic customer growth in each of the past eight years, and strong margins and free cash flows.","As we look ahead, health care costs continue to grow at an unsustainable rate with poor or eroding individual health status contributing to this unsustainability. This is caused by consumer behaviors and lifestyles, an aging population and a rising chronic disease burden, all in an environment that has historically been volume-based sick care intervention system with misaligned incentives.","Today, pharmacy is the most widely used health care benefit. At the same time, pharmacy also presents a leading opportunity to close gaps in care and follow evidence-based care. All too often, individuals fail to adhere to their treatment plans or are given treatment plans from multiple physicians without coordination. Over time, the combination of increasing utilization and high manufacturer prices for prescription drugs has resulted in pharmacy trend growing at multiples that are three times or more CPI rate, which is simply not sustainable.","Specialty pharmacy, in particular, is the fastest growing medical cost category. Over the next decade, specialty drug costs are expected to more than triple from approximately $300 billion today to more than $1 trillion. As a result, rising specialty pharmaceutical costs are a top concern for employer clients and, with the right capabilities in place, represent a tremendous opportunity for value creation.","Against this backdrop, it has become more critical than ever to holistically manage and coordinate medical, pharmacy, and behavioral care in order to reduce cost to a sustainable level, preserve health or improve health status and improve outcomes.","These critical needs are at the center of our proactive decision to combine with Express Scripts. Our combination will accelerate our growth strategy by creating deeper alignment across critical elements of the health care system including health plans, service providers, physicians, hospitals, pharmacists and pharmaceutical manufacturers, all to drive improvements in affordability and clinical quality.","Together with Express Scripts, Cigna will be even better equipped to continue delivering differentiated value for our customers and clients, our health care partners and our communities. We will deliver solutions through a strengthened and expanded portfolio of integrated medical offerings and a new health services operating unit.","This new operating unit will offer an array of solutions including pharmacy services, specialty pharmacy care, behavioral health services and population health and decision support, all with the appropriate data management and security firewalls in place between the services and medical platforms to ensure the protection of competitively sensitive data.","By bringing together our complementary capabilities, our combined company will operate from an improved medical and pharmacy cost position that will directly benefit our customers and clients. And it will leverage an open-architected or choice-based model that expands offerings for the people we serve while strengthening and expanding our partnerships with health care providers. Our combination will also strengthen our ability to contribute to better cost predictability, which we recognize is a priority for employers, individuals, health plans and government agencies.","Leveraging Cigna's capabilities and long track record of innovation, we have the ability to offer customers and clients a broad portfolio, ranging from full guarantees to shared risk models and service-based offerings, all built to address the financial predictability, service and clinical outcomes our customers and clients are seeking.","With Express Scripts, we'll be better equipped to understand, support and inform physicians based on the breadth of data the combined company will be able to generate from the billions of customer touch points we'll have.","While we have existing tools in place today, this wider and deeper data set will meaningfully accelerate our progress and provide us with more actionable insights into both customer and physician behavior. And as a result, we'll be even better positioned to provide best-in-class cost performance, clinical quality, customer and physician service, and predictability.","As we look toward this next phase, it's also important to highlight the fact that each company brings a highly complementary clinical capability to support this goal. More specifically, Cigna employs more than 4,000 clinicians. Express Scripts employs more than 3,000 clinicians and each organization has a proven ability to partner with clinical professionals and pharmaceutical manufacturers to deliver strong and differentiated results.","Together, our collective experience, expertise, and capabilities will result in a broader portfolio of aligned and integrated offerings, offerings that deliver differentiated affordability along with predictability for customers, clients, and providers, and deeper outcome-based relationships with health care professionals and pharmaceutical manufacturers.","A direct result of creating differentiated value in the marketplace is creating differentiated shareholder value. The combined Cigna and Express Scripts will be well-positioned to deliver attractive growth and strong financial results, coupled with exceptional strategic financial flexibility. The combination will drive growth for expanded and strengthened integrated medical offerings in our Go Deeper geographies and our new health services offerings will meaningfully expand the distribution reach of our services across the United States.","Additionally, both companies operate highly capital-efficient businesses, which facilitate the company's ability to continue driving strong margins and ongoing free cash flows. This, in turn, will position us to continue making investments in the business to further drive expansion and innovation. It also provides us with ongoing strategic flexibility with respect to additional M&A opportunities as well as for share repurchase activity. We see this optionality and financial flexibility as a significant strategic advantage in this highly dynamic and changing environment.","Now, to summarize a few key points before I turn the call over to Eric. Cigna began 2018 with very strong momentum across our portfolio, with each of our businesses well-positioned for growth over the balance of the year, providing us with confidence we will achieve our increased outlook for EPS growth this year in a range of 23% to 27%.","Looking ahead, we are excited about our combination with Express Scripts, which we expect to close by the end of this year. This acquisition positions us to continue building on and accelerating our results by driving deeper alignment across critical elements of the health care system, all to further improve affordability, expand our addressable markets, and deliver outstanding financial results with strong financial flexibility.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Eric.","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today I will briefly review key aspects of Cigna's first quarter 2018 results and discuss our updated outlook for the full year. I will also discuss our capital position and outlook for 2018 as well as following the close of our acquisition of Express Scripts.","Key financial highlights in the quarter are consolidated revenue growth of 9% to $11.4 billion, consolidated earnings of $1 billion led by exceptional growth and strong margins in our Global Health Care and Global Supplemental Benefits segments, quarterly earnings per share of $4.11, and continued strong free cash flow and financial flexibility. Overall, our results demonstrate continued strong performance across the enterprise.","Regarding our business segments, I will first comment on Global Health Care. First quarter operating revenues in Global Health Care grew 10% to $9.1 billion, driven by commercial customer growth, premium increases consistent with underlying cost trends and inclusive of the return of the health insurance tax, and specialty contributions.","We ended first quarter 2018 with 16.2 million global medical customers, an organic increase of 327,000 lives year-to-date, driven by growth in our Select, Individual and Middle Market segments. We grew customers in both risk and ASO funding arrangements as our industry-leading trend results continue to resonate with the market.","First quarter earnings in Global Health Care were $871 million, reflecting growth in medical customers and specialty relationships, continued effective medical cost management and a lower tax rate compared to 2017.","Turning to our medical care ratios, our first quarter 2018 total Commercial medical care ratio, or MCR, of 73.7% reflects ongoing strong performance of our Commercial business, particularly from our integrated medical platform, the pricing effect of the resumption of the health insurance tax and favorable prior-year reserve development.","Our first quarter 2018 total Government MCR of 84.5% reflects strong performance in Medicare Advantage through our advanced physician engagement model and normal Part D seasonality.","First quarter 2018 Global Health Care earnings included favorable prior-year reserve development of $43 million after-tax compared to $61 million after-tax in first quarter 2017.","Moving to operating expenses, for first quarter 2018, our total Global Health Care operating expense ratio was 22.7%, which reflects ongoing investments in growth and innovation, continued effective expense management and the impact of the return of the industry tax, which added 110 basis points to the expense ratio in the quarter. Overall, we've had a very strong start to 2018 in our Global Health Care business.","Turning to our Global Supplemental Benefits business, operating revenues grew 21% to $1.1 billion, or 15% on a currency-adjusted basis. First quarter 2018 earnings grew to $112 million, reflecting business growth and strong operating expense management. This business has once again delivered outstanding top and bottom line growth as we continue to deliver affordable and personalized solutions that meet the needs of our customers.","For Group Disability and Life, first quarter operating revenues were just over $1.1 billion. First quarter earnings in our Group business were $67 million, reflecting solid disability performance and modestly elevated life insurance claims.","Overall, Cigna's fourth quarter results reflect strong customer, revenue and earnings growth, led by our Global Health Care and Global Supplemental Benefits segments.","Now I will discuss our outlook for 2018. In 2018, we expect to continue to deliver strong financial performance for our shareholders by continuing to provide industry-leading medical cost trend management, leveraging our differentiated capabilities to deliver more affordable and personalized solutions, and continuing to invest in capabilities to better serve our customers and clients.","For full year 2018, we continue to expect consolidated revenues to grow in the range of 7% to 8% over 2017. Our outlook for full year 2018 consolidated adjusted income from operations is now in the range of approximately $3.17 billion to $3.27 billion, or $12.85 to $13.25 per share.","This represents an increase of $0.35 to $0.45 per share over our previous expectations and represents earnings per share growth of 23% to 27% over 2017.","I will now discuss the components of our 2018 outlook starting with Global Health Care. We now expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of $2.67 billion to $2.73 billion, an increase of $50 million to $70 million over previous expectations, reflecting continued strength in both our Commercial and Government businesses.","Key assumptions reflected in our Global Health Care earnings outlook for 2018 include the following. Regarding global medical customers, we now expect growth in the range of 400,000 to 500,000 lives over year-end 2017, an increase over previous expectations, reflecting the strong growth we have seen across our Commercial market segments to date.","Turning to medical costs, for our total U.S. Commercial book of business, we continue to expect full year medical cost trend to be in the range of 4% to 5%. Through our integrated medical platform, we continue to align incentives for our customers, clients and physician partners driving positive health outcomes and better management of total medical costs.","Now turning to our medical care ratio outlook. For our total Commercial book of business, we continue to expect the 2018 MCR to be in the range of 77.5% to 78.5%. For our total Government book of business, we now expect the 2018 MCR to be in the range of 83.5% to 84.5%, reflecting a decrease of 50 basis points over previous expectations and driven by strong performance in Medicare Advantage.","Regarding operating expenses, we continue to expect our 2018 Global Health Care operating expense ratio to be in the range of 22.5% to 23.5%.","Now turning to our other segments. For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we continue to expect strong top line growth and now expect earnings in the range of $390 million to $410 million, an increase of $10 million over previous expectations, reflecting continued strong results in this business.","Regarding the Group Disability and Life business, we continue to expect full year earnings in the range of $330 million to $350 million. Regarding our remaining operations, that is other operations and corporate, we now expect a loss of $220 million for 2018, which is an improvement over previous expectations.","So all in, for full year 2018, we now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $3.17 billion to $3.27 billion, or $12.85 to $13.25 per share. This represents an increase of $0.35 to $0.45 per share over our previous expectations. I would also remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of additional prior-year reserve development or any future capital deployment.","I will now discuss our 2018 capital position and outlook. Our subsidiaries remain well-capitalized and are generating significant free cash flow to the parent, with a strong return on capital in each of our business segments.","Regarding free cash flow, we ended the first quarter of 2018 with parent company cash of $1 billion. After considering all sources and uses of parent company cash, we continue to expect capital available for deployment to be $2.8 billion in 2018. Thus far, in 2018 we have deployed $130 million of parent company cash to repay current maturities of long-term debt and we have repurchased 1.3 million shares of stock for approximately $275 million. As previously discussed, we do not expect to conduct additional share repurchases prior to the closing of the Express Scripts transaction.","Looking ahead to our combination with Express Scripts, as David indicated earlier, the status quo and health care spending is not sustainable, and our combination with Express Scripts will position us to accelerate our strategy by driving deeper alignment across the health care system. As a combined company, we will drive greater affordability through an improved medical and pharmacy cost position, deliver better health outcomes and more predictability for our customers and clients, and have an expanded reach through our existing integrated health business and newly created services operating unit.","Driven by the value creation from these capabilities, we expect to deliver attractive margins through a highly capital efficient operating model. The combination will be immediately accretive, delivering mid-teens accretion in the first full year, post-close, excluding any contribution from Express Scripts transitioning clients and excluding revenue synergies.","As a result, we also raised our 2021 earnings per share target to a range of $20 to $21, an increase of $2 to $3 per share from our prior guidance. The combined organization will generate strong free cash flow which will enable our debt to capitalization ratio to return to the 30s within 18 to 24 months following closing.","Importantly, while we will prioritize debt repayment in the two-year period following the close, the strength of our capital efficient businesses will also allow for additional capital deployment in both 2019 and 2020.","For additional capital deployment during this time period, our strategy and priorities remain, providing the capital necessary to support the growth of our ongoing operations, pursuing targeted M&A activity, as well as returning capital to shareholders through share repurchase.","Looking forward, we project the combined company will generate free cash flow of at least $6 billion in 2021. As David noted, this strong free cash flow and capital deployment optionality positions Cigna to be nimble to continue to innovate in the dynamic environment in which we operate.","Now to recap, our first quarter 2018 results reflect strength in our diversified portfolio of global businesses and a continuation of our track record of effective execution of our focused strategy. Overall, we are pleased with our strong start to the year driven by the fundamentals of our business and are confident in our ability to achieve our increased full-year 2018 earnings outlook.","From this position of strength, we are excited about our combination with Express Scripts, which positions us to accelerate our growth strategy and which will generate strong free cash flow to deliver significant financial flexibility for ongoing investments and capital deployments to drive further innovation.","And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. You may ask your question.","Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yes, I was just hoping you could talk about the growth in commercial risk that you've seen this quarter. And we're framing it in the context of attrition that we've seen at several of your large peers, so it's a little bit surprising, and if like you could just address how you would achieve that in this environment.","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Yeah, Matt. It's Eric. I'll start. With respect to the growth that we delivered in the quarter, as David noted in his prepared remarks, again, this is our eighth year of consistent growth in terms of organic commercial enrollment. We approach the market with growth in both self-funded and commercial risk products and really work to ensure that we've got the best funding arrangements for the needs of our clients and customers.","Overall, I would point to the increasing recognition of the trend in the cost performance that we've been able to generate for our clients across all the funding arrangements as the primary driver of our success in the growth cycle coming into this year. And we've had good growth in both self-funded and risk products to show for it.","Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","If you can comment, are you expecting growth will continue over the balance of the year?","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Our growth continues to come primarily from the Select and Middle-market segments. And those segments do tend to be spread more throughout the year, so we're optimistic about the trajectory for additional growth across all of our funding arrangements in those segments over the balance of the year.","Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And maybe I can just ask one last question which is just an early view on your setup for the Medicare Advantage products going into the 2019 open enrollment. Not looking for guidance, but just to understand, do you see this upcoming season as being a normal one after you've had a period of recovery?","David M. Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Hey, Matthew. Good morning. It's David.","Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, David.","David M. Cordani - Cigna Corp.","So first and foremost, we're excited to be back in the growth mode in our Seniors business. For 2018, we expected to turn the business back from a growth orientation and we expect to build some of that growth momentum throughout the rest of this year. We started with very strong retention results and starting to add some new sales.","Specific to 2019, the team is excited. We're well-positioned for 2019. We're also oriented around further geographic expansion in 2019, 2020, and 2021 as we look forward. So the team's on their toes right now and we're excited to restart that growth engine with some increasing momentum.","Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Fantastic. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Borsch. Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. This question's for David. I think you and Eric both have spent a lot of time since the Express deal was announced meeting with shareholders, talking to them. I guess I'd invite you to share what do you think is the biggest concern and pushback shareholders have about the transaction, and what is the response that you've been sharing to that concern?","David M. Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Gary, good morning. You're correct. We continue an open dialogue consistent with our culture. I think first off, big picture, stepping back, shareholders recognize the fact that Cigna has had and continues to have, as evidenced by this quarter, a consistent strong track record of success, momentum, growth, and earnings growth, so understanding the strategic accelerant that is either perceived to be necessary or being pursued.","Second piece of the conversation is just a rapidly evolving environment and better understanding how the additional capabilities position us not just for today's business but the evolution of tomorrow's business. And in those conversations understanding that further improvement of medical cost or affordability is mission critical.","We've put forth the strategic objective of further stepping down medical cost trend from our industry-leading levels as a strategic objective for the future at a CPI level, because we think that's what the market demands and that's what is possible with a well-run organization. And then helping the market understand the fact that we're going to deliver outstanding financial results even without the revenue synergies we've talked about. So putting that whole picture together, I think the appreciation for the strategic value, the financial value and the forward-looking strategic flexibility and optionality is being better understood today.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Taylor. Our next question comes from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.","A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks. Hi, everybody. Just conceptually, you beat, I think, the consensus by almost $0.70-plus, and you raised the guidance for the full year by $0.35 to $0.45. I know there's a number of reasons why that might happen. Maybe internally, your forecast was higher than what the Street had, maybe just being conservative earlier in the year, maybe there was a pull-forward or something else. I guess first question would just be to get your perspective on that dichotomy, the really strong beat and a strong raise but not quite as much as you beat by.","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","A.J., it's Eric. I would just note we're really pleased with the strong start that we've had to the year. I wouldn't call out anything in particular in terms of dynamic there, other than just it's early in the year. We're pleased with the momentum that we've got and excited about the opportunity to be raising our guidance over the balance of the year at this point, but nothing else I'd call out in particular.","A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And then, obviously, one of the areas of outperformance was on the MLR\/MCR. One of the things we've been hearing from people \u2013 both hospitals and from at least one of your peers \u2013 was potentially an increase in acuity on the inpatient side. Again, there's several reasons for that. One is the industry may be very effective in pushing the low intensity stuff into the outpatient side, or there may be an increase in these higher acuity patients.","I wonder if you could indicate maybe where in particular you saw positive trends on the medical loss ratio? And specifically on that acuity question, are you seeing anything unusual there?","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","A.J., I wouldn't call it anything unusual in terms of acuity or anything along those lines. Our medical cost trends are performing consistent with our expectations and the guidance that we set back when we provided 2018 guidance in February. We continue to be in the range of 4% to 5% which we think is a great result for the year.","A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Rice. Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. You may ask your question.","Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Want to stay on the Commercial segment and sort of a two-parter here. Commercial MLR was a lot lower than we were looking for and I know there's some seasonality around some of the products, et cetera, but I'm just curious how sustainable you think that quarterly result is.","And then I kind of want to juxtapose that with this mid-market sort of stop-loss product. We heard from Humana yesterday for the first time on one of their calls speaking specifically around that product. So are you seeing more competition? Do you think margins are sustainable there? Is that just a growing market that feeds everybody or do you think you're starting to see new entry there?","David M. Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Josh, good morning. It's David. Let me start talking about the market and the, I'll call it, the acceptance and the trends relative to the product, and then ask Eric to expand a little bit relative to just our outstanding result for the quarter and how it unfolds.","First, more broadly, as you know, 85% of all of our Commercial lives are ASO and we like the transparent funding mechanism to drive alignment. So it comes all the way back to the philosophy of driving alignment with the employer, greater transparency and the dynamism that happens throughout the course of the year to be able to work with the employer to try to optimize results for their employees, our customers.","Stop-loss is an important part of that portfolio as you come downmarket to provide peace of mind and predictability relative to the cost outcomes and we've been doing this for a long, long time. Secondly, as we've discussed before, we've talked about the fact that the evolution of the transparent funding mechanisms continued to be broader accepted in the marketplace beyond the legacy of middle-market, but the broader market continues the option and we see that trend moving forward.","And lastly, we have expected over time to see additional competition coming to this marketplace. That's a good thing because it's reinforcing of the tremendous demand for this product and service. We like the fact that we have a dedicated unit, dedicated technology, dedicated resources and very importantly, continued investment in innovation and services around the expansion, if necessary, to drive this on a go-forward basis. So we see an optimistic future for this portfolio as we look to future. I'll ask Eric to give you some color relative to our very strong MLR and how it shapes over the rest of the year.","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Hey, Josh. It's Eric. Just on the MLRs, as David noted, we're really pleased with the performance that we delivered in the first quarter here. Would expect that that would follow, I'll say, a normal seasonal pattern as we move throughout the course of the year, I mean, ultimately, the Commercial loss ratio for the full year landing in the 77.5% to 78.5% range that I talked about in my prepared remarks. We think that's a great result and we're on track to deliver it.","Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC","Great. And if I could just throw one more out there, the life insurance claims, you talked about sort of a slightly higher than expected life insurance claims. Maybe just talk a little bit about the product and the funding. Just want to make sure this is just the traditional life. Maybe mortality rates increased a little bit, nothing more than sort of industry factors there.","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Yeah. Josh, on the Life businesses, is just a pretty plain vanilla group, employer-sponsored and voluntary life set of products where employees may elect additional coverage, things along those lines. There's some variability in this from period to period. We saw higher claims in the month of March specifically, but have seen the month of April, for example, has been right back to where we were expecting. So again, we do just see variability from time to time in this business and I would note that as the driver for the results in the first quarter here.","Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Raskin. Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. You may ask your question.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. I guess I want go back to maybe follow up on an earlier question about the investor feedback around the Express deal. Because I guess from what I've heard, I think the things that you've outlined around the opportunities here I think are pretty clear but the concerns tend to be more around the core underlying performance of a PBM, I guess Express in particular but maybe to the PBM market broadly.","Just wondering as you've spent some time talking to investors, you had more time to talk to Express about the issues, is there anything that you can kind of provide to us to give us comfort around the work that you've done to kind of say that the earnings profile of Express going forward is in fact more or less what the market believes that there is sustainability? Or if there's any levers that you think that, as a combined company, Express might not have on its own, that give you that confidence that the pro forma numbers into 2021 will play out.","David M. Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Kevin, it's David. So a couple different dimensions to your question. First and foremost, let me start with the basic chassis and that is the fact that Express continues to deliver strong performance to their clients that they serve each and every day, as evidenced by their very strong retention rates. So you come back in a dynamic market of servicing commercial employers, sophisticated health plans, governmental agencies, strong retention rates are reinforcing a high-value creation.","The second piece to the core of your question, the whole notion relative to the earnings profile, the sustainability of the earnings, just to spend a moment on that, it's clear that Express has a strong margin profile relative to its traditional competitors. Unlike their traditional competitors that they're benchmarked against, Express Scripts is focused in the pharmacy space exclusively and, as such, doesn't have other lines of business to, kind of, cross margin against or otherwise.","Additionally, the market better understands through some of the disclosures that have taken place in the ongoing dialogue that Express' portfolio of business is a little different. So a broad commercial portfolio, but that commercial portfolio has both large national accounts and smaller national accounts and therefore the margin profile is little different from that standpoint.","Secondly, that they have a broad services portfolio they offer to the marketplace that doesn't correlate to the facilitation of prescriptions being fulfilled, yet they have the revenue and earnings from that. Hence, it makes the margin profile per script look a bit higher. So a little better visibility into that from the filings that have taken place.","But at the end of the day on a go-forward basis, whether it's legacy Cigna, legacy Express, or anybody else, the ability to capture value for the shareholders is totally predicated on the ability to deliver value for clients and customers. And the visibility relative to just the sheer size and the impact of pharmacy, specialty pharmacy, medical, behavioral being better coordinated to deliver an outstanding cost and quality outcome, we believe, is being better understood, because that's the fundamental market need. And the combined company's going to have the ability to take market-leading trend already and step it to another level, which is going to be key to being able to deliver value to clients and customers and, as a result, capture value for the benefit of shareholders. And to me, that's the core of the dialogue.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. And then just, when you talk about the MLR for the two businesses, you threw prior-period development in the Commercial explanation but not in the Government explanation. So I assume that most of the PPD was in Commercial. And yet, you lowered your MLR in Government and kept it in Commercial. So just wanted to understand that dynamic, if there's anything going on there either at the Government or the Commercial business.","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Kevin, it's Eric. We reported favorable prior-year development in both the Commercial and the Government businesses, skewed more on the Commercial side or end of the book. But the Commercial book is quite bit bigger than the Government book as well. And so again, nothing I would call out as particularly notable or anything along those lines. Again, pleased with the performance in both so far, year to date, and the visibility that we had to the outlook for the full year on a Government basis led us to lower the loss ratio there. But again, overall, good momentum in both.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Fischbeck. Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research you may ask your question.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the membership growth. I mean, I'm sure you guys realize this, but you're significantly differentiated from your peers here in the first quarter at least. It looks like just in the first quarter versus 4Q, you guys added about 150,000 Commercial group members, while your peers shrunk by about 750,000. So can you give us some more color in terms of products, geographies, markets, where you feel like you're seeing momentum, or anything you're doing differently here?","David M. Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Justin, good morning. It's David. First I appreciate the callout relative to significantly differentiated. And just come back, as Eric and I noted, we have eight years of growth in the commercial space and it's been disciplined growth. Coming back to the geographies, anchor back to our Go Deep or Go Deeper orientation first and foremost. We seek to be higher focused geographically. Second, it's really imperative to anchor this back, as Eric articulated before, off of the multiple years of differentiated medical trend delivery.","Third, as we've discussed in the past, we have continued to pour significant resources into innovation of products, programs and services. For example, the Cigna One Guide offering that was rolled out in 2017 to 2 million customers. In 2018, we'll have 4 million customers being serviced by that. So an evolving chassis through that dimension.","And lastly, as you may recall, we profiled in our Investor Day \u2013 and as Will noted in his opening comments \u2013 we profile that our view was that we had significant headroom, for example, in the 251 to 500 life employer space. And we reoriented and aligned the team relative to that and expanded our density of orientation. And we saw meaningful progress in the 250 to 500 space as well.","Broadly speaking, by way of funding mechanism philosophy, our team uses our broad portfolio, from ASO, ASO stop-loss, shared returns and guaranteed costs, and we're really pleased with what the team was able to deliver with outstanding retention and good new business adds.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And just as a follow-up there, it was interesting just because I thought your ASO, this would be a year where you would take share in self-insured that just given the HIF coming back, anybody with guaranteed risk is going to be taking a big price increase.","So the fact that that didn't happen, and you're seeing what seems like more competition on that ASO and stop-loss business chassis, whatever you want to call it, is it possible that you've now kind of evolved that to say, instead of just shared risk or instead of \u2013 where you'll get some upside if things are better, are you stepping out even further and guaranteeing that upside? Have you changed any of your pricing methodology around that ASO and stop-loss to just take the next step to guaranteed cost?","David M. Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Justin, it's David. First, consistent with our past dialog, we have not viewed nor have we seen that the implementation of the HIF, pausing the HIF, re-implementation of the HIF, et cetera. We've had the posture that that doesn't change the purchasing patterns broadly. It doesn't change what and philosophically how an employer's going to buy. You're either going to orient around transparency or not, you may get a little movement on the margin. So point one.","Point two is we've invested meaningfully into evolving our portfolio of services with dedicated platforms, dedicated distribution resources, dedicated client management resources and evolving the products, programs and capabilities. And we like our portfolio of services. To the point you made, we have not had a pricing philosophy change. Our pricing philosophy is very consistent, as evidenced by our really strong client retention levels to come back to delivering on our promises and delivering an outstanding medical cost trend.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Lake. Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. You may ask your question.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. I know it's early and we're sort of in the midst of the 2019 selling season, but any general views of kind of what you're seeing or hearing whether we're likely to see less movement in Commercial next year just given some of the pending deals? Or if it's a big RFP calendar both in terms of your renewals and new business?","David M. Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Ralph, good morning. It's David. So, relative to 2019, your question points toward mostly, essentially, the national accounts marketplace, so a little color there. Before I give you color, just to remind everybody, we define national accounts a bit differently than our competition. So, for us, a national account is a commercial employer with 5,000 or more employees that are multi-state. So, our focus is very clear there.","Specifically, relative to point-in-time today versus point-in-time last year, the amount of RFPs we have to look at are about equal year-over-year and the portion of our portfolio that's out to bid is about equal year-over-year. So, we see consistency through the volume. The only double click-down I would give you there is still the intensity and momentum of the market looking for just proven incentive engagement-based programs, further evolution of proven points of integration to deliver step functions of affordability, health improvement, productivity improvement. That intensity just continues to mount over time and we're well-positioned to step up to those opportunities.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Right. That's helpful. And then just to follow up on that, I guess I do want to drill down a little bit on the national account book and just want to get your views of sort of looking ahead. How much of a focus will that be? Why is it that sort of the Select and smaller end of the market has been more receptive, I guess, to your strategy in terms of the growth you've seen than the national account book? And then, I'm hoping you can give us the overlap of your national accounts that carve out to Express Scripts. Thanks.","David M. Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Yes. So, Ralph, two dimensions there. Dimension number one, to be clear, we continue to perform well in national. We pick our spots because what we're looking for is the philosophical alignment with what the employer is seeking to do and we try to go really deep in those relationships. And you may recall from our prior conversation, we value the depth of the relationships and the cross-selling and the integration of services, and we've seen continued further deepening of those relationships. And that enables us to deliver outstanding medical costs, that enables us to deliver strong retention and further expand those relationships going forward.","We grew our national accounts relationships in 2017, and we see the opportunity to continue to grow both in the traditional marketplace as well as importantly on a targeted basis on the private exchanges.","Specific to the second part of your question, think about a 10% to 15% overlap, hence, flip it around the other way, massive opportunity. And we've talked about those opportunities in the past between the Cigna and the Express portfolio of relationships. So, we see tremendous upside and opportunity there.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Giacobbe. Your next question comes from Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Just wanted to triangulate some of the comments around the Commercial enrollment and, frankly, the MLR beat with the return of the HIF and I guess strong enrollment gains, some of the comments we've heard from your competitors. I guess I'd be interested in just understanding if high deductibles or just higher deductibles in general gained more traction this year than in years past in a way that might drive increased seasonality in the business, and whether that might've been a part of the thought process as you considered how much of the upside in Q1 to flow through to the guidance.","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Yeah. Steve, it's Eric. Couple of dimensions to that. So, first of all, with respect to deductibles and the like, I wouldn't actually call out a particular change in terms of the overall book of business and such. Our customers in 2018 have about the same cost sharing as they had in 2017, and there hasn't been a pronounced shift there.","In any given year, there's different dynamics as the terms of the seasonality of the quarterly pattern of the loss ratio evolves, as you think about the impact of the amount of stop-loss in the portfolio, the amount of the Commercial business, the timing of the sales and the makeup of the individual book of business. But again, overall, pulling those pieces together, we think we're well on track for the strong result that we've communicated previously.","Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. It's great to hear. Just one follow-up on trend. I think it was on the 4Q call where you sort of outlined expectations of an acceleration in utilization. Are you actually seeing that? And if you could talk to maybe inpatient versus outpatient, both utilization and pricing that you're seeing, that would be helpful. Thank you.","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Sure. So, as we noted coming out of 2017, we delivered a particularly strong trend result in 2017, finishing the year at 3%. We did note that we assumed and expected a bit of a utilization uptick coming into the year. Overall, wouldn't call out anything particular in terms of areas of increase and such, but more that we were just making sure that we had an outlook that was allowed for a bit of an uptick relative to 2017.","As you think about the different service categories and such, overall, would continue to note inpatient and outpatient both in kind of that mid-single-digit sort of a range, but all consistent with the outlook that we provided three months ago.","Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Tanal. Next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. You may ask your question.","Steve J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Great. Thanks. Good morning, David and Eric. So, I hate to beat the medical cost trend questions to death here, but I had sort of a similar question to some other folks just on the dynamics around favorably reducing the Government MLR guidance but leaving the Commercial MLR guidance unchanged, even though there seemed to be that bigger delta, favorable results on the Commercial side. Is there just anything noteworthy or magical about changing one and not the other? Thanks.","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Yeah, Steve. It's Eric. Overall, I would just say it's early in the year, and I think that we're off to a good start. But I would note it's early in the year, so again, nothing along those lines. As I noted in one of the other answers, just the impact and the size of the Government business. We had visibility given the PYD that we've delivered, and the track record or the results in the first quarter led us to lowering that ratio. But, again, nothing else that I would call out underneath the numbers. Just early in the year and again, off to a good start.","Steve J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Valiquette. Our next question comes from Ana Gupte the Leerink Partners. You may ask your question.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Following up again on the Mid-Market and Select growths and what you're expecting to see post the deal close. Think Mid-Market, you've grown year-over-year single digits. Select is well into the teens it looks like. What type of feedback are you getting from the Mid-Market and Select brokers and the employers on the cross-selling value proposition Express to Cigna and vice versa?","David M. Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Ana, good morning. It's David. Our dialogue with clients as well as brokers, and we've had significant interaction post the announcement, macro, favorable reaction. Why favorable reaction? Expansion of capabilities to further improve affordability, expansion of services and flexibility of offerings, so very positive.","You may recall as we've talked about the additional uptick from a revenue standpoint that the new franchise will be able to deliver beyond the base case of both organizations. We did identify the ability for further uptick within the legacy of Express as it relates to additional growth opportunities. Additionally, in a prior question, I indicated the modest amount of overlap in the relationships that exist today.","So, big picture, I'd say energy and optimism, twofold. One, the ability to further step up and further deliver differentiated affordability, which is job number one. And secondly, the broadening of services that will be available through either side of the channels, whether it's the integrated medical or the services-based offering, both being received very favorably in the market.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Thanks. And then following up on the affordability point, you've guided to $600 million in synergies on admins and we're taking that to the bottom line. So, I'm assuming given the price sensitivity in those markets that you are looking to pass through some of your medical cost synergies into the employer customers. And what is kind of the driver of that and what is the timing? And as you even look into the 2019 selling season, might you be thinking about what you might do together?","David M. Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Ana, it sounds like you're trying to negotiate a rate renewal with us right now, but specific to your question, you're correct. And to be very clear, it's important. We've committed the expense in administrative-oriented synergies back from a shareholder standpoint and we were clear on the date of the announcement. We expect to flow the preponderance of all the medical and pharmacy savings back to customers and clients because we seek to drive further step function and affordability.","As you might imagine, that intent and that strategic direction is being received favorably in the marketplace and we look forward to being able to carry that forward as quickly as possible there after closing the combination. So, we couldn't be more excited about it to further build on the affordability momentum we have today with yet another step function of good value for the benefit of clients and customers.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you, Ms. Gupte. Our next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. You may ask your question.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, everyone. Nice quarter. Can you tell us about \u2013 one of the opportunities you see some of your competitors exploring that you guys have not explored with Medicare Advantage group business. How many of your commercial retirees at this point \u2013 commercial members are retirees and that could be an opportunity for you to convert into Medicare Advantage group lives?","David M. Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Peter, good morning. It's David. First, macro, we don't have that data point disclosed. Stepping back, you identify a future growth opportunity that is not lost on us in any way, shape or form. So, we continue to be excited and optimistic around our Medicare Advantage growth chassis, both in the individual market as well as the opportunity over time relative to the group space.","We have not pursued that, as you noted. We have stayed focused in an incredibly Go Deep orientation to drive the individual chassis but, over time, we see a significant opportunity there. We're clearly aware of what that number is. We just don't have that number disclosed and we see that as a future growth opportunity for us.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Has that risen or declined over the last year or two as your competitors start rolling these products out more and more aggressively? Are they coming into your customer base? Or are you still retaining most of those retirees within your customer base and that what they're actually having is mostly just conversions of their own commercial group into Medicare Advantage?","David M. Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Experience has been pretty stable and we don't see disruption relative to our customer base at this point in time.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Terrific. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Costa. Our next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. You may ask your question.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Your enrollment guidance increase suggests that you are expecting enrollment growth over the balance of the year. Your revenue guidance maintenance, I can kind of get beyond that by just annualizing the first quarter. I wondered if there's a mix disconnect that I'm not thinking about, or what might be the reason that we wouldn't see revenue grow at more like double digits just annualizing the first quarter. Thanks.","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Dave, it's Eric. Nothing I would note in particular, I think. Over the balance of the year, we would expect to have growth in the Select and Middle-market segments across a range of funding arrangements. We'd also expect the individual book will attrit consistent with the normal pattern over the balance of the year until you pull those pieces together and you get to the range that we've talked about. Again, we're pleased with the early momentum that we've got from a customer base perspective and from a growth perspective, but just that kind of evolution of the mix of funding arrangements over the back half of the year, that lands you still at the 7% to 8% growth.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Super. I appreciate that. I don't think I've read or heard any call-out with regard to flu. Was there a quantification of flu impact? And did that end up being lower than you expected, or in line?","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Yeah, the flu season overall, we had pretty good visibility into when we provided our guidance back at the beginning of February. It played out pretty consistent, so I would note it as a variance kind of one way or the other in terms of our performance so far this year or in our outlook.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","And if I can sneak in one more, David. Competitively, are you seeing competitors creating networks that favor owned delivery assets? And is that a competitive challenge or opportunity for you?","David M. Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Dave, macro, generally speaking, no. Over time, we expect to see that as a potential. We see it more as an opportunity than not. We believe the more choice, partnered, open-access framework and the alignment around that is superior based upon needs and buying behaviors so long as the cost quality equation is there and we've been able to prove an outstanding cost quality equation. So, big picture, to-date, no. See it as a potential change in the future and we think that change creates more opportunity for us than not.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Windley. Our next question comes from Lance Wilkes with Stanford Bernstein. You may ask your question.","Lance Arthur Wilkes - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yeah. Morning, guys. Just had a question strategically. Following the Express Scripts merger and ultimate integration of that, what are the additional strategic capabilities that you feel you need to add? And how would you prioritize things like local market scale, government program growth and vertical integration with risk-bearing providers?","David M. Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Good morning, Lance. So, you recall we have a very clear set of priorities relative to M&A. Your question was premised on what we have to add. We will be extremely well-positioned post the combination and we're excited for that. We remain focused in terms of five categories of M&A so long as they are strategic as well as financially attractive. And to remind you, they further our global footprint, they continue to perform quite well, further our U.S. seniors capabilities, further our physician engagement and pharmacy capabilities, further our retail base capabilities and over time, expand our state-based risk program capabilities.","So, our orientation, if you look back, has been very consistent with the five priorities we put forward. We don't prioritize one over the other. We dynamically seek to identify the best opportunity in any of those categories as the marketplace evolves and we'll continue to be optimistic around that.","Lance Arthur Wilkes - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And just a quick question on pharmacy membership for the quarter. It looked like the pharmacy cross-sell rate may have declined a little bit in the quarter. Just wondering what drove that, kind of who won that business and if there were any changes in how you're going about cross-selling that?","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","The decline of the PBM lives for the first quarter was primarily driven by the loss of a large national account relationship. Looking over the balance of the year, I'd expect pharmacy lives to grow as it's a key element of the integrated offering that we have in our Select and Middle-market segments. And obviously, the combination with Express scripts will position us to even more effectively serve those clients on an integrated or on a stand-alone basis.","Lance Arthur Wilkes - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Got you. And I just note that in your prepared remarks, David, you mentioned your clients and an expansive view clients including health plans and you mentioned pharma manufacturers a number of times. I was wondering just kind of your perspective on how you look at pharma manufacturers and kind of the orientation of them as clients and how you might service them going forward.","David M. Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Yeah. Lance, thanks. It was referring to the pharma manufacturers in terms of opportunities for alignment opportunities for value creation, et cetera.","So, coming back to orientation around partner of choice, coming back to orientation around driving value-based outcomes, we believe it's imperative in the next chapter of health care in the United States to find some of the success that the marketplace has seen and we have seen in aligning incentives around collaboratives, or otherwise, with physicians or hospitals carrying that same philosophy much more deeply and much more comprehensively into the pharmaceutical manufacturing environment because, again, the cost curve cannot continue to be borne by society. And we see a tremendous opportunity to step-function the value creation for clients and customers working with forward-looking pharmaceutical manufacturers. That was the intent of that comment.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Wilkes. Our last question comes from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question.","Frank George Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning. Most of mine have been answered, but I did want to go back to the guidance just one last time. And maybe this is an Eric question. When you look at the strong results in the quarter relative to the amount of guidance raised and you look at just the EPS contribution in the first quarter, it's obviously a lot higher than what you historically run.","So I'm just curious, is there any final thoughts, this is the last question, in terms of just the cadence over the course of the year that we should be mindful of when we work the quarterly progression out to get to your guidance? Thanks.","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Frank, I appreciate the question. The dynamics here, I would call, would be all kind of normal things. But I would note the following in terms of things that will shape the seasonal pattern over the balance of the year. First is just the normal seasonal impact of deductibles and the normal impact of things like Part D and the like. And with the deductibles, in particular, as you know, as you move throughout the year, those have an upward increase on the cost end of things, one.","Two is the rate and pace of spending on our capabilities, including the impact of some of the investments that we've talked about in terms of tax reform and those sorts of things. We expect that those will come in over the back part of the year, as well as spending on our readiness for January 2019 selling cycle.","And then, third would just be the impact of the 2019 industry fees suspension that'll come back out of rates as we get closer to the 2019 timeframe and such. And so, again, we've seen this dynamic in the past when the industry fee comes and goes in terms of the impact that it has on the seasonal pattern and the like.","Those would be the things I'd encourage you to think about as you look at the overall pattern. But again I'd reiterate, off to a great start this year and really confident in our ability to deliver the results and the guidance that we put forward.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Morgan. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks.","David M. Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Thank you. To wrap up our call, I just want to reiterate a few key points from our discussion. Cigna delivered very strong first quarter financial results, which continue our consistent track record of growth and value creation across our well-positioned portfolio of businesses. Our results reflect strong momentum across our portfolio, led by our Commercial Employer business, which once again delivered strong organic medical customer growth, particularly in the Select and Middle-market segments, attractive margins and continued industry-leading medical cost trend. Collectively, our first quarter results reflect strong momentum and give us confidence we will achieve our improved 2018 outlook for earnings, EPS growth and customer growth.","Our first quarter performance also continued Cigna's long track record of value creation in our employer customer space through deep integration in medical, pharmacy behavioral and other specialty solutions that enables us to more comprehensively support the health needs of our customers.","Looking ahead, our combination with Express Scripts will position us to continue to build on this track record and will accelerate our growth strategy by creating deeper alignment across critical elements of the health care system to drive improved affordability and clinical quality and will result in attractive financial results, exceptional free cash flow and capital flexibility. We thank you for joining our call today and look forward to our future discussions.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Cigna's First Quarter 2018 Results Review.

We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedures on how to enter queue to ask question at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen this conference including the Q&A session is being recorded.","We will begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Will McDowell. Please go ahead, Mr. McDowell.","William McDowell","Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining today's call. I\u2019m Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric Palmer, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Eric will cover a number of topics including Cigna's full year 2019 financial results, as well as our financial outlook for 2020.","As noted in our earnings release when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues which are not determined in accordance with Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States otherwise known as GAAP.","A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income, and total revenues respectively is contained in today's earnings release which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com.","We use the term labeled Adjusted Income from Operations and Earnings per Share on this same basis as our principle measures of financial performance. I will remind you that as previously disclosed we exclude contributions from transitioning clients from adjusted income from operations, and adjusted revenue.","In our remarks today, we will be making some Forward-Looking Statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2020 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.","Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, in the fourth quarter we recorded an after tax special item charge of $116 million or $0.31 per share for integration and transaction related costs. We also recorded a special item charge of $162 million or $0.43 per share, for severance cost associated with a series of actions we're taking to improve our organizational efficiency.","As described in today\u2019s earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations, in our discussion of financial results. Please note that consistent with best practice, when we make prospective comments, regarding financial performance, including our full-year 2020 outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future share repurchases or additional prior year development of medical costs.","Additionally, our outlook for 2020 assumes a full year of earnings from Cigna's group disability and life business. We continue to expect our divestiture of that business to be completed by the third quarter of 2020. I will remind you that as previously disclosed beginning in 2020, we will no longer exclude contributions from transitioning clients from our performance measures as the transition for those clients was substantially complete as of December 31, 2019.","And finally, I will note that this morning, we posted investor presentation to the investor relations section of cigna.com that outlines our strategy and track record, the strength of our four growth platforms, 2020 operating and capital guidance and details of our longer term outlook. We hope that you will find this a helpful resource.","With that, I will turn the call over to David.","David Cordani","Thanks Will and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. In 2019, we delivered consolidated adjusted revenue of $140 billion and grew earnings per share by 20% to $17.05. As a result, we exceeded the guidance that we'd already raised each quarter during 2019 for revenue, earnings and EPS as well as cash flow from operations.","Today I'll comment on how we delivered these exceptionally strong results and on the contributions made by each of our four growth platforms led by Health Services and Integrated Medical segments. I'll also discuss how we are positioned to drive attractive growth in 2020 and achieve our 2021 EPS target of $20 to $21 per share.","Finally, I'll highlight a key point of differentiation and a driver of future growth, our focus on being the undisputed partner of choice in health care. Following my comments, Eric will share more details about our full year 2019 financial results and 2020 outlook, and then we'll take your questions. Let's dive in.","At our Investor Day last year, we committed to building on a decade long track record of delivering industry leading cost trends, consistent growth, and effective capital stewardship. In 2019, we delivered on each of these commitments. While remaining focused on our customers and patients, we executed well across each of our businesses, deepened our customer relationships and achieved our integration priorities. Together this fueled our outstanding performance.","In Health Services, we delivered market leading customer and client retention including 97% retention for the 2020 selling season and continued strong organic growth in prescriptions. In commercial, we again delivered industry leading medical cost trend and grew our commercial medical customers for the 10th consecutive year, led by another year of double digit growth in the select segment.","And in a government business, CMSs most recent stared ratings position as to have 87% of our Medicare Advantage customers enforced our higher plan for 2021 a reinforcement of our strong customer satisfaction and high levels of clinical quality.","Additionally, we made significant progress in advancing our five key integration priorities. First and foremost, we kept that promises in the marketplace by ensuring our more than 170 million customer relationships around the world experienced ongoing high service quality throughout the year.","Second, we delivered medical and pharmacy cost savings for the benefit of our customers and clients, effectively completing their transition to industry leading pharmacies solutions, including Accredo's specialty pharmacy, and Express Scripts customer friendly home delivery pharmacy. Additionally, more than 95% of our customers have access to safeguard Rx, an innovative suite of value based programs that improve care and value for customers with challenging medical conditions.","Third was a focus on talent. As a Health Service company, our talent and their engagement is key to our performance and ongoing growth. Our retention and engagement levels today, one year into a combination are above our already strong pre-transaction levels.","Fourth, we made significant progress towards securing base operating expense synergies. The organizational efficiency plan we announced earlier today is another important step toward achieving these targets.","And finally, we kept our vision top of mind by accelerating marketplace innovations that improve affordability, predictability and simplicity, including our embark benefit protection program, which improves customer access to life changing gene therapies, while shielding clients from the price shock of multimillion dollar treatments.","Our digital health formulary, to better carry and generate value from the 300,000 digital health apps in the marketplace today in a patient assurance program, where insulin dependent patients with diabetes pay a maximum of $25 for a 30 day supply of insulin. As a result of this program, our customers are already realizing significant out of pocket savings.","Overall, 2019 was an exceptionally strong year for Cigna and gives us considerable momentum for ongoing attractive growth in 2020 and beyond. Our achievements were and continue to be driven by the focus, commitment and passion of our employees who wake up every day to fulfill our mission to improve the health well-being peace of mind to those we serve.","In 2020 we will continue to drive significant growth and customer relationships, revenue, earnings and EPS as well as strong cash flows. In Health Services, we expect adjusted script growth in a range of 20% to 23% over our year end 2019 levels. In integrated medical, we are on track for continued medical customer growth highlighted by our government business, where we expect 13% to 16% customer growth and Medicare Advantage and we remain positioned for very attractive growth over the next five years.","Additionally, after a very successful first year as a combined company, we remain on track to complete our integration activities over the next year. We also expect to close the sale of our group disability and life business to New York Life by the third quarter this year. And we're on track to return a balance sheet to normalized levels of debt by year end 2020. In short, we're on pace to meet the commitments we made when we announced the combination nearly two years ago, and meet the commitments we made at our Investor Day in May of 2019.","Looking forward a key point of differentiation and growth driver for Cigna in 2020 and beyond is our orientation toward partnering in order to achieve accelerated innovation, improved affordability, predictability and simplicity and to further expand our distribution reach. Several recent examples demonstrate our proven differentiation.","First is our new arrangement with Prime Therapeutics. Starting in April 2020, together we will make pharmacy care more affordable, financing, pharmacy networks and pharmaceutical manufacturer value for Prime's 28 million members who are covered by 23 health plans including employer programs, Medicare and Medicaid.","Together Express Scripts and Prime will help each other to continue to grow in the market across the country by innovating new solutions to improve affordability, increased access to medicine and further improve individual health. This agreement shows our ability to work across healthcare and partner with those who seek to deliver innovative high quality health services and solutions to employers, health plans and governmental agencies for the benefit of customers and patients.","A second example of our partnership orientation is our work with emerging and highly innovative companies. A great recent example of this is a partnership with Oscar Health. With Oscar, we will deliver new innovative solutions for small businesses, which all too often are left with limited options that are highly priced. We will offer small businesses access to affordable, fully insured health plans that brought in choice and prioritize whole person health. We will focus in four geographies with Oscar later this year and we'll take our proven tessellated framework to accelerated growth over time.","A third example is our trusted relationships with healthcare professionals. We have a long history innovative value based arrangements with healthcare professionals in both our US commercial and government businesses, including more than 650 collaborative accountable care relationships. Today, more than 65% of Cigna's medical payments are in value based arrangements across our top 40 commercial markets and all our Medicare markets.","Importantly, 92% of healthcare providers in our programs are delivering differentiated levels of quality. And 90% of healthcare providers believe Cigna is the industry leader in this area. These deep partnerships drive our growth, particularly in Medicare Advantage where we focus on geographies, where our commercial business already has aligned high performing collaborative accountable care relationships in place.","Approximately 25% of Medicare eligible seniors live in geographies where commercial business has deep ties in delivery systems, but we have no Medicare Advantage presence today. That provides a meaningful growth opportunity for our Medicare Advantage business that we have begun to capitalize in 2020 by accelerating our geographic expansion and bringing new PPO solutions to market.","This combined with the fact that 87% of our Medicare Advantage customers are in four star or greater plans in 2021 and our high customer and PS levels, which approximate 70 across all of our markets, make us excited about our future customer growth, which we project to be in the range of 10% to 15% on an annualized basis over the next five years. Each of these examples gives a clear view of how diverse healthcare stakeholders view Cigna as their best partner for future success and how being the partner of choice in healthcare marketplace will contribute to our sustained differentiated growth over time.","Now briefly, to summarize, at Cigna we delivered exceptional full year 2019 financial results across our four growth platforms led by Health Services and our Integrated Medical segments. These results drove strong financial performance in 2018 and provide us with considerable momentum as we step into 2020 with outstanding strategic and financial flexibility, and we remain on track to deliver our EPS goal of $20 to $21 per share in 2021.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Eric.","Eric Palmer","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll review Cigna's 2019 results and provide our outlook for 2020. Key consolidated financial highlights for 2019 include adjusted revenue of $140 billion, earnings of $6.5 billion after tax, earnings per share growth of 20% to $17.05 and operating cash flows more than doubled this year to $9.5 billion. These results reflect strong consistent execution across our businesses throughout 2019.","Regarding our segments, I'll first comment on Health Services. Full year 2019 revenues were $96.4 billion and pre-tax earnings were $5.1 billion. Results for 2019 reflect organic growth, with outstanding client retention and the addition of 2.7 million pharmacy customers, strong volumes with 1.22 billion adjusted pharmacy scripts fulfilled and growth in specialty pharmacy. Overall, Health Services performed well in 2019 with results in line with our expectations and reflecting significant progress across our integration activities.","Turning to Integrated Medical, 2019 revenues grew 11% to $36.5 billion driven by commercial customer growth and expansion of specialty relationships, premium growth reflecting underlying cost trends, and the inclusion of the Express Scripts Medicare Part D business. We organically grew our global medical customer base to 17.1 million lives. In 2019, we once again delivered double digit organic customer growth in our select segment with continued enrollment gains in middle market. Full year earnings grew 9% to $3.8 billion reflecting growth in medical customers and specialty relationships, strong operating expense discipline, and continued effective medical cost management.","Turning to medical cost, for our total US commercial book of business, full year medical cost trend for 2019 was approximately 4%, which marks the seventh consecutive year Cigna has delivered an industry leading result. Our full year 2019 total medical care ratio or MCR was 80.8%, finishing the year at the low end of our guidance range.","Our MCR performance reflects stable trends and focused execution of affordability initiatives across our commercial and government businesses and the pricing effect of the health insurance tax suspension. Full year 2019, Integrated medical earning benefited from $85 million pre-tax of favorable net to prior year reserve development. Overall, Cigna's Integrated Medical segment delivered strong financial results in 2019.","In our international markets business, revenues grew to $5.6 billion, an increase of 8% on a currency adjusted basis. And full year 2019 pre-tax earnings grew to $762 million reflecting continued business growth, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts.","For our group disability and other operations segments, full year 2019 revenues were $5.2 billion. Full year pre-tax earnings for this segment were $501 million with strong performance in life and continued administrative efficiencies, partially offset by higher disability claims.","For our corporate segment, the full year 2019 loss was $1.8 billion, primarily driven by $1.7 billion of interest costs. As Will mentioned, during fourth quarter, we reported a special item charge of $162 million after tax for severance costs related to our organizational efficiency plan. Under this plan, we will implement efficiency initiatives that we identified primarily through our integration work. These actions reflect our commitment to providing affordable quality solutions to the marketplace and the savings associated with this plan are included within the multi-year administrative expense synergy targets that we previously communicated.","Overall, Cigna's 2019 results reflect focused execution across each of our businesses. Before discussing our outlook for continued attractive growth this year, I would remind you of the 2019 earnings per share baseline adjustments that we quantified on our third quarter earnings call. Specifically, Cigna's earnings per share performance in 2019 should be adjusted for the following three items.","First, $0.12 share for the tax item we've favorably settled in the second quarter of 2019. Second, $0.18 per share of favorable net prior year reserve development. And finally, $0.25 per share associated with the industry tax, which was suspended for 2019, but returns in 2020 a final year. This impact is increased to reflect the incremental timing effect of the recent repeal of the industry tax. When adjusting for these impacts, Cigna's 2019 earnings per share baseline was $16.50.","Turning to outlook, we have entered 2020 well positioned to drive both continued growth and innovation. We also expect to complete our integration activities associated with the Express Scripts combination over the next year. For full year 2020, we expect consolidate adjusted revenues in the range of $154 million to $156 billion, representing growth of 10% to 11%.","We expect full year 2020 consolidated adjusted income from operations to be $6.8 billion to $7 billion or $18 to $18.60 per share. This represents growth in the range of 9% to 13% over our 2019 baseline. We expect the cadence of earnings per share 2020 to be approximately 47% in the first half and 53% in the second half of the year, taking into consideration seasonality patterns within our businesses. For 2020, we project an expense ratio in the range of 8.6% to 9.1%, and the consolidated adjusted tax rates in the range of 23% to 24%.","Additionally, our outlook excludes any contribution from future share repurchases, and prior year reserve development and assumes a full year of contributions from our group disability and life business. And as previously communicated in 2020, we will no longer report transitioning client contributions since those transitions were substantially complete as of December 31, 2019.","I will now discuss our 2020 outlook for our segments. For our Health Services business we expect full year 2020 earnings in the range of $5.3 billion to $5.45 billion. This represents year-over-year growth in the range of 4% to 7%. In Health Services, we expect first quarter 2020 earnings to grow by a mid-single digit percentage over first quarter 2019.","This outlook reflects solid underlying growth and the benefits of increased year-over-year administrative expense synergies. I'd also note that we expect our first quarter 2020 Health Services SG&A expense ratio to be higher than first quarter 2019 reflecting impacts of the client transitions we've discussed previously and including startup costs associated with our collaboration with Prime Therapeutics.","For 2020 we expect adjusted pharmacy scripts in the range of 1.47 billion to 1.50 billion claims. This reflects the impact of completing the in sourcing of Cigna pharmacy services, growth associated with the first year of the Prime collaboration and additional organic growth of 25 million to 35 million adjusted pharmacy scripts. All in this represents a year-over-year growth of 20% to 23%.","For integrated medical, we expect full year 2020 earnings in the range of $4 billion to $4.1 billion, which represents growth of 11% to 13% over the 2019 baseline. This outlook reflects strength and growth in our businesses, driven by continued benefits from organic customer growth, deepening of customer relationships and effective medical cost management. This outlook also included the benefit of administrative expense synergies.","Key assumptions reflected in our Integrated Medical earnings outlook for 2020 include the following, regarding global medical customers, we expect 2020 growth in the range of 150,000 to 250,000 customers, driven by continued organic growth in our commercial business, led by the selected middle market segments, partially offset by lower national accounts enrollment. We also expect Medicare Advantage customer growth of 13% to 16%.","Our growth outlook also includes an expectation of lower enrollment in our US individual business, and the expected loss of our Texas Medicaid contracts collectively resulting in a reduction of approximately 90,000 customers.","Turning to medical costs, for our US commercial employer book of business, we expect full year 2020 medical cost trend to be in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%. We expect the 2020 medical care ratio to be in the range of 80.2% to 81.2%, reflecting the return of the health insurance tax in 2020, and continued strong performance of our commercial and government businesses, offset by the mix impact of new Medicare Advantage life and normalized margins in our US individual business.","We also expect strong contributions from our international markets with disability and other businesses as they continue to deliver solutions that enhance affordability and predictability and provide a more simplified experience for those we serve.","Regarding interest expense, we expect costs of approximately $1.6 billion pre-tax in 2020. So all in for full year 2020, we expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $6.8 billion to $7 billion or $18 to $18.60 per share. I would also remind you that our outlook excludes the impact of future share purchases and prior years of development, and assumes a full year of contributions from our group disability and life business.","Overall, these expected results represent a very attractive outlook, aided by the strong performance across our differentiated portfolio of businesses. These expected results also position us well to achieve our 2021 earnings per share target of $20 to $21 per share.","Now, moving to our capital management position and outlook, our subsidiaries remain well capitalized and we expect them to continue to drive exceptional cash flow with strong returns on capital even as we continue reinvesting to support long-term growth and innovation. In 2019, we deployed $5.2 billion to repay debt, and we repurchased 11.8 million shares of stock for $2 billion. We ended 2019 with a debt to capitalization ratio of 45.2% an improvement of 570 basis points over a year and 2018.","For 2020, we expect greater than $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations reflecting the strong capital efficiency of our well performing businesses. As previously discussed, with a near term focus on accelerated debt repayment and remain on track to return our debt to capitalization ratio to the upper 30s by the end of 2020. In 2020, we expect to deploy $4.5 to $5 billion to debt repayment, and $1 billion to capital expenditures.","As a reminder, our capital priorities remain as follows. Reinvestment back into our businesses to drive further innovation and growth, strategic M&A on a targeted basis and returning capital to shareholders, which historically we have done primarily through share repurchase. Year-to-date, as of February 5, 2020, we've repurchased 1.2 million shares for $245 million and we have $3.72 billion of remaining share repurchase authorization. Our balance sheet and cash flow look remain strong, benefiting from a highly efficient service based orientation to drive strategic flexibility, strong margins and attractive returns on capital.","Now, to recap, our full year 2019 consolidated results reflects considerable strength and momentum across our four growth platforms and continued effective execution of our focus strategy. We are confident in our ability to deliver our full year 2020 earnings outlook. We will remain on track to achieve our $20 to $21 earnings per share target for 2021. Further, our clear strategic focus, differentiated value proposition across our businesses and outstanding financial flexibility give us continued confidence in our long-term targets for growth in revenue, earnings and EPS.","With that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Mr. Lake, your line is open.","Justin Lake","Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask a quick numbers question and then a little bit about the capital deployment. So first, just in terms of the group disability sale on numbers. I know you have it in there. Just want to understand how you keep \u2013 you deploy capital that you receive to keep this earnings neutral for 2020. Wouldn't the company have to begin buying back stock early or doing ASR given the earnings of go away at a moment in time, and yet the share \u2013 the capital deployment might take time.","Eric Palmer","Justin it's Eric, thanks for the question on that. So just to step back, so for the group disability and life transaction, as we noted, in December, we entered into that agreement, we expect $5.3 billion of after tax proceeds, and we're on track for that to close in the third quarter. Since the $5.3 billion first will be incremental to operating cash flow for the year. We've got flexibility in terms of the timing of how we deploy things and how we deploy capital for the year. Our primary focus is on achieving our debt to capitalization ratio of below 40% by the end of the year and we've got flexibility beyond that and throughout the year to begin to what to do share repurchase and such. We haven't provided any specific guidance in terms of the exact timing of the share repurchase, but we do have flexibility to get started on that even as advanced with the close.","Justin Lake","Okay, but will it be earnings neutral through the year, the combination of anything to disability and the capital deployment?","Eric Palmer","That's our expectation, and that's the guidance that we provided back when we announced the transaction.","Justin Lake","Okay, and then if I could just ask a question about the Prime relationship. Congratulations on that obviously. Wanted to understand two things, one, in terms of the relationship itself, it's somewhat narrow in focus, but sounds like it could expand over time. How do you kind of look at the risk versus opportunity to risk being that some of your existing Express Scripts customers we have a much broader relationship, move to Prime and therefore could be somewhat dilutive versus the opportunities to work with these blues and potentially expand that partnership and kind of offset some of that risk.","David Cordani","Justin, good morning, it's David. First and foremost, let me just re-underscore how pleased we are to have entered that relationship. The validation of our deep commitment to servicing health plans, partnering with health plans and growing those relationships. Two, your ability to retain any relationship be a commercial health one otherwise is based on a couple of basic tenets. A, are we able to drive partnership and alignment; B, deliver differentiated value; C, innovate together? We're committed to doing so. And actually we view the opposite of the maybe risk that you identified. This further broadens our reach and our opportunity to serve more lives, both individual customers and patients and a broader portfolio of health plans as we go forward. So we're delighted by securing this and we look forward to beginning to serve that relationship in the second quarter of this year.","Justin Lake","Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you for the question. Our next question is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Your line is open, sir.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay, great. Thanks. Actually it's a quick numbers question. First two, it sounds like you're saying that the guidance basically is similar to what you were saying with Q3, but you've got another $0.05 drag from this being removed in 2021. Do I just have that right that that's the main change versus Q3 initial outlook?","Eric Palmer","Kevin its Eric, really two small things to think about there, the incremental drag of a few cents that you noted and we have the benefit of a few cents\u2019 pickup because of the lower share count as we completed repurchase from the time period. Those are the two differences.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay, and then the question being, I think that when you guys provided initial membership guidance at the beginning of this year, that was kind of a little bit disappointing. And I guess it's clear now that some of its individual, some of its Medicaid, but you in your presentation have long-term commercial top line growth of 8% to 10%, which is a higher number than I think most people think about as far as commercial growth. How much of that is able to be driven by just growth in the selected middle market accounts? Or do you need to be starting to grow national accounts and individual to kind of achieve that over the long term? And how do you \u2013 if so, how do you turn that around?","Eric Palmer","Kevin its Eric, I'll start on that. First of all, those targets are very consistent with the results we've driven in the commercial markets for a number of years now. And I think the growth in that \u2013 the brinks that we target in that business is being driven by really three things. The first category would be around continued customer growth as we continue to grow in the select middle market segments. We've got a lot of opportunity to continue to grow in those segments. The next one, I'd say would be on deepening our existing client\u2019s relationships. So as we work to identify new solutions and deepen our existing solutions in terms of new product sales and again other programs and services. And then the third category I think about would be around, working to innovate and to deliver new solutions more broadly. But again, that's the recipe that we've used for a number of years now. And we see a lot of opportunity to continue on that track in the commercial market.","Kevin Fischbeck","And you don't need massive account growth per se together or is that part of the growth platform?","David Cordani","Kevin its David, when you think about national accounts, put it back in context, we defined that segment to remind you much more narrow than maybe the market in total. So for Integrated Medical, its commercial employers, 5000 or more employees that are multi-state. Based on that definition and our strategy we view that marketplace as a flat to somewhat shrinking marketplace based on our strategy within Integrated Medical. Now, Eric's point two and point three reinforce how we continue to actually grow and deepen relationships with national accounts. Even today, we're able to successfully do that. And then lastly, we're quite excited about is adding to that more broadly off of our Health Services platform, the ability to offer broader coordinated services. So we could see deepening of relationships and broadening of relationships with the national accounts, even with the medical membership performance that you're making reference to. And over time, we see the ability to even further accelerate that by leveraging our Health Services portfolio. So that will be a net contributor as well.","Operator","Thank you for your question. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Your line is open, sir. Mr. Windley, are you perhaps on mute?","Dave Windley","Sorry. Thank you. I was on mute. Sorry about that. Thanks for taking my question on Medicare Advantage. As you look at double digit growth trajectory here and I think that's your expectation for multiple years. That larger cohorts can sometimes come in and put a little pressure on margin. I'm wondering what your expectations are around that and what kind of platform and resources you have in place to onboard risk or risk assess and get new Medicare Advantage members into programs to mitigate any initial margin pressure.","David Cordani","Good morning, it's David. First and foremost, we're really pleased with the start to 2020. As we indicated in 2019, we expect to grow this platform 10% to 15% and we're on track to do 13 to 16. Just back to remind me of some of the context we're well positioned today in 2021. Our Stars rating picks up yet further to 87% of our lives enforced are greater plans. And our net promoter score is tracking yet tad over 70 across our broad portfolio. So our ability to grow both in markets on platforms, net new geographies being adjacent counties and new markets are opening and broadening our PPO platform will feel this and drive it on a go forward basis. Clearly the rate and pace of that growth may put a little margin pressure and draw us toward the low end of our margin range or at times, maybe a tad below that. We'll balance that in our portfolios. We continue to invest as we are today. But we like the growth outlook, we like to aggregate margin profile and we like to sustainability. The last sub note maybe have there in terms of the coding and otherwise, our value based provider relationships and our high engagement programs are well positioned to coordinate the care of the services et cetera as reinforced by the stars rating and as reinforced by our overall performance. So we feel good about the outlook for this year and the trajectory going forward.","Dave Windley","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, sir.","Steve Tanal","So I guess one on Oscar. This sounds like a very interesting partnership, but trying to understand what elements of their business are difficult or costly for Cigna to build their offer independently. So just trying to really understand what are the functions each of the companies will do in the context of the partnership. And maybe that's it for me.","David Cordani","Steve thanks, it's David. So stepping back, as I noted in my prepared remarks. First, at a philosophical level, we view that the notion of partnering and beyond partnering, striving to be the undisputed partner choice is a competitive advantage and something we want to build on. Why? It accelerates pace of innovation, it accelerates value creation, whether it be around affordability, predictability, simplicity, it could broaden speed and absolute reach within the marketplace. Oscar is a wonderful example of that. And if you take it up to the macro level, you'll recall that Cigna has historically not participated in the smallest end of the employer marketplace, be it under 50 or under 100, depending on where the regulatory lines are drawn from that standpoint. Two, we believe that's an underserved marketplace with less choice and less leverage of some of the most innovative solutions, not at the core of your question. When you're open minded to partnering, you could have both focused and acceleration in this case by leveraging Oscar's phenomenal technological infrastructure, digital first infrastructure and information flow infrastructure, which is similar to our philosophy, but we just apply it up market and select the middle and national. And this is a case where we're philosophically aligned, but the durable infrastructure is there to serve the unique needs of the small employers and then we're able to port over our value based network configurations, our high performing engagement, clinical behavioral pharmacy capabilities to make one plus one equal a lot more than two. So we're excited about that. And as I noted in my prepared remarks, we're staged to open up four markets to the latter part of this year, and then fuel some growth.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Our next question is from AJ Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is open, sir.","AJ Rice","Hi, everybody, just maybe ask about the 2020 bottom on and 2021 bottom line ranges that you have, two parts to it. First, Eric made some comments about divisional level seasonality this year and how we might think about that. I know some of your peers have made a bigger deal about the first quarter and the impact of Leap Year, perhaps because your businesses diversified. It doesn't mean as much to you, but is there anything you'd like to say about the seasonal pattern relative to a normal year? And when you think about the range itself, I guess my question is, there's a number \u2013 you got a number of business lines, you got variability around your capital deployment and cost synergy realization. Is that \u2013 is there a couple of things in that range that you see is standing out that would particularly move you either to the high end or the low end of your forecasts, given its $0.60 range and $1 range for this year and next? Or is it just the agglomeration of all these different business lines and it falls out. But I guess I'm just trying to figure out of there a couple things that are big variables in your mind as to where you're going to be say versus the $20 to $21 next year.","Eric Palmer","Eric. On the item related to the Leap Year and the February having an extra day this year that doesn't move the pattern around a little bit in the Integrated Medical segment, all else equal, that runs the loss ratio up a little bit for the first quarter, it'll normalize out over the course of the year, of course, fully factored into our guidance and such, but that does put a modest amount of pressure on the first quarter that will recover over the balance of the year. Nothing that I would call out is particularly significant. As it relates to the range more broadly, there aren't any big items I'd call out other than just the rate and pace of our spending and our investments in terms of future growth. As you know, we have continued to invest in building the capabilities in the like and spend every year as we get ready for new clients to come on board and things along those lines, so it would be those types of items that I think about more than anything else at this point.","AJ Rice","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is open, sir.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thanks, good morning. I want to go to interest expense guidance, so it looks like your run rating to 1.6 billion at least as of the fourth quarter. The guidance calls for 1.6 billion of interest costs in 2020 despite the 4.5 billion to 5 billion debt pay down. So is it just timing related? Maybe if you can kind of help reconcile that? And then along those lines, I guess to Justin's first question, so I'm sure \u2013 that's your repo, I mean, to the extent that you're doing in an accelerating it early on as an offset to the group disability and life does that mean any upside essentially in the first half of the year essentially is not going to carry through to the EPS line simply because of timing I guess. Thank you.","Eric Palmer","Ralph its Eric, so on the interest expense, really nothing in particular I'd call out other than it may be looking out to the decimal point a little bit further and the timing throughout the year. Obviously, to the extent we were to extinguish that earlier, the interest expense will go down, but again, our current expectation would be for 1.6 billion as I noted in my prepared remarks. In terms of the timing on the capital deployment, the mechanics are consistent with what I outlined to Justin's question. And we do have flexibility in terms of the timing of which we would deploy or our expectation is that we would fully offset the absence of the group transition by reducing the share count through share repurchase. And we'll approach that as we go through the course of the coming months and quarters yeah.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Sarah James with Piper Sandler. Ma'am, your line is open.","Sarah James","Thank you. Looking at the five year Medicare growth strategy, there's a shift to focus on PPO. Wondering what dynamics changed in the market to make PPO more attractive and why not focus on group given your large national account base. Your peers have had good success on retiree accounts. So why is that not a strategy pursuing?","David Cordani","Sarah, good morning, it's David. So first and foremost, I wouldn't view it as a shift. We didn't go from something and away from something to something. So the individual HMO continues to be a bedrock of the platform and in fact is the major driver of our growth in 2020 as an example of that. We start to add the individual PPO platform to a portfolio invested to do so, stood it up and have the arrangements with the database provider community to be able to offer that. So it's expanding choice and building on a successful platform and track record. And as we both enter new markets and expanding counties, we will make our decisions in terms of individual HMO, individual PPO or both on a go forward basis. We just see it as an end, I mean, natural extension of our portfolio. Additionally, to your important point, we view that the employer marketplace is also a very attractive addressable market. And as you know, our national accounts are broad while performing commercial portfolios of employee relationships presents another opportunity for that. And it's on our growth trajectory. We're just very disciplined as it relates to building the momentum. So going from the proven HMO to adding the PPO, expanding geographies and you should expect us over time to come back and talk with you about the very attractive additional growth opportunities that exist in the employer marketplace for us as well.","Sarah James","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Gary Taylor with JP Morgan. Your line is open, sir.","Gary Taylor","Hi, good morning. Two quick numbers, questions, the first one is to Eric on the 80 basis point impact on the MLR from the HIF recurring next year. Just wondering, when you derive that, do you just presume that on MA there's no impact because there's no explicit growth up there, but just kind of a yes, no question? My other question was on the PBM, so for next year, you've got like 5% at the midpoint pre-tax growth on like 22% script growth. Obviously, the Prime scripts are coming in at breakeven you've told us. We know that the Optum scripts coming over or lower profitability per script. So when we just think about the core and the organic growth in script, should we have Assume that organic EBITDA margins are similar those new organic scripts are coming in at similar margins and in the sort of dilution and profitability per script is purely being driven by Optum and Prime?","Eric Palmer","Hey, Gary its Eric. On the first part of your question, the short answer is yes. I think of that as not having a specific impact in terms of the quantification given there's not a way to specifically build that into how you bid for MA. On the second portion of your question, absolutely the answer is yes. The dynamics you outlined are really the biggest pieces here. When you adjust for the Prime volumes, I mean, you adjust for the Cigna transition volumes. I think of the core aside from those items is being consistent.","Gary Taylor","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open, sir.","Matthew Borsch","Thank you. Can I just ask about the commercial market maybe a little bit about what you're seeing from, I guess what you call your select segment in terms of preference to shift alternate funding away from risk? And you got any sense for how that may be affecting the risk pools. I'm asking the question partly why there's another company that spoke to seeing some deterioration in the remaining underwriting risk.","David Cordani","Matthew its David, so specific to the commercial marketplace and I think you're going into the select segment. Recall that we offer choice in that marketplace. The choice is heavily oriented around a well configured integrated value proposition with the medical, the pharmacies, the behavior of the care management programs, et cetera and building choice around funding options. Today, think about from a new standpoint, it's tracking about 50-50. About 50% of a new business we're writing right now is risk about 50% of it is ASO stop loss plus or minus, and that vacillates in any given year, a little bit more of one a little bit more of the other and we're delighted with that. We're delighted to be able to be in position to offer it in that way. I'd also remind you from prior conversations, one of our friends, when you offer that choices, oftentimes you're literally offering that choice side by side. And it's a good validation for the purchaser, in this case, the client of our conviction to the ASO proposition when you're able to put the guarantee cost side by side. But today, think about it, the new business running about 50-50. And I wouldn't describe any difference we're seeing in terms of your terminology from a response standpoint and performance, it's performing really well for us.","Matthew Borsch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Your line is open, sir.","Josh Raskin","Thanks. Good morning. I'm going to ask a little bit about capital deployment and you're talking about getting your debt to cap under 40% by the end of this year, you've got another 5.3 billion of proceeds from disability in life and 7.5 billion available deployable cash next year. You think about adding all these numbers up, and it's approaching 20% of the market cap. And I understand the priorities. But is there a little bit more urgency from a capital deployment perspective rather than sort of sitting on cash that's diluted to returns? Do you think about more aggressive buybacks? Is there a dividend increase things like that, I'm just curious if you're starting to feel a little bit more pressure in terms of that deployment?","Eric Palmer","Josh its Eric. I appreciate the way you frame that up. Obviously, we're very excited about the capital generation that we've got, the cash flow from operations visibility that we've got for 2020 and into 2021 and that gives us a lot of flexibility. And we've got a really good track record of not to use your word sitting on cash, we will deploy the capital in a way that's effective and aligned with our shareholders interest and such versus just accumulating to be clear, but again, the overall history we've got from a \u2013 track record we've got from a effectiveness of capital deployment and managing our capital coupled up with the visibility and flexibility that we've got coming with the capital available for us is an exciting combination. David, I don't know what else to add that on that.","David Cordani","Just to reinforce Josh and I appreciate your question. Recall from the \u2013 our strategic positioning, pre combination, aided to buy the combination, et cetera. Our ability to generate a significant amount of operating cash flow is a critical competency and we believe the strategic advantage with $9.5 billion in 2019, at least $7.5 billion in 2020 and at least 8.5 billion in 2021, so quite deliberate as Eric said. We note the importance of that responsibility, not something we take lightly, but our effective capital stewardship responsibility will be clear as we go forward and we have tremendous value creation opportunity in front of us right now.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Your line is open, sir.","Lance Wilkes","Great, just had a question on the individual business line and the strategy and appetite in that business going forward. And then maybe also, if you can comment on the SG&A increase in Health Services for the fourth quarter, and maybe what drove that?","David Cordani","Lance, good morning, it's David. I'll take the first question and I'll ask Eric to take the second part of your question. Individual business line, I'm presuming you're referencing the individual exchange. Just to remind everybody the individual exchange marketplace, we took a very focused deliberate posture on that \u2013 in that marketplace in 2014 and has stayed steady within that marketplace systematically, but slowly growing our posture. We're in 10 markets today. Think about the positioning of being in 10 markets highly oriented around leveraging our value based provider relationships. And that marketplace has performed pretty darn well in the last couple of years. Going forward we'll monitor the competitive landscape, but we see the ability to continue to grow that reasonably over time with fair returns. Cornerstone to our value proposition though is ensuring that in those states, we go down to sub MSA level and make sure we're building the value proper the offering around our highest performing physician relationships and getting the requisite alignment with the delivery system and thus far that's performed well for us. And we look forward to year in year out making individual decisions of additional market expansion. Eric, I'll ask you to address the SG&A comment.","Eric Palmer","Yes. Lance its Eric. On the Health Services fourth quarter probably two items to have you think about on that front, one, as we noted throughout both David and my prepared remarks continue to spend to invest in terms of building a new and additional capabilities and such. Additionally, we're spending on facilitating and effectuating the transitions associated with the full reinforcing of the Cigna volumes in the life. The other item, I would just note that we've provided some commentary throughout the year last year around the effect of the transition in client going away since as the volumes that are transitioning clients wound down that added costs back into the core, if you will. And we're well on track to extinguish that as we work through 2020.","Lance Wilkes","Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open, sir.","Peter Costa","Thank you. I like to follow up with \u2013 on Dave's question earlier about margins in Medicare and particular timing of when that'll start to add to your earnings from a perspective of how are you getting the members that you're getting today? Are they coming electronically? Are you setting up broker networks and can you talk a little bit about the channel and how that's going to evolve going forward? And then also in 20 21 with ESRD patients coming on, how do you expect that to impact your margins in the Medicare business?","David Cordani","Peter its David. First, broadly speaking, just to reiterate, we're really pleased with the positioning we have in our existing MSAs and expanding into new markets are individuality to more platform is the lead offering still and the lead part of the growth chassis, aided by the new market entrees as well as the PPO platform. Specifically to your question of how we go-to-market, think about that as an end proposition, so it's a multi-channel approach relative to captive partnered and otherwise and expect that to continue to expand over time. Specific to the margins, as I mentioned to the prior question, the margins we would expect to be at the lower end of the range that we've put out as a long-term range, as we accelerate our growth trajectory over the near term, potentially taking below that having said that, with a growth we would have earnings growth, that that brings along with it. And finally relative ESRD, as we flagged in the past when asked that question, it will be a smaller impact on our aggregate franchise. We will manage the final ESRD posture, MSA by MSA, benefit offering by benefit offering in alignment with our value based physicians. And we will be well positioned to manage that to the extent the final changes transpired is currently proposed from that standpoint. Net-net taken together attractive growth, even at the lower end of the margin range, we will be experiencing earnings expansion while simultaneously investing for growth going forward.","Peter Costa","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open, sir.","Frank Morgan","Thank you, two real quick questions. Any thoughts on last night CMAs proposed rule around 2021 you may rate updates and in any update on the Cigna Anthem litigation. Thanks.","David Cordani","Frank its David. Specific to the rate notice, as you might imagine, we're digesting the detail of a given the magnitude of it. It's the preliminary notice you know the process in terms of getting to the final rate notice. And big picture, I would suggest the aware in macro in line with the aggregation of what that rate notice indicates. And when we think about the posture that rate notice, the expansion of our shores proposition for 2021 will be in good shape for 2021. More to follow, but big picture, our impact is broadly speaking in line with what the rate notice speaks to. And as it relates to the \u2013 you asked specifically about the Cigna Anthem litigation that is on course to resolve itself by the end of this calendar month.","Frank Morgan","Any other color you can hear on that? What gives you confidence it would be wrapped up this month and will that result in a settlement payment?","David Cordani","Probably in specificity relative to litigation other than I would reinforce, we feel very strong about our position relative to our contractual responsibility and contractual ability to collect a break fee and the court is on is on track to resolve that by the end of this calendar month.","Frank Morgan","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Our next question is from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open.","George Hill","Good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the question. I guess Dave you talked a lot about the partnership strategy and maybe digging a little bit more into Prime \u2013 the Prime deal. I guess, can you talk about the network component of it? And I guess where you guys see the most significant points of operating leverage that deliver through to earnings beyond 2020? Is it more on the rebate side or is it more on the network side? And kind of can you talk a little bit about the strength that each side brought to the relationship?","David Cordani","Yeah, I'm not going to go through the micro pieces of the components of the relationship, but I'd rather just reframe what we're trying to achieve together. This is a wonderful example of two organizations identifying philosophical alignment and strategic alignment and then pursuing leverage that results in additional value for customers and clients. That's the end of and the net- net of this, which is improved affordability, potentially improved coordinated access and then clinical program leverage on a go forward basis. We will continue to work with Prime in terms of the best ways in which we could add additional value for them. There's 28 million individual relationships that \u2013 or customers and members that are within the Prime relationship and we'll be guided by the components that they feel we can create the most value for will make value added suggestions and evolve that over time, all with the objective of creating more value for their members and clients and therefore getting some benefit for Cigna as well over time. So we're delighted with it. It's another validation of our ability to work with other likeminded partners to create mutual value.","George Hill","Maybe a quick follow up then, how do we think about you guys effectively strengthening a competitor at the margin or kind of enabling their competition against you in the PBM business?","David Cordani","I appreciate the question. We think about it the exact opposite way. It's a dynamic marketplace and those who create the most valuable win, those who try to preserve or regress to control value will lose over time. So big picture, we're more oriented around a perpetual innovation cycle and continue to drive more value. And we like to do that with others and create mutual value. We have a long track record, the legacy of the ESI [ph] has that, the legacy of Cigna has that and we're fueling more of it. So this is an opportunity to create more value for 28 million more customers starting in 2020, and further improve affordability and further improve quality from that standpoint, that's a great outcome. Each organization has to continue to innovate. Each organization has to deliver value and there's ample growth opportunity in front of both organizations going forward and we'll align to mutually identify beneficial opportunities for both organizations to grow. But the cornerstone is innovation and more value delivery. So we view it as upside not downside.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, sir.","Ricky Goldwasser","Yeah. Hi, good morning. As we start thinking about a 2021 selling season for the PBM business, can you give us some sense of the size of the book that's up for renewal? And also any order? What's the size of the opportunities you're seeing that's up in the market from the other PBMs? And then my second question is on the MA growth guidance, obviously, you came in \u2013 the guidance you base in January was ahead of your initial goal that these near term goals, so maybe you can share with us what really resonated in the marketplace and what do you think drove the above expectations, performance or at least it materializing earlier?","David Cordani","Ricky, good morning, its David, specific to the 2021 PBM selling season break that up as new components, health plan relationships, corporate relationships, as we sit here today, they help find relationships as you would expect and draw close your completion sooner given the size, shape and scope of those relationships. They're substantially completed through the renewal cycle and we feel great about the outcome. So that would be the picture I give you for 2021, continued trends from that standpoint. The corporate part of the relationships are getting into full steam right now. We think we're going to have another very good year from that standpoint and our value proposition is resonating very well in the marketplace, specifically relative to our value proposition and some of the new innovations that we put into the marketplace, be it the patient assurance program, be it health connect 360, et cetera.","Put a circle around it in aggregate, think about the size of the book moving or up to move about from a normal standpoint. As it relates to Medicare Advantage, pleased that you're calling out the fact that a bit ahead of the market we put down before, remind you we said 10% to 15% on average over time, we said in our first year, we were expected to be at the lower end of the range as we were stepping into that new result. There's no one driver, what moves us to the 13% to 16%, I would call out a bit higher retention. So what we had initially put into our projection our retentions even higher, we love that. And as I noted in my prepared remarks, we're sitting in an MPS right now, just in excess of 70 across the aggregate book of business that we have and the vast majority of our customers in this space are in value based arrangement. So I wouldn't call it anything else. My existing platforms drove the majority of it, our new markets contributed, and we had a bit higher retention rate.","Ricky Goldwasser","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Your line is open, sir.","Scott Fidel","Hi, guys. Good morning. Question just on hospital volumes and there's been a little bit of debate on whether those have been picking up or not over the course of the year and just interested from your perspective across both the commercial and Medicare books, what you saw in terms of hospital volumes in the fourth quarter and how those trended relative to your expectations.","Eric Palmer","Hey Scott its Eric. Overall, nothing that I would call out as particularly notable, we finished the year with the trends of above 4%, which is right in the middle of our expectations. So there's nothing that I would call out as a particular change in trajectory in either the commercial or in the government business.","Scott Fidel","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Your line is open, sir.","Steven Valiquette","All right, great. Thanks and good morning, Dave and Eric. Thanks for taking the question. So I have two just somewhat interrelated questions on pharmacy? And I guess first, are you able to provide a little more color on your drug procurement strategy going forward for the PBM mail order operations? It's from some conjecture that you may be changing one of your buying group relationships. I'm not sure if you able to comment on that or not. And then secondarily in pharmacy for the 3.5% to 4.5% commercial medical cost trend that you're expecting for 2020. Are you able to discuss whether this includes any incremental pharmacy savings and maybe a lower pharmacy trend this year versus prior years, which obviously may be tied to further integration? Thanks.","David Cordani","Good morning, it's David. I'll take the first question and I'll ask Eric to take the second question. We don't get into individual actions we're taking relative to our supply chain or procurement strategy. I would just step back and say we have a broad portfolio of tools, solutions and capabilities. And we're going to continue to dynamically manage those to get the best possible value for existing and prospective customers and clients going forward. Beyond that, we're not going to comment on any individual actions we're taking in the supply chain activity. Eric, could you comment on the trend.","Eric Palmer","Yeah, Steve on the trend, we've had pharmacy trend in that low to mid-single digits range for some time now, I mean, that would be the expectation we'd have going into 2020 as well. Just to remind you Express Scripts delivered in 2018 a 0.4% commercial trend. We're publishing our Express Scripts client or trends report later this month, and expect another really attractive result there. But to begin, nothing else I would call out.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Our last question will be from Charles Rhyee - Cowen. Your line is open.","Charles Rhyee","Yeah. Hey, thanks for squeezing me in here. Maybe I can ask about \u2013 you look at the chart here in your presentation. And obviously, over the last 10 years you've really driven your medical cost trend down. And you're guiding 3.5% to 4.5%. If I'm not mistaken, that's sort of same range you gave last year. I know you've talked about trying to get towards CPI, anything in the short-term that might be keeping you in this range. Can you talk about what are the factors that you're seeing that's going to help you to get lower from here and sort of how we should think about the pacing of that? Thanks.","David Cordani","Charles good morning, first to your point, we're delighted with the fact that we have seven years now going into a plus in terms of delivering the lowest medical cost trend in the industry. And our clients and customers benefit from that immediately, especially given the profile of our business highly ASO oriented from that standpoint and will continue to drive exceptional value for our clients and customers. Two, I appreciate you calling out the CPI level goal and objective. A couple of years ago we put forth a strategic objective which said we strive to deliver a level of medical cost trend approximating CPI by 2021. We view that is indicative of a sustainable trend that the system and society could tolerate and manage on a go forward basis and indicative of a responsible trend. I would note that today we feel like we're well on our way to that journey.","And I would underscore that with the fact that many of our clients today who have established relationships with us and are leveraging our most advanced consumer engagement, health improvement and value based relationships are benefiting from CPI or better trend from that standpoint. So there's a toolkit we have that will continue to innovate and evolve around how do we get engagement in support of the consumer in the life journey? How do we evolve the precision and speed of the health improvement programs, especially as we continue to expand in the whole person health arena on an accelerated basis with our market leading behavioral health and pharmacy capabilities? And then just further deepening the activation of value based care delivery platforms that we have in the marketplace and we're already able to deliver as I indicated, CPI are better for many of our clients. We're going to see \u2013 further expand that in 2020 and beyond. I appreciate your question.","Operator","Thank you for your question. I will now turn the conference over to David Cordani for closing remarks.","David Cordani","Thank you. To wrap up, I'd like to highlight just a few key points from today's conversation. First, to remind your Cigna delivered exceptional full year 2019 financial results across our four growth platforms led by Health Services and Integrated Medical segments. We exceeded the guidance we had already raised each quarter for 2019 for revenue, earnings and EPS as well as for cash flow from operations. Looking forward, our 2019 performance gives us considerable momentum for attractive growth in 2020 and beyond. In 2020, we will continue to drive significant growth in customer relationships, revenue, earnings, EPS, as well as continued strong operating cash flow.","We are on track to complete our integration activities associated with our combination with Express Scripts over the next year. We expect to close the sale of our group disability life business to New York Life in the third quarter. We're on track to return our balance sheet to normalized levels and debt and be in a position to provide exceptional strategic financial flexibility moving forward, just as we committed to when we announced our combination two years ago. And we're well positioned to drive attractive growth beyond 2020 and on track to deliver our 2021 EPS target of $20 to $21 per share. We thank you for joining our call today and we look forward to our future conversations.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Cigna's fourth quarter 2019 results review.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the question-and-answer session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Ted Detrick. Please go ahead, Mr. Detrick.","Edwin J. Detrick","Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining today's call. I'm Ted Detrick, Vice President of Investor Relations, and with me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom McCarthy, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer.","In our remarks today, David will begin by commenting on Cigna's second quarter 2013 results and how our broad portfolio of differentiated solutions creates value for our customers and clients as well as provides us with several options for business growth in 2014 and beyond. Next, Tom will review the financial results for the second quarter and provide our -- an update on Cigna's financial outlook for 2013. We will then open the lines for your questions. And following our question-and-answer session, David will provide some brief closing remarks before we end the call.","Now as noted in our earnings release, Cigna uses certain financial measures, which are not determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP when describing its financial results. Specifically, we use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and earnings per share on a same basis as the principal measures of performance for Cigna and our operating segments, and a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com.","Now in our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking comments. We would remind you that there are risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations, and those risk factors are discussed in today's earnings release. Now before I turn the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our results and disclosures.","Regarding our results, I would note that in the second quarter, we recorded an after-tax charge of $24 million or $0.08 per share related to transaction costs associated with the previously announced pharmacy benefits arrangements with Catamaran, and we reported the charge as a special item. I would remind you that special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations in today's discussion of our second quarter 2013 results and our full year 2013 outlook.","Regarding our disclosures, our GAAP cash flow statement explicitly discloses in cash flows from operating activity the amount paid to Berkshire Hathaway in connection with our exit of the Run-off Reinsurance businesses. Adjusting for this onetime payment, which we view as a cost to dispose of the Run-off businesses, operating cash flows for our ongoing businesses are $803 million in the quarter, representing 1.6x our adjusted income from operations.","And finally, please note that when we discuss our full year 2013 outlook, it will be on the basis of adjusted income from operations, and this outlook excludes the effects of any future capital deployment.","And with that, I will turn it over to David.","David M. Cordani","Thanks, Ted, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll briefly review highlights of the second quarter earnings performance. And then I'll discuss the current trends and opportunities we see in the global marketplace. And I'll address how our ongoing investments, coupled with execution of our focus strategy of Go Deep, Go Global and Go Individual, continues to position Cigna to deliver attractive results in a dynamic and disrupted global environment.","Moving to the quarter, we delivered strong second quarter results in each of Cigna's ongoing businesses. Our second quarter consolidated revenue increased by 8% to $8 billion. We reported adjusted income from operations of $512 million or $1.78 per share, which represents a per share increase of 19% over the second quarter of 2012.","Relative to each of our businesses, our Global Health Care business delivered strong performance across all of our markets. We continue to deliver high-quality medical outcomes and competitively attractive medical costs that directly benefit our customers and clients.","Within the Global Health Care business, our U.S. Seniors business remains well positioned to deliver value and innovative solutions to our Cigna HealthSpring customers over the long term. We delivered substantial revenue and earnings growth in our Global Supplemental Benefits business, driven by recent acquisitions, ongoing organic growth and our ability to leverage our differentiated distribution capabilities.","And our Group Disability and Life business had strong results as we continue to create value for our clients and customers through our productivity and return-to-work programs.","Our performance across the board underscores our focus on creating enduring value for our customers and clients and our ability to provide sustained, attractive results for our shareholders.","Now moving to the environment and outlook. To date, by effectively executing our strategy, we have positioned Cigna to win in a rapidly changing marketplace. Looking to the future, the global forces of change include well-documented disruptions that stem from economic, demographic, legislative and regulatory forces, most notably defined by an aging population, a rapidly growing middle class, rising instances of chronic disease and affordability and access challenges for systems around the world, including the U.S. where we have an evolving health care system, which is confronting changing reimbursement levels and approaches and adapting to new exchange marketplaces. All of these forces put additional pressure on the government, employer groups and individuals that purchase products and services as well as those who deliver and coordinate those services.","As we've discussed before, we are sharply focused on evolving our solutions to deliver differentiated value and on making ongoing targeted investments to ensure we are well positioned for sustained growth. Categories are -- of our investments include enhancements to our portfolio of innovative solutions and tools, advancing programs designed to effectively connect with the evolving retail customer markets and making further progress in establishing ourselves in important new geographies.","I'll provide just a few examples of the strategic investments and improvements we continue to make for the benefit of our customers, clients as well as our shareholders. Relative to the expansion of our portfolio of PDM solutions during the quarter, we announced our long-term strategic partnering agreement with Catamaran to advance our pharmacy solutions. A unique partnership will enable our customers and clients to realize greater value through further improvements to clinical integration across medical care as well as pharmacy services, enhanced program affordability and leading technology that will accelerate innovation and customized solutions.","Relative to customer technology solutions, our customer navigation tools continue to expand. Today, we average more than 1.2 million monthly visitors to our myCigna customer website. Nearly 0.5 million of these visits are from customers researching costs and quality information for doctors, specialists, hospitals and specific medical procedures. These tools help our customers engage, get information and make more informed, personalized decisions.","Relative to our geographic expansions, in the second quarter, we expanded the reach of our Global Supplemental business with the continued rollout of new individual Medicare supplemental products in the U.S. This new product was released in an additional 17 states and as of today, is available in 35 states. In Turkey, since partnering with Finansbank in November of last year, we are now beginning to see encouraging results that are accelerating our ability to offer new solutions to support growth in this important and attractive market.","On the physician and health care delivery front, the American Medical Association's National Health Insurer Report Card ranks Cigna highest among the 7 leading commercial insurers for its low physician-related administrative costs, demonstrating our continued investment in efficiencies that make it easier for our physician partners to work with us and focus on caring for their patients.","We're also pleased with the ongoing expansion of our Collaborative Accountable Care or CAC relationships. Since forming the first of our CACs in 2008, we have delivered differentiated value relative to our triple aim, which is to improve clinical quality, customer satisfaction and affordability. We continue to expand our CACs and now combined with the customers of Cigna HealthSpring physician engagement model, we currently support more than 1 million customers in these collaborative models.","In our more mature CACs, we are seeing improvements in medical costs and care quality, which exceeds the market averages, driven in part by implementation of embedded care-coordinating programs where our nurses build relationships with our physician partners to help to coordinate the care programs for our customers. By way of a specific example, at a recent ACO summit designed to share best practices, our CAC partner, Jackson Clinic in western Tennessee, shared its success in improving medical cost trend by nearly 5% while further improving quality.","Our success included reducing by 50% the number of emergency room visits by frequent ER utilizers, driving over a 20% improvement in compliance rates for diabetic measures and 50% better compliance for adolescent well care.","So to summarize, we continue to make targeted investments in our platform of solutions, capability for an evolving retail market and expanding into new geographies, all to position us for sustained growth in the future.","Now before addressing the balance of 2013 and touching on 2014, I want to offer a brief overview of our long-term outlook. Over the next 3 to 5 years, we continue to expect to deliver 10% to 13% EPS growth on average. As noted earlier in my remarks, we've executed our strategy to position Cigna with differentiated capability in attractive markets, including U.S. Health, U.S. Seniors, Global Employer, Group Disability and Life and Global Individual businesses.","In U.S. Health, we'll continue to focus on employers who value incentive- and engagement-based programs, and we'll seek to further leverage our transparent and aligned funding capabilities. For U.S. Seniors, where 10,000 people are aging into Medicare every day, Cigna's differentiated physician partnership model positions us to excel over the long term. In the Global Employer market, we have the largest network of health care professionals in the world and are well positioned to continue to meet the needs of the growing globally mobile population.","In Group Disability and Life, our business remains focused on improving productivity and presenteeism for the benefit of our clients and customers. And the Global Individual business will continue to leverage our leading marketing and distribution capabilities, which will enable us to meet the expanding needs of the growing global middle class.","Taken as a whole, we continue to see attractive growth outlook for Cigna over the long term.","Now stepping back to 2013 and 2014. We have increased our outlook for 2013 again this quarter. The strength of our second quarter and our track record of effective execution of our strategy gives me confidence that we will achieve our full year outlook.","Further, our broad portfolio of products with differentiated capabilities, position in global markets with attractive growth potential gives us confidence that we will deliver competitively attractive revenue and earnings performance in 2014.","And now to briefly summarize before turning it over to Tom, we're pleased with our strong second quarter results. They reinforce consistent, effective execution of our Go Deep, Go Global, and Go Individual strategy, which guides our 35,000-plus Cigna colleagues around the world who work each and every day to help our customers. The combination of our clear strategy, consistent execution, outstanding team and sustained investments and capabilities positions us well to deliver competitively attractive results for the remainder of 2013 and beyond.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas A. McCarthy","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will review Cigna's second quarter 2013 results and provide an update to our full year outlook. The quarter was highlighted by a few key accomplishments, specifically, revenue and earnings growth across each of our operating segments; the announcement of our strategic arrangement with Catamaran to enhance our successful pharmacy business; and quarterly earnings per share of $1.78, representing growth of 19% over second quarter 2012.","The quarter also benefited from favorable development in medical costs and disability reserves. Overall, this quarter is another example of the effective execution of our focus strategy and demonstrates the strong fundamentals of each of our operating businesses. The strength of these results provides us with good momentum and confidence to increase our full year financial outlook in 2013.","Now moving to some specifics. Second quarter consolidated revenues grew 8% over prior year to $8 billion, driven by growth in our targeted market segments. Second quarter consolidated earnings were $512 million, representing 18% growth over second quarter 2012.","Regarding the segments, I will first comment on our Global Health Care segment. Overall, Global Health Care results were strong, particularly for our Commercial business. Second quarter premiums and fees grew 5% to $5.7 billion, reflecting strong contributions from both our Commercial and Seniors businesses. We ended the second quarter 2013 with 14.3 million medical customers, representing year-to-date growth of 241,000 customers or 2% over year end 2012. Second quarter earnings in Global Health Care increased 10% to $403 million and were driven by favorable medical costs, strong revenue growth in specialty contribution and operating expense efficiencies.","Turning now to medical costs. We continue to deliver attractive medical costs and clinical quality for our clients and customers. Medical costs also reflect the continued low utilization trend. As a reminder, given that nearly 85% of our U.S. Commercial customers are in ASO funding arrangements, our clients directly benefit from these favorable medical cost results.","Regarding medical care ratios, in our U.S. Commercial guaranteed cost business, our second quarter 2013 medical care ratio or MCR was 78.7% on a reported basis or 79.5% excluding prior year reserve development. In our Seniors business, our second quarter MCR for Medicare Advantage was 82.9% on a reported basis or 83.3% excluding prior year reserve development.","Across our Commercial and Seniors risk businesses, our second quarter earnings included favorable prior year reserve development of $20 million after tax compared to $17 million after tax in second quarter 2012. We are pleased with the results of our medical risk businesses as they continue to reflect both a strong pricing, and disciplined underwriting approach and continued effective medical management and physician engagement.","Moving to operating expenses. For the second quarter 2013, the total Global Health Care operating expense ratio was 21.7%. This ratio has improved over time, reflecting our ongoing commitment to drive expense efficiency while maintaining strong service levels and continued funding of strategic investments. To recap, we had a strong quarter in our Global Health Care business on all key metrics.","Now we'll discuss the results of our Global Supplemental Benefits business, which continues to deliver attractive growth and profitability. Premiums and fees grew 35% quarter-over-quarter to $613 million, driven by contributions from our recent acquisitions, most notably Great American Supplemental Benefits and our Turkey joint venture as well as strong customer retention and business growth, primarily from South Korea.","Second quarter earnings in our Global Supplemental Benefits business were $49 million, representing a substantial increase over a depressed second quarter 2012. For Group Disability and Life, second quarter results were very strong. Group premium and fees increased 10% over the second quarter of 2012 to $846 million, and second quarter earnings in our Group business were $104 million. The quarter's earnings included favorable claims experienced in the disability book, partially offset by unfavorable life claims.","The quarter also included a $27 million after-tax favorable impact from a reserve study on our Group Disability business, which compares with a $35 million favorable impact from a similar study in second quarter 2012 and a $14 million after-tax favorable impact related to a higher discount rate for reserves as a result of the transfer into the Group Disability portfolio of higher-yielding assets previously supporting our Run-off Reinsurance business.","Results for our remaining operations totaled to an after-tax loss of $44 million for the second quarter of 2013, which is primarily interest expense in the Corporate segment.","Turning to our investment portfolio, we are pleased with our results in the second quarter. Our commercial mortgage loan portfolio is performing well. During the quarter, we completed our annual review of our $2.6 billion mortgage loan portfolio, which indicated that there has been an improvement in the average loan-to-value ratio to 64% as well as improvement in the average debt service coverage ratios.","Our strong investment management capabilities, diversification of our investment portfolio and our disciplined approach to risk management continued to deliver solid results.","Overall, as a result of the continued effective execution of our strategy, our second quarter results reflect strong revenue and earnings contributions from each on our ongoing businesses, as well as significant free cash flow.","Now I will discuss our full year 2013 outlook. We now expect consolidated revenues to grow in the range of 9% to 11% over 2012. Based on the strength of our second quarter results, we now expect full year 2013 consolidated adjusted income from operations of approximately $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. This range is higher than our previous expectations and reflects strong underlying results in all of our businesses.","We now expect full year earnings per share in the range of $6.25 to $6.65 per share, which is an improvement of $0.20 to $0.25 per share over our previous expectations. Consistent with prior practices, our outlook excludes any contribution from additional capital deployment.","I will now discuss the components of our 2013 outlook, starting with Global Health Care. We now expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of approximately $1.5 billion to $1.57 billion, an increase of $50 million [ph] to $30 million. This increased outlook for Global Health Care primarily reflects second quarter favorable prior year reserve development and favorable medical costs with overall low utilization relative to expectations.","I'll now summarize some of the key assumptions reflected in our Global Health Care earnings outlook for 2013, starting with our customer base. Regarding global medical customers, we continue to expect full year 2013 customer growth of approximately 1% to 2%. Relative to medical costs, for our total U.S. Commercial book of business, we now expect full year medical cost trend to be in the range of 5% to 6%, which is 100 basis points lower than our prior guidance. We now expect the 2013 medical care ratio to be in the range of 81.5% to 82.5% for our U.S. Commercial guaranteed cost book of business, which is 100 basis points lower than our previous expectations. For our Seniors business, we continue to expect our Medicare Advantage MCR for 2013 to be in the range of 82% to 83%.","Turning to operating expenses. We expect our total Global Health Care operating expense ratio to improve approximately 50 basis points over 2012's full year ratio of 22.6%.","Now moving to the other components of the outlook. For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we expect continued strong top line growth and now expect earnings in the range of $180 million to $200 million, which is an increase of $20 million from our previous expectations and represents earning growth of 22% to 35% relative to full year 2012.","Relative to operating expenses in Global Supplemental, we expect to increase our investment and product distribution and geographic expansion to support growth in this segment during the balance of the year.","Regarding the Group Disability and Life business, we now expect full year 2013 earnings in the range of $280 million to $300 million, an increase of $10 million over our previous expectations.","Regarding our remaining operations, we now expect a loss of $165 million in 2013.","So all in, for full year 2013, we have increased our outlook for consolidated adjusted income from operations to a range of approximately $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion or $6.25 to $6.65 per share. I would also highlight a number of items reflected in our outlook that impact our earnings pattern in the second half of the year relative to the first half, including the absence of favorable first half prior year reserve development and an increase -- an expected increase in strategic spending in third and fourth quarter on Global Health Care and additional spending to support growth in our global supplemental business.","Finally, while the net earnings impact of the Catamaran arrangement is expected to be immaterial in 2013, there is a lag in the timing of the incremental pharmacy savings benefits relative to the transition cost spending between the third and the fourth quarter of 2013. This pattern of transition cost spending and other strategic spending could dampen third quarter earnings by $0.10 to $0.15 per share.","Now moving to our 2013 capital management position and outlook. Overall, we continue to have good financial flexibility. Our subsidiaries remain well capitalized and are generating significant free cash flow to the parent, with strong return on capital in each of our ongoing businesses.","We ended the quarter with parent company cash of approximately $575 million. During the period May 2 to July 31, we repurchased 3.3 million shares of Cigna's common stock for approximately $250 million. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 7.2 million shares of stock for approximately $500 million.","After considering all sources of parent company cash and setting aside $250 million to meet liquidity needs, we now expect to have approximately $1 billion available for cash -- capital deployment during the balance of the year.","Overall, our capital position and updated outlook are strong and reflects the underlying performance of our operating segments, and our capital deployment strategies and priorities remain unchanged.","Now to recap, our second quarter 2013 consolidated results reflect the strength of our global portfolio of businesses and a continued track record of effective execution of our focus strategy. The fundamentals in our business remained strong as evidenced by our second quarter results, which reflected attractive growth in revenue and earnings in each of our ongoing businesses to finalization of the strategic pharmacy benefits arrangement to deliver market-leading value to customers and continued targeted strategic investments, which will enable sustained growth into the future.","Based on the strength of these results, we are confident in our ability to achieve our increased full year 2013 earnings outlook.","With that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just want to start with the guidance just to understand a little bit better. You've done sort of $3.50 in earnings in the first half. Kind of implies a $2.75 to $3.15 type range for the second half. I know you did $3.25 last year. I think in previous calls, you had suggested that second half was actually expected to be stronger than first half at least within the Global Health. So I know you provided some color, but anything incremental to help us bridge that gap in terms of earnings being down compared to kind of sizable first half growth?","Thomas A. McCarthy","Ralph, it's Tom. Well, the first place I'd start is we're really pleased with the results in the first half of the year. So I mean, again, based on those strong results, we have increased our guidance. As far as thinking about how the year progresses, the growth in placing dynamics are largely locked in for the balance of the year. We've got some normal pluses and even minus in the second half. We've got expected strength in PDP. We've got some pressure from high deductible claim costs for the last half of the year. We also are anticipating favorable reserve development or disability reserve starting to impact us in the second half of the year. So all that factored in, combined with the anticipated increase in strategic spending, leads us to believe that our full year outlook looks pretty reasonable.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Have you quantified the strategic spending amount?","Thomas A. McCarthy","We really haven't. We're talking about some ramp-up in telemarketing or affinity partner relationships in our Supplemental Benefit business, some additional capabilities to support customer engagement in the U.S., but we really haven't quantified that for you.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just my follow-up. Any updated thoughts on the ASO business? Obviously, you've had good growth there over the last kind of couple of years, particularly moving downstream. I guess any thoughts on the competitive landscape? Are you seeing any more pressure there. And then I guess, in your conversations with employers, do you get a sense of any greater shift beyond the norm into 2014?","David M. Cordani","Ralph, it's David. I would say macro, no seismic shift. Broadly, continued elevation and interest in what we call the more transparent funding mechanisms, and ASO is highly transparent. So a continuation of that progress. As you know, greater than 80% of our total portfolio is in ASO, and the reason why we believe you see more interest in it is the alignment of incentives. So we're able to get the transparency with the employer as they're trying to get a more engaged wellness preventative care model with their employees, and it works in a very positive way. And we're seeing that traction throughout all of our segments. On a final note, you said down market, so our Select Segment targets employers with 51 to 250 employees. We continue to see great progress there as employers are seeing this as an attractive alternative.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","What about the competitive landscape?","David M. Cordani","I would say no broad change in the competitive landscape. From a pricing standpoint, maybe a little bit more competitive activity as some competitors who previously had not had ASO or self-funded down market beginning to explore those opportunities, which we expected to transpire as that market unfolds.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","First question is on -- David I think you said 2014, you're expecting competitively attractive revenue and earnings growth. So is that just mean relative to your peers or do you expect absolute earnings growth next year? And maybe within that, following up on the last question, would you expect ASO national account membership to be up or down to start next year?","David M. Cordani","Josh, it's David. Two points. Relative to 2014, we have not provided 2014 outlook or guidance, so we're not providing you specifics. You did hear me correctly in that we continue to indicate that we expect, because of the diversity and performance of our portfolio, that our 2014 results will be competitively attractive for both revenue and earnings. But we have not yet provided specific outlook and guidance. The reason why we expect that competitive attractive result is both the consistency of our execution and the positioning of our businesses that had very attractive growth outlooks, such as our global portfolio of businesses, such as our U.S. health care portfolio of business focused in on the ASO and the more transparent funding mechanisms. As it relates to the second part of your question, for U.S. national accounts, at this point in time, that's the part of the portfolio we have reasonable visibility into. So let me give you a little color there. First and foremost, we define that segment differently than the competition. So we define that segment as commercial employers with a 5,000 or more employees that are multistate. Our definition tends to define it more narrowly. Within that portfolio, as we've consistently talked with you about over the last several years, that defined employer group has net shrinkage in the employment base of 1% to 2% and has had because of economic environment. So let me give you a little color. From an RFP standpoint, our RFP volume for 2014 was down a bit relative to 2013 as we see more employers trying to assess the health care reform. Second piece of interest, we have the same amount of finalist meetings to attend in -- for 2014 as we did for 2013. So you can conclude that the quality of the RFPs or the alignment with our value proposition was high. Third, the percentage of our book of business that was out to bid for 2014 was also a little lower than in 2013. So taken as a whole, while not complete yet, as we look to 2014 for national accounts, we'd expect that customer and client retention level could be up somewhat to have a reasonable net sales outcome and then to have a net membership performance that's on or about the national average of that segment. So think anywhere from minus 1, minus 2, up to plus 1 from a range standpoint, which is where we've strategically targeted that portfolio of business to perform.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's perfect. That makes sense. You're seeing a little less activity, I guess, just broadly in front of reform. And then maybe on Cigna 2014 on the Medicare Advantage front, I'm just curious -- I'm guessing just based on your footprint and model that there's probably not going to be a lot of market exits. I'd be surprised if there were. But I'm curious if you're anticipating any market exits from competitors in some of your markets. You tend to be a little bit more rural. And wondering if we should be thinking about a period similar to sort of the early 2000s after the BBA where HealthSpring was a net share gainer in a meaningful way as competitors had trouble sort of keeping up. Is that consistent with what you're expecting or what you're seeing already?","David M. Cordani","Josh, it's David. Time will tell. Well, we don't have to wait very long to get into the fall cycle to have clarity in terms of what that looks like. But first and foremost, stepping back, as we look to 2014 and as we talked about before, make no doubt, the environment is a disruptive environment. That will impact both product offerings, price points and product offerings, market positions of competitors, including ourselves and unfortunately, some disruptions for Seniors. We're seeking to minimize that for the benefit of our customers. Secondly, our expectations are unequivocally to grow our customer base further in 2014 as we focus on our continued Go Deep strategy in those respective markets. Specific to your point, we will have some targeted market exits. It will be small. Think about -- right now, we're thinking about that maybe 2% to 3% of our underlying covered lives. And lastly to your point, we expect for both '14 as well as '15, there'll be some disruptions that's triggered from market exit as the -- as this product line gets constrained based on the federal government policy. And we think that creates net opportunity for us relative to our level of focus.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First question. Just interested now that you have over a year of integration booked with the HealthSpring and looking for around $1 billion of deployable capital in the back half of the year, just interested in your updated thoughts on M&A at this point and whether you're honing in on any opportunities, either domestically or internationally. Or do you think that capital deployment would be more biased towards share repurchases looking out over, let's say, 6 to 9 months?","David M. Cordani","It's David. So first at the macro level, our capital deployment priorities have not changed. And just as a quick reminder, our number one objective is to make sure the underlying portfolio of businesses are appropriately sourced and capitalized and we run a well-capitalized business and subsidiary environment. Second then is to evaluate and pursue, on a targeted basis, attractive M&A opportunities. And third is to return excess capital to our shareholders. Specific to your point, on our M&A priorities, broadly speaking, our priority targets, the categories of our targets, broadly speaking haven't changed. We continue to be open to targeted opportunities that will further expand our already very attractive global portfolio. Secondly, opportunistic relative to further expansion of our Seniors footprint, including capabilities that may assist us in the emerging duals marketplace. And then finally, point 3 is expanding our retail, we call it not individual but retail-based portfolio of capabilities. So we're open to that. And we have platforms with which to integrate. As Tom pointed on in his prepared remarks, the continued strength of our operating execution positions us with a very healthy amount of free cash flow for deployment this year and for consideration and we would expect to continue that strength of operations as we go forward. But the headline here is no change in capital deployment priorities.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Then just a follow-up question, just would be interested in sort of update on the environment for the International businesses. Looks like performance remained very strong in the second quarter as measured by the Global Supplement (sic) [Global Supplemental Benefits] business, in particular, but clearly there's been some slowdown in some of the economies in emerging markets and in China. And just interested if you're seeing any impact on demand from some of the international economic slowdown or do you continue to see continued stable and strong demand for your products.","David M. Cordani","Scott, it's David again. So 2 specific businesses as you know, we operate under a global notion. First and foremost, and I'll comment on the specific question in a second, what we call the globally mobile population. So comprehensive products and solutions offered to corporations, IGOs, NGOs and then on a targeted basis, high net worth individuals who want a very comprehensive high service coverage around the globe. We see continued demand in opportunity around that. And as I referenced in my prepared remarks, we're able to leverage the broadest and largest delivery system portfolio in the world, our multicultural service environment and multicultural clinical management environment and we see continued growth opportunities. Specific to the business you referenced, our Global Supplemental Benefits business, you're correct, the global economy is challenged and we expect will be challenged. Our model has us focused on both emerging and recently, established middle class. The outlook in our targeted markets there is quite attractive relative to the underlying economy. Second point is key to our success is continued innovation of our products. So understanding the needs of that population and innovating both products and distribution channel to match those needs. And the headline here is we continue to see a very attractive outlook in our targeted geographies, whether they be emerging, developing or developed countries for those targeted supplemental benefits.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And, Dave, would you just remind us within that just flagging how the startup of the Turkey operations is progressing so far.","David M. Cordani","Sure. And I see down sneaking your third question. Turkey is a very attractive market, Scott, as you look at the just macro makeup of that market. We did a 2-step there. We started with an initiation of an organic footprint and then we're able to have great opportunity for a joint venture with Finansbank. I mentioned it briefly in my prepared remarks, but we're very pleased with the first year progress there. We're quite pleased with the first year progress there. That joint venture helps us accelerate an organic path very significantly and begin to accelerate innovation of new products and services. So early -- so we're always cautious in the early cycle, but growing and profitable with some very attractive opportunities for growth. And the last comment I would add there is that government continues to be a bit innovative relative to making sure there are evolving policies to assist what the population needs. So we have a positive outlook for that market.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christine Arnold with Cowen.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Could you update us on efforts at the NAIC, CMS and other reports we've recently seen limiting small group's ability to self-insure and how that might impact you going forward?","David M. Cordani","It's David. So I think as you're going at the self-insured question for small group specifically then you're going at the self insurance and the self insurance is cohabitating with stop loss or catastrophic cover.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Exactly. They're trying to limit the attachment points.","David M. Cordani","Yes. Specifically, state activities, NAIC activities, we continue to be highly and actively engaged on both work streams. As you know, that's a core part of what we do across multiple business segments. A couple of headlines. One, high support for and a very vocal movement amongst employers to ensure that those products and those services remain in the marketplace because they're offering significant value and enabling employers to have aligned incentives and see meaningful movement and progress around preventing wellness engagement and therefore, improvements in health productivity and overall costs, that's point one. Two is, from a Cigna standpoint, I'd ask you to remember that, when you think about small employer, or commonly defined as under 50, think about us as having a de minimis population there. And thinking about that as a nontarget. So well less than 100,000 lives, and when I mean well less than 100,000 lives so that is that a target segment for us. So headline, highly engaged in the conversation to make sure you're eliminating how the programs work when responsibly and effectively designed. Two, a very active voice from the employer landscape demonstrating the value. And three, from an under 50 life or the small employer life, that is not a target business for Cigna going forward.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then follow up, ASO yields looked a little bit light this quarter. Was there some one-timers or some unusual things going on there that we should be thinking about?","Thomas A. McCarthy","Christine, it's Tom. I think of that just as normal variability, nothing particular to point out.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. I guess, this may not be a completely fair question for you, but it just feels to me like the tone from the companies around MA for next year although everyone's still acknowledges the disruption that the rates are going to create, it seems that the tone has gotten a whole lot better over the last few months. Is there anything in particular as you evaluated the rates and your ability to respond to the rates that makes you feel a little bit better about your positioning and your ability to say that, with confidence, you're going to be able to grow membership next year? And any initial thoughts about the ability to maintain profitability while growing that membership next year?","David M. Cordani","Yes. This is David. So just a couple of different points in there: one, just coming back to our macro point, from our point of view, is and will be a disruptive environment; two, our orientation around both our Go Deep geographic focus -- so what Cigna's historical orientation around that and HealthSpring's historical orientation and how they aligned. And three, our ability to continue to partner effectively with physicians to deliver outstanding value. And we take that picture together while disrupted, we believe that based on our prior performance, both in disrupted environments, we'll grow covered lives. We have a great value proposition in those targeted geographies. Second point is your question is, can you do so profitably? The history of Cigna and the history of HealthSpring is to orient to make sure that books of business are sustainable and therefore, profitable. So we'll do it in a, I'll call it, a shareholder-responsible way because we want to have long-standing relationships with our customers that are sustainable over a long period of time. And we're pleased with the positions we're able to take in our respective markets relative to the disruption. And obviously over the near term, we'll see the overall competitive landscape and the enrollment cycle will take place in the fall as we step forward. But as we stand here today, we expect to grow covered lives in our targeted geographies for 2014 for sure.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just on the cost trend, 100-basis point reduction in cost trend in the quarter is a pretty big move. Can you just talk a little bit about what the main factors are driving that reduction?","Thomas A. McCarthy","Kevin, it's Tom. Again, we've been really happy with the competitively attractive results we've been able to deliver in medical cost trend for quite some time. The improvement in the outlook is generally driven by lower outpatient utilization than previously expected. And now we're kind of seeing all the key elements of the trend kind of in the same mid-single digit range for the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Lake with JPMorgan.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question is on private exchanges. Dave, can you give us a view on what you think the 3- to 5-year outlook is for this distribution channel and how you think it could impact your business going forward?","David M. Cordani","Justin, so relative to private exchanges, a couple of points. First, very early innings of evolution relative to private exchanges. Secondly, there's a variety of offerings that are in the marketplace today that are formed for very different reasons. Let me give you an example and then I'll address the core of your question. So some of the private exchanges are designed to, from our point of view, improve the retail purchasing experience for individual employees or customers, that's positive. Some are designed to do that and to further advance adoption of engagement, incentive-based programs, et cetera. And still some further are designed to shift risk from the employer more meaningfully to the employee. Beyond that, some of the exchanges are designed to be multi-carrier, some are designed to be single-carrier, some are designed to be risk funded, some are designed to be ASO funded. So my point here is: one, it's early; and two, they're not all created equal. From our point of view, we're playing in many, many of the exchanges and positioned to play in many, many of the exchanges. And as we've consistently done in the past, we'll seek to partner and focus what we think we could work with our others to create meaningful sustainable value for clients and customers. Last note I'd make here is we design, develop and will roll out in '14 a proprietary exchange as well, that's focused on employers who value both those incentive and engagement-based programs, as well as packaged alternatives. That will provide quite attractive flexibility from an employer to configure what they want and for an employee to configure what they value and lever that up against the right funding alternatives, really sophisticated multimodal service capabilities, as well as some attractive savings that come along with those incentive-based and packaged alternatives. Lastly, as you asked for a 3- to 5-year horizon, the best part I can give to you and a short answer here is, just like many parts of the health care marketplace are changing and we are keenly focused on making sure we're engaged to be able to create value. And this is an example of change into my mind, where some efficiency and transparency and choice can be brought into the marketplace. And we have examples of how to play here, both in the U.S. as well as outside the U.S. So we're actively engaged in the early innings here and we have some proprietary capability to play in this space as well.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Any thoughts on how big a market this is going to be? Or whether it's going to be full risk or ASO?","David M. Cordani","And Justin, I don't think it will be constructive for me to theorize on some of those percentages given the early time frame. I also don't think there are many credible third-party assessments relative to it. I do think if you step back though, and you think about just changing distribution environment, if you look at other industries, you could point toward the broad category of changing distribution about wrong choice and transparency and elimination of value as being a trend that many industries go toward. We're comfortable in that environment. We're comfortable competing based on value. And the totality of our business is really around knowing and understanding the customers' needs and offering the right choice and transparency, but I can't give you a direct percentage to either of those categories at this point.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then so maybe my follow-up then will be, David, you mentioned there is more competition down market in ASO. Can you flush that out a little bit in terms of what is exchanging there and how that might impact your ASO growth going forward?","David M. Cordani","Sure. An interesting way to frame that, so you said maybe your follow-up will be. So I guess you didn't like the comments in the private exchange. So I'll try to [indiscernible] in here, Justin, for your very fair question. So what's transpiring? You could see some competitors filing new product offerings, et cetera. And very importantly, we expect and expected that to transpire. And for us to be successful, we need to continue to innovate. A couple of pieces here. When you think about the down market, so a 100-life employer, a 150-life employer in an ASO stop-loss offering, the entire delivery platform that you use to serve that employer is different than what you're going use for a regional or national account employer. Your ability to produce on a monthly basis reports that are actionable and transparent for both the employer as well as the broker to understand how their money is being deployed and where the opportunities for improvement exists and then to be consultative, modifying communication plans, incentive programs, network modifications, clinical programs. That's really the fundamental success that goes into this. So early on, candidly, more employer or more competitor dialogue here actually creates more opportunity for us because it lathers up the market even more significantly. And secondly, so long as we continue to innovate off of our very attractive platform, we see strong growth opportunities as we look to the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe just picking up on that last topic. What are you seeing at this point, 5 months ahead of reform implementation in terms of the pace of ASO conversions? Is this something that's meaningfully accelerating as employers look to make those changes ahead of the implementation?","David M. Cordani","It's David. My headline answer to you will be no. Backing up from that, we have seen over the last several years a continued increase in demand for interest in and adoption of the more transparent programs. And that continues, but we do not see -- and remember, we don't play under 50 life. So my comments here are above 50 life employer. We do not see an overnight fee change relative to the desire, demand or acceptability of the programs. Rather, we see a continued elevation and interest in awareness relative to employers and relative to brokers who are seeking to offer alternatives that are transparent and create value over time. And that's a very attractive position for us to see and be in.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I also just wanted to just ask about the guaranteed cost side of the business in terms of the pricing that you're seeing there from competitors, whether that's evolved at all as we move through this year and maybe underlying cost trends have been pretty favorable throughout the industry. And related to that, is it -- has it been a relatively smooth process on the guaranteed cost side of passing through the industry fee, including the gross up to account for the fact that it's not tax deductible?","Thomas A. McCarthy","Matthew, it's Tom. So first on your -- the first part of your question, we really haven't seen a dramatic change in the competitive environment on the guaranteed cost side. Again, you come up with an anecdote or 2 here or there, but generally, conditions in that market segment have been consistent. To the question on general pricing and the industry fee in particular, as you know, we tend to have a pretty disciplined pricing and underwriting approach and the industry fee is another cost factor. We've built into our process and we understand that the tax dynamics of it and we have included that in the amount we need to recover as we set our prices and expect that to continue going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ana Gupte with Dowling & Partners.","Ana Gupte - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","Just following up on the distribution questions that were being asked earlier and just more broadly beyond private exchanges, this notion that you're moving more from group to individual. Just wanted to get your thoughts on the growth opportunity in supplemental and voluntary benefits specifically because you play globally and compete with players like AFLAC, who are making noises about this. And then on the life side, it seems like Met and Pru and others are also pointing to this as a sizable growth story.","David M. Cordani","Ana, it's David, 2 comments. First before commenting on the supplemental and voluntary, a very important point, the employer to individual -- one piece I just want to highlight is, when you think about the national accounts and in many cases, the largest of the regional employers, in a lot of cases, we're operating in a B2B2C relationship today already. We're one of choice, meaning, we're a choice that's offered but not the only choice. So to be successful, you need to have both the wholesale and retail experience that works and that has been increasing over time. The positive of that is that it enables us to evolve and hone some capabilities that are more retail-oriented. Now more specific to your supplemental and voluntary comment, we do believe if you step back and you look at markets around the globe, and you look at change in the way comprehensive or the primary benefits are offered, you end up seeing a large and evolving supplemental or voluntary series of programs that exist. And we think in the United States, the growth of supplemental and voluntary, supplemental being sold direct to individual; voluntary, sold to an individual but through an employer as an affinity or aggregator, we think that marketplace will grow. And lastly, the combination of both our existing, I'll call it U.S. set of capabilities around supplemental and voluntary, but our broad set of capabilities around product design, individual insights, direct to consumer distribution service capabilities that were effectively able to ply in multiple countries and cultures around the world gives us an important set of capabilities to be able to lever as this marketplace unfolds here in the United States. So we see that as an attractive opportunity.","Ana Gupte - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","So in light of this growth opportunity, I do get questions from people investing in the life side of the business, do you think fewer health players are positioned better or are the life guys positioned better or someone like yourself that plays in both? And might you invest in some new distribution channels like private exchanges or carrier-specific private exchanges so you can capitalize on that growth?","David M. Cordani","Ana, I would -- I typically don't like to generalize, so I would not say life players are better positioned or health players are better positioned. A couple of things I'd ask you to think about or at least how I think about it. One is to be successful here, we believe we're going to need deep and sustainable insights around the customers' current and evolving needs and the ability to subsegment and micro segment because the ability to thrive over time and have long-standing supplemental and voluntarily relationships, not just to push a product but actually sell a highly valued product that can be based upon that customer analogy and those customer insights. The second piece is the multiple distribution channels that work and meet the needs of those subsegments. That's what we do all day everyday outside of the United States. And then just teasing up against that, some players will find themselves confronting massive channel conflict. We see that outside the United States all day everyday. If you have a primary distribution channel that's oriented in one way, when you try to bring up a different distribution channel up against that to meet a customer's needs, you get massive channel conflict. In the United States, we are not labored by that, in any way, shape or form. Lastly, you tie back to investments. When we talk about our priorities around investments, the third category we talk about from an inorganic standpoint as well is additional retail-based capabilities. And it underscores this, for example, as an evolving marketplace not limited to, but this is an evolving marketplace. So we leverage our non-U.S. capabilities, our current U.S. capabilities and we'll seek to augment that further going forward.","Operator","The next question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Maybe first, just -- I know it's an area where you're more targeted and opportunistic, but any updated thoughts on how the rollout of the public exchanges under ACA is going? Are you seeing more opportunities, less opportunities than you thought, and any reaction to the initial data that's been available?","David M. Cordani","A.J., it's David. So just a moment of backdrop and then specifically where we are. As I think you know, at Cigna, our history is that we've not played in both the under 50 life, as well as the individual guarantee cost market. The relevancy of that is both, a, we don't have to protect our legacy revenue or earnings stream; and b, we don't have an old business model has to be changed to a new business model, we could take a fresh look. To that point, we have run pilots for the last 3 years in 10 different cities. We were able to test a variety of product distributions, service orientation programs, and successfully were able to take away some very good [indiscernible] earnings. As it relates to the exchange marketplace, as I think you know, we sought to play in 5 states and then in a limited number of markets within those states. As we look at our rack and stack of our positioning for the subsegment of buyers we're seeking to go at, I think our headline would be, no great surprises there. And we're going to take a very focused cost review in terms of the early entry on the markets. We do view that over time this may present an attractive growth opportunity that's sustainable, but currently taking a very focused and disciplined approach for '14.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then very specifically maybe on the Disability and Life segment. I know last quarter, you called out that you had some unfavorable experience on the Disability claim side. This quarter you're calling out that you had some favorable, maybe a little commentary around that. And should on the reserve study benefit and also the discount rate assumption, will that -- are you assuming that there's benefit from either one of those on the back half of the year as well?","Thomas A. McCarthy","A.J., it's Tom. So again, as you point out, the Disability business has had a few ups and downs this year. This is a segment where we're really happy with the core capabilities we have. We've got great productivity and return to work tools and a great team. Over the last few years, we've had the constraints of a difficult economy. In the first quarter of this year, you might recall, we made some model changes that we thought would have some negative impact to Disability results. And in fact, we reflected that in the first quarter results and the reserve change -- special item reserve change in that quarter. This quarter, we're really going through the more normal process of assessing what the outlook for the business is in the reserve studies. And also, I've seeing a little better metrics on the bread-and-butter claims indicators in Disability that may be tied to some stability in the economy. We tend to continue to have a model where we look for continued improvement and outcomes in this business. And we do think about that when we set our outlook for the year, for example, for the balance of the year and as we were coming into this year. Sometimes as improvements show up in better operating results, current period operating results sometimes those improvements show up through a reserve study impact looking back on claims you've already had in inventory. So that's a little bit of the mischief in the timing of the Group Disability results. But what the current outlook for Group does kind of net all those impacts out, both the claim model changes in the first quarter, the somewhat improved dynamics in Disability results evident in the second quarter plus some pressure from life claims that we're seeing right now dampening some of the improvement in the last half of the year. So all in, all those factors are considered in our outlook for Group.","Operator","The next question comes from Carl McDonald with Citigroup.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Interested in your thoughts on the sustainability of earnings specifically in the experience-rated business, I know you don't disclose a loss ratio for that product, but it does look like that's run at some pretty favorable levels in the first half of this year. So I'd be interested in what you're assuming in the second half and then also into '14 given the dynamics of those contracts.","Thomas A. McCarthy","Carl, it's Tom, as you point out, we don't really give that level of detailed results. But just in response to your general inquiry, there's really nothing mischievous going on in experience-rated, that's a product that really cuts well for our segment of the market. Again, it's customers that are willing to engage and expect to be able to invest in health improvement. We've had great results there. Historically, we don't really see any change in that prospect going forward so I'm feeling pretty comfortable where we are in experience-rated.","Operator","The next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies.","David A. Styblo - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","It's Dave Styblo filling in for Windley. One quick clarification on your comment earlier about market exits in the Senior business. I think it was representing 1% or 2% -- excuse me, 2% or 3%. Was that of the total membership of plans that you're withdrawing from? Or is that kind of the net impact of how many of your members won't have access to another HealthSpring\/Cigna plan?","David M. Cordani","Dave, it's David. We think about that as essentially disruption to the current aggregate MA covered lives. There are some other product alternatives we have that will be made available, but that's a disruptive number. And you recalled it correct, 2% to 3% of the MA products in the overall portfolio.","David A. Styblo - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. Can you size that? What -- of those 2% to 3%, how many will have another alternative plan?","David M. Cordani","For our planning purposes, we're -- that would be upside because it's hard for us to determine whether or not the other offerings will meet the needs of those specific customers. But I think it's safe for you to assume that, that 2% to 3% is a pretty firm estimate that we have in terms of disruptions from the MA portfolio.","David A. Styblo - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then my follow-up is, you had talked about your CAC is expanding, supporting over 1 million customers now. Can you talk a little bit more about the things that we can watch for as you go forward, what your targets are for that? And then, how many of your -- how much of your medical costs are running through that?","David M. Cordani","Dave, let me give you a little color relative to this because there's absolutely a lot of buzz in the market relative to the broader ACO movement and what we call our Collaborative Accountable Care relationships. First and foremost, we've been at this now for, believe it or not, 6 years in the commercial space and well over a decade because of legacy of HealthSpring in the MA space. And our approach is to use this as a preferred -- ultimately a preferred network alternative in our Go Deep markets because it's proving to have the highest value by balancing access, accessibility, cost and quality. We don't orient around it as a separate P&L or a separate technology initiative going forward. As I indicated, we have over 1 million lives being serviced today. We expect that to continue to grow significantly. We have a meaningful number of collaboratives up and running, think in excess of 60. And now really the focus is making sure that we're able to demonstrate that, the sustainability of those results for the benefit of our clients and customers. We're driving the retention rates ultimately enabling to cross-sell rates and enabling the growth in the respective markets. Lastly, to your point, at this point we don't think it's helpful to try to estimate the aggregate medical costs flowing through because again, we could have fun with numbers there. I could take all the chronic data, and any chronic is being touched by those physicians, and get to some pretty big numbers, which we have. I don't think they're actually helpful but, rather, we see these as preferred networks in our Go Deep markets that are delivering as I indicated, even in the prepared remarks, meaningful cost improvement. The Jackson Clinic is demonstrating a 5% cost improvement along with quality improvements and we see more opportunity going forward to continue to grow those for the benefit of both our MA customers, as well as commercial customers.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Wright with Monness, Crespi, Hardt.","Brian Wright - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division","In the Global Supplemental Benefits, what percent of the other geography is Turkey? And is that a market that you can see as large as your Korean market?","Thomas A. McCarthy","Brian, it's Tom. I'm not sure I can give you the exact percentage, maybe one of these guys can come up with it before we're done. It's in startup stage right now. So it's not a meaningful -- it's not a huge contributor in the early stage, but as David has pointed out, we do view Turkey as a very significant contributor in the long run so we would expect that it could go -- grow to be a size to rival Korea over time.","Brian Wright - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on another note, in the MA MLR in the quarter, the year-over-year increase, is that basically most of that? What percentage of that was planned to get to the minimum MLR kind of regs going forward?","Thomas A. McCarthy","Brian, it's Tom. I would say most of it is was of that design. Again, I think you understood the MLRs in some plans that were running well below the floors that we'd be dealing with and we had anticipated conscious program changes to increase the MLR.","Operator","The last question comes from Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I just wanted to -- with regard to the pension funding and the amount of money you're going to put into it this year, is that $1 billion available for capital deployment net of what you're going to contribute? Or just any color on what we should assume going for the rest of the year.","Thomas A. McCarthy","Chris, it's Tom. Yes. So the $1 billion net available for capital deployment is net of all the other parent cash funding needs we would expect, including interest expense and the pension plan contribution. And as it happens the pattern of the timing this year, most of that $250 million pretax pension plan contribution hasn't been made yet, will be made in the last half of the year, but the $1 billion of free capital available for deployment in the last half of the year is net of that funding expectation.","Operator","I will now turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks.","David M. Cordani","Thank you. So in closing, I'd like to emphasize a few highlights from our discussion this morning. We're pleased with Cigna's second quarter results, which reflect strong revenue and earnings contributions from each of our ongoing businesses. These strong results give me confidence in our ability to achieve our full-year 2013 earnings outlook. We continue to make targeted investments in solutions and market expansion to support the sustained growth of our businesses. And the combination of our clear strategy, consistent execution and sustained investment and capabilities positions us well to deliver competitively attractive results in 2013 and beyond.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded. ","We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Ted Detrick. Please go ahead, Mr. Detrick.","Edwin J. Detrick","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I'm Ted Detrick, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ralph Nicoletti, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer.","In our remarks today, David will begin by commenting on Cigna's first quarter results. He will then review our approach to delivering value for our customers and clients. He will also discuss our key earnings drivers and why we believe Cigna is well positioned to deliver attractive top line and bottom line growth over the long term. Next, Ralph will reviewed the financial results for the first quarter and provide an update on Cigna's financial outlook for full year 2012. We will then open the lines for your questions. And following our question-and-answer session, David will provide some brief closing remarks before we end the call.","Now, as noted in our earnings release, Cigna uses certain financial measures, which are not determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, when describing its financial results. Specifically, we use the term labeled adjusted income from operations as the principal measure of performance for Cigna and our operating segments. And the reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com.","As is customary, our quarterly financial supplement is also available through cigna.com. In addition, as we begin the year, we have made information available on our website to facilitate your understanding of our full year 2012 outlook, as well as our longer-term growth goals and opportunities.","Now with our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements. We would remind you that there are risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations and those risk factors are discussed in today's earnings release.","Now before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our first quarter results and disclosures. ","Regarding our results, I note in the first quarter, we recorded 2 charges to shareholders' net income, which we reported as special items. The first special item was an after-tax charge of $28 million or $0.10 per share for transaction costs related to the HealthSpring acquisition. The second special item was an after-tax charge of $13 million or $0.04 per share for costs associated with the litigation matter. I would remind you that special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations in today's discussion of our first quarter 2012 results as well as the full year 2012 outlook.","Relative to our Run-off Reinsurance operations, our first quarter shareholders' net income included an after-tax noncash gain of approximately $41 million or $0.14 per share related to the Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefits business, otherwise known as the GMIB. I would remind you that the impact of the accounting fair value disclosure and measuring guidance on our GMIB results is for GAAP accounting purposes only. We believe that the application of this guidance is not reflective of the underlying economics as it does not represent management's expectation of the ultimate liability payout. Because of application of this accounting guidance, Cigna's future results for the GMIB business will be volatile as any future change in the exit value of GMIB's assets and liabilities will be recorded in shareholders' net income.","Cigna's 2012 earnings outlook, which we will discuss in a few moments, excludes the effects of the GMIB business and therefore any potential volatility related to the perspective application of this accounting guidance.","And also, as we've previously disclosed, effective January 1 of this year, Cigna has adopted new accounting guidance regarding the accounting for the deferral of certain costs related to the acquisition of new or renewable insurance contracts. This accounting change restricts the amount of costs that can be capitalized and accelerates the recognition of certain acquisition costs that previously would have been deferred. Cigna adopted this accounting change on a retrospective basis, in the first quarter of 2012, recasting prior periods and recording a onetime noncash charge of $289 million directly to shareholders' equity effective January 1, 2011.","Prior period results have been recast to reflect the impact of this accounting change. And the impact to recast 2011 results for the adoption of this new guidance was to reduce earnings for our International business by $16 million in the first quarter of 2011 and by $67 million for full year 2011. We would remind you that this accounting change has no impact on the fundamentals of the business. That is, there is no effect on future cash flows, our statutory capital position or the lifetime profitability of these policies.","Also please note that when we discuss our full year 2012 outlook in a few moments, it will be on a basis, which excludes any future capital deployment and assumes break-even results for the remainder of the year for our Run-off Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefits business, known as VADBe. ","And one last item, please note that Cigna will be hosting our upcoming Investor Day on November 16 in New York City. ","And with that, I will turn it over to David.","David M. Cordani","Thanks, Ted, and good morning, everyone. Before Ralph reviews our results and outlook, I'll briefly comment on our first quarter performance then I'll discuss how our capabilities continue to deliver differentiated value for our customers and clients. And finally, I'll briefly highlight how we are positioned for continued long-term profitable growth.","Turning to our results. We are pleased with our results for the first quarter. We exceeded our expectations in earnings and in medical customer growth, resulting in a stronger capital position at the end of the quarter. We also accelerated investments in our technology infrastructure, which we expect will start to yield efficiency gains in the second half of this year, in 2013 and beyond.","We reported adjusted income from operations of $370 million or $1.28 per share, excluding the VADBe results; and consolidated operating revenues of $6.9 billion, an increase of 27% over the first quarter of 2011.","Our results demonstrate the ongoing effective execution of our Go Deep, Go Global and Go Individual strategy. And each of our ongoing businesses, Health Care, International and Group made strong organic revenue and earnings contributions in the first quarter. ","For our U.S. Health Care business, our results demonstrate continued growth in our targeted customer segments. In addition, we added 2 months of attractive contributions from HealthSpring, which we closed on January 31, 2012. First quarter revenues increased approximately 32% relative to the first quarter of 2011. Our medical customer base grew by 1.2 million members. Nearly 800,000 of these members represent organic growth from our core commercial business. This was ahead of our previous outlook. The result was driven by strong sales and higher-than-planned client retention levels across all of our targeted customer segments.  Approximately 300,000 of these customers were gained in International account segment, reinforcing the effectiveness of our strategy to reposition this business.","We also experienced favorable prior claim development in the quarter. Utilization trends remained low through the end of 2011 and into 2012. I would note that while overall utilization growth is somewhat muted, we continue to drive higher use of prevention and wellness service in our portfolio.","Our ASO clients benefit directly from these lower medical costs. Today, 85% of our commercial customers are in these arrangements, which enable Cigna clients to choose from our comprehensive suite of programs while having full transparency and control of the costs.","In our International business, we delivered top line growth of 24%, driven by robust premium and fee growth in our Health, Life and Accident business as well as our Global Health Benefit business. With infrastructure in 30 countries and jurisdictions, in-country sales expertise and in-depth customer understanding, our global footprint continues to provide a powerful advantage in our ability to design, develop and sell locally differentiated products and services.","In our Group Disability and Life business, our revenue growth of 8% was in line with our expectations and we continue to see good client interest in our programs that focus on productivity.","Now let me take a moment to discuss the future business environment. We believe that businesses today must be able to adapt to continued economic, social and political changes at an accelerated pace. Health systems around the world are demanding health and wellness solutions that address improvements in quality and costs. At Cigna, we are constructively engaging with lawmakers, regulators, business and other thought leaders in our global markets to create effective health and benefit systems for the future.","Here in the U.S., attention is being focused on the Supreme Court's evaluation of the Affordable Care Act. Regardless of that outcome, there are 3 indisputable certainties that Cigna is taking into account in our strategies and our actions: first, the cost of health care is unsustainable. In an environment where almost 75% of costs can be influenced by lifestyle and behavioral choice, demand for innovative solutions is increasing.","Second, individuals will assume increasing responsibility for their own health and well-being decisions. Actionable information and resources to enable them to make choices based on what they value is critical to improve health outcomes and lower costs. ","And third, aging populations require new models for sustainable social programs. By 2030, the number of people in the world over the age of 50 will be greater than those under the age of 17 for the first time in history. This means we will have more people requiring health benefits for a longer period of time and fewer workers in the system paying for it. At Cigna, we are helping our clients and customers address these trends with our health, wellness and productivity programs that focus on engagement and incentives to yield better value.","With this environment as a backdrop, several elements of our growth strategy and business capabilities position us to continue to deliver value for our customers and clients, and our approach starts with our focus on our customer. We have been at the forefront of the market shift to a more retail, customer-focused approach to health care. We are reengineering our business around the individual. Our goal is to deliver a simple, easy and helpful customer experience for everyone every time, and we will continuously work to improve to meet the emerging needs and customer trends.","From a service standpoint, we were the first and remained the only global health service company with 24\/7, 365 live phone service. And we're becoming even more accessible through channels such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Our website has recently earned recognition as a resource that helps customers evaluate the quality of health care professionals, provides tools to calculate the cost of care and offers advisory capabilities to make more informed decisions. Last month, we launched a new tool that provides real-time pricing for more than 200 common medical procedures, which represent 80% of our medical claims. ","Our customer focus is delivering results. For example, in the U.S., our consumer-directed health plans grew by 35% in 2011, more than double the industry average. In the first quarter, we have already grown enrollment in these plans by another 24%. Outside the U.S., sales of our direct-to-consumer Health, Life and Accident business continues to grow by more than 20% per year. Our successful expansion into the Internet and direct response TV distribution complements our leading telemarketing capabilities.","Next, we add our consultative sales approach. Our approach helps us deliver differentiated value for our clients and customers. This, in turn, positions us to expand existing client relationships over time. We start by listening to our clients to understand the business strategy, their benefit goals and their corporate culture. Then we analyze their claims utilization, conduct health assessment and biometric screenings to get a more complete view of their employee population. We design health and wellness plans to align to a client's specific goals for health and productivity improvement. Then we drive high individual engagement, aided by incentive programs that reflect the unique needs of their employees. ","And we complement these programs with our physician engagement models.  At Cigna, we've taken a leadership role in physician engagement, moving away from offering rewards for just the quantity of services performed to providing incentives for achieving better health outcomes for our customers.","Our approach, which we call Collaborative Accountable Care, or CAC, provides physicians with: actionable information on their patients to improve health and close gaps in care; financial incentives for keeping patients healthy and delivering the highest quality of care; and assistance from care coordinators to help patients follow prescribed treatments and improve their overall health by participating in our coaching and lifestyle programs. Today, we have 22 of these CAC initiatives in place in 13 states. And by 2014, we expect to have 100.","The addition of HealthSpring further builds on our ability to reshape the delivery of health care. HealthSpring has demonstrated that truly partnering with physicians, integrating services and driving innovation delivers market-leading results for customers. In fact, many of HealthSpring's programs are recognized as some of the most innovative in the marketplace, reflecting the type of coordinated care, clinical quality and physician engagement needed to address key aspects of sustainable health care reform. Combined, these elements of our strategy, customer focus, consultative sales approach and physician engagement allow us to offer our customers and clients the differentiated value proposition.","We leverage these capabilities to deliver competitively attractive growth for our shareholders. This growth is driven by our U.S. commercial business, our International business and now, our Medicare business. In our U.S. Commercial business, we are seeing increased demand for health and productivity programs. As a proof point, we expect to add approximately 800,000 new medical customers in 2012 in our Commercial business.","Second, in our International business, we continue to expect high demand for health solutions to serve the globally mobile individuals and the growing middle-class and emerging markets. We are continuously evaluating opportunities to expand our international distribution capabilities and product portfolio, as well as invest in new markets where there is a attractive growth potential. ","For example, in 2011, we deepened our geographic footprint further in China by securing our 10th license. We now have the ability to reach more than 500 million people. This represents 40% of the population and over 65% of the GDP in the country.","Third is our Medicare business. We plan to expand HealthSpring's offerings beyond the current markets to leverage Cigna's broader U.S. footprint including our employer-based and our established relationships with physicians and hospitals. Our integration with HealthSpring is well on track. We have effectively engaged our customers, employees and physician partners, resulting in continued business momentum. We are also aggressively working on our strategic growth priorities to extend the value of HealthSpring's position engagement model by developing new commercial offerings and to leverage Cigna's footprint to extend HealthSpring's seniors capabilities into new markets.","I attribute this early success to our common vision and true philosophy of strong physician partnership that focuses on delivering the highest clinical quality for our customers. When you take these growth drivers together, plus our ongoing effective capital deployment, we continue to expect to deliver 10% to 13% annual EPS growth over the next 3 to 5 years.","Now before I turn it over to Ralph, let me highlight just a few key points. Our first quarter results exceeded our expectations in earnings and medical customer growth, resulting in a strong capital position at the end of the quarter. We also accelerated investments in our technology infrastructure, which we expect will start to yield efficiency gains in the second half of this year, then in 2013 and beyond. Our integration of HealthSpring is progressing well. And based on the strength of our first quarter results, we are increasing our full year outlook for earnings and customer growth. ","Our results reflect the dedication of more than 30,000 Cigna colleagues who are working everyday to improve the health, well-being and sense and security of the individuals we serve around the world. ","And lastly, I would highlight that our strategy is built to thrive on and seize on the opportunities created by today's dynamic business environment. ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Ralph.","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will review Cigna's first quarter 2012 results and provide an update to our full year outlook. In my review of consolidated and segment results, I will comment on adjusted income from operations. This is also the basis on which I'll provide our earnings outlook. ","Before I get into the specifics of the quarter, I wanted to highlight that the quarter reflects strong fundamental execution of our strategy, earnings and customer growth ahead of our expectation, continued strategic investments to support growth and ongoing efficiency gains as well as strong contributions from HealthSpring. These results provide me confidence to increase our full year earnings outlook.","Now moving to the results. Our first quarter 2012 consolidated operating revenues grew 27% to $6.9 billion, driven by growth in our targeted markets and the impact of the HealthSpring acquisition. First quarter consolidated earnings were $370 million or $1.28 per share, excluding the after-tax loss of $0.04 per share from the results of the Run-off VADBe business.","Turning to the segments. In Health Care, first quarter 2012 premiums and fees grew 36% to $4.5 billion, reflecting strong business growth and 2 months of HealthSpring revenues. First quarter earnings for the Health Care were $262 million and reflect growth in our commercial business, contributions from HealthSpring and the impact of favorable prior year claim development. ","In addition, the quarter's results include strategic spending to support our business growth and service capabilities, as well as targeted investments that will deliver operating expense efficiencies beginning in the second half of this year. ","Specific to our spending-to-deliver operating efficiencies, these costs impacted the quarter's results by approximately $30 million pretax or $0.07 per share.","We ended the first quarter 2012 with approximately 12.7 million medical customers, representing growth of almost 1.2 million customers. The increase is comprised of organic growth of 800,000 commercial customers, which are essentially all ASO, and roughly 400,000 HealthSpring customers, reflecting continued growth of the Medicare book of business.","As David noted, our customer growth is aligned with our Go Deep strategy with strong results in our national account, middle market and select segments where we offer clients differentiated funding alternatives and product solutions to our consultative approach and focus on incentive alignment.","Now turning to medical costs. In the quarter, we continued to deliver favorable medical costs and sustained clinical quality for our clients and customers. I would remind you that 85% of our commercial customers are in ASO funding arrangement where they directly benefit from these medical trend results, and we continue to see a growing proportion of our commercial customers in service-based relationships.","Across our commercial and Medicare risk books of business, our first quarter earnings include favorable prior year claim development of $38 million after tax and net of rebate accrual, compared to $22 million after tax in the first quarter of 2011.","Specific to commercial guaranteed costs, our first quarter 2012 medical care ratio, or MCR, was 76.2% on a reported basis. Excluding prior year claim development, the commercial guaranteed cost MCR for the first quarter was 79.6%. Our first quarter 2012 MCR for Medicare Advantage was 81.1% on a reported basis or 82.8% excluding prior year claim development.","Overall, we are pleased with the results in our medical risk businesses as they continue to reflect good pricing and underwriting discipline, as well as sustained clinical quality for our clients and customers.","For the first quarter 2012, total operating expense ratio is 24.3%, which is a 280 basis point reduction over the first quarter of 2011 expense ratio and primarily reflects the change in business mix associated with the HealthSpring acquisition.","Now I will discuss the results of our International business. International continues to deliver attractive growth and profitability. The results reflect targeted new sales, strong retention and further product penetration to existing customers. Premiums and fees grew 24% quarter-over-quarter, driven by strong customer retention and growth within our Health, Life and Accident business and increased risk membership in our Global Health Benefits business. ","First quarter earnings in our International business were $80 million, representing continued high-single digit margins in line with our long-term growth expectations for this business. I would note that our first quarter 2012 results included the onetime benefit of $8 million after tax, related to the implementation of a capital management strategy.","In our Group, Disability and Life segment, premiums and fees increased 8% over the first quarter 2011. First quarter earnings in the Group business were $65 million. We continue to deliver value for our clients and customers through our market-leading disability and productivity management programs.","Results for our remaining operations, including Run-off Reinsurance, Other Operations and Corporate totaled to an after-tax loss of $48 million for the first quarter of 2012. These results include a reserve strengthening of $11 million after-tax, related to our Run-off VADBe book of business. ","The reserve strengthening is the result of our continuing review of assumptions and primarily relates to the impacts of expected changes to our long-term lapse assumption on a segment of the business. Our capital position in Arbor, the legal entity dedicated to the Run-off Reinsurance businesses, continued to be strong and consistent with year end. As a result, the reserve strengthening has no impact on our outlook for cash available for deployment.","Overall, our first quarter results reflect solid revenue and earnings contributions from each of our ongoing businesses, which continue to generate significant free cash flow.","Turning to our investment portfolio. We are pleased with our results in the first quarter. We recognized net realized investment gains of $12 million after tax, coupled with a strong net investment income result. And our commercial mortgage loan portfolio is performing well in a challenging economic environment. ","Overall, we continue to be pleased with the quality and diversification of our investment portfolio. Our strong investment management capabilities and disciplined approach to risk management continue to deliver solid results.","Now turning to our outlook. Based on the strength of our first quarter results, we are confident in our ability to achieve our increased full year outlook. We now expect consolidated adjusted income from operation in the range of $1.52 billion to $1.63 billion and consolidated EPS of $5.20 to $5.55 per share, reflecting continued strong underlying results in each of our ongoing businesses. This is an increased outlook -- this increased outlook represents an increase of $0.15 to $0.20 per share over our previous expectations. ","I would remind you that consistent with prior practices, our outlook excludes any contribution from additional prior year reserve development or capital deployment.","I will now discuss the components of our 2012 outlook, starting with Health Care. We now expect full year Health Care earnings in the range of $1.19 billion to $1.26 billion, which is an improvement of $70 million from our previous expectations. This increased outlook for Health Care reflects 3 items: the impact of higher-than-expected full year customer growth, the first quarter favorable prior year claim development and a reduction in amortization expense related to the HealthSpring acquisition.","I do want to highlight that our quarterly earnings patterns will be different than prior years as we expect earnings for 2012 will be more heavily weighted to the back end of the year than our historical pattern as a result of a few things: the seasonal earnings patterns of our expanded Medicare PDP book of business; operating expense efficiencies expected in the second half of the year, resulting from investments we are making in the first half, which I alluded to earlier; additional expected specialty earnings contributions from our ASO block of business; and reporting only 2 months of HealthSpring contributions in the first quarter.","Relative to medical customers, we now expect full year 2012 growth of approximately 1.2 million people, of which 800,000 is in our commercial book of business and is 300,000 higher than our prior expectations. This year's growth is essentially all in our highly transparent ASO funding arrangements and across all of our targeted market segments including national account, middle market and select size employers. ","We have delivered additional growth in sales to larger clients. As you know, new sales to these clients tend to have less product penetration initially. We expect to provide additional value to our larger clients by expanding our suite of solutions over time, which will drive increased revenue and earnings for these relationships. Overall, we are pleased that employees of various sizes are attractive to our consultative approach and differentiated value proposition.","Turning to medical costs. Our outlook continues to assume a modest increase in medical services utilization during 2012. For our total commercial book of business, we continue to expect full year medical cost trend to be in 6% to 7% range. These expected medical costs have been reflected in our pricing for 2012. ","We now expect the full year MCR to be in the range of 80% to 81% for our commercial guaranteed cost book of business, which is 100 basis points lower than our previous expectations, the majority of which is driven by favorable medical trend development. Our expectation relative to Medicare Advantage MCR for the full year continues to be in the range of 81.5% to 82.5%. ","Our operating expense ratio for the full year is expected to be in the range of 22.5% to 23.5%, which is consistent with our prior expectation and reflects the benefit of operating expense efficiencies in the second half of 2012.","Now moving to the other components of our outlook. For our International business, we expect continued strong top line growth and continue to expect earnings in the range of $265 million to $285 million, which represents earnings growth of 19% to 28% versus the full year 2011.","Regarding the Group Disability and Life business, we continue to expect full year 2012 earnings in the range of $260 million and $280 million. ","Regarding our remaining operations, including Run-off Reinsurance, Other Operations and Corporate, our outlook is now an expected loss of $195 million for 2012, reflecting the first quarter Run-off VADBe reserve strengthening. This outlook assumes break-even results for the remainder of 2012 for VADBe.","So all in, for full year 2012, we now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $1.52 billion to $1.63 billion and consolidated EPS in the range of $5.20 to $5.55 per share.","I would now discuss our updated capital management position and outlook. Overall, we continue to have good financial flexibility as our subsidiaries remain well capitalized and are generating significant free cash flow to the parent, reflecting a strong return on capital in each of our ongoing businesses. ","We ended the quarter with parent company cash of approximately $520 million. ","For the full year 2012, after considering expected sources and uses, we now expect to have approximately $1 billion in parent company cash by the end of 2012, with approximately $550 million available for capital deployment. This represents $100 million increase compared to our previous capital outlook, primarily reflecting the increase in our earnings outlook.","Overall, our capital position and updated outlook remains strong, and our capital deployment strategy and priorities remain unchanged.","And now to recap. Our first quarter 2012 consolidated results reflect the strength of our global differentiated portfolio of businesses and effective execution of our focused strategy with solid growth in our targeted customer segments. Our first quarter results were better than our expectations, reflecting good progress on the integration of HealthSpring and strong organic revenue and customer growth, which are expected to deliver $0.15 to $0.20 higher earnings per share, and additional $100 million in capital available for deployment and targeted strategic investments to provide sustainable growth in revenues, earnings and EPS into the future. Based on the strength of our results, we are confident in our ability to achieve our increased full year 2012 earnings outlook. ","With that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]  Our first question comes from Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Could you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing on the utilization and cost trend side? Did it come in below your expectations in terms of utilization trends in the first quarter? Was it up modestly from last year or you're just expecting that going forward? And any differentiation you can make between commercial and Medicare would be interesting.","David M. Cordani","It's David. I'll start and I'll ask Ralph to expand and explicitly also deal if there's any difference between commercial and Medicare. First off, as indicated with our favorable prior year development, results continue to develop favorable to our expectations. Secondly, from my prepared remarks, we noted that we did not see a meaningful uptick in utilization in the first quarter. I would note that our expectations coming into the year, we plan for an increase in utilization, but for it to ramp throughout the course of the year. So we weren't projecting a large step function in the first quarter and the point is we did not see that. So overall, results continue to be somewhat muted from utilization acceleration. Final note before I turn it over to Ralph is also as I noted in our prepared comments, for our book of business, specifically, we continue to see targeted increases in certain prevention, wellness, diagnostic procedures as well as even higher medication compliance around evidenced-based care for people in chronic programs, which is more of the right utilization happening, which benefits our clients and customers. Ralph?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Thanks, David. Matt, I guess the only thing I'd really add to David's point is on the Medicare side, essentially, the trends are the same, so we haven't really seen a difference on the Medicare side of the business as well.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And just one follow-up. On the commercial pricing side, I note -- as you noted, nearly all of your gain you expect is coming from the ASO segment. How are you seeing the risk pricing environment develop at this point relative to, I think, the fairly competitive environment that you saw last year or at the later part of last year that caused you to step away from that market?","David M. Cordani","Matthew, again, David. Just from a macro standpoint, your recollection is correct. As you'll see in our results, we didn't post growth in the risk portfolio. As we look to the -- our outlook, at least into 2012, we're expecting to -- planning to see some additional pressure there, so maybe a little dampening in the volumes offset by the continued success in ASO. So with the competitive landscape out there, we're not saying uniquely competitive, but a competitive landscape. And we're picking our spots and maintaining our pricing and underwriting discipline, which is showing through in our MCR and showing through in our medical cost trends and is showing through in our continued ASO growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charles Andrew Boorady with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Charles Andrew Boorady - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The acquisition of HealthSpring looks especially timely in light of where the commercial business is headed and how well Medicare Advantage continues to do. But that said, you seem to be doing really well holding your own in the commercial side despite some of the noise we heard last year on pricing, so congrats on that. What I want to ask about HealthSpring is they, as a company, have been sort of best in class at the vertical integration, how they handle that and how they're able to achieve a high star rating notwithstanding the government moving the goalposts on them last year a little bit. But with the RADV rules now defined, what have you been able to do to sort of assess how the new RADV definition would impact the business, either positively or negatively? And have you accrued anything for RADV in the quarter?","David M. Cordani","Charles, it's David. Appreciate your comments. And just one item relative to the commercial side before I get to HealthSpring. We continue to be pleased that the marketplace -- buyers in a variety of segments continue to increasingly look for what we call health improvement engagement and incentive-based programs, which are not all consumer directed. It's how do you get more engagement with the individuals within an employer space, how you do align the incentives and then how do you bridge that across to the physician line, which carries across to HealthSpring. Broadly speaking, as you noted, I mean HealthSpring has been innovating for a little over a decade and the innovation is heavily around integrating with physicians, aligning incentives, using information and then integrating care coordination, et cetera. And the objective there is to get the highest possible evidence-based care compliance. So when you pierce through it all with the star ratings, RADV audits, et cetera, the macro objective is to get to the highest level of engagement with the physician and individual and highest level of evidence-based care compliance. You can look at the national averages. For example, within MA, you'll see national averages in the high 30% to 40% range in terms of compliances with evidence-based care. And you'll see in the most mature HealthSpring markets percentages approaching the high 80s, so about twice the national average. So to your concluding point, we expect that, that will continue to perform well through the evolving star system as well as the RADV environment.","Charles Andrew Boorady - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Can you scale that across to your commercial lives? And how much of that is technology-based that can be rolled out versus just know-how in the marketplace that might take longer to transfer those skill sets to other markets?","David M. Cordani","Yes, appreciate that very much in terms of your framing of it. First and foremost, a part of our acquisition strategy here was to believe that we can indeed leverage -- you used the term scale. I'll use leverage, leverage the capabilities. I would suggest to you, Charles, it starts -- before we get to technology and otherwise, it starts with kind of an attitudinal orientation. The HealthSpring team, philosophically and fundamentally, believes that by partnering with physicians, putting the customer front and center and using information on a targeted basis, you could yield a better result. And it's an environment of continuous improvement. They've been able to demonstrate that in a variety of markets, so it's just not in a single market like certain other models might be. It's not solely in the most developed integrated care systems like in Southern California. They've been successful in a variety of markets and have been functioning in 15 to 20 -- or 12 to 15 major cities. I would compare that across, Charles, to our experience in 2009 in collaborative accountable care where we've been able to see traction for commercial customers. So a long way of answering your question, yes, we believe we could scale it because we've seen success improvement in our commercial business. It's not an overnight. It's market-by-market and it's collaboration with the targeted physician groups, but they've been able to successfully expand that to a variety of geographies, and we're excited because the marketplace is evolving in that direction.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Barclays Capital.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just before my real question, just one quick question. The $8 million capital management change in International, what does that mean?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Sure. We took some steps to increase our flexibility in cash management outside the U.S. and then that will also enable us to lower our effective tax rates over time. So there was a one -- in the process of doing that, there was a onetime favorable benefit of $8 million after tax.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So clearly onetime, can't expect that?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Yes, over time we'll get the benefit of the cash flexibility and deployment as well as the lower tax rates. But in terms of -- as you think about it from a modeling standpoint, it would be onetime.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's perfect. And then I guess my real question's just around -- as you guys are preparing in month or so before the 2013 MA bids are going to be submitted, so I'm just curious how are you guys are managing that process? I think it's probably a little bit new to the Cigna organization. Obviously, HealthSpring has been doing this for a long, long time. And then as you think about your goals and your targets for 2013, would you say margin maintenance is most important, or do you think continuing to grow those members and on sort of a longer time value of the member is more important?","David M. Cordani","Josh, it's David. So first and foremost, you're correct. At the scale that it's at, it's new to Cigna. Cigna only historically operated MA in Arizona. I would note that we've operated a pretty meaningful PDP book and we put the 2 companies together, the PDP book doubles. More specifically to how we're running it, the HealthSpring business unit is the HealthSpring business unit and the leadership is broadly intact and that leadership continues to now run the HealthSpring business unit as well as the legacy Cigna Medicare Advantage business. So we actually view it positive that there's continuity as well as the ability to leverage that expertise with the legacy Cigna Medicare book of business. As it relates to philosophy, you could look back at the HealthSpring philosophy. They have a very disciplined approach the marketplace, trying  to create value, value for the customers in terms of the benefit design and partnership with the physician, good financial discipline and the commitment to maintain financial discipline and integrity. So they've not generated, over time, wild swings in their membership base. More, they've generated disciplined growth and disciplined earnings growth that go along with it, and you should expect that to continue from us. On a final note, I appreciate your point. We do look at the long-term value of relationships. And as we're able to expand the portfolio of services, there's additional programs and services we could offer, but that's an add-on. So no change in philosophy, continuing the HealthSpring philosophy of sustained profitable growth by delivering good value. And we'll leverage their expertise for the legacy Cigna book.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And I guess just the last point on that, HealthSpring had run MLRs that were very impressive. We talked about their care coordination and I think the reasons for that are pretty clear. As you think about minimum MLRs in '14 and I believe Herb and his team had spoken about that in the past, would you expect just some natural margin compression just due to the minimum MLRs that you get there, or is that a 2014 event for you?","David M. Cordani","Broadly thinking of it in the out years, number one. Secondly, as you know, as the MLRs are reconciled, there's a variety of services that are provided both by the physician as well as the health service or health insurance company. That all has to get washed through. But to your point, they've run very strong MLRs. We expect it will continue to run very strong MLRs. Some of the costs of doing that care coordination service and complementary services will go through some adjustment to the MLRs, and we expect to see some stepping as the rates get finalized as you look out to 2014.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Simpson with Morgan Stanley.","Douglas Simpson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Maybe if you could just touch a little bit on what you're hearing from large customers on the commercial side, just in terms of their view of benefits, their commitment to health insurance. And has that conversation changed in anyway? As we're getting closer 2014, how do you think the uncertainty around SCOTUS is potentially affecting their thought process there just as they're thinking about the benefits and maybe perhaps moving more to defined contribution model over time?","David M. Cordani","Doug, it's David. So a variety of moving parts, but in the macro picture. So to your macro point, how are employers thinking about their benefit strategies currently. Scene one I would give you is that just the increasing intensity and drumbeat over the last 2 years around employers, large, medium and increasingly small but you want the large employers, around incentive-based health improvement, engaging individuals. So if you move across that continuum, you ended on defined benefit, which I'll come to in a minute or defined contribution. You see employers moving along to get the incentives a bit more aligned with their employees. Secondly, employers are obviously watching what transpires in the regulatory landscape and know that if the rules are currently derived in 2014, there'll be in a marketplace out there, state and federal base exchanges, for small employers. Third, we do not see, we do not see a large drumbeat or momentum for employers to prepare to aggressively shift over to the exchanges. And a final note, we do see some employers beginning to explore how they might move to the next generation of incentive alignment, which is a bit more of a defined contribution model. Back to Cigna, what we like around that is as we're working around orienting our business model around the individual, consumer engagement and physician engagement, we believe those 2 consumer engagement and physician engagement models are going to be mission-critical whether they're in the current model, whether you're into more of a defined contribution model or evolving on to the fringe of the exchanges.","Douglas Simpson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great, that's helpful. And I'm not sure how to tie this into that question, but I'll just ask on VADBe. Just I apologize if you mentioned it earlier, I missed part of the call. But any new or different on VADBe and what should we be watching for there in terms of your efforts to potentially do something strategic there?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Doug, it's Ralph. Importantly, we continue to look at options to further reduce or eliminate the liability and we're very active in that area. And the structure that we did put in place regarding the separate legal entity that we well capitalized, coupled with enhancing some of our hedging strategies, is proving to be effective, so you'll continue to see us work at that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ana Gupte with Sanford Bernstein.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just following up on the last question, David, and your commentary on the select market, I guess, instead of small group market. You talked about the group market. You talked about defined benefit, the defined contribution. Can you comment on what's going on, on the fully insured to self-insured mix shift and how much that's contributing to your growth? And to what extent you think that'll impact the competitive environment in the fully insured market and the stop loss attachments? And then the recent regulatory pushback from the insurance commissioners on using these stop loss attached products and self-insured? And where do you think that might go?","David M. Cordani","Ana, you're correct. We run a part of our business called the select segment, to ground everybody. That is employers, broadly speaking, between 50 and 250 employees. By way of backdrop, a couple of questions you have in there. Last couple of years, think about our new business sales in there vacillating around 50\/50 between guaranteed cost and ASO stop loss, ticked above 50%. But again, right around 50\/50. I'll come to your regulatory question in a moment. What we find quite interesting in this segment is that when you bring that product to market, what you offer in that line segment is a new product and service that has higher level of transparency, more choice and benefit design and configuration, and very importantly, the ability to align the incentives with the employer, the individual and the health service company. The result we see is in the select segment for employers that have ASO and stop-loss. You see higher preventive services, higher wellness services, better overall costs, better overall productivity. To the specifics of your comment around the regulatory landscape, we're obviously very engaged in the regulatory landscape. We understand that there's dialogue amongst insurance commissioners around the configuration of stop-loss programs. Broadly to date, that conversation is focused on the 2 to 50 life employer segment. As you recall, that's a relatively small portion of our overall portfolio. We're still actively engaged with insurance commissioners, both at the national level and the local level, because we want to make sure that they understand all the facts in terms of how the programs work, and again, the benefits to employees and individuals of getting that transparency choice and incentive alignment.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Got it. And are the blues, I believe the blues in California are beginning to offer some of these stop-loss products. You think that might change the competitive landscape at all and is that likely to drive price competition in fully insured and in the stop-loss market with and without -- outside of health care.","David M. Cordani","Ana, as we started growing this segment of our portfolio meaningfully post the Great-West acquisition and the successful integration, we signaled them and we said we expect to see increasing competitive movement around these lines of business because this segment, historically, had only been a guaranteed cost or risk block of business. So we anticipated that. And you could see activities, you could see product filings, et cetera. And in a way, Ana, there's a positive byproduct of that because it creates more visibility to a unique product in the marketplace, and over the short term, creates more of a buzz and more demand. Over the intermediate to long term, like any other offering, it comes down to differentiation and innovation on our part. And we have a good head start on that product portfolio and intend to keep our lead in that product portfolio as the market changes.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just one final question on these -- the HIPAA 5010. Is that part of your prior period? And did you see any acceleration in claims in the fourth quarter? A couple of your competitors are reporting negative development here.","David M. Cordani","Ana, could you repeat? We didn't hear the first portion of your question. Can we ask you to repeat that? I'm sorry.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Yes, the HIPAA 5010, both Health Net and Humana had some negative development. I'm just curious whether that is part of your favorable PDP and do you see that despite this headwind?","David M. Cordani","Yes, broadly speaking, whether it's 5010 or other activities, as you know, there's a lot of regulatory compliance activity underway as a result of the new laws and regulations. We've got programs in place. We've made good progress. There's a lot of moving parts. The key to managing that is having good communication, good connectivity and good visibility with your trading partners. We've been able to secure that. And as such, have been able to kind of mute any unique impact tied to 5010 thus far. I would say our prior year development, specific to your point, that speaks to fundamentals, which have us continued positive fundamental improvement in the overall medical cost environment for the benefit of our clients and customers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christine Arnold with Cowen.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","On the ASO fees, it looks like the PMPM came down about 5%, but I have to kind of break out $9 million of health source ASO fees, so I'm not sure if I did math right. If the PMPM did come down, could you tell us why that would be? And then I understand you have 60,000 duals with HealthSpring. Can you confirm that? And how are you thinking about potential vulnerability with respect to those members excluding the opportunity, of course, to gain members?","David M. Cordani","Christine, very efficient question. You worked in a lot of components. It's David. First, relative to the fees, as you'll note, we have meaningful growth in the first quarter and we're very pleased with that, essentially all ASO growth. I'll point to a couple of things: one is the growth this year is toward the higher average case size. So when you look at our book of business, the higher the average case size, the lower the fees per life the nature of economics in the book of business. That's point one. The fees we're able to secure on the case we added are in line with our historical averages. Second piece, which is why you will see a little bit of a different pattern is very important for you to know, we do not have a full quarter's run rate of revenue in the first quarter. Why that is, a variety of points but the most important point is we added ASO life throughout the entire quarter. So we added January 1 business, February 1 business, March 1 business. So while you see the net membership, you're converting it back to a revenue base that's a little understated and the second quarter will get you more close to a run rate revenue base. As it relates to duals, your number is approximately correct. And as it relates to approach, strategically, we're approaching the dual population. As we indicated earlier, Cigna, that we believe that if we secured a leading set of clinical seniors capabilities that in our targeted geographies, we could pursue Medicaid, ABD, Medicaid -- Medicare dual population, et cetera. So we see that as an opportunity going forward and we'll pursue that on a state-by-state basis tied to our Go Deep strategy. We'll leverage the organic capabilities that HealthSpring has, both their leading Medicare capabilities as well as their Medicaid capabilities. And finally, Christine, in targeted geographies, we will evaluate partnership opportunities where you can bring best-in-class Medicare and clinical capabilities that HealthSpring brings with -- if appropriate, from a targeted standpoint, a leading Medicaid player.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And are there regions where you view the 60,000 duals you have as vulnerable? Like what portion of that do you think, if you don't get a partner, you're at risk of losing over the next, say, 2 years, 18 months?","David M. Cordani","Christine, I wouldn't flag any unique geography or dynamic. The HealthSpring business model is deployed in beyond, but arguably think about 15 major markets and there's duals in a variety of those markets and a lot of active engagement with regulators and the legislative leaders locally as well as nationally. Very importantly, to put the beneficiary front and center, and these are beneficiaries who are getting a very positive service experience today that have continuity with their physicians. So I wouldn't highlight any geography or immediacy of threat there currently.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Couple of questions on HealthSpring here. You mentioned that there was a benefit from a change in the amortization assumption. How much was that?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Kevin, it's Ralph. It's about $16 million after-tax for the full year, yes, for the full year. And so you could prorate that for the 2 months in the first quarter.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And that's, I guess, the same thought process though about future changes in amortization kind of down 10% to 15% from this level into next year? Offset by the fact they have more months.","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Yes. That's right. You can think of this as essentially the guidance we gave you last time was a preliminary estimate. Now it's been refined and finalized and the shape of the amortization curve over time, you would expect to see still in the 10% to 15% on the lower end of that going into next year because we're going to pick up 12 months of HealthSpring as opposed to the shorter period this year, but that's the right way to look at it.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. That number is kind of more in line with what we were initially thinking. So just another question and you kind of addressed this a little bit in regards to Josh's earlier question. I just wanted to flesh out a little bit more. You mentioned a couple of times that you're excited about expanding HealthSpring's offerings beyond its existing footprint. And with the 2013 rates out, is that a 2013 opportunity or do you feel like that is still -- 2013's still about integration and it's more 2014 that you're really going to be able to see the expanding of the footprint?","David M. Cordani","Kevin, it's David. Think about it through 2 dimensions and maybe let me restate the base. Job one is to make sure that the fundamentals of the business and the inherent momentum in the business remains and stays strong, so there's good, strong fundamental growth and early progress there. So now, you do the add-on. The add-on's twofold. One is in targeted geographies, leveraging the HealthSpring's unique physician relationships and engagement relationships for new commercial solutions in existing HealthSpring markets. Secondly is the HealthSpring model for Medicare Advantage in new geographies. Think about the opportunity to get some movement in the first category, the commercial category in '13. Think about the Medicare Advantage because of the contractual cycle, et cetera being more of a '14 environment, and obviously, both of them carrying on a go-forward basis.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Styblo with Jefferies.","David A. Styblo - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I'm in for Windley right now. I had 2 for you. The first one was on the spending in the Health Care segment that you guys had flagged of being about $30 million. Could you elaborate more on if that spending is done or is that going to carry over into other quarters? And then how should we think about the benefit in the back half of this year as well as for '13? The second question is on your International outlook. You had a benefit, I think, it was $8 million in the first quarter, but that didn't seem to flow through into the guidance. Has that stayed the same? Can you tell me about the dynamics, if something is offsetting that or what's going on in that regard?","David M. Cordani","I'll start on the spending and I'll turn it over to Ralph, ask him to kind of shape it a little bit for you in terms of how to think about it for the year. And then I'll ask Ralph to give it back to me to talk about International because that's a different topic. But specifically relative to the spending, we had some planned targeted investments back in our technology infrastructure on a couple of discrete programs to garner efficiency gains on a go-forward basis. We expected the bulk of the spending in the first quarter, some of it continues clearly into the second quarter. And they're tied to 2 discrete programs where we'll be moving some technology platforms, one is around telephony and telecom network and data network. The second's around some support technology and infrastructure for staff-facing functions. They both tied to discrete vendors in contractual terms, which is why we're flagging the efficiency gains as we go into the second half of the year. I'll ask Ralph to give you a little bit more color to kind of shape how the patterns is going to unfold.","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Sure. Thanks, David. So we average -- the expense ratio in the quarter was 24.3 and it guided to the reduction on the full year. And there's a lot of moving parts here with the mix of revenues and within the businesses, but you should expect to see some of the step down in Q2. But as David mentioned, we are still spending against some of these cost efficiency opportunities into the second quarter. And then you'll see us in the back half step down further as the cost efficiencies take hold. So from the first quarter some reduction in the second quarter, a combination of slightly lower pace of spend as well as picking up 3 months at HealthSpring, which, just from a mix standpoint, brings the average down. And then the benefits in the back half of the year will shape how the OpEx ratio works.","David M. Cordani","David, on the International piece, you're correct and as Ralph identified, the capital deployment strategy, there's a onetime benefit. There's also a run rate benefit. To you macro point, first, the International business continues to perform extremely well. Very attractive top line growth, strong margins, good bottom line contribution. The program that was referenced in terms of the capital deployment strategies, part of our planned initiatives, so we planned for this. We've worked this. We've delivered it. And it's important to think about these as opportunities for future value creation because we created a more efficient environment. And for an asset that is growing at the rate this asset is growing at, it'll create some meaningful contributions looking forward. As it relates to the earnings outlook for the International segment, no change in our expectations other than we continue to believe that the assets are going to demonstrate 20% to 30% growth, which we're quite pleased with in this environment.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So on International, it's more of a function that was already reflected in your guidance. It wasn't something along the lines that this is a surprise then?","David M. Cordani","Absolutely. Very planned and deliberate activity in our part.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Wright with Monness, Crespi, Hardt.","Brian Wright","Did the guaranteed cost MCR in the quarter benefit any at all from the release of 2011 minimum MLR rebate accruals?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","No, the guaranteed cost in the quarter?","Brian Wright","Correct.","Ralph J. Nicoletti","No.","Brian Wright","No material or none at all?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Nonmaterial really.","David M. Cordani","None at all actually.","Brian Wright","None at all, okay. And then, lastly, can you kind of size the magnitude of the second half versus first half kind of waiting on earnings that you would mention just to fine tune some modeling?","David M. Cordani","All right, let me just start, just at the macro level. If you think about the earnings drivers, so we'll try to give you some of the earnings drivers as you think about on a go-forward basis and Ralph highlighted some of this in his prepared remarks, but at a macro level. One, from a health care standpoint, the PDP business is a highly seasonal business. Our PDP book is now doubled with acquisition of HealthSpring. So the first thing I'd ask you to think about is we can't tell you how to model, but how you're thinking about that. Secondly, Ralph just walked through very clearly the operating expense ratio pattern, what's in the first quarter and how it's going to shape throughout the course of the year. Third is for ASO block of business, as we referenced in a prior question, we'll get some additional revenue leverage because the first quarter does not have a full quarter's contribution of the revenue, and we'll get some additional specialty contribution as we ramp throughout the course of the year. On a final note, there'll be a little bit of an offset to this as you think about your modeling. We flagged that we believe that there may be a little bit of pressure in the risk book of business as it relates to the volumes. And finally, there is some seasonality to that MLR. So those would be the 5 levers I'd ask you to think about: PDP pattern; the operating expenses that Ralph walked through the expense ratio very clearly; some ramping in the ASO contribution, driven by revenue leverage; as well as specialty contribution, offset somewhat by the volume of the risk business; and the seasonality in the risk business.","Brian Wright","Okay. I'm not exactly sure what -- we're talking magnitude, so it's still a little vague. But maybe we can talk off-line in a little bit.","Operator","Our final question comes from Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First question, just thought -- wanted to see if you can highlight a bit on your strategy for growth in the public sector part of the commercial marketplace. I know you had some wins there recently. Maybe, first, just talk about how much of the 800,000 adds in commercial are coming from the public sector market? And sort of how much more opportunity you have there? And what do you think is driving some of the growth in that market for you?","David M. Cordani","Scott, it's David. The public sector -- so we get a common definition, when I hear public sector and commercial, the way we think about it is states, cities, counties, other governmental agencies. So that's how I'm going to address the point. We lead and manage that business as a part of our middle market or regional segment. The reason why we do that, which is different than some of our competitors, we do that because we believe it's a highly localized and very locally intimate event. Over the last several years, we've had meaningful success in that space, specifically tied to 2 things: one, our Go Deep approach, so targeting specific geographies, not just states, but MSAs; and then secondly, identifying, call them public sector employers, who are looking for different solutions. They're looking for health engagement. They're looking for health improvement. They're looking for productivity programs. That doesn't mean they're buying a CDHP program. May or may not, but they're looking for a involved [ph] solutions. We see increased demand from that standpoint and increased focus and traction from our standpoint in that area. So we continue to be pleased that it's yielding results from our Go Deep approach and kind of our local intimacy, and buyers are revolving around the value proposition. Directionally, if we added 800,000 lives, think about 20%, 25% of that is in the range contributed by these diverse buyers. So don't just think states, think states, cities, counties and other derivatives of municipalities, and very importantly, in targeted geographies where we're seeking to grow the broader portfolio.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, and then just had one follow-up. Just on maybe how we think about your thought process on the buyback program given that you improved the view on parent company deployable cash for the year?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Sure, Scott. The overall capital deployment priorities haven't changed. The focus on, first, the core operating of the business. We look at M&A opportunities, particularly to expand whether the capabilities in geographies or in the seniors or the individual and retail side, so those are our priority areas and we continue to focus there. And then I think our track record shows over time, we'll deploy cash for those priorities as well as return to share owners -- return to shareholders through buyback as well. But it's a dynamic process and it's always based on the outlook that we have on the prospects of those priorities and where we need to deploy the funds.","Operator","I will now turn the call back over to Mr. David Cordani for closing remarks.","David M. Cordani","First off, thank you for your questions today and your continued interest in Cigna. I just want to emphasize a few key points from our discussion. Our first quarter results exceeded our expectations in earnings and in medical customer growth, resulting in a stronger capital position at the end of the quarter. We also accelerated investments in our technology infrastructure, which we expect to start to yield efficiency gains in the second half of this year and ongoing into 2013 and beyond. Our integration with HealthSpring is progressing well. And based on the strength of our first quarter results, we're increasing our full year outlook for earnings as well as customer growth. I'd also note that our business model is built to thrive in today's dynamic business environment. And finally, I'm confident in our ability to achieve our full year 2012 strategic, financial and operating goals. With that, we thank you again for joining today's call, and we look forward to our future discussions.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Cigna's First Quarter 2012 Results Review.

At this time, all callers are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedures on how to enter the queue to ask questions at that time.","As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the question-and-answer session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Will McDowell. Please go ahead, Mr. McDowell.","William McDowell - Cigna Corp.","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I am Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom McCarthy, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer.","In our remarks today, David and Tom will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's third quarter 2016 financial results, as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2016. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses first certain financial measures which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. Specifically, we use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and earnings per share on this same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, shareholders' net income, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com.","In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2016 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.","Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, I note that in the third quarter, we recorded two charges to shareholders' net income, which we reported as special items. The first special item was an after-tax charge of $46 million or $0.18 per share for merger-related transaction costs. The second special item was an after-tax charge of $25 million or $0.10 per share related to a litigation matter.","As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations in our discussion of third quarter 2016 results. Also, consistent with past practices, when we make any prospective comments on earnings or EPS outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future capital deployment or additional prior-year development of medical costs.","And with that, I will turn the call over to David.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Thanks, Will, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll begin with a review of highlights from the third quarter. I will also discuss how our ability to anticipate and meet customer and client needs through innovation, engagement and value-based programs continue to drive our business performance. Then I'll discuss how our well-positioned businesses continue to deliver strong results for the benefit of our shareholders and how we are driving improvements for our businesses that are currently underperforming their potential. We were doing all of this while we continue to prepare for the future by investing in capabilities that meet customers' needs and while we continue to support the litigation process with our proposed Anthem combination.","Next, Tom will provide more detail around our third quarter financial performance and our full year outlook. And following your questions, I'll conclude our conversation with just a few closing remarks.","Let's begin with some highlights from the quarter. Our third quarter 2016 consolidated revenue increased 5% to $9.9 billion over the third quarter 2015. We reported adjusted income from operations for the third of $503 million or $1.94 per share reflecting strong performance in our Commercial Health Care and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses and improving results in our Group Disability and Life segment.","Our actions continue to be guided by our proven strategy of Go Deep, Go Global, Go Individual, with a focus on anticipating and meeting the needs of our customers and clients through ongoing innovation and a commitment to being a trusted partner, as well as continuing investments for future growth and capabilities, which deliver affordable, personalized solutions and further expand our geographic reach.","Around the world, individuals are seeking access to quality health care and sense-of-security programs that are both of high quality and affordable. At the same time, employers of all sizes and across all industries and geographies increasingly recognize that healthier, more engaged and productive workforces are essential to driving their businesses forward, while they continue to seek solutions that are affordable and sustainable.","Amid this backdrop, many individuals and employers are concerned that they must accept either constrained access or diminished quality, or both, in order to achieve affordability of care. At Cigna, we see it differently. We have demonstrated that quality and affordability can be achieved by designing personally tailored access and high-quality care delivery with engagement, alignment and support for individuals and health care professionals.","We deliver this through personalized and localized benefits as well services for our customers, which empower and support their actions and decision-making and enable them to find the right balance of access, quality and affordability. At the same time, we support health care personals with actionable insights and further expanded care resources, all the while ensuring alignment with them to deliver superior quality and improved affordability.","To further innovate for our customers and clients, we are accelerating investments in value-based care programs and incentive payment models with our provider partners that continue to drive enhancements in both care quality and affordability. For example, today, we have 160 collaborative accountable care arrangements, which span 29 states. And we serve well over 2 million customers in these value-based programs. Our success in driving increased affordability is reflected in our continued delivery of industry-leading medical cost trend.","In support of that, 82% of our more mature collaborative relationships with large physician groups have outperformed the market in total medical cost. This leadership in physician partnership was also most recently validated through Cigna's first place ranking amongst 214 companies in athenahealth's provider satisfaction survey.","Our ability to anticipate, identify and help satisfy these needs continues to resonate with our customers and clients as well as our provider partners. Importantly, across all of our businesses, our customer and client experience remains at high levels. As a result, retention remains strong, and this presents ongoing opportunities for further expansion of our customer and client relationships. Importantly, these long-term relationships allow us to support individuals more meaningfully across their life and health stages.","Now, relative to our businesses, we have an opportunity to improve performance. Throughout the third quarter, we made solid progress in our efforts to improve the financial results of our Group Disability and Life segment. As the model begins to mature, this will lead to a further differentiated customer experience.","Relative to Cigna-HealthSpring, we continue to make progress in the CMS audit remediation work. Our focus remains on completing this work and growing our business with industry-leading collaborative relationships, all to drive positive outcomes for the benefit of seniors. We expect to emerge from this work with a stronger, more sustainable model that ensures seniors will continue to receive the highest quality service experience and clinical outcomes.","So to summarize, our well-performing businesses continue to deliver strong results, and we are driving improvements where needed. This, combined with our ongoing investments for the future and our tremendous capital resources positions us with strength and flexibility to deliver sustained value for customers and clients and differentiated results for our shareholders.","Now, as we look forward to 2017, we expect to deliver attractive financial performance and growth. We see a number of earnings tailwinds, including continued strong performance of our Global Health Care and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses, with high customer retention levels and solid revenue and earnings growth. Second, more meaningful improvement in the margin for our Disability and Life business. And third, meaningful margin improvement for our Seniors business. With the ramp down of remediation costs, we'll more than offset the headwind caused by the revenue reductions that we expect for 2017 in this business.","As always, there may be variability in 2017 in the rate and pace of both medical utilization as well as the pace of our strategic investments. When we take the tailwinds and headwinds as a whole and consider our significant capital position and ongoing strong free cash flow generation, we are well-positioned for an attractive 2017.","Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to reiterate some of the key points from my remarks this morning. Cigna's operating a well-positioned, diversified portfolio of businesses dedicated to meeting our customers' needs and delivering value through engagement, incentive alignment and support services.","As we look ahead to 2017, we will continue our momentum in our well-performing businesses and improve the results in some of our historical strong businesses. Our long-term objective remains commitment to our annual growth of 10% to 13% EPS on average, all while we continue to invest back in our company. And the high levels of ongoing free cash flow generated from our diverse business portfolio and tremendous capital resources available for deployment give us a strong degree of flexibility to pursue further value-creation options for our shareholders.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas A. McCarthy - Cigna Corp.","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will briefly review key aspects of Cigna's third quarter 2016 results and discuss our outlook for the full year.","Key financial highlights in the quarter are: consolidated revenues of $9.9 billion, consolidated earnings of $503 million, quarterly earnings per share of $1.94, and continued strong free cash flow and financial flexibility. This quarter's result reflects continued strong revenue and earnings contributions from our Commercial Health Care and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses and improved results in our Group Disability and Life business.","Regarding our business segments, I will first comment on Global Health Care. Third quarter premiums and fees in Global Health Care grew to $6.8 billion. Third quarter earnings were $416 million, reflecting continued strong performance in our Commercial business driven by customer growth, strong specialty results and favorable medical cost outcomes. Offsetting these strong Commercial results were elevated costs in our Government business related to our CMS audit response and some loss ratio pressure primarily in our Medicaid offerings in Texas and Illinois.","Turning to our Global Supplemental Benefits business, premiums and fees grew 9% and earnings of $81 million represent growth of 31% quarter-over-quarter or 25% on a currency-adjusted basis, reflecting business growth and strong operating expense discipline. This business continues to achieve attractive growth and profitability as we deliver value to our customers with personalized and affordable offerings in the supplemental benefit space.","For Group Disability and Life, third quarter results reflect premium and fee growth of 4% over third quarter 2015. Third quarter earnings in our Group business were $53 million, reflecting stabilized claim experience in our Life book of business and sequential improvement in disability results as the claim process modifications we made earlier this year continue to mature. Additionally, we completed our annual Disability reserve review in the third quarter. And consistent with our commentary last quarter, this review had de minimis impact on results.","Overall, our third quarter results reflect strong revenue and earnings contributions from our Commercial Health Care and Global Supplemental Benefits businesses and an improvement in our Group Disability and Life results with some elevated cost in our Government business. We also continue to generate very strong free cash flow from our businesses and have significant financial flexibility.","Now, I will discuss our outlook for 2016. We continue to expect consolidated revenues to grow in the mid-single digit percentage range over 2015 results. Our outlook for full year 2016 consolidated adjusted income from operations is now in the range of approximately $2.025 billion to $2.095 billion, or $7.80 to $8.05 per share.","We now expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of $1.84 billion to $1.87 billion. This reflects continued strong performance in our Commercial Health Care business offset by a reduction of $60 million from previous expectations in our Government business due to higher than previously anticipated costs associated with our CMS audit response as well as loss ratio pressure in our Medicaid business. The assumptions reflected in our Global Health Care earnings outlook for 2016 include the following. Regarding Global Medical customers, we continue to expect growth in the low-single-digit percentage range in 2016.","Turning to medical costs, for our total U.S. Commercial book of business, we now expect full year medical cost trend to be in the range of 4% to 5%, a 50 basis point improvement over our previous expectations. We continue to deliver medical costs that reflect better health outcomes and strong clinical excellence for our customers and clients as a result of our deep collaborative relationships with physicians and our focus on personalization.","Now, turning to our medical care ratio outlook. For our total Commercial book of business, we continue to expect the 2016 MCR to be in the range of 78.5% to 79.5%, reflecting continued strong performance in our Commercial Employer business. Consistent with past years, our outlook anticipates a sequentially higher fourth quarter MCR due to an increase seasonal impact from the growing share of high deductible plans in our Employer group and Individual businesses.","For our total Government book of business, we now expect the 2016 MCR to be in the range of 84.5% to 85.5%, reflecting some pressure in our Medicaid offerings in Texas and Illinois.","Regarding operating expenses, we continue to expect our 2016 Global Health Care operating expense ratio to be in the range of 21% to 22%, which continues to include the impact of spending on our CMS audit response. For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we continue to expect strong top line growth and now expect earnings in the range of $275 million to $285 million, an increase over our previous outlook.","Regarding the Group Disability and Life business, we now expect full year 2016 earnings in the range of $80 million to $110 million. This also represents an increase in our earnings expectations for Group. Regarding our remaining operations, that is Other Operations and Corporate, we now expect a loss of $170 million for 2016.","So, all in, for full year 2016, we now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $2.025 billion to $2.095 billion or $7.80 to $8.05 per share. I would also remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of additional prior-year reserve development or any future capital deployment.","Regarding free cash flow, year to date, we have repurchased 785,000 shares of common stock for $110 million. We ended the quarter with parent company cash of approximately $2.2 billion. After considering all sources and uses of parent company funds, we expect to have approximately $2.75 billion in parent cash available during the balance of the year, including $250 million held for liquidity purposes. Our balance sheet and free cash flow outlook remain strong.","Now, to recap. We continued to invest in capabilities and programs across our businesses, which will deliver significant growth opportunities into the future. Our third quarter 2016 results reflect strength in our diversified portfolio of global businesses marked by continued positive momentum in our Employer business, Commercial Employer and Global Supplemental Benefits business as well as improvement in our Group Disability and Life business. In our Government business, the increased investments that we are making with regard to our audit response ensure that we are well-positioned for long-term growth.","Overall, we are confident in our ability to achieve our full year 2016 earnings outlook and are well-positioned for attractive earnings growth in 2017.","With that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. Good morning. I was hoping you could give us some more detail on how you're doing with the Group Insurance business. Obviously, the earnings came in better than we were expecting for this quarter. What should we expect \u2013 realizing you've given us a range, what should we expect directionally for the fourth quarter and going into 2017?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Good morning. It's David. Just by way of direction, first, we're pleased with the improvement and performance in the third quarter. As we indicated previously, we expect the improvements to continue to be driven throughout the third quarter, fourth quarter and into 2017. There's always some variability in it, hence the range for the business outlook for the full year, but our expectation is throughout 2017, we'd see continued improvement and stabilization in our Disability business and putting us in the right step-up position as we look to 2018. Adding to that, as we look to 2017, we would expect stable and consistent Life results. And I'd note that we saw an appropriate step up in those results in the third quarter.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So, results so far on the Life side would confirm your earlier view that it was a once every decade or several years' fluctuation rather than something systemic?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Matthew, as you recall from the second quarter call, we indicated that the really significant spike took place quite early in the second quarter. And we even saw a reversion back toward the latter part of the second quarter. That pattern continued through the third quarter. We're pleased with our Life results and expect that to continue as we look forward.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And would you say \u2013 at this point, would you think that this \u2013 in terms of getting back to the \u2013 can you get back to the margin that you were at in the 2013 to 2015 time period for your Group Insurance business overall by the time you get to 2018?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Matthew, clearly, we're not giving you 2018 guidance, but first, by way of backdrop, the Disability portion of this business is a very strong and well-performing business that focuses on productivity solutions for employers. At this point, we fully expect that as we fully mature this model, we will be able to get back to our sustained margin goals.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Let me just ask one question on a different topic, which is as you look ahead to next year, on Medicare and the Star score results, what odds do you think you'll have of either getting CMS to maybe rethink the approach that they'd taken on the Star scores for impacting you in 2018 versus what you can do whether it's cross-walking or rather activities to offset that?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Matthew, I actually compliment your efficiency getting in so many questions. Relative to the Stars Rating, by way of backdrop, we're pleased and proud with the position we've developed for ourselves. 2016, 60% of our lives were four STAR+PLUS. 2017, 75%. Per your comment, the current view is that the Stars Rating would step down for 2018, specifically because of the audit process. To be quite clear here, we do not agree with those conclusions, nor do we accept those. In fact, our clinical and service measures reinforce a very positive outcome for the benefit of our seniors and our physician partners. And we're going to use a variety of approaches to resolve that issue, because again, we don't accept that outcome.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Borsch. Our next question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS. You may ask your question.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Hello, everybody. First, a detailed question and a follow-up. The $60 million of headwind around the government business, I know part of it's audit cost and part of it sounds like it's this Medicaid issue. I think, last quarter, you said the audit costs were about $30 million. Were they similar in this quarter? And can you expand a little bit on the Medicaid issue?","Thomas A. McCarthy - Cigna Corp.","Sure, A.J. So, your recollection from last quarter is right, and I'd say the cost in this quarter were little higher than that. And if we look at the $60 million, which was the change in expectation for the full year, I'd split that about 50-50 between Medicaid and additional remediation costs.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Any color on what's happening in Medicaid?","Thomas A. McCarthy - Cigna Corp.","Oh, sure. So, first, again, let's put it in context. Medicaid is a small business for us, essentially just the dual SNP programs in Texas and the dual demonstration project in Illinois. And we did report an increased MCR in both Texas and Illinois this quarter. Different dynamics in each market. Texas included pressure from the long-term support service costs. In Illinois, we're seeing some rate pressure and more significant mix of higher-acuity patients than we'd expected.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And maybe my follow up to stay sort of in the government area. it's been a while since we had a company have to go through the Open Enrollment under sanctions. Can you just remind us on the ground what can you do to retain your membership and keep others from going after that? And when we get through the end of Open Enrollment, when you're thinking about 2017, is whatever enrollment you end up with, is that where you think you'll be for the year? I mean I guess, that entails when you think you might get resolution on the sanctions as well, but any thoughts on that would be helpful.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","A.J., good morning. Relative to your framing of your question. First, by way of backdrop, you're correct. Our working assumption is that we will not be participating in the Open Enrollment period. Specific to the actions, I'm not going to delineate the specific actions you can or cannot take. There's clear rules in terms of what you can do, in terms of what's the marketing versus retention activities.","I think the most important thing to highlight is within our model, you'll recall that our model is largely based where the majority of our lives are in terms of very mature physician collaborative models, hence those customers or members have very deep relationships with those physician groups. That is a highly retentive tool. Not perfect, but it's a highly retentive tool, because there's deep relationships that have been built, there's expanded services and the like.","So, while we expect attrition, and as I noted in my prepared remarks, we're planning for a revenue headwind in 2017 that will be offset by the attrition of the remediation costs. We expect retention to perform better than the historical norms of a sanctioned environment. As it relates to 2017, as soon as we're off sanctions, we'll be back in the monthly enrollment process, and we look forward to that environment.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. All right then. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Rice. Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Barclays. Your line is open. You may ask your question.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Just want to start on the comments around 2017 being attractive financially and maybe juxtapose that with the 10% to 13% long-term growth. Is that attractive, meaning you expect to be within that range? And then what base should we be using for 2016? Maybe if Tom could give us sort of a run rate 2016 once we take out all the remediation costs that are extra, and any favorable development, or negative development as well, and maybe the Life and Disability side.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Josh, good morning. It's David. Let me give you just a little bit more color in terms of the drivers, as we think about moving from 2016 to 2017. And I appreciate your reframing our long-term commitment of the 10% to 13% on average, which we've delivered on average over the last half a dozen years. Specifically, we see three. We call it the three largest, meaningful tailwinds that are specific and compelling.","Number one is the continued leverage of our well performing businesses, specifically our U.S. Employer Health Care business, and our Global Individual business, where we expect to continue to deliver attractive both revenue and earnings growth. Second is a meaningful step up in the margin performance of the Group Disability and Life business. And third is margin expansion in the Government business, where, largely, the attrition of the cost profile that we've incurred this year, which was significant will more than offset the revenue headwind.","It's important to attach on top of that, that's going to take place under one or two environments: will either be in a so called Plan A, where we're able to effectuate the combination and we're stepping into a different environment; or a so-called Plan B, where the government will stop and impede us in terms of the ability to combine.","In a Plan B scenario, our estimate is towards the latter part of 2017, we'll have between $7 billion and $14 billion of deployable capital, which is made up of about $5 billion of free cash at the latter part of 2017, leverage that we could step up to one threshold if we're going to use it solely for internal purposes, dividend buy back and the like. And the higher end of the range is if we're going to use leverage largely to expand our self through M&A capacity. So, taken as a whole, a significant uptick.","I don't think it's constructive on this call to try to scroll the numbers around on the underlying run rate. Suffice to say 2016 is a choppy year for us, 2017 will be quite attractive. And if we expect to deliver certain numbers on average since this year is not an average year from a transition, we'd expect to have a very strong performance for 2017.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I'm sorry, David, is there a way to just parse that, maybe you don't have to give what you think the run rate, but just any extraordinary numbers this year? You're talking about the remediation costs. Obviously, that's a \u2013 I don't know if that's $70 million or so, or any way to just size the one-timers at least?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Let me give you two chunks to try to be helpful here. Chunk one will go to the remediation cost. Our best estimate for the full year is approximately $100 million after-tax. So, when we talk significant, it's significant because our objective is to effectively and rapidly \u2013 and speed is always in the eyes of the beholder, but effectively and rapidly resolve this and use whatever resource is necessary to put this behind us. So, think about $100 million after-tax, which is significant.","Secondly, you know us quite well. And you know even with the revised outlook for our Group Disability and Life business, the earnings dislocation there is significant. And if you will just project forward a mindset that our view is a stable and consistent performance of the Life business, that's a meaningful step up. And then continued improvement in the Disability business. There's a significant step up, or an example to your point of a one-time dislocation, when you would compare 2016 to 2017, albeit, we don't expect to be at full earnings potential in 2017 because Disability will ramp throughout the course of the year. Those are two items I'd ask you to focus on.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Perfect.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Raskin. Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning. First question, just to kind of tie out the whole CMS audit stuff. I wanted to ask, at what point do you think the work's going to be complete here, David? And then for \u2013 you put that $100 million number out there for the year. Is there any of it that you think remains in 2017, or does it all go away?","And then you talked about being better than average. And I went back to Aetna and Health Net when they were out of the market, and I think they lost about 20% of their membership during Open Enrollment, while they were on sanction. Is that the bogie you're comparing yourself to when you're saying you're going to be better than average? And any kind of way that would give us directionality on that would be great.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Yeah. Justin, a few different comments there. First, by way of context. So, this is obviously a complex undertaking. And as I noted, as the $100 million reinforces, it's complex in terms of what we're confronting here.","We confronted an audit process that was changed and modernized for CMS, so a new audit methodology. We operate a business model that functions off the more modern collaborative or value-based environment. And what that means is we have a lot of partners. Think about entities that we work with in partnership to get that value-based environment, and think about the better part of a couple hundred. So, the ability to operate in this more modernized audit environment relative to that, which we believe is a big part of what the future of health care looks like required us to drive some changes. We're driving those changes, and we'll seek to get those resolved in short order. So, we think we're in the latter phases, point one.","Two, we believe the large majority of those costs will not be re-occurring, that otherwise will be contributors to 2017's earnings or the margin inflection. And third, we fully expect our retention levels to outperform the numbers that you referenced, largely based on the different orientation we have of our model. And we could look back and look at the retentive nature of our business over a long period of time and those relationships.","So, while we expect a revenue headwind that will be meaningful, our revenue headwind projection is not in line with the numbers you made reference to. And we think it's largely driven by the different model we have, whereby once our customers are with us a year or more, they tend to be with us for a long, long time, largely because of those collaborative relationships.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. And then just a quick follow-up on the Health Care earnings. I understand, obviously, there are some headwinds and tailwinds going into next year on the Medicare side, but the increase in the remediation costs, I mean, basically, you took down Health Care by $60 million. I'm curious when you \u2013 we normally think about your Health Care business as a mid-to-high single-digit grower. Would it be reasonable to think that you'd grow in that capacity off of the original guidance, given that Medicaid and the CMS audit increases would seem to be transitory, or should we think about that growth coming off the new $1.840 billion to $1.870 billion guidance? Thanks.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Justin, we're not providing the detailed guidance for 2017. We look forward to doing that on our year-end call. But I think there's two important points you teased out. One, noted in my prepared comments, we continue to feel quite good about our Employer Health Care business, and that Employer Health Care business has continued to perform well as the marketplace looks for more engagement, more affordability solutions, more partnership solutions.","And we would expect to see continued strong performance relative to our top line as well as our bottom line. And I'd ask you to think about our historical performance there. And I think you made reference to that. If you extract out the Government portion of the business, that's been lumpy beyond a shadow of a doubt. And we expect to see a step up in earnings next year, so I'd ask you to pull those two pieces apart as you think about your 2017. Clearly, we'll provide guidance at the end of the year as we go into our fourth quarter call.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Lake. Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks. Just a couple of questions. One, on the same topic, just the progression of the Global Health Care earnings through the year. I just want to make sure I understand. So, if we look at the first quarter, net income in the segment, up about $100 million. 2Q was down $42 million. Third quarter is down $66 million. The issues you've cited through the year have been individual market, Medicaid, the MA audit costs. But then as I look to the fourth quarter, it looks like you're looking for flat to plus $30 million year-over-year. So, just trying to understand that piece, why does it improve in the 4Q on a trend basis?","Thomas A. McCarthy - Cigna Corp.","Gary, a couple of things. First, you've cited the quarter-over-quarter variance in the third quarter. And you've got that right. And that's largely driven by the Medicaid and remediation costs. As we look to the fourth quarter, again the remediation costs we expect to moderate. The fundamentals in the fourth quarter kind of continue to be the same, very strong underlying Employer business, really not much news on the Individual side, a little bit of timing difference in the Group Disability and Life and Global Sub business. But that's generally the picture for the balance of the year.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Second question, just going back to Disability for a moment, David. I think when you had the issue in the 2Q, you were very clear that in the Disability claims you're not having a frequency issue. It's primarily a duration of claims issue caused by the disruption. So, as we look at this nice sequential improvement, is that where we'd be looking to that claims duration has improved sequentially?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Gary, appreciate the framing. Two dimensions here, so we're at the same convention. There's claims that are presented, there's validated claims, we call those occurrences or open claims, and then there's closed claims. So, point one is throughout the course of the year, we have not seen a different pattern. Again, we have not seen a different pattern of the volume of claims that present themselves for consideration. So, that's, I think, your first point.","As we changed our model, we saw more claims go from that first bucket of potential claims to activated claims, open claims, because of the disruption of our process. So, that's disruption point number one. Disruption point number two is more claims stayed open or active for an elongated period of time because of the disruption. If I understand your question, if you think about the third quarter, we're seeing, again, no change in the number that are presenting themselves for consideration but improvement in that bucket two and bucket three, which are validated claims that are opened, and the rate and pace in which claims are closed. And we expect over time that pattern to continue.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Perfect. Thank you","Operator","Thank you Mr. Taylor. Our next question comes from Christine Arnold with Cowen. You may ask your question.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, there. With respect to the Medicare Advantage book, was the MLR elevated there at all? And as we go through Open Enrollment and experience some attrition, should we expect any impact on the MLR owing to the sanctions, or is it just a revenue issue?","Thomas A. McCarthy - Cigna Corp.","Christine, it's Tom. So, I would answer your last question first. I would expect the impact from sanctions will largely be in revenue. The position engagement model in HealthSpring continues to deliver strong medical costs consistently throughout the year. On a year-to-date basis the Medicare results are about flat MCR-wise, which again reflects that consistent strong performance as we commented on last time. Last time, there's a little bit of a higher MCR in some of the expansion markets, some of the less engaged markets, but generally consistent with our expectations for the year.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","And it sounds like the improvement from second to third quarter in D&L was \u2013 both Life and Disability. Is there any way to parse out how much we saw improvement in Life versus Disability and \u2013 so, we can get a sense for how much more Disability is going to drive improvement or \u2013 and have we maximized our Life experience? Are we back to normal there?","Thomas A. McCarthy - Cigna Corp.","Well \u2013 look, again, last quarter, we highlighted we had significant variability in Life, so obviously more of the improvement sequentially has come from Life just getting back to normal, and in fact that kind of is the headline. Life business, back to normal expectations, Disability improving.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you Ms. Arnold. Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sure. I want to go back to the headwinds and tailwinds for 2017. I guess, you didn't mention Medicaid improvement as a tailwind to 2017, so does that mean that you're not expecting improvement there? And then as far as the headwind, I think the only headwind I heard you mention was MA membership attrition. Is that really kind of the only meaningful headwind that you expect for 2017?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Kevin, good morning. It's David. You're correct. There's a variety of items, we didn't mention. So, there's always some smaller puts and takes. What we tried to call out were the three compelling major drivers. So, there's going to be other small puts and takes. And you should expect that if we're underperforming in Medicaid, we'd expect to take actions to slightly improve that as we move forward. But it's a small portion of our business, and in the scope of the moving parts that we talked about, those are the three items I'd ask you to consider relative to the fundamentals, with the fourth being the just tremendous capital deployment opportunity that sits in front of us.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. But it sounded like you said that the Medicaid was half of the government issue in the quarter and that you took down Health Care by $60 million, so it's not right to think that Medicaid was a $30 million drag?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Relative to the current year, we're feeling the pressure relative to the Medicaid number. All the other fundamentals are holding. If you look at the year to date, our Medicare number, as Tom noted, is performing cleanly year-over-year in totality with some puts and takes. Our PDP results improved somewhat. Our Medicaid results eroded somewhat.","As we project forward to next year, again, we would expect to take actions to improve the Medicaid numbers, but the size of that delta in a well over $2 billion after-tax earnings franchise, what we're trying to call out here, these are the three discrete drivers that are most significant. There'll be some other puts and takes, absolutely. And you're correct, we would expect to improve that result as well.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And I guess my last question on your bids for next year, for MA, with the HIPAA expiring and also with the sanction, you get a lot of moving parts as to how you'd want to do this. It sounds like you're saying margin improvement in MA is driven more by the CMS sanction costs winding down rather than material MLR improvement. Wasn't sure how you \u2013 did you bid for margin? Did you bid kind of assuming a stable margin for next year? What were your thoughts there going into next year?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","With an eye toward 2017, obviously, when we had to put the bids in, we understood the environment we were in. We were already through the audit process. So, we knew the sanctions, et cetera. If you look back historically, we typically positioned ourself for more stable offerings, consistent benefits. As I referenced before, long-term customer relationships are an important part of our model, because it facilitates the interaction back and forth through the value-based offerings. Clearly, we sought to improve margins in some of the markets that were underperforming. With a portfolio our size, there's always opportunities in some select markets to improve margins, but that's a market-by-market approach.","So, think guiding force, stable benefits, stable offerings, the customer-first orientation, working with our physician collaboratives, looking at all the tools that are available to us especially in the markets that may be underperforming. Some of those are the less mature market, so we took some actions in some of the less mature markets, and we expect to see a little bit more disruption there, but margin improvement that would take place, but by and large, stable offerings.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Fishbeck. Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. You may ask your question.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to go back to the MA side. You talked about $100 million in costs coming back to you after sanctions are lifted. And you said that, that's going to be more than offset any losses in Enrollment. But back to the envelope, we're estimating that's about 15,000 lives and off your base, which suggests about a 3% drop, in Enrollment. When I look at the last couple of quarters, you've had sort of a 2% to 3% drop sequentially sort of outside of Open Enrollment. So, just want to see if I'm missing anything and just your comfort around those expectations.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Ralph, good morning. It's David. I'm not going to go through the moving parts at this point. We'll provide full 2017 guidance at the end of the year, as we go through our fourth quarter call.","The three headlines here are as follows: One, we expect better than market retention, because we've typically delivered better than market retention levels from our customers specifically tied to the collaborative model. You could actually look at \u2013 to your point, you can look at our attrition rates throughout the course of the year as we've been able to manage the business.","Point two is the remediation costs will essentially \u2013 the large majority of those costs will attrit next year, which will offset the earnings implication. Broad sweeping numbers, we expect to grow the franchise in aggregate revenue numbers because of the strength of the business, as I referenced before: the U.S. Commercial Employer business; the Global Supplemental Benefits business; our Specialty portfolio, et cetera. And that will more than offset the revenue implications here as well.","Lastly, order of magnitude, you could think about $1 billion of revenue that unfortunately currently is low margin. We'll step the margin up, and that will more than offset the earnings implication from that as we look through the attrition, both the end-of-month attrition for this year as well as the Open Enrollment attrition for next year.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then just my follow up, just want to go into the Commercial MLR a little bit more. You mentioned taking down sort of cost trend. Maybe go through some of the components of what you're seeing as the drivers there and how that's impacting \u2013 or maybe how that impacted how you priced and thought about 2017. Thanks.","Thomas A. McCarthy - Cigna Corp.","Hi, Ralph. It's Tom. So, obviously, we're very pleased with the medical trend results. We're continuing to build on a competitively attractive record here. And since most of our commercial customers are in self-funded arrangements, they directly benefit from this well-managed trend.","So, absent the components, the experience to-date generally shows all of our trend components in the low to mid-single digits, so were pretty happy with that results. As far as impact on pricing, our philosophy has typically and remains consistent to anticipate medical cost trend in our pricing. And effectively, we're seeing great results in delivering medical cost trend and a good trajectory for this business going forward.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Giacobbe. Our next question comes from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. You may ask your question.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Yeah, thanks. Good morning. So, again, following up on the Government loss ratio. This year, you had year-over-year compared to last year give or take maybe 150 basis points or so of deterioration. Can you par that, how much of that came from this Texas, Illinois duals issue versus the Medicare advantage deterioration or Part D deterioration? And then given that you've been under what \u2013 CMS now apparently has a new claims audit process, so next year as you look at recovery and the MA and some of the Part D piece of it on loss ratio, how much of that is recoverable, or is this kind of the new normal because of a more stringent claims audit process?","Thomas A. McCarthy - Cigna Corp.","Ana, it's Tom. Rather than getting into all the pieces here, let me give you the higher-level message. The quarter-over-quarter deterioration you mentioned, that 160 basis points, 170 basis points. That's all attributable to Medicaid and the difference in less favorable prior development this year compared to last year. So, I wouldn't be anticipating that we'd be seeking significant improvements in the Medicare Advantage loss ratio going into 2017. We'd expect to have significant \u2013 continued ongoing strong performance there.","And as far as splitting the difference in the variance in the quarter it splits about 60\/40. Medicaid, the more significant variance is about 40%. A little bit of minor puts and takes other than that, but about 40% related to the difference in prior year.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","And on the latter part of your question, I'd ask you not to think about an impact of the audit on the sustainable loss ratio. I think I heard you say the claim audit process having an impact on the loss ratio going forward. We do not expect any implication on the sustainable of the loss ratio there. We have operating expenses, which you referenced that we had to incur to make process changes, but there are not fundamental differences of our cost, or quality, or clinical performance measures in any way, shape, or form we need to worry about there.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And just going to the Individual side, you don't say much here. The Commercial book's performing very well. I'm estimating you have maybe $800 million to $1 billion or so in premiums. As you look at how sequentially your experience from 2Q to 3Q, what is that telling you about that book, even though it's small compared to your peers? And what does that mean for next year in relation to your bids? And I believe you've entered one more state at least.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Ana, two headlines there. Relative to 2Q to 3Q, essentially consistent, I think is the big picture headline relative to the individual book of business. Relative to next year, important to put a backdrop on it. As you recall, we have been, I'll say, cautious and slow in this space, is the headline. As we've viewed the opening of this marketplace in 2014 is probably being much smaller than projections, not profitable for the industry and choppy or less than stable operationally. And unfortunately, societally, it's proving to be more right than wrong.","We entered five markets, and we deliberately and slowly grew to seven markets. As we look to 2017, our initial plan had us growing into 10 markets. After assessing all the market dynamics, we're going to end up in seven markets in 2017, but a different mix where we will shrink our footprint in three markets by leaving three markets on the exchange. And then we'll have a new offering in three different markets, specifically built on our collaborative model.","So, some change in the overall profile of our marketplace but a smaller geographic footprint than we were anticipating; we anticipated going from seven to 10 markets. We're going to actually be in seven markets with a different mix, net-net taking it all as a whole. For next year, we're going to expect to see some revenue growth there. We're continuing to plan for a loss in the business, which is what we think is appropriate as we continue to refine our learnings and look to determine whether there's a sustainable future here.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you, Ms. Gupte. Our next question comes from Dave Windley, Jefferies. You may ask your question.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to pivot to a couple of questions on International. David, your International Risk business membership growth ticked up pretty nicely in the third quarter. Wondering if that's another bright spot in Global Health Care, and if there's anything in particular to call out there in the growth path of that business? And then over on Global Sup, I guess I'm just interested in kind of an update on the overall strategy and model. Is it basically unchanged and continuing to roll out in additional markets or countries, noting that Korea had an 18% growth in the quarter?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Dave, good morning. So, two headlines here. First, as we noted both through Tom's comments and my comments, continued strong performance of our Global business, that's headline number one. Two different businesses, big picture to think about. One is a largely an employer globally mobile business, where we take care of corporate expats, IGOs, NGOs, et cetera. And we've seen a bit of growth in there that we are pleased with and a bit of continuation of growth there that we're pleased with. That's part of our Global Employer business.","And then the Global Supplemental or Global Individual business, where we continue to see strong growth anchored in our strongest market, which is Korea. You referenced a phraseology in terms of is there nothing changed? A pause on that one, because in a dynamic global market, everything's changing all the time. But the core of our business model remains, which is a focus for that business, the Supplemental business, a focus on the individual, understanding their needs, innovating derivative products and having distribution capabilities and unique ways to meet them on a direct fashion, be it telemarketing, be it direct pull-through Internet, be it TV, be it retail base, et cetera.","That iterative evolution is what's driving our business growth as the global markets continue to evolve and the global middle class continues to grow. So, looking forward, as we noted, we expect this to continue to be a positive driver for us to 2017 and looking to the future.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Windley. Our next question comes from Chris Rigg, Susquehanna Financial Group. You may ask your question.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Just wanted to come back to Global Health Care income quickly here. I'm sorry to keep coming back to this, but, I guess, when we think about where you were when you reported second quarter results the end of July relative to what you're looking for now in terms of the remediation costs, I mean, it's a $30 million step up in a pretty short window of time. I guess, I'm just not fully understanding why it increased so rapidly relative to what you were looking for at mid-year.","Thomas A. McCarthy - Cigna Corp.","Well, Chris, it's Tom. Look, we've invested a lot in technology, augmenting staff and engaging consultants to get this done as quickly as possible. And the cost has been substantial. Total costs to-date are in the about $80 million range after tax. As David indicated, we're expecting about $100 million for the full year, so we see the costs have peaked in the third quarter. They have significantly ramped down in the fourth quarter, and that ramp down reflects a more narrowly-focused work effort as we just address the remaining issues. So, that's the general pattern of what's going on here.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. And then just on the two Medicaid issues, I mean, Texas normally has a rate increase September 1, and I can't remember where Illinois stands, but nevertheless, do you think at least in Texas, the rate increase there gets you back to breakeven pretty quickly? And likewise, can you give us a sense for where things stand in Illinois? Thank you.","Thomas A. McCarthy - Cigna Corp.","Yeah. I'd say, in Texas while perhaps there'll be a rate increase that will help us, that's more impacting costs. In Illinois, we'd expect it to be more through rate increase. And we'd expect that to be closer to the beginning of the year. So, all in, again, this is a small business for us, so I think that on the margin, the impact is marginal, but all in, we'd expect to get some improvement in results here.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Rigg. Our last question comes from Michael Newshel with Evercore ISI. You may ask your question.","Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for getting me in there. On your decrease to cost trend guidance for the Commercial business, are there any particular utilization categories to call out that drove the decline there in terms of inpatient versus outpatient versus prescription?","Thomas A. McCarthy - Cigna Corp.","Yeah, again, we're pretty happy with the overall results here. I would call out, the driver of the change is largely pharmacy. So, in the pharmacy trend, we're seeing benefit both from the moderation in specialty drug costs and the continued strong performance of our integrated model.","Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC","And then maybe just one more on Star Ratings and Medicare Advantage. Given the decline there for the 2018 payment year, what do you think your prospects are for improving those ratings for 2019?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Yeah, Michael. It's David. First, as I indicated previously on the call, we're pleased with the quality indicators, we're able to deliver. So, off a base of 60% for STAR+PLUS in 2016; 75% for STAR+PLUS in 2017. Absolutely not lost in us that the current view is to meaningfully downdraft us for 2018. We do not agree, and therefore do not accept that. Our outcome measures, both service satisfaction and retention, clinical outcomes, physician partnership members do not reinforce that. So, we have a variety of paths in front of us. We seek to address that for 2018 long before we look at 2019. Fundamentally, we would expect to be rewarded for and recognized for the strong performance we're able to deliver as we look to 2018 and 2019.","Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Newshel. I will now turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Thanks, everyone. So, to conclude our call this morning, I'd like to underscore just a few key points from our discussion. Cigna's third quarter results include meaningful revenue and earnings contributions from our Global Health Care and Global Supplemental Benefits business and improving financial performance in our Group Disability and Life segment. This gives us confidence that we will achieve our full year 2016 outlook and deliver attractive earnings and revenue growth in 2017.","We are anticipating and meeting customer and client needs through innovation, engagement and value-based programs, which continue to drive our business performance. We have significant capital resources available for deployment.

We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedures on how to enter queue to ask questions at that time. As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded.","We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Will McDowell. Please go ahead, Mr. McDowell.","William McDowell - Cigna Corp.","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I am Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer and, Eric Palmer, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Eric will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's third quarter 2017 financial results as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2017.","As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. Specifically, we use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, shareholders net income, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com.","In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2017 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note in today's earnings release and in our most recent Reports filed with the SEC.","Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, I note that in the third quarter, we recorded special item charges to shareholders net income totaling $214 million, or $0.85 per share, predominantly associated with the previously disclosed early extinguishment of debt.","As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations in our discussion of financial results. Also, consistent with past practices, when we make any perspective comments on earnings or EPS outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future capital deployment or prior year development of medical costs.","And with that, I will turn the call over to David.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Thanks, Will. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. I'll begin my comments by highlighting Cigna's third quarter operating results, which reflect continued strength across our portfolio of businesses, driven by our ongoing effective execution of our strategy. Then I'll briefly discuss a clear path for value creation grounded in each of our operating businesses, followed by a more detailed overview of the significant growth opportunities in our Commercial Employer business.","I'll then highlight how Cigna's well performing businesses and strong free cash flow generation are providing us with ongoing financial strength and capital flexibility. And finally, I'll share some initial thoughts around expectations for 2018 before turning the call over to Eric for a more detailed overview of our third quarter results. Following our Q&A, I'll wrap up the call with a few closing comments.","I'll start with our third quarter operating results. We achieved substantial earnings growth in the quarter, including continued momentum across each of our businesses. Our consolidated revenue increased to $10.4 billion and we grew earnings to $716 million or $2.83 per share, with significantly increased bottom-line contributions from each of our businesses compared to the third quarter of 2016.","Turning to our segments. In Global Health Care, we continue to drive strong earnings growth and deepening our relationships with our customers, clients and healthcare delivery partners. Our Global Supplemental Benefits business posted another outstanding quarter of top-line and bottom-line results, which reflect continued progress in addressing evolved sense of security and health needs for our customers in targeted geographies around the world. And finally, our Group Disability and Life business also delivered solid performance this quarter, with strong fundamentals across both our Disability and Life portfolios.","Collectively, these results, combined with our capital position and ongoing free cash flow generation, give us confidence we will achieve our increased 2017 outlook and enter 2018 with considerable momentum.","Looking ahead, we continue to operate in a dynamic environment with an evolving marketplace characterized by aging populations, eroding health status, rapid technology innovation and a highly disruptive regulatory and legislative climate. Taken together, these dynamics will continue to create profound challenges and opportunities relative to the affordability of healthcare services across the globe and the ability to meet individual needs in a highly personalized way.","In this disruptive environment, Cigna's strategy of Go Deeper, Go Local and Go Beyond serves as our guide to value creation in each of our targeted growth platforms, including our Commercial Employer segment, which continues to present significant growth opportunities as we innovate solutions to meet market needs, more deeply integrate our medical and specialty offerings and deliver superior management of total medical costs and quality outcomes.","Our U.S. Seniors business, which is positioned for growth in 2018 and over the long term by leveraging our best-in-class physician engagement model and a relentless focus on engaging our customers.","Our Global Supplemental Benefits business, with sustained growth as we provide customers in key geographies with highly personalized, affordable health and sense of security solutions. And the Group Disability and Life segment, which drives profitable growth through our industry-leading productivity and asset management model, enabling our customers to avoid disability, or to maximize their return to work potential when disabilities do occur.","Now I'd like to take some time to delve more deeply into our Commercial Employer business. We see outstanding opportunities for continued growth through a consistent focus on achieving the right balance of affordability and personalization. We seek to deliver this balance through three strategic imperatives. First, being the undisputed partner of choice, second, accelerating the next generation of integration and, finally, working to make the complex simpler for the benefit of our customers.","An example of how we drive our role as undisputed partner of choice is by leveraging information, incentives and care resources to help healthcare professionals better align around value-based care models and to deliver a differentiated, more coordinated approach to care. We currently have advanced collaborative relationships with nearly 390 physician groups and hospitals spanning 34 states. We have built strategic flexibility into our platforms and our willingness and ability to meet our providers where they are enable us to deploy a variety of collaborative arrangements and models with physician groups and hospitals.","These relationships help us by leveraging data and insights to identify health risks earlier as we provide timely analysis on insured patients and customers who our predictive models identify as being higher risk for decreased health status and emerging health challenges.","In fact, recently Cigna was the only national health plan to earn the National Committee for Quality Assurance's Physician and Hospital Quality Certification. This recognition is one of many that reinforces our ongoing commitment to effectively partner to make sure that Cigna customers receive the right care, the right service and the best value. I would also note that our success here in part helps to drive higher level of client persistency, as well as improved quality of care and, as a result, total lower medical costs.","At the same time, we deploy an integration model in our Commercial Employer business that goes well beyond traditional cross-selling and solutions bundling. It's based on a consultative approach, allowing us to leverage the combined data and insights from across our solutions to improve outcomes for the benefit of our customers and clients.","We've demonstrated that customers with integrated Cigna medical and pharmacy solutions are more active in health coaching and case management programs than those engaged in medical-only benefits. And our customized programs have generated significant annual medical cost savings for customers who engage with us in one or more health improvement coaching or counseling services. The health impact and resulting savings from these programs are just one example of how Cigna continues to deliver industry-leading medical cost trend.","Further illustrating the value of our integrated solutions, we have seen that among our commercial clients who benefit from three or more Cigna solutions, we are delivering retention rates that are 3% to 5% higher than those with standalone medical services. And while these results are market differentiated, as we've discussed before, we have additional opportunity to further deepen our client relationships across our buying segments.","We are also accelerating our next generation of integration by delivering services through a variety of means, be it digital, face-to-face or otherwise, to better engage the individual in a highly personalized way. When combined with deep value-based relationships with healthcare professionals, we see our approach to next-generation integration as a further step in continuing to deliver differentiated value and our market-leading medical cost and quality outcomes.","Finally, we strive to simplify the complexity in healthcare for the benefit of our customers, clients and partners through ongoing innovation and differentiated capabilities.","To share just a few examples. First, we remain the only health service company to offer live access to call service representatives, 7\/24, 365, to be there when our customers or partners need us. Second, we continue to embed and integrate care extenders, such as nurses and care coordinators, into the practices of hundreds of our collaborative partners across the country.","And, third, we actively work to improve the customer experience through new technologies and digital enablement, such as One Guide, which helps our customers to make more informed choices as they select their benefits, better manage their cost of care through price transparency and reward program participation and make it easy for them to create and connect a personalized team of doctors, coaches and clinicians, how and when they choose. Today, in only our first year since launch, we already have 2 million customers on One Guide and we expect to double this to 4 million customers in 2018.","These examples underscore how Cigna is continuing to deliver differentiated value to enhance personalization and affordability.","Now as we look across the Cigna enterprise, we recognize that the differentiated value we deliver in the marketplace directly contributes to our company's financial strength and flexibility. Our exceptional capital position today and continued strong free cash flow that our operating businesses are generating enable us to both continue to reinvest back in our business to drive continued growth and expand the solutions for our customers and clients and strategically position Cigna for the long-term growth by pursuing attractive, inorganic opportunities to further develop capabilities aligned to evolving marketplace needs as well as to effectively return excess capital to shareholders.","With respect to our initial outlook for 2018, the headline is we expect to deliver attractive financial performance again in 2018. We will continue to organically grow our business in terms of revenue, earnings and customers over our increased 2017 outlook, driven by our four well-positioned growth platforms, a clear, compelling strategy and outstanding talent deployed across the globe. We expect to continue to generate strong margins and cash flows, which will further fuel our capital deployment opportunities. I would also remind you that when we provide guidance for 2018, we will exclude the impact of any prior year development or future capital deployment as we have done in the past.","Now to summarize a few key points before I turn the call over to Eric. We have achieved substantial earnings growth in the third quarter, with continued momentum across our portfolio of businesses, giving us confidence will achieve our increased 2017 outlook.","In a disruptive environment, our recently evolved strategy of Go Deeper, Go Local and Go Beyond serves as our guide to achieving the right balance and affordability and personalization, which positions us well in each of our growth platforms, Commercial Employer, U.S. Seniors, Global Supplemental Benefits and Group Disability and Life. We remain well positioned for growth across our portfolio in 2018 and over the long term, which is even further strengthened by our strong capital position.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Eric.","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will review key aspects of Cigna's third quarter 2017 results and provide an update to our full-year outlook. Key financial highlights in the quarter are consolidated revenue growth of 5% to $10.4 billion, consolidated earnings growth of 42% to $716 million, including significant earnings growth in each of our business segments, quarterly earnings per share growth of 46% to $2.83, and continued strong free cash flow and financial flexibility, with approximately $2.3 billion returned to shareholders through share repurchase on a year-to-date basis.","Overall, the results in the quarter reflect the effective execution of our focused strategy and demonstrate the strong fundamentals of each of our operating businesses. The strength of these results provide us with continued momentum and confidence reflected in our increased full-year 2017 financial outlook.","Regarding our business segments, I will first comment on Global Health Care. Third quarter premiums and fees in Global Health Care grew 6% to $7.2 billion, driven by strong customer growth in specialty contribution across all commercial market segments and, as expected, this growth was partially offset by lower Seniors enrollment versus the prior year.","We ended third quarter 2017 with 15.8 million Global Medical customers, an organic increase of 619,000 lives year-to-date. Third quarter earnings increased 38% to $575 million, reflecting growth in medical customers and specialty relationships, continued effective medical cost management and operating expense discipline.","Turning to our medical care ratios. Our third quarter 2017 total Commercial Medical Care Ratio, or MCR, of 78.6% reflects the continued effectiveness of the medical cost management capabilities David discussed earlier, partially offset by the impact of the Health Insurance Tax suspension. This MCR also reference better-than-expected medical costs in our U.S. Individual business.","Our third quarter 2017 total government MCR of 84% reflects the impact of our innovative physician engagement model within Medicare Advantage and favorable Medicare Part D experience. Third quarter 2017 Global Health Care earnings included favorable prior-year reserve development of $19 million after tax.","Moving to operating expenses. For third quarter 2017, our total Global Healthcare operating expense ratio was 21.1%, which reflects the impact of the Health Insurance Tax suspension, business mix changes and continued effective expense management. Overall, we've had a very strong quarter in our Global Health Care business.","Turning now to Global Supplemental Benefits, our third quarter results reflect continued attractive growth and profitability, as premiums and fee grew to $937 million, an increase of 12%, and third quarter 2017 earnings grew 35% to $109 million, reflecting business growth, favorable claims experience in South Korea and effective operating expense management.","For Group Disability and Life, third quarter premiums and fees were just over $1 billion. Third quarter earnings in our Group business increased 38% to $73 million, reflecting favorable claims experience in both our Disability and Life businesses.","Overall, as a result of the continued effective execution of our strategy, our third quarter results reflect strong earnings contribution from each of our business segments. We also continued to generate very strong free cash flow from our businesses and maintain significant financial flexibility.","Now I will discuss our increased outlook for 2017. For full-year 2017, we now expect consolidated revenues to grow by approximately 4% over 2016, driven by strong growth in medical customers and specialty relationships as we continue to more deeply integrate our solutions and generate greater value for customers and clients and continued momentum in Global Supplemental Benefits as we innovative with new solutions across a diverse set of distribution platforms.","Our outlook for full-year 2017 consolidated adjusted income from operations is now in the range approximately $2.6 billion to $2.65 billion, or $10.20 to $10.40 per share. This reflects an increase of $0.35 to $0.45 per share over our previous expectation and represents per-share growth of 26% to 28% over 2016.","I will now discuss the components of our increased 2017 outlook, starting with Global Health Care. We now expect full-year Global Health Care earnings in the range of $2.14 billion to $2.17 billion. Key assumptions reflected in our Global Health Care earnings outlook for 2017 include the following. Regarding Global Medical customers, we now expect an increase of approximately 650,000 lives over year-end 2016. This is an increase of approximately 100,000 lives from the midpoint of our previous expectations and reflects targeted growth across all commercial market segments.","Turning to medical costs. For our total U.S. Commercial book of business, we now expect full-year medical cost trends to be in the range of 3% to 4%, an improvement of 100 basis points over our previous expectations. Our industry-leading medical cost trend continues to reflect benefits from increased incentive alignment for our customers and clients, deeper collaborative relationships with providers and our differentiated specialty integration model, all of which contribute to positive health outcomes and better management of total medical costs.","And as a reminder, given that 85% of our U.S. Commercial enrollment is in transparent ASO funding arrangements, Cigna's multi-year track record of leader on medical cost trends results directly benefit our clients.","Now turning to our Medical Care Ratio outlook. For our total commercial book of business, we now expect the 2017 MCR to be in the range of 80% to 81%, an improvement of 50 basis points versus our prior range. Consistent with past years, our outlook anticipates a sequentially higher fourth quarter MCR, due to an increased seasonal impact from the growing share of high deductible plans in our Employer, Group and Individual businesses.","For our total Government book of business, we continue to expect the 2017 MCR to be in the range of 84.5% to 85.5%, with a bias toward the low end of that range. Regarding operating expenses, we now expect our 2017 Global Health Care operating expense ratio to be approximately 21%. I would also note, regarding our U.S. individual business, we now expect full-year 2017 results to be slightly profitable. For our Global Supplement Benefits business, we continue to expect strong top-line growth and now expect earnings in the range of $345 million to $355 million. This is an increase of $25 million to $35 million over previous expectations, reflecting the strength of our third quarter results.","Regarding the Group Disability and Life business, we now expect full-year 2017 earnings in the range of $275 million to $285 million, an increase of $5 million to $15 million over previous expectations, reflecting strong third quarter results. And regarding our remaining operations, that is Other Operations and Corporate, we now expect a loss of $160 million for 2017.","All-in for full-year 2017 we now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $2.6 billion to $2.65 billion, or $10.20 to $10.40 per share. This represents an increase of $0.35 to $0.45 per share over our previous expectations. I would also remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of additional prior-year reserve development or any future capital deployment.","Now moving to our 2017 capital management position and outlook. Overall, we continue to have excellent financial flexibility. Our subsidiaries remain well capitalized and are generating significant free cash flow to the parent. Each of our business segments has a strong return on capital and we maintain significant free cash and leverage capacity at the parent company.","Our capital deployment strategy and priorities remain, first, funding our businesses to support long-term growth, next, pursuing M&A activity with a focus on acquiring capabilities and scale to further grow in our targeted areas of focus, and, lastly, after considering these first two items, we will return capital to shareholders primarily through share repurchase.","Regarding free cash flow, we ended the third quarter with parent company cash of approximately $1.7 billion and we have the capacity to generate additional deployable cash by increasing our debt-to-capitalization ratio to the mid-30%s, which we would consider a normal range going forward.","Regarding share repurchase, during the period from August 4 through November 1, we repurchased 5.5 million shares of stock for approximately $1 billion, bringing our year-to-date share repurchase to 13.2 million shares of stock for approximately $2.3 billion.","Our balance sheet and free cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from industry leading margins and returns on capital in our businesses and a high level of capital efficiency, particularly from our fee-based businesses.","Now to recap. Our third quarter 2017 consolidated results reflect strength and momentum across our diversified portfolio of global businesses and continued effective execution of our focused strategy. The fundamentals of our business remain strong, as evidenced by these results, which reflected strong revenue and earnings contribution from each of our business segments, industry-leading medical cost trends with our clients directly benefiting from increased levels of incentive alignment, physician collaboration and specialty integration and continued strong free cash flow.","Based on the strength of these results, we are confident in our ability to achieve our increased full-year 2017 earnings outlook and are well positioned for attractive earnings growth in 2018.","And with that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Mr. Lake, your line is open.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Appreciate all the color. Wanted to first touch on your 2018 comments, David. You talked to being able to grow revenue net income year-over-year versus your 2017 revised guidance. Just want to first make sure that is the way to think about this, right, versus let's just say the 26%, 25% mid-point of net income, do you expect to be able to grow off of that?","And then you talked about attractive growth. Is it, in your mind, a typical growth year off that number, or is there a reset we should be thinking about in terms of the upside this year?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Good morning. It's David. Let me provide some color and framing for 2018, then I'll ask Eric to embellish a little bit with some of the specifics of the numbers. First, by way of a backdrop. First, we're really pleased with the 2017 outlook and the momentum we've built and our ability to yet again increase our full-year outlook. And as Eric noted, it has an embedded growth rate in it of 26% to 28% from an EPS perspective.","Second, specifically to the headline for 2018, as you articulated, we will again grow our top and bottom line. That's correlated to the four well-positioned growth platforms we have. At a macro level, think about the drivers as being further revenue and customer growth, further deepening our customer and client relationships by leveraging our both diverse and growing specialty portfolio as well as further expense leverage.","Now, while we won't go through the detail of our 2018 guidance until the fourth quarter call, we want to give you a little bit more color. So, when you consider that 2017 jump off and the macro drivers I identified, we expect to grow our organic earnings in the range of 7% to 9% when you adjust 2017 for prior-year reserve development, as we always do. Now that 7% to 9% is in line with our strategic goal and objective.","I would also note that that outlook, from our point of view, is competitively attractive and it contemplates as well as offsets the headwind that is created from the return of the industry. So, said otherwise, even with the return of the industry, we expect to grow organic earnings consistent with our strategic range of 7% to 9% when you exclude prior-year reserve development.","Lastly, I would remind you, as you know, we have both an exceptional capital position and we don't project future capital deployment. That presents additional opportunity for shareholder value creation for us.","I'll ask Eric to just reinforce few of the numbers behind that.","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Yeah, Justin. It's Eric. So, as David said, I think we're really pleased with the momentum that we've carried through 2017. And our 2017 guidance for income of $2.6 billion to $2.65 billion represented really strong growth over 2016. And as David noted, when we provide guidance, and have for some time, we always exclude, and we do so on a basis that excludes prior-year reserve development and excludes any potential future capital deployment.","So, if you take the 2017 number and remove the impact of prior-year development, our 2017 guidance on a similar basis would be $2.485 million to $2.535 million (sic) [$2.485 billion to $2.535 billion] (28:38) in income and off of that base, we'd expect to generate income growth consistent with our long-term averages. The range that David talked about and that we've talked about even at our Investor Day would be a long-term average of 7% to 9%. And so we'd expect to grow consistent with that range.","There's a number of headwinds and tailwinds. We're not going to enumerate all of those in the course of the call today. We'll do so at our fourth quarter call, when we provide more detailed guidance.","But as David said, notably, we'd expect to deliver results in that range and that's inclusive of the Industry Fee return, which is definitely a headwind. We think the timing dynamics associated with the commercial portion of the Industry Fee as being worth something like $50 million year-on-year and that'd be a headwind that we would work through in the course of achieving the results of that long-term growth range of 7% to 9% off of the basics including prior-year development. Hopefully that helps provide a little bit of color of how we're thinking about 2018 at this point.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","That was so helpful. I'm going to skip my follow-up and jump back in the queue. Thanks a lot, guys. I really appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Lake. Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Mr. Fischbeck, your line is open.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","(30:00-30:09)","William McDowell - Cigna Corp.","You have a bad connection. We're having trouble hearing you.","Operator","Our next question will be from Matt Borsch with BMN (sic) [BMO] (30:25) Capital Markets. Mr. Borsch, your line is open.","Matt Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. It's actually BMO. So, I just wanted to ask a question about, you touched on enrollment growth expected for 2018. Can you give us any thoughts on how you think the employer renewals and account wins and losses are shaping up for January 1?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Sure, Matthew. Good morning. It's David. Let me give you a little bit of color. As we first, big picture, as we look to 2018, we expect, again, to grow our customer lives, therefore, our revenue. And quite importantly, we expect to, again, further deepen our relationships by leveraging our growing and well-positioned Specialty portfolio.","As we look to 2018, we would expect the bulk of our growth to continue to be driven by our Select and Regional segment. Specifically, this time of the year we typically talk with you about the National segment, so a little bit more color there. To remind you, we define the National Commercial segment a little bit differently than the industry. So it's commercial employers with 5,000 or more employees that span multiple states.","Relative to that marketplace for 2018, we would expect to have another year of strong client retention, underscoring our medical cost delivery, our service delivery, et cetera. We would expect to have some targeted wins in terms of new business growth. And net-net, we're expecting to step into the year for the National segment with stable membership for National, growing membership for Select, as we have in the past, growing membership for Regional, net-net overall for Commercial business growing membership as we step into 2018.","Matt Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And if I could just add a follow-on to that, which is, what are you seeing in terms of the employer preferences for products if you can make a generalization across the broad landscape there? I mean, for example, is there cost \u2013 high-deductible conversions and cost sharing, is that decelerated because of the strong economy and tighter labor market or not?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Matthew, I appreciate the prompt for the additional color. I would say the push for value is as intense as it's ever been. Employers are seeking to get more value or higher return from their overall benefits portfolio and investment.","As such, we see employers at all sizes more open to and more aggressively evaluating not just transparent funding mechanisms, but as we described, incentive and engagement based programs that are quite targeted to get more engagement of their individual employees and family members into the active health management, into the active engagement, into the predictive indicators, et cetera.","And if there's a trend that I would identify that's emerging on the more accelerated basis, which we think is positive, it's the push for more localized variance. So, you'll recall our strategy; topic two is Go Local. As the market evolves for more value-based arrangements, it's happening unevenly around the country, and employers are more open to buying or configuring local variations that get the best of the value-based collaboratives, we're well-positioned for that. We think that's a very positive direction for employers.","So less on the CDHP side and more directed toward more value-based programs, higher engagement-based programs, more leverage of incentives and increasingly more local variation.","Matt Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Borsch. Our next question will come from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open, sir.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. Sorry about that. So, I guess can you talk a little bit about you mentioned that you expect MA membership growth next year in addition to the long-term growth. Can you give a little bit of color on how you're feeling your bids are positioned for 2018?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Good morning, Kevin. Can hear you a lot clearer. Thank you. So, specific to MA, broadly we continue to see the U.S. Seniors market as an attractive growth platform. That's driven by a variety of forces. First, at a macro level, the demographics, as well as, importantly, the real strong value proposition MA provides the seniors relative to fee-for-service in many markets. Specific to Cigna, we overlay, in addition to that, our proven value-based collaboratives and then our innovative customer engagement programs.","Not lost on us that we have been in a paused state relative to the marketplace for a couple years. As we step into 2018, we will grow. We'll grow revenues and we'll grow customers despite that disruption and noting that strategically we're exiting some targeted counties in 2018 and not entering new geographies.","So, taken as a whole, our read of 2018, we will grow, albeit our underlying expectations for 2018's customer growth is lower than our historical run rate in this business and we're projecting for lower-than-market-average growth because, in part, we're reentering the market, we're exiting some counties and we didn't enter any new counties or new markets for 2018.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Then I guess maybe if you could give some color on longer term, I guess maybe not specifically 2019, but longer term when you think about entering new markets, what kind of opportunity for growth is that? We heard other companies talk about significantly expanding their geographic coverage over the next several years. How do you think about that opportunity?","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Kevin, we see that as a very attractive opportunity. We have had a disciplined process of organically opening up one to two markets per year prior to our structured pause that we were involved in. And we would expect to re-engage in that as we look at 2019 and beyond.","Importantly, we have many markets where we have highly aligned well-performing collaborative and value-based relationships that are performing at high level for our commercial population, who those physician collaboratives and delivery system collaboratives desire us to be in the Medicare Advantage marketplace with them.","So we have a lot of supply, if you will, or demand in the market depending on orientation. And as we look to 2019 and beyond, we see some really attractive growth opportunities, both in existing markets, but to your specific point, opening new markets for 2019 and beyond.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Fischbeck. Our next question comes from Chris Rigg with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. I was just hoping to get some more color on the new medical cost trend outlook being down 100 basis points. Obviously, that's a fairly sizable decline relative to the prior outlook. What's the primary reason for the reduction there? Thanks.","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Chris, it's Eric. Good morning. A couple of things that I'd share with respect to the medical cost trend. First of all, just stepping back, I would remind you within our book of business, 85% of the clients are in self-funded arrangements where the medical trend directly benefits the clients.","And even the other 15% of the book of business that's in insured arrangement, much of that is in arrangements where the trend also directly impacts how we set the rates and things along those lines. And so, I mentioned that because I think the context of having the alignment of incentives provides that really important impact and effect in helping work to impact medical cost trend overall.","Now, with respect to our lowered expectation of moving the trend to 3% to 4% for the full year, I would note a couple of dynamics. First of all, as you think about the specific categories, inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy and physician, each one of those different dimensions we would continue to expect to be in that low to mid-single digit range that I've referenced in prior calls.","Within the quarter specifically, the areas that drove the improvement in results overall, I'd point to pharmacy and inpatient, in particular, now being lower in the range than they were previously. But in aggregate, continue to expect each one of those categories to be in that low to mid-single digits range. And overall, we're really pleased with the overall impact that we're able to drive here.","Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. And then just changing gears to Medicare Advantage. Can you give us a sense for how you think you're positioned for next year for growth and whether you think you'll be able to grow in line with the market or potentially even better given you've been out of the Annual Enrollment period for a while? Thanks.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Chris, it's David. As I briefly referenced in a prior question, our view is we're positioned to grow in 2018. We were back in the selling process in July, August, September, albeit small months, and were able to test the market from that standpoint. We had high alignment in demand with our physician collaborative projects in existing markets.","Specific to 2018, we will growth revenue and we will grow customers. Our expectation is we will grow at a rate lower than the market average in 2018 for three reasons. One, we are reentering the market and we want to be honest relative to that process. Two, we've strategically exited some counties in 2018. And, three, we are not entering new markets in 2018.","Even when you think all that together, we'll grow revenue and lives and position ourselves really positively to build off that momentum as we step into 2019 and revert growing at least in line with market average off our strong core and entering new markets in 2019 and beyond.","Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Rigg, for your question. Our next question is from David Windley with Jefferies. Mr. Windley, your line is open.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thank you. So, David, as you think about the evolving landscape on the pharmacy side, pharmacy benefit management and delivery channel chain, how do you characterize Cigna's cost position in Pharmacy? I'm thinking about beginning with Optum Rx's developments and continuing on the potential competitor of yours combining with the pharmacy. How do you consider Cigna's Pharmacy cost position?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Good morning, David. We have, for quite some time, viewed that the Pharmacy business, the integration of Pharmacy, the coordination of Pharmacy services, as quite an important part of our offering and our strategy.","Today, we operate a high-performing innovative and importantly integrated Pharmacy business. We have a proven approach, with the ability on a targeted basis to partner with others to create even step functions of value of the benefit of our customers. And we continue to invest in capabilities in our Pharmacy business, technology, services, programs, as well as talent.","As a result, our Pharmacy business unit continues to grow. As Eric previously referenced, we're delivering yet again another year of industry-leading medical cost trend. The Pharmacy component is a contributor to that. And we feel quite good about it. And as we look forward, we'll continue to invest both in technology capabilities and service expansions for our business.","So net-net, we feel quite good about our positioning, the integrated approach. And we see further opportunities to both grow the business and drive further integration with our healthcare delivery partners.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. Thank you for that. And then a quick follow-up on Medicare Advantage. You've commented on 2018. How do you think about investments that you might make in 2018 to help or bolster that business' position to grow in 2019, thinking particularly around mitigation around Stars (41:55)? Thanks.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","So, relative to the business portfolio and the platform, we feel good about the platform we carry into 2018. There's always an ongoing, we'll call it, investment portfolio in every one of our businesses, ongoing innovation and capabilities, be they service, program. In the case of MA, beyond that there are geographic expansions that we talked about as well.","But we feel like we have the right portfolio of talent, technology, tools and a disciplined approach to continue to invest. And we like our positioning for 2018. We like our positioning to look to 2019 and beyond. And it will continue to be a growth platform for us. So I wouldn't say any massive inflection point change, nor an investment that is necessary in 2018 that would change our earnings trajectory for that business either.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thanks for the question. Our next question will be from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Your line is open.","Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to focus on the Healthcare segment, specifically the International operations within there. I was just looking back, so I think that you guys' run rates are a $2 billion International Healthcare-specific business. And so as I look back to the growth rates, it really hasn't grown as fast or certainly not faster than the overall company.","So I guess my question is really around strategic fit. And does this help with the domestic clients? Are there advantages that you see for running that business? And then has there been any thought around divesting it in light of some of the volatility that's been seen around currencies and really just revenues over the last several years?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Morning. It's David. A few questions embedded there. So, stepping back. First and foremost, we operate a diverse global platform of businesses. As you know, businesses that include highly innovative direct-to-consumer solutions, not the business you're making reference to.","Secondly, a business portfolio that has comprehensive global and coordinated healthcare solutions for the globally mobile population. We sell that to commercial employers, IGOs, NGOs, et cetera. And then increasingly on a targeted basis, in-country healthcare coordination for the benefit of multi-national employer clients.","Specific to your question, the Global Employer business has confronted a couple of years-plus of a meaningful customer and revenue headwind that has been on a sub-slice of the business that has dampened the revenue growth in that business. And it's specifically tied to the wind-down of the two wars that the U.S. has been involved in, obviously in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the Defense Base Act.","We were, and continue to be, a major supplier of services, service coordination and service delivery for those suppliers of resources that wrap around the war effort in terms of the contractors that wrap around that. As those wars have wound down, which is a net societal good, that business has dissipated massively. We've been able to offset that with fundamental growth but it has meaningfully dampened the net revenue growth of the business. And we see that chapter as having largely come to completion in terms of the dissipation of revenue.","Lastly, we see this part of our business as leverageable for our global employers, and the vast majority of our employer clients are multi-national. And the vast majority of those employers are looking for additional solutions to either fill or supplement what different countries are affording on a go-forward basis. And we're well-positioned relative to that business, so we're excited about the growth opportunities looking forward.","Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research","All right. That makes a ton of sense. Is there a way to quantify the global employer portion of that $2 billion of annual revenues?","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Josh, what we'll do is, we'll take that away and as we provide guidance for 2018 and beyond, we'll take away the challenge to embellish a bit further. But, as you'll note, our Global business in aggregate continues grow.","You've mentioned FX as well. Within the Global Employer business, the FX kind of nets itself in a different way because we're matched globally relative to that business. But we'll take away the opportunity to provide you some more insights as we talk about our Commercial business on a go-forward basis.","Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research","All right. Perfect. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you for your question, Mr. Raskin. Our next question will come from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Mr. Giacobbe, your line is open.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. David, you've talked about the $7 billion to $14 billion of deployable capital in the past and how you won't sit on it. So could you maybe just update us on timing or approach to M&A? Obviously, a lot of different headlines out there. How does or doesn't that impact your approach and timing?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Sure. Good morning, Ralph. So big picture, our capital deployment strategy and priorities have not changed. It's important to preface that with our current capital health and our projected capital health is a direct result of having well-performing businesses that are high margin and we have a successful track record of converting earnings to free cash flow as well as a disciplined capital management priority within the corporation.","As you know, our priorities remain: ensure our businesses are well capitalized and supported for ongoing growth, pursue strategic and financially attractive M&A and then return excess capital to shareholders, largely through share repurchase. As Eric noted in his prepared remarks, year-to-date we purchased about $2.3 billion of our stock. We entered the year and indicated that we expected to purchase at least $2 billion.","And I would note, we have about $1.4 billion of share repurchase authority currently approved based on our Board of Directors. And as we go forward, we'll continue to look at a whole variety of deployment opportunities consistent with those three sets of objectives, strategic M&A, two, share repurchases, item number three, our businesses are well capitalized for growth, and we continue to invest appropriately in CapEx investments for our business. So stay tuned for more as we step into 2018.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then just second question. There's been some debate on whether commercial risk enrollment more broadly popped a bit this year just ex-HIX due to HIF holiday and the idea that maybe we reverse course and see a bigger pop in ASO next year with HIF coming back in. Do you agree? Are you seeing that in terms of pipeline next year? And is that what's giving some of the confidence around what seems to be maybe outsized growth, particularly within the Select segment?","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Ralph, it's Eric. Maybe just a couple of comments on that front. So overall within our guaranteed cost book of business, we have had nice growth there this year. And I'd break it into a couple of categories.","First of all, a meaningful portion of that's been just growth in our individual business. The remainder of it was really split between National Accounts and the Select segment. And within National Accounts, more oriented towards continued growth in our participation in different private exchanges.","And then the other piece of it was within the Select segment. Within Select, by the time you split it into those buckets, think of that as less than 100,000 lives of guaranteed cost growth in the Select segment. We've had good growth and momentum in Select for a number of years now across both guaranteed costs and the ASO funding arrangements.","So, again, it wouldn't point to a sea change in terms of the buying characterizations or criteria for 2017. I continue to feel like we've got good momentum, as David noted in that prior comment, as we think about Select going into 2018.","So overall, good traction in both, but wouldn't point to a sea change in terms of differences in buying behavior or anything along those lines.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question, Mr. Giacobbe. Our next question is from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Mr. Taylor, your line is open.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to clarify something and then ask my real question. I think it's pretty clear, but worth clarification. So when you talked about the 7% to 9% organic earnings growth on top of the adjusted net income numbers, you also have a long-term stated goal of 10% to 13%, including capital deployment. So, had a couple of questions about it already. So I just want to make sure that both of those long-term targets are still in place?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Good question. Gary. It's David. Absolutely. In addition, just to amplify that, you recall from our dialogue at our Investor Day, we put forth an EPS goal for 2021 of $16. And we remain on track to achieve that goal and objective, which reinforces your question relative to our long-term average growth objective of 10% to 13% EPS, as well as, as Eric and I referenced, the 7% to 9% range on average for organic earnings growth and the residual being capital deployment.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I knew that was the answer, but I just wanted you to say the rest of it so people didn't feel like there was any change.","My real question was, going to the Global Supplemental business, which has performed really well. But even within that, we're just noticing U.S. revenue up 39% year-over-year has really accelerated. Maybe could you just \u2013 obviously your second-largest market in that business. Could you maybe just touch a little bit on what products are selling so much better in the U.S. and why?","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Gary, it's Eric. The primary business in that segment is Medicare Supplement business. That's the largest piece, but it's not the only piece. And we continue to have good growth in both the Medicare Supplement business as well as other individual supplemental types of benefit programs. But in terms of the biggest driver of the growth, it's Medicare Supplement. It's a business that's performed well for us.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And any obvious reason why it's done so well this year or why it's picked up? I mean, more targeted efforts selling the products or new states or any obvious comment?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Gary, this is a business that we acquired a platform a few years back now and has continued to invest into new capability. In terms of the percentage growth, it's off a pretty small base. So, as we've focused on growing this business with new charters and new product features and such, we've been able to achieve a competitive product. But the percent growth is off of that relatively small base and I continue to see opportunity in front of us there.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question, Mr. Taylor. Our next question comes from Christine Arnold with Cowen. Your line is open, ma'am.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi there. You've talked repeatedly on this call about the penetration of Specialty and other solutions. Can you delve a little bit more into that? What products are you seeing really driving that Commercial growth? And going into 2018, where do you see that momentum? And was there anything in Life and Disability which improved really remarkably that was not in period or non-recurring, or is this a good run rate?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Good morning. It's David. First, importantly, when we think about, as I noted as before, the Specialty portfolio, we don't think about it simply as a cross-selling opportunity. That chapter has long since passed. We think about it as, how do you get the right dimension of integrated solutions for the benefit of employers, and ultimately their employees are our customers.","You can think about as a cornerstone for us, we've been able to prove an outstanding result for the benefit of client and customers when you have at a minimum an intersection of medical, pharmacy, behavioral, that takes you to kind of life management, as well as targeted population health solutions. Operative term, targeted. So, you mine the data, you understand the health burden and the challenges of an employer or client, and you have targeted population-based health programs. Beyond that, then there's additional services. Our Dental portfolio continues to perform extraordinarily well. There's additional services above and beyond that.","Lastly, as an example, while the market may not think about it as a Specialty offering, nor do we in a classic sense, we referenced One Guide, with 2 million lives on it this year, going to 4 million lives next year. It's a tremendous customer engagement, customer navigation, support set of capabilities that both individual customers benefit from, as do our clinical and service coworkers in terms of driving that on a go-forward basis. So, the key is it's a foundational body between the medical, pharmacy, behavioral and life management. And then we augment that and then bring additional services and tools beyond that.","As it relates to Life and Disability, no. Not any one unique item, especially from a one-timer standpoint. We're quite pleased to see the trajectory and the momentum that we've been able to build in 2017. And we remain fully on track with our goal, which is to step into 2018 with our underlying run rate health for that business.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question Ms. Arnold. Our next question is from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Ma'am, your line is open.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. On the employer book, you continue to show great growth on all of the segments, Select, stop loss, Middle Market, and you have almost doubled your Individual book. With the Executive Order moving to short-term policies, bare-bones, association health plans and you used to have (55:29) and much more off-Exchange presence, how do you see all of the playing out in terms of the membership growth and margins for 2018?","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Ana, good morning. It's David. Relative to 2018, as we've discussed previously, big picture we see another year of attractive growth. Top-line revenue growth, customer growth and earnings growth.","Specific relative to the Executive Order, it's clear that the individual market and the overall ACA components continue to evolve. We'll stay rather close to it as the Executive Order is internalized by all the respective agencies and the specific regs, rules and otherwise are promulgated throughout 2018.","We've been able to position ourselves well with a diverse portfolio, as you very well made reference to products, of products, programs and services, both in Medical as well as Specialty, various funding opportunities. And I appreciate your recollection. We have a past track record relative to supplemental or alternative benefits. And all those remain vibrant.","I don't believe and we don't project for that being a step function in 2018. There's too many forces moving. If it did present itself as the final EOs are converted, the EOs converted down to rules and regs, we would clarify that in a quarterly call in 2018 if we see a step function. But right now, the very attractive growth we have projected is in more of an as-is state of our current portfolio.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Thanks for that. On the Global Supplemental, if I could pivot, your margins have been really good. You've had about 150 basis points this quarter, or maybe even more. Do you see that as a sustainable margin expansion trend? And you have about 1 million policy growth in Korea and in China JV mainly. And how does it look to you for 2018?","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Hi, Ana. It's Eric. In terms of the margin and such, again, as we noted in the prepared remarks, overall we continue to have really favorable experience and continue to be really pleased with the momentum we've got in this business.","I would think of the margin going forward, plus or minus within the range of where we've been. So, would not be thinking about the performance as strictly a one-time item or anything along those lines. There's normal ebbs and flows in terms of things around seasonality as well as just the variability in this business. But, again, order of magnitude, feel good about the margin profile that we've delivered in this business over some time and that we've delivered this year.","With respect to growth, again, not providing the detailed guidance as such here today. But we continue to have good momentum in terms of distribution and just the overall and we see that continuing.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you for your question, Ms. Gupte. Our last question is from Zack Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is open.","Zachary W. Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for getting me in. I just wanted to go back to medical trend for a second. And I appreciate all the color that was given and the specific dynamics that helped out with the quarter. I was wondering when you think about going to 2018, and especially with your book where you mentioned they're incentiveized to help impact trend, do you see it continuing to move towards a decelerating trend, or do you think it's safe to think about it just going back to more normalized levels as we look to next year?","Eric Palmer - Cigna Corp.","Zack, it's Eric. Just a couple comments on the medical trend going into next year. We're not providing the detailed guidance as we go into 2018 at this point in time, but would note that the underlying forces that have served us well in delivering this trend for a number of years fundamentally continue to work well and would expect them to continue to be in play as we look ahead to 2018.","We always approach our future guidance and our future trend expectations based off of a number of factors, based on what we know about emerging technologies and changes in pharmaceuticals, et cetera, et cetera. And we'll factor that all into play when we provide our guidance for 2018. But the fundamental underlying effectiveness of our trends and such we would expect to continue as we go into next year.","Zachary W. Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question, Mr. Sopcak. I will now turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks.","David Michael Cordani - Cigna Corp.","Thank you. To wrap up our call, I'd like to highlight just a few key points from today's discussion. We achieved substantial earnings growth in the third quarter, driven by continued momentum across each of our businesses. Collectively, these results combined with our exceptional capital position and ongoing free cash flow generation give us confidence that we will achieve our increased 2017 outlook and enter 2018 with considerable momentum.","In a disruptive environment, Cigna's strategy of Go Deeper, Go Local and Go Beyond, serves as our guide to value creation in each of our targeted growth platforms, including our Commercial Employer segment, our U.S. Seniors business, our Global Supplemental Benefits business and our Group Disability and Life segment.","Further, our exceptional capital position today and continued strong free cash flow that our operating businesses are generating enable us to both continue to invest back in our business to drive growth and expand the solution for the benefit of our customers and clients and strategically position us for long-term growth by pursuing attractive inorganic (1:00:37) opportunities to further develop capabilities aligned to an evolving marketplace as well as effectively return excess capital to our shareholders.","Finally, with respect to our initial outlook for 2018 expectations. We will continue to organically grow our businesses in terms of revenue, earnings and customers over our increased 2017 outlook, driven by four well-positioned growth platforms, a clear compelling strategy and a team of outstanding talent that's deployed around the globe.

(Operator Instructions). As a reminder ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the question-and-answer session, is being recorded. ","We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Ted Detrick. Please go ahead, Mr. Detrick.","Edwin J. Detrick ","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I am Ted Detrick, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom McCarthy, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer.","In our remarks today, David and Tom will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's full year 2013 financial results as well as our financial outlook for 2014. ","As noted in our earnings release, Cigna uses certain financial measures which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP, when describing our financial results. Specifically, we use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and earnings per share on the same basis as the principal measures of performance for Cigna and our operating segments. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com.","Now in our remarks today we will be making some forward-looking comments, including statements concerning our outlook for 2014 and future performance. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of the risk and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note in today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.","Now before turning the call over to David I will cover one item pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. In the fourth quarter we recorded an after tax charge of $40 million or $0.15 per share for severance and other costs associated with a series of actions we are taking to improve our organizational efficiency. And we reported the charge as a special item. As described in today's earnings release special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations in today's discussions of our 2013 results. ","As a reminder please note that when we discuss our earnings outlook for 2014 it will be on the basis of adjusted income from operations. And in addition our outlook for earnings per share for 2014 excludes the effects of any future capital deployment. ","And with that I will turn it over to David. ","David M. Cordani ","Thanks, Ted. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining today's call. First I will discuss Cigna's full year performance and highlights for our 2013 results. Then I'll address how we continue to meet the needs of our customers and clients in ever changing marketplace. Next Tom will provide detail on the performance of the fourth quarter and full year for 2013 as well as provide the specifics for outlook for 2014. Then Tom and I will answer your questions before I leave you with just a few closing comments. ","I'll begin with some highlights for the year. Our strong full year 2013 results has been outstanding track record of financial performance and marks Cigna's fourth consecutive year of competitively attractive financial results. All of our business segments contributed meaningfully to our results for the year with each segment delivering earnings and revenue growth. ","For the full year 2013 consolidated revenue increased by 11% to $32.4 billion with each business segment delivering double-digit growth versus 2012. We reported adjusted income from operations for the full year of $1.93 billion or $6.79 per share, which represents a per share increase of 13% over 2012. ","It's important to note that 2013 was a year of strategic accomplishments for Cigna as well. First our transaction to transfer our one-off reinsurance business, which improves our financial flexibility. Second is our further improvement of our PBM capabilities which enhances pharmacy offerings for our customers and clients while providing a platform and infrastructure to drive accelerated innovation and provides attractive financial benefits for both our customers and shareholders. ","Third, we continue to deepen our global footprint with a meaningful progress in important growth markets including Turkey, India and China. And fourth, we advanced our capital health through strengthening the balance sheet and significant free cash flow from our businesses. Overall these result and accomplishments were driven by focused and effective execution of our strategy. ","Turning to 2014 we expect Cigna will deliver competitively attractive earnings and revenue growth. Tom will elaborate further on our outlook in a few moments. But first I will address how we view the global environment we are operating in this year. ","We anticipate that disruptive market forces, changing client and customer needs and a variety of headwinds will continue to create a challenging marketplace. Both developed and developing countries are confronting significant change in disruption, including an ageing population growing middle class, rising chronic disease levels and affordability pressures for all. ","Our industry also continues to operate in an active legislative and regulatory environment, one that includes uncertainty around Medicare Advantage reimbursement levels, cost pressure resulting from reduction in hospital reimbursement levels due to government cuts, implementation challenges in public exchanges and changing reward structures for physicians in hospitals and globally health systems attempting to rebalance the public-private relationships as they seek to ensure sustainability of their social programs. ","With these trends and uncertainties in mind across our segments and key markets we've built our capabilities to be able to adapt and deliver ongoing success. Cigna's businesses have the strategic direction, focus and core capabilities to anticipate, adapt and win in the global market. Our core strategy of Going Deep, Going Global and Going Individual continues to guide our company around the world. And by executing this strategy in our target markets and in new ones when we see opportunities, our capabilities are delivering differentiated values for our customers, clients and shareholders. ","Our strategy enables us to improve individual health and productivity, engage with physicians to drive quality health outcomes and affordability and support our customers with products and services that provide them with much needed sense of security. To continue to succeed in these global markets there are three key areas that we continue to invest in, to ensure ongoing value creation. These areas are customer insights and engagement, consultative distribution and physician partnership models. ","Insights give us deep knowledge that allows us to identify the right micro segments and match to distribution channels that best meet our customers' preferences. When combined with our consultative distribution capabilities analytical insights give Cigna the unique ability to bring our customers personalized solutions through their channel of choice. ","These include selling through brokers and consulting channels for employers of nearly all sizes, in diverse geographies going through intermediaries, including affinity partners; going to individuals directly through telemarketing, Internet distribution and direct response marketing and selling through our new proprietary private exchange capability where we tailor benefit programs for the needs of employers, clients and brokers and provide greater choice and personalization for our customers. ","In addition relative to the evolving private exchange market we've chosen to participate in those exchanges which most closely align with our target client needs. And we are staying close to evolving programs should they prove to deliver differentiated value. ","Our third key area is care delivery and physician partnership capabilities. Here we are delivering superior health and productivity outcomes today in a local and personalized fashion and our innovation continues for tomorrow. In 2013 we increased the number of customers benefiting from our collaborative relationships with physicians by 50%, or an increase of 400,000 lives. We now have 86 collaborative accountable care initiatives up and running, which is up from 52 at the end of 2012. ","Importantly we are seeing positive cost and quality outcomes for our customers. And additionally we continue to receive feedback from healthcare professionals that Cigna's approach to these initiatives is differentiated in the market. Our approach, which harnesses aligned incentives, specific actionable information and care extenders such as health coaches and case manager is highly leveragable in a rapidly changing marketplace. ","In addition our global network of doctors and hospitals, coupled with our localized health management and coordination resources positions us to offer innovative solutions in our targeted markets around the world. ","Now looking ahead we recognize that change is constant and change will continue at an accelerated pace. At Cigna we've demonstrated our ability to effectively anticipate and adapt to change. And we will continue to grow by retaining, expanding and adding new customer and client relationships. ","More specifically in 2014 we expect to grow our U.S. and global healthcare businesses as well as our global supplemental business. When coupled with the continued strengthen of our Disability and Life business this will more than offset the market disruption and repositioning pressure of our U.S. Seniors business. ","And finally our ongoing strong capital positioning affords us significant deployment opportunities to further build customer and shareholder value. Based on our focused strategy, diversified capabilities and differentiated portfolio of businesses we expect to continue to deliver competitively attractive and sustainable long term EPS growth of 10% to 13% on average all while continuing to invest back in our company. ","Now to briefly summarize before turning it over to Tom; Cigna's strong financial performance in 2013 marks the fourth consecutive year of earnings and revenue growth for our company and provides a good foundation as we step into 2014. We have significantly advanced our capital health through a strengthened balance sheet and free cash flow. ","We recognize that global markets will continue to be disrupted. In this environment of ongoing change we will successfully execute our focused strategy and leverage our differentiated capabilities and customer insights and engagement, consultative selling and physician partnership, all with the objective of delivering differentiated value for our customers and clients. ","With that I'll turn the call over to Tom. ","Thomas A. McCarthy","","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today I will review Cigna's 2013 results and provide our outlook for 2014. ","We had a strong year in 2013 with earnings and revenue both growing by 11% over 2012 and earnings per share growing 13%. These results represent a fourth consecutive year of strong revenue, earnings and EPS growth while also continuing to make significant strategic investments in capabilities across all our businesses. ","Some other key highlights regarding our 2013 results include strong revenue and earnings growth in each of our business segments, despite a disruptive market environment, most notably in Medicare Advantage; enhancement of our pharmacy business through our arrangement with Catamaran; the strengthening of our balance sheet through the successful exit for the Run-off Reinsurance business and pension fund de-risking plan and continued strong free cash flow generation with $1 billion returned to shareholders through share repurchase. ","While there was some pressure in our fourth quarter results the strength of our overall 2013 performance provides us with a solid foundation for growth in 2014. ","Now moving to operating results. Our full year consolidated revenues grew 11% to $32.4 billion, driven by contributions from each of our segments and growth in our targeted markets. 2013 earnings were $1.93 billion, which represents growth of 11% over 2012. ","Regarding the segments I will first comment on our Global Healthcare segment. Overall our Global Healthcare results for 2013 were solid. 2013 premium and fees grew 9% to $23 billion. Full year earnings were approximately $1.6 billion, representing growth of 6% driven by strong revenue growth in specialty contributions, operating expense efficiency and attractive medical costs in our commercial business partially offset by revenue and medical cost pressure in our seniors business. ","Turning to medical cost. Our customer and physician engagement capabilities continue to deliver differentiated value for our clients and customers. Our medical trend outlook has improved throughout the year and we delivered competitively attractive results. For our total U.S. commercial book of business full year medical cost trend was below 5% for 2013. ","Since nearly 85% of our U.S. commercial customers are in ASO funding arrangements they directly benefit from these favorable medical cost results. Regarding medical care ratios, in our U.S. commercial guaranteed trust business our full year 2013 medical care ratio or MCR was 81.5% on a reported basis or 82.3% excluding prior year reserve development. ","We are pleased with results of our commercial risk businesses, which continue to reflect strong pricing, disciplined underwriting and continued effective medical management and physician engagement. Our fourth quarter 2013 guaranteed cost of MCR was higher than prior year. Some of this increase was anticipated due to the impact of business mix and broker fee changes continuing into the fourth quarter and some from large claim activity and modestly increased utilization in the quarter. While on the high end of our expectations this result is within the normal range of variability we expect for this business. ","In our seniors business our full year 2013 MCR for Medicare Advantage was 84.8% on a reported basis or 85.2% excluding prior year reserve development. This is higher than we had expected. The elevated Medicare Advantage MCR for full year 2013 reflects revenue pressure driven by government reimbursement levels as well as higher medical costs. ","The claim pressure in the fourth quarter of Medicare Advantage MCR is a continuation of what began earlier in 2013. This pressure is not improving as we had expected. While we continue to focus on opportunities to improve medical costs for our seniors business we expect to see pressure in 2014 and have reflected this impact in our 2014 outlook. ","Moving to operating expenses, for 2013 our total global healthcare operating expense ratio, excluding special items was 21.7% which is a 90 basis point improvement over 2012 expense ratio. We accomplished this result while continuing to fund strategic investments. Overall we had a solid year in our global healthcare business. ","Now I'll discuss the results of our global supplemental benefits business which continues to deliver attractive growth and profitability. Premiums and fees in 2013 grew 27% over 2012, driven by contributions from our recent acquisitions, most notably Great American Supplemental Benefits and our Turkey joint ventures as well as strong customer retention and new business growth. ","2013 earnings in our global supplemental benefits business were $183 million, representing a 24% increase over 2012 and reflected attractive profitability while we continue to fund strategic investments for future growth. Fourth quarter results include some modest claim increases in our [Korea] operations due to seasonality and additional funding to enhance distribution capabilities. ","For Group Disability and Life, full year results were strong. Group premium and fees increased 10% over 2012 results. 2013 earnings in our Group business were $311 million, an increase of 11% over 2012 primarily driven by lower disability loss ratio and higher net investment income. ","For our corporate and another operations results totaled to an after-tax loss of $134 million for full year 2013. Overall our 2013 results reflect revenue and earnings growth from each of our business segments as well as significant free cash flow as a result of the continued effective execution of our strategy. ","Turning to our investment portfolio, for 2013 we recognized net realized investment gains of $141 million after tax, coupled with a strong net investment income results. Overall we continue to be pleased with the quality and diversification of our investment portfolio. ","Now I will discuss our outlook for 2014. While 2014 will be a disruptive and challenging environment we expect to continue to deliver differentiated value for our customers and clients and as a result strong financial performance, including revenue and earnings growth for our shareholders. This is based on effectively executing our focused strategy, leveraging our differentiated global capabilities and capitalizing on the multiple sources of growth in our diversified portfolio of businesses. ","For full year 2014 we expect consolidated revenues to grow in the range of 4% to 7% over 2013. We expect full year 2014 consolidated adjusted income from operations to be in the range of $1.9 billion to $2 billion or $6.80 to $7.20 per share. Consistent with prior practices our outlook excludes any contribution from additional capital deployment as well as any prior year claim development. ","Before reviewing more specifics for the year I'll comment briefly on the organizationally efficiency plan we implemented during the fourth quarter. As Ted mentioned we reported a special item charge of $40 million after tax related to the actions we are taking across our global operations, including actions to implement our pharmacy strategy. We estimate that these actions will yield annual after tax savings of approximately $45 billion going forward with the expected savings of $30 million after tax in 2014. The impact of these actions has been factored into our 2014 guidance. ","I'll now discuss the components of our 2014 outlook, starting with global healthcare. We expect full year global healthcare earnings in a range of approximately $1.58 billion to $1.64 billion compared to our 2013 result of $1.57 billion. Excluding 2013 prior-year claim development of $77 million after tax this represents growth of 5% to 9% in 2014. This outlook reflects continued benefits from organic revenue growth, specialty contributions and operating expense efficiencies partially offset by continued pressure in Medicare Advantage. This also includes our updated view of the annual enrollment trade results for both Medicare and the public exchange business. ","I'll now summarize some of the key accomplishments reflected in our global healthcare earnings outlook for 2014, starting with our customer base. Regarding global medical customers we expect 2014 customer growth of 1% to 2% after adjusting for the impact of the limited benefit business exit due to ACA legislation. Relative to Medicare Advantage, after taking into consideration the impact of market exits we expect modest growth overall during the course of 2014 with essentially flat customer growth in January. ","Turning to medical costs, our 2014 outlook assumes some increase in medical utilization versus current levels and this increase has been reflected in our pricing. For our total U.S commercial book of business we expect full year medical cost trend to be in the range of 5% to 6%. For our U.S. commercial guaranteed cost book of business we expect the 2014 medical care ratio to be in the range of 80% to 81%. This range is lower than our 2013 results and reflects strong medical cost management and ACA legislation impacts. ","For our seniors business our Medicare Advantage and CR for 2014 is expected to be in the range of 84% to 85%. This range reflects expected revenue and medical cost pressure in 2014. ","Regarding operating expenses, our 2014 global healthcare operating expense ratio is expected to be in the range of 22.5% to 23.5%. This range includes approximately 130 basis points due to impact of the industry fee and taxes. Overall we expect full year 2014 global healthcare earnings to be approximately $1.58 billion to $1.64 billion which we believe is a competitively attractive result. ","Now moving to the other components of our outlook, for our Global Supplemental Benefits business we expect continued strong top line growth and expect earnings in the range of $195 million to $215 million. This represents earnings growth of 7% to 17% when compared to 2013 and is consistent with our long term growth expectations. ","Regarding the Group Disability and Life business we expect full year 2014 earnings in a range of $305 million to $325 million, compared with a strong 2013 result of $311 million. Regarding our remaining operations, that is other operations and corporate we expect a loss of a $175 million for 2014. ","So all-in, for full year 2014 we expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $1.9 billion to $2 billion or $6.80 to $7.20 per share. This excludes the impact of any future capital deployment for prior year claim developments. Overall this result represents a competitively attractive outlook and a disrupted market environment and underscores the benefit of our diverse and differentiated portfolio of businesses. ","Before moving on I would note that we believe our 2014 earnings outlook will follow a different quarterly pattern this year for a number of reasons. These include absence of $48 million of after tax -- of prior year claim development in the first quarter of 2013 which translates to $0.17 on an earnings per share basis, the impact of sequestration and ACA related factors, start-up cost for business expansion and the timing of some expenses. As a result we expect first quarter earnings in 2014 will be lower than the prior year's first quarter. ","Now moving to our 2014 capital management position and outlook overall we continue to have good financial flexibility. Our subsidiaries remain well capitalized and are generating significant free cash flow to the parent with a strong return on capital in each of our business segments. Our capital deployment strategies and priorities have not changed. These priorities are providing the capital necessary to support the growth of our ongoing operations, pursuing M&A activity with a focus on acquiring capabilities and scale to further growth in our targeted areas of focus and after considering these first two items we would return capital to shareholders, primarily through share repurchase. ","Regarding free-cash flow during 2013 we repurchased 13.6 million in stock for approximately $1 billion and we ended the year with parent company cash of approximately $760 million. For full year 2014 we expect subsidiary dividends of $1.6 billion driven by a strong performance in each of our business segments. After considering all sources and uses of parent company cash and setting aside $250 million to meet liquidity means our outlook implies we would have approximately $1.8 billion available for capital deployment in 2014. ","During the period from January 1st to February 6th we repurchase 2.6 million shares of Cigna's common stock for $225 million. This amount is included as part of the $1.8 billion available for capital deployment. ","Overall our financial position and 2014 capital outlook remains strong. The strong margins and high returns on capital from each of our businesses coupled with the strength of our balance sheet means that we will continue to generate significant free cash flow to deploy for the benefit of shareholders. ","During our third quarter call we also discussed the progress we have made in improving our financial flexibility regarding the funding of our pension plan. Based on 2013 contributions, the equity's market strong performance and an increase in interest rates during the course of the year the funded status of the pension plans has continued to improve. As of December 31, 2013 the unfunded liability of our pension plans has improved $1 billion over year end 2012 and the pretax unfunded liability is now approximately $600 million. ","As a result we expect to contribute $100 million pretax to the pension plans in 2014 which is a significant reduction from prior years. This increases the free capital available for deployment in 2014 and has been contemplated in the capital outlook I guided earlier. ","Now to recap our full year 2013 consolidated results reflected the strength of our diversified portfolio of global businesses and the continued track record of effective execution of our focused strategy. Our 2013 performance provides a solid foundation for 2014, highlighted by differentiated capabilities that create value for our customers and clients, competitively attractive growth in revenue and earnings, continued targeted strategic investments to enable sustained growth into the future and continued strong free-cash flow.","While we expect a continued disrupted market environment we are confident in our ability to achieve our full year 2014 earnings outlook. And with that we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. ","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Yes and just hoping you can give us some more elaboration on the trend pressures on both the commercial and Medicare Advantage side, maybe just starting with which one is more concerning to you, it sounds like Medicare advantage because that's what you expect will persist to some degree into 2014, but correct me if I am wrong?","David M. Cordani ","Matthew good morning it's David let me start with the -- I call it the framing of Medicare and then ask Tom to give you a little bit more insights on the commercial because there are two very different dimensions. First with the Medicare loss ratio into context, as you recall we entered the year with expectations that our medical care ratio for Medicare Advantage would go up as we price for and position the book for adoption of ACA.","In addition to that last quarter we talked about the revenue pressure that continued to mount for the Medicare Advantage portfolio, like the sequestration, risk adjusted et cetera and we started to see the impact of a bit of an uptick in medical cost. That carried on through the fourth quarter and from our assessment it's most notably seen in facility-based cost, as you know that's in-patient and out-patient based cost. ","We see that manifesting itself a bit differently in our models. So we operate three different models in our portfolio; the integrated care delivery model, where we have either owned or tightly aligned delivery system; the highly engaged physician models; and then the less engaged physician models. While the impact of this facility elevation is taking place in many geographies, the impact driving the variance is different. So higher variance in the less engaged models, a lower variance in the integrated models if you will.","We have projected forward now that the impact of those medical cost pressures will carry into 2014. There is a variety of actions we can talk about later that we're implementing to address but we've taken the step forward and said until we see otherwise the impact of those medical cost pressures will continue into '14. We factored that into our outlook and still with the diversified portfolio we have were still able to grow earnings. ","I'll ask Tom to comment now about the guaranteed cost in the commercial loss ratio, that's a different dimension. Tom? ","Thomas A. McCarthy","Yeah Matt again on the commercial MCF if you step back the fundamentals of our commercial results for the year were very strong. Over the course of the year we continued to improve the outlook for the GCNCR, basically reflecting the very good overall medical trend in managed we've had for the year and we ended up with very strong medical cost trend for the total year. ","In the fourth quarter we did see some increased variability, with both the large claims and some increased utilization. So we did end up on the high expectations of our -- high range of the expectations for the quarter but as you said more in-line with what we might expect for the performance on that business. And I would point we've previously commented there is potential for some uptick in results and utilization there, so not quite a surprise. ","So in addition to the fact that we have a relatively small guaranteed cost block, this variability we see as more in-line with expectations versus the experience we saw in Medicare. ","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Just one clarification there, when you talk about facility based cost on the Medicare side do you mean more utilization or unit cost? ","David M. Cordani ","Matt it's David, it's less utilization, so the way we think about it, it's a combination of mix and services, causing an increase in either cost for admit or cost per episode of care. So it's manifesting itself more in terms of the, I will call it billing aspect as opposed to the utilization aspect. ","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Or the acuity, is that a fair word to use?","David M. Cordani ","I am going to say Mathew, yes but so acuities I think if our clinicians would hear they would say the acuities and diagnosis spiking up, and I have to say we don't have the data to say that. The costs per episode of care are going up, and we see the impact of that in many geographies. But we don't see the one-for-one in terms of the acuity or the, I'll call it, severity of illness changing one-for-one with that. ","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Got it thank you. ","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Borsch. The next question comes from Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to come to the corporate and other expenses. If I look at the guidance for the full year and you implied -- what you had implied for the fourth quarter, it looks like those costs for the full year came in meaningfully below what you were looking for, particularly in the fourth quarter. Can you help us understand what might have changed relative to what you were looking for in 3Q? Thanks. ","Thomas A. McCarthy","Chris, it's Tom I would say corporate results actually ran favorably through the whole year in 2013 including some tax items and really what's reflected in the outlook for 2014 is return to a more normal year. ","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group","Okay. So is it fair to say it was about $23.5 million to $29.5 million delta relative to what you are guiding for in 3Q? ","Thomas A. McCarthy","I think we gave a range in 3Q. So it was a little better in the quarter but not -- that sounds a little high to me but somewhere in that range. ","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group","Okay. Thanks. ","Operator","Thank you Mr. Rigg. The next question comes from Justin Lake with JPMorgan.","Justin Lake - JPMorgan","Thanks good morning. First I just want to go back to the Medicare Advantage cost, specifically because I know your book is pretty heavily capitated, so I am somewhat surprised with the magnitude of the MLR increase year-over-year. Can you walk us through that in terms of how much the actual core MLR had to be changing in order to have this flow through given your capitation agreement? ","And then also as you kind of look out to 2014, given the MLR you've guided to in Medicare Advantage of 84% to 85% plus the tax, the typical SG&A, can you give us an idea where the MA margin kind of will sit under that MLR?","David M. Cordani","Justin, it's David. Let me start. First you used the term capitation. So I am going to use a different term, right. We have aligned physician relationships with our more shared risk relationships. So capitation tends to be a risk transfer as opposed to shared risk. But stepping back and following your logic, to my prior comment, what we've seen is the facility cost pressure is in multiple geographies, the performance or variance that we are experiencing is different. ","So to your point in the less engaged or less aligned reimbursement models we're seeing more variability or more of a financial impact. In the most aligned models we're seeing less variability and less impact. So you are seeing the impact of your term capitation, I'll use risk alignment. Additionally as we looked into 2014 from a growth standpoint our net either new business adds or new business beliefs were stronger in the integrated markets or the highly aligned physician markets as opposed to the less integrated or less physician aligned. So we see that variability playing through but the macro point here is that the facility-based cost structure is in multiple geographies. ","As it relates to 2014 the headline is this in our outlook and projection will create margin pressure or a decrement to Medicare Advantage margin 2014 relative to 2013. And even with that taken into as a whole of the diversification of our business we are able to grow earnings in 2014. ","Justin Lake - JPMorgan","I guess what I was trying to get to on the margin question, David is just understanding what do you think the core margin of this business is longer-term and where does that sit in 2014 versus that kind of longer-term target, obviously with the thinking that 2015 is also going to have some pressure. So kind of the baseline where you are probably going to pass most of the cost over to the beneficiary at this point or get more efficient or do you feel like margins have further to potentially fall given the potential -- the rate pressures that we are looking through '15?","Thomas A. McCarthy","Well, Justin it's Tom again. In the long term we continue to see this business as kind of a mid-single-digit pretax margin performer. Obviously the pressure we talked about in '14 will be below that and as you pointed out kind of a flattish loss ratio doesn't get us to our target margins given the introduction of the industry fee in 2014. So I don't think we are prepared to quantify exactly where we would end up in 2014 but it will be below our long-term expectation for the business. ","Justin Lake - JPMorgan","Okay, great, thanks. ","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Lake. The next question comes from Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank. ","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank","Thanks. I was hoping if you could give us an update on some of the metrics around the exchange business so far, the public exchange in terms of how much enrollment have you seen so far and some of the indicators on the risk mix. And then just more broadly whether you expect the exchange business to be profitable or unprofitable in 2014?","David M. Cordani","Good morning, Scott, it's David. So as for the public exchange as you recall we've been open but highly focused, meaning open to the marketplace but highly focused. So to remind you we are in five states and a limited number of specific markets within those states. At a macro level our experience to date has been in-line with lot of the headlines that you have seen and we've seen with the lower all-in overall addition or adoption rate therefore lower covered lives and with an older base. ","To put in context about half of the business we put on for January 1 came through the exchange and the half of the business came through off-exchange. As it relates to the makeup of the business think about the majority of our on-exchange business being in the silver plan. Think about a little variability in terms of the mix versus our assumption in terms of a little older mix relative to population. ","Those who've bought on-exchange about 75% of them were subsidy eligible. And then finally to your last piece of your question we assume for this portfolio of business that this will not be a profit driver or a money maker for us in 2014 at this point. ","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thanks for those details. And then just a follow-up question just on group insurance and global supplemental benefits. Do you just have an outlook for revenue growth for each of those segments for us?","Thomas A. McCarthy","Well I don't think we've -- it's Tom, Scott. I don't think we provide the specific details of revenue growth by segment. But just overall in the commentary that we're expecting continued growth in-line with what we've seen lately in both of those businesses. ","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Maybe, Tom to put it another way, do you think about top line growth in those businesses sort of in a similar trajectory as margins or earnings growth, or is there something on the margin side any of those that we should be considering relative to top line growth? ","Thomas A. McCarthy","Probably fair in relation to global sup and group, I'll remind you 2013 was a pretty strong margin year. So the revenue might grow a little faster than the after tax profit in group, that's fair. ","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank","Okay thank you. ","Operator","Thank you Mr. Fidel. The next question comes from Josh Raskin with Barclays. ","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital","Hi, thanks and good morning. Wanting to ask actually on the private exchanges, if you guys had any data or information around your experience, I know David you said, you are participating in several of them. So I am curious do you have any update data on how many lives you have single lives in '13 moved into exchanges in '14 and then may be how many you've gotten out of the private exchanges you are participating in, in 2014? And what's the mix of ASO and risk profile? ","David M. Cordani ","Good morning Josh, it's David. Just a moment of backdrop, as we said before, we view the private exchange environment is in the early stages of innovation and these markets have the potential for creating sustainable models on a go-forward basis. To-date we've focused on -- our energies on a number of the exchanges and those that most closely aligned with the needs of our current and target clients. ","Also as you may have recently seen we announced and launched our own proprietary exchange when we made that public announcement this week. Specific to your question I mean as we anticipated 2014 has a small impact for Cigna from an exchange standpoint both inflows and outflows.","You can net them together and see if there is a diminished impact, think of tens of thousands of customers, not hundreds of thousands of customers with some new business adds and some losses in terms of the exchange netting to a small number that is not a needle mover for our membership, and slightly biased to the ASO but not limited only to ASO in terms of the movement in terms of how we're playing. ","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital","Okay got you. And then just to clarify, I think you said Medicare Advantage membership you were expecting growth this year. It looks like just from the CMS data and I know it's never complete for the January month but it looks like you guys were down about 5,000 lives, did you say first quarter would be flat or the full year would be flat, I am trying to\u2026.","Thomas A. McCarthy","Josh you put the puzzle pieces together correctly, this is Tom. First of the year flattish, down 5,000 lives. Full year we expect to grow modestly. ","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital","Okay, perfect. ","Operator","Thank you Mr. Raskin. The next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","Thanks good morning wanted to go back to MA, is it something you sense in the population that you attracted that's sort of driving the higher MLRs we haven't really seen a pop up to this point with peers and I guess how would you get a better handle on it?","And then along those lines how should we think about the higher trend in the context of your 2014 bids? And any sense at this point you talked about moderate growth there has been others in the industry that are going to grow significantly in terms of enrollment, any shot of churn as it relates to some of your existing -- if you can give that gross versus term expectation that would be helpful. Thanks. ","David M. Cordani ","Ralph, good morning, it's David. Just I'll give you a little color on the multiple questions you have there. First as we noted before we saw impact beginning to manifest itself in 2013, tied to facility-based costs and from our point of view the pressure that's being put back on the hospital systems as it relates to reimbursement pressure from the government we see making its way through the system and most notably in Medicare. ","As I noted before not utilization but mix of reimbursement for the services, either per episode or kind of mix of acuity in terms of the billing as it relates to services. On a go-forward basis there is a number of actions that we're focused on driving in terms of our business to position us for 2015.","Having said that we've taken a more cautious view of our outlook for the Medicare business and factored that into our outlook for 2014. As it relates to the gross, the gross net lives think about our gross for 2014 overall, Tom just summarized it, over the year we'll grow somewhat in Medicare Advantage, a bunch of moving parts there. We'll have organic growth in the first quarter of the year, offset by some strategic market exits. We've also entered two new markets in 2014.","As we look at the make-up of our net losses and net gains, our growth profile is stronger in the integrated care delivery markets as well as those markets that have the most mature physician engagement model and some other markets that have less mature physician engagement models or less engaged physicians, we took a little bit more cautious approach relative to our product positioning in an effort to protect the margin sustainability, hence we lost some lives there.","So net, there is not a single churn answer. It varies by market, I will ask Tom to expand on that. ","Thomas A. McCarthy","One other thing on that, Ralph so again to the point of how we are feeling about the health of the business, given the modest growth, obviously there isn't much turnover in lives in our portfolio, so we think we have a pretty good handle on that impact, our outlook is about 10% of our customers will be new to us. And that after you figure out [inaudible] in and out of lives and that compares to about 12% last year, so very consistent with our long term results.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","Okay that's helpful. And then just one more quick one you've done a lot over the last 12 months to disrupt the balance sheet, with that being in pension. Just want to get an update your interest level in M&A at this point, any specific areas you'd like to bulk up or expand into and maybe even any thoughts on dividend at this point? Thank you.","David M. Cordani ","Ralph I'll comment on M&A and I'll ask Tom to talk to us about the overall capital deployment priorities. As it relates to M&A, no major change in posture for us. We continue to view that we are strategically and financially attractive. There are three major categories of M&A opportunity that continue to be attractive for us. First, further expansion of our global footprint in global portfolio capabilities. ","Second, U.S. seniors and\/or duals capability that enable us to serve the growing duals population, and third our retail-based capabilities that allow us to better deliver more personalized solution distribution service capabilities, et cetera. So that kind of portfolio of priorities has not changed for us and if you look back over the last several years you can see we've been disciplined in terms of staying in those categories. ","I'll ask Tom to elaborate a little bit more to the capital deployment priorities because as he referenced in his prepared remarks we will have a significant amount of free cash flow and capital to deploy in 2014.","Thomas A. McCarthy ","Well and as we reiterated in the prepared remarks, so our first priority in capital deployment of course is to invest to support organic growth. Now the margin profile of our business tends to generate significant capital in excess of what's needed to finance internal growth. So that does give us the opportunity to deploy capital elsewhere. ","As we've said many times we like to deploy capital strategically, that would be our preference through M&A or business expansions. Then if we don't find the right opportunities to do that we do return capital to shareholders. We're still using share repurchase as our primary vehicle for returning capital to shareholders. We do regularly revisit dividend policy, but at this point there is no change in that.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Giacobbe. The next question comes from Christine Arnold with Cowen. ","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC","Good morning. As I look to my model, it seems like something at other MLR were elevated, I am kind of calculating in back of the envelope and haven't had much time with it. But it looks like the stop loss and experienced weighted-loss ratios were up about five percentage points year-over-year and also up pretty significantly. What's going on there?","Thomas A. McCarthy ","Christine, it's Tom. So first a couple of things. Just stepping back, that global MCR does have a lot of moving pieces to it. So the characteristics of the business is the loss ratio versus expense ratio that we have across the broad portfolio are very diverse and even with the experience rate we have different business types that have different MCR levels. ","So the movement around in the global result has a number of impacts in it. I would point to you though the headline result here really is the variability in our GC MCR in the commercial business. On the stop loss side we also did have a small change in reserving methodology, that produced some reserve strengthening in stop loss, but overall no material change to the overall for that business.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC","So was the international loss ratio up within -- I am trying to figure out there's lot of stuff going on here and I guess just to lay on the table expect the question on trends rising, because it's not, relative to this model, it's not just guaranteed cost and Medicare Advantage. There is other stuff that's significantly happening on the loss ratios.","Thomas A. McCarthy ","Again Christine I take you to the bottom line, the bottom line margins really, the variability there is explained by what we talked about and the additional variability within -- the loss, the MCR really is more of a function of business mix. And again different lines of business have different loss ratios even though they have the same bottom line margin contribution. ","David M. Cordani ","Christine, the only add is that you referenced to a number of various lines of business in there. ","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC","Right. ","David M. Cordani ","So consequentially you could have some puts and takes within the various experience-rated different funding types. The loss ratio as reported in that aggregate loss ratio will move but the margin profile does not. And the headline that Tom is delivering is the important one which is the underlying margin profile of the discrete businesses is strong and intact in carrying into the new year. I also would flag it otherwise, also it's the reason while we caution not to overly analyze that aggregate parts because there is so many moving parts in it. ","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC","One last question here. I am trying to get kind of a run rate for fourth quarter, was that prior period negative development perhaps related to prior quarters such that the fourth quarter maybe was better than it looked on a run-rate basis?","Thomas A. McCarthy","Well actually in the fourth quarter as I mentioned we did do a very small stop loss reserving methodology change. So there really was modest negative prior period development in the fourth quarter in commercial. ","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC","But only in that stop loss ","Thomas A. McCarthy","Yes. ","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay, thanks. ","Operator","Thank you, Ms. Arnold. The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. ","Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great, thanks. I want to go back to the [appetite] for M&A here I mean I guess I think I understand what you are saying, the higher costs or being caused by in Q4 and expectation in 2014. But I guess is there a good way to get on top of those costs and really adjust that if you are below your target margin for 2014. I mean how do you think about positioning yourselves and getting back to normal margin when the '15 rates are also going to be difficult?","David M. Cordani ","Kevin, good morning, it's David. There is two different sets of actions that are currently being actively worked, and again as I referenced before, they are going to be different depending on the market type. So our integrated markets versus our highly activated physician markets versus our less activated physician markets. ","But as you think about bucket number one it's to further accelerate our timeframe to move less activated physicians to more activated and get them into the shared risk model or on a more accelerated basis deal with call in from the network. So that's buffer number one. And in those markets over the near-term I would say more comprehensively use traditional medical management and cost tools which you typically don't use in the more activated physician market. So that's bucket of actions number one, ","Bucket of action number two around the facility side, several different actions. One is to seek for outright reimbursement activity to adjust to reimbursement levels contractually with the facilities. Absent your ability to do that seek to use the activated physicians to guide their patients to higher value facilities and lever free standing surgery centers where appropriate where the value is best. ","And then finally if you are not able to get to the desired outcome as we are looking towards on the 2015 environment be willing to remove an underperforming facility from the network still obviously delivering network adequacy. ","So all those actions are being worked. We believe you take in the -- an informed view of the earnings for 2014 into our outlook when stepping down our outlook here and our margin expectations but you hit the nail on the head on getting as much visibility into it as possible as we go into the second quarter for the bid cycle. And we believe we'll make some good traction in these actions. ","Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And does this dynamic with the clear out performance of the targeted provider alignment change your view at all about your ability to enter new markets over the next couple of years, and continue in markets you get this year and above with you might add one to two per year after that, does it harder to do that if you really need to have the specific alignment or is there enough kind of out there to be able to continue to enter new markets in 2015 and beyond?","Thomas A. McCarthy","Kevin, you speak to a real important point. I am going to answer yes and no. So the difference here is if you enter a new market de novo with no activated physician relationships the time to go from that to a fully activated shared risk is probably too long given the reimbursement environment we operate in. ","So it puts a premium on choosing those markets that are both attractive from a senior standpoint and very importantly we have well developed commercial relationships with physician groups in integrated care delivery systems. We are already moving through that activated physician environment. So the opportunity for us is given that we have 86 of them up and running, we have more than our fair share of opportunities in front of us in new market to choose from. ","So that's where the opportunity is and we would expect to continue to open new markets building off of the successful the success with the commercial proposition. So it comprises the timeframe where you could go from no activation to fully activated and integrated. And those collaborators will help us accelerate that timeframe. ","Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And just last question here on the efficiency review, it sounds like a lot of it was actually the Catamaran thing, I just wonder if that was right and if PBM is not part of that, understand kind of what has spurred this review and then just an update on how Catamaran is going? ","Thomas A. McCarthy","Kevin, it's Tom. So PBM is part of the restructuring but I wouldn't to say it's the majority of it or it was never close to all of it. The restructuring included a number of factors. First just some general process improvement and efficiency enhancement throughout the organization. As we mentioned the impact from PBM implementation. We also were able to consolidate some real-estate locations and we had some realignment costs in our overseas operations. So it was a number of things across the organization to better position ourselves to grow and give us success into the investing initiative. ","David M. Cordani ","Kevin the only add I would give you to that is we have now a track record over the last four plus years in terms of continuing to seek efficiency and effectiveness gains in part folding that back into our investment portfolio to continue to invest that into new markets, new capabilities. And in part taking to shore up the expense ratio on a run rate basis in terms of the improvement you've seen year-over-year. ","And this is a continuation of that good progress the organization has driven. ","Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And expand a bit on how Catamaran is going? ","Thomas A. McCarthy","So we also put the PBM in total just putting Catamaran back in the context the PDM sets off another very strong year for us delivering very good economic outcomes, very good clinical outcomes for the benefit of our customers. Again in terms of how it's going just to remind what we are seeking to do, we are seeking to further improve on the operating platform \\to drive the level of flexibility that's necessary to innovate for the future, further improve the underlying cost of goods sold for the pharmacy business as well as administrative expenses. ","We've set ourselves a target for 2015 of about $0.50 EPS accretion and 2014 as a transition year is progressing well. ","Operator","Thank you Mr. Fischbeck. The next question comes from A. J. Rice with UBS. ","Albert J. Rice - UBS","Hi, everybody just to think through conceptually how you're setting up the guidance when you released third quarter and came in ahead of expectation, I think your comment at that point was on the increased performance you expected revenue growth and earnings growth for 2014. Today obviously you gave us a formal guidance and admittedly none of the other major companies are even projecting any growth, but at the high-end you have about 6%, at the low end about flat year-to-year. ","Has there been any change, I am trying to put in perspective the comments about what you saw on the fourth quarter? Have you changed -- any of these things changing your view about 2014 relative to where it was three months ago. ","David M. Cordani ","A.J. it's David. So I think macro, you have the right picture here. When we provided the comments after the third quarter we said we expect the organization to grow both revenue and earnings albeit at a lower rate than our historic run rate. ","I mean as we look at 2014 our opinion of that is when you take that 2013 results that we're rather proud of, when you back out the prior year reserve development because we don\u2019t project any we jump off of a base of about 1.85 and we've given the range of 1.9 to 2, I mean that's a base that we believe is attractive. ","The only think that changed in a while is what we've spent the time on this morning, is that our assumption on a perspective basis is that the medical cost pressure in Medicare will continue into 2014. So that reduces our Medicare Advantage expectation. But with the breadth of our portfolio we're still able to harness the overall strength of the portfolio and still delivering attractive revenue result on an organic basis, still delivering attractive overall earnings result and to remind you we don\u2019t project any reserve development in our outlook and we're not projecting any further capital deployment beyond what Tom referenced. ","So all in we think it's an attractive result for 2014 off of a very strong 2013. ","Albert J. Rice - UBS","Okay. And just may be a quick follow-up to that you mentioned in this morning that in January alone you bought $225 million worth of stock. I guess how should we think about that in the context of this. I mean is it all of about that fact that you've got this extra liquidity that going to be available to you or in anticipation of today's result I guess it's interesting to me that you were fairly aggressive in purchasing in January, even coming up on this?","Thomas A. McCarthy","A.J., it's Tom I mean our share repurchase program tends to follow periodic pattern of repurchase. There is really no this particular signaling and decisions we make there and obviously we don\u2019t give any guidance to future repurchase activity. ","Albert J. Rice - UBS","Okay, all right thanks. ","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Rice. The next question comes from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. ","Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann & Company","Yeah, hi, thanks, good morning. So was just trying to put the third quarter and the fourth quarter and your guidance in context with growth model, longer term. If I just looked at global healthcare it appears you have continued margin pressure. You were probably in the high single to low doubles even maybe on margins. You are guiding to mid-single, so I mean it's less of a growth story. '14 you have Catamaran, so the healthcare and global healthcare. ","So just longer-term is that whole business line going to be a slow growth for you -- are you seeing more conversions of self-insured. And then on the global supplemental side you were growing at a much higher pace in 2013 and now you are guiding to 17% which maybe your longer term growth guidance but again that was kind of an outsized growth, it feels like that's slowing down as well? ","So what gives you confidence about your growth model and the whole fit about Cigna being a longer-term kind of build story that's undervalued in the long-term and are you signing any deals, to enhance the supplemental growth? ","David M. Cordani ","Well, Ana, good morning it's David. I think you put about 16 questions in to that. So I am going to take the first part. You probably framed -- of the underlying earnings performance and the earnings trajectory and the drivers of that. So I will take that piece of it. And then I am going to ask Tom to take the global sup component of your question. ","When you think about 2013 just to put it back in context, for 2013 we successfully executed and delivered 11 and 11 from the top line and the bottom-line and 13% for the EPS and we were able to increase our outlook each quarter and we feel great about the overall year acknowledging the fourth quarter pressure on Medicare Advantage. ","Looking to 2014 in a marketplace that's going to have a series of headwinds, including MA for the marketplace, including us -- our assumption of no prior reserve development, we are running off the limited benefit business which previously we gave you context to say that's about $30 million of earnings or so and that's still in the right trajectory. As well as in 2013 we delivered a medical cost that was superior to the underlying assumption. So we had positive spread from our ratings. ","Looking to 2014 we don't make those assumptions. So in 2014, you have tailwinds which include ongoing organic growth in a very challenging market and we have a track record of delivery of that. Two, ongoing expense leverage, which we have a track record of delivery. And three, contributions from further strengthening of our PBM. ","Taken as a whole we will generate organic earnings growth and organic revenue growth that we see as competitively attractive in a disruptive environment. And we believe positions us with strength as the marketplace conditions change somewhat to be able to continue to grow both our U.S. healthcare business, our global healthcare business, our global sup business our disability business as-well-as the seniors business as we get repositioned. ","As it relates to deal, I will comment very briefly relative to that and kick you back to Tom on the global sup question you specifically asked. You see in our past track record we've been targeted and opportunistic relative to acquisitions that make good strategic and financial sense. ","We've been very consistent in terms of where we see the category of assets we are attracted to and we will be disciplined relative to that, but our underlying organic earnings growth rate is what will drive the organization and very importantly, a level of free cash flow production because of the profile of our businesses that's going to be very attractive, no matter how we seek to deploy it for shareholder value creation. I'll ask Tom to talk a little bit more about global sup. ","Thomas A. McCarthy ","Yeah, Ana stepping back on global sup, obviously 2013 was very strong year, right, 27% revenue growth and 24% earnings growth, both very strong metrics. The revenue growth split about 50-50 between acquisitions and organically. So kind of the run-rate revenue growth in '13, excluding the inorganic activity was in the range of the long term expectation we had in the mid-teens. And that's again what we would expect to normally see in global sup going forward. ","Our earnings projection for '14 is a little bit wide of that but keep in mind '14 has some start-up activities going on in it that tend to contribute over the longer-term but well within the range of what we might expect in that business and we are very comfortable with our positioning in these fast growing markets overseas. ","Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann & Company","And then self-insured, do you think that conversion continues? ","David M. Cordani ","No. ","Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann & Company","That's huge versus your growth? ","David M. Cordani ","Ana what we've seen to-date as it relates to self-insured that's been a continuation for us. So when you look at where there is indication the bulk of the regional segment and we define the regional segment quite broadly, it's the larger segment of business that we run in our company today. Employers are 250 to 5,000 employees and large single site, single state piece of the business, the bulk of that is self-funded. ","Interestingly when you go down to the select segment, our fastest growing segment 50 to 250 employees and we've seen systematically growth of penetration of the self-funded capabilities. So Ana thinking about on that trajectory wise a few years ago you would had less than 50% of the new sales being self-funded and more than 50% of the sales being risk of guarantee cost, a year and half ago it was approached the 50-50 most recently it's 70% or so is self-funded and but still a full 30% of it being guaranteed cost and we're able to offer successfully both of those alternatives. ","So both parts are attractive but the self-funded continues to do well largely because it's a highly transparent funding mechanism that allows us to align our incentives and the employer's incentives, give a level of visibility with them monthly and quarterly to actively manage their care programs, their health improvement programs. ","Operator","Thank you Ms. Gupte The next question comes from Carl McDonald with Citigroup. ","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup","Great, thanks. I am going to ask Christine's question in a different way. If I look in the healthcare segment, Medicare expenses went up about $90 million sequentially in the fourth quarter. 45 million of that was guaranteed cost but the PDP was down $30 million sequentially and Medicare advantage was basically flat. ","So somewhere in the other products Medical expenses went up $75 million sequentially that seems like too big just to be a stop loss reserve .Adjustment so just wondering do you have any comment on that? ","Thomas A. McCarthy","Yeah Carl it's Tom, again different perspectives on different things you are trying to triangulate. It sounded like you were going sequential quarter three to quarter four. While I haven't done the math to reconcile the 90 million that you point out, we do expect pretty much heavy fourth quarter now an uptick in medical claims due to the [weather] impact. And I suspect that's what's underlying the math that you're seeing although again I haven't done the math that way to figure it out. ","Again the headline on the medical cost results in the fourth quarter in commercial is as we've talked about some variability due to large claims and an uptick in utilization. ","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup","And there's definitely an increase in the guaranteed cost it just seems like there is $75 million missing somewhere else that hasn\u2019t been explained. Second question is just on the Medicare loss ratio, it's increased to 150 basis points in each of the last two quarters. So what's get you comfortable that we are going to see that stabilize in 2014 rather than continue that acceleration? ","Thomas A. McCarthy","Carl, it's Tom again. A good deal of that Medicare MCR increased also related to revenue pressure both as sequestration worked in over the year, risk adjusters adjusted over the course of the year. So those things we would expect to normalize out and the issue we're focused on is making sure we can get the medical costs under control. ","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup","Okay. Thank you. ","Operator"," Thanks you, Mr. McDonald. The next question comes from Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley. ","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co.","Hi thanks. Just a quick one here. I was thinking about your cost trend guidance for the year of 5% to 6%, only about a 50 basis point increase at the mid-point versus I guess when you started 2013 you were actually thinking in the region of 6% to 7%. So may be any color about how trends developed this year and your expectations for next year? And then any more detail on what's really driving that 50 basis points I think you said utilization I know have ACA related costs and then may be anything around in-patient versus out-patient, any of the other drivers, thanks? ","David M. Cordani ","Andy, it's David and just at a macro level and as Tom noted in his prepared remarks 2013 coming in favorable to 5% with that back in context we have several years in a row of competitively very attractive medical cost stream and as Tom noted with 85% of our book of business being self-funded those clients and employees benefit directly from that","As it relates to looking forward for 2014 what we're projecting somewhat of an uptick to that trend. So will go below five to five to six, so to the mid-point of little greater than the 50 basis points you made reference to. But the major headline in there is we've been still making some assumptions that some of the utilization pattern will uptick slightly. ","There is no major category changes that are sea changes in there, little percentage but no major category sea changes in there for the commercial population. ","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co.","Okay. So the most increase you're expecting is all utilization driven, anything related to ACA driving that at all or\u2026?","David M. Cordani ","Not, especially to call out. ","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co."," Okay. Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Schenker. The final question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies.","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. On your -- I wondered David if there were any callouts or proof points that you could highlight on your ACO strategy and is that a critical, enough of a critical mass to have a major impact on your cost sharing performance across the business. ","David M. Cordani ","Sure, David. To context and come back to some of the prepared remarks. Well again the collaborative accountable care as we call them are still in the early stages of development. We are really pleased in terms of the amount of growth we have seen in those. So 50% growth year-over-year in number of customers that are experiencing it of about 400,000 lives going from a base of 800,000 to about 1.2 million, both seniors as well as commercial. Growth in collaboratives going from low 50s to mid-80s in terms of number of collaboratives. To the core of your question proof points, we are able to see now in some of the more mature collaboratives a meaningful improvement in both clinical quality engagement and cost. ","So then it comes down to the ability to move trend is you really see trend move for employers that are higher utilizers of those collaboratives. So we have high concentration coming through to the benefit of some of those collaboratives. And with at a density of 80 plus collaboratives we have the ability in some markets to offer a network constellation that will have just the collaboratives or an incented collaborative model where the employer can make the decision to more aggressively steer their employees in that direction. ","So headline is meaningful growth, still early but meaningful growth in terms of lives, physicians, collaboratives. Two, the exciting news is the proof points we would say off of an open access high performance clinical model, another step function in cost improvement and clinical quality because of the customer-physician engagement and that's really what that matters. And then driving now in a density where some employers could really benefit from using just collaboratives or highly intensive collaboratives that's the next stage what we are driving towards right now. ","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC","So a question kind of off the main topics here. The disability business I think has been under pressure from the general economic cycle. Has that turned the corner, I think disability was called out as a better performer?","David M. Cordani ","Well I think you're right. Disability did perform really well in 2013. And as you pointed it's been operating in a very challenging environment over the last few years given the low interest rate and high unemployment. And we are, all are hoping both of those are normalizing and within that time frame through our focus on health and productivity produced great results that allowed us to mitigate a great deal of the environmental pressure and the fundamentals of our productivity in the world return to [work tools] in that business are very strong. ","So as you say going into 2014 the background is improving market conditions and investment results. We are expecting to have another strong year. ","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Windley. I will now turn the call back to David Cordani for closing remarks. ","David M. Cordani ","Thanks. So to wrap up I just want to emphasize a few key points from our discussion this morning. Cigna's full year results were strong and include earnings and revenue growth from each of our business segments, continuing our track record of strong financial result for the fourth consecutive year. ","Our outstanding performances, made possible by the passion and focus of our 35,000 colleagues who are deployed around the world. And our Go Deep, Go Global, Go Individual strategy has enabled us to grow over the long-term in the midst of environment that continues to undergo considerable change and disruption. By leveraging our flexible and transferable capabilities across the globe which include our ability to have a deep understanding of our customers, use of complicated distribution and physician capabilities, we will continue to compete and win in the global markets for the benefit of our customers, clients and shareholders. ","And based on this we are confident in achieving our full year outlook for 2014. And we remain committed to our long-term EPS growth outlook of 10% to 13%. We want to thank you for joining us this morning and your continued interest in Cigna. And we look forward to continue our dialog with you as the year unfolds.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the question-and-answer session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Ted Detrick. Please go ahead, Mr. Detrick.","Edwin J. Detrick","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I am Ted Detrick, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom McCarthy, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer.","In our remarks today, David will begin by commenting on Cigna's third quarter 2013 results. He will then discuss how our diversified portfolio of businesses, coupled with their differentiated capabilities, positioned us well for sustained future growth. Finally, Dave will conclude his remarks by making some brief observations about our expectations for 2014. Next, Tom will review the financial results for the third quarter and provide an update on Cigna's financial outlook for full year 2013. We will then open the lines for your questions. And following our question-and-answer session, David will provide some brief closing remarks before we end the call.","Now as noted in our earnings release, Cigna uses certain financial measures which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP, when describing financial results. Specifically, we use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and earnings per share on a same basis as the principal measures of performance for Cigna and our operating segments, and a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com.","Now in our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking comments. We would remind you that there are risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations, and those risk factors are discussed in today's earnings release.","And finally, please note that when we discuss our full year 2013 outlook and discuss our expectations for 2014, it will be on the basis of adjusted income from operations. In addition, our comments regarding both outlook and expectations for earnings per share will be on a basis which exclude the effects of any future capital deployment.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to David.","David M. Cordani","Thanks, Ted, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll briefly discuss our financial performance for the third quarter and review our outlook for the remainder of 2013, then I'll address how our clear strategy and consistent focus execution across our portfolio of diversified businesses continue to drive differentiated value for our customers and clients and attractive financial results for our shareholders. I'll also highlight how our differentiated capabilities position us to continue to deliver attractive growth. And finally, I'll provide some brief observations on our positioning for 2014.","I'll start with some highlights from the quarter. Our focused execution of our strategy delivered strong third quarter results in each of Cigna's business segments, continuing our momentum from the first half of the year. Our third quarter consolidated revenue increased by 10% totaling $8.1 billion. We reported adjusted income from operations of $536 million or $1.89 per share, which represents a per-share increase of 12% over a strong third quarter of 2012.","Turning to each of our business segments. Our Global Health Care business, again, performed well this quarter, with continued favorable medical cost and disciplined operating expense management in the Commercial business, partially offset by some pressure in Medicare Advantage results. We reported strong contributions from our Global Supplemental Benefits business, while making, as expected, increased investments to position us for sustainable future growth. In our Group Disability and Life business, we delivered solid results and, again, grew our book of business. Our attractive consolidated revenue and earnings results extend our momentum from the first half of this year and give us confidence that we will achieve our increased full year 2013 outlook.","Now stepping back from our operating results and evaluating the market environment. We believe Cigna is positioned to our strategy of Going Deep, Going Global and Going Individual to reach more customers in a personalized manner and to further improve affordability and clinical quality. Specifically, our strategy is helping us capitalize on some of the dynamics we're seeing in today's global marketplace, including employers, as well as individuals looking for affordable health care solutions; an increased focus on transitioning to payment systems based on performance and value rather than volume; and the continued emerging growth of the middle class around the world.","Beginning with the pursuit of affordable health care solutions, at Cigna, we seek to engage and incent individuals in their health and wellness, as well as the active management of the chronic and acute health conditions. We then seek to leverage our leading physician partnerships with the focuses on differentiated clinical and service quality, as well as improved affordability. We added 9 new collaborative accountable care relationships in the third quarter, which underscores the priority we are placing on these programs and the progress we are making in this critical area. This brings us to a total of 75 collaborative accountable care relationships nationwide.","At the same time, our move to further strengthen our PBM, which will further improve affordability, is progressing well. This puts us on track to deliver additional client flexibility in 2014, all while providing attractive shareholder returns. In addition to these changes that focus on affordability and quality, we're also seeing market changes that focus on expanding access to insurance. As you know, this is unfolding in the form of both public and private exchanges.","The public health care exchange marketplace went live on October 1. At CIGNA, we have maintained this very selective approach through the first phase of the public exchange opportunity. We are participating where we are best position to bring the greatest value to our customers. And as the Go Deep strategy suggests, we are sharply focused. As such, we are participating in 5 states. In these markets, our relative product and price positioning is consistent with our initial expectations.","Relative to the private exchanges, the marketplace is in the very early stages of development, and from our point of view, we expect a continued evolution of these models over time. In fact, we believe the private exchanges may create attractive, sustainable opportunities for some employers, who view them as a way to get their employees more engaged in their health care programs. At this early stage of development, we have chosen to participate in many of the first-generation private exchanges. As we look to the future, we believe the best long-term outcomes will be delivered in an environment where both employees and employers are engaged to improve health and productivity, while seeking to leverage the most efficient positioning gauge and models.","When we consider this initial stage of evolution and our differentiated health, wellness and physician engagement programs, as well as our proven direct-to-consumer engagement and marketing capabilities that we have developed and deployed around the world, we believe the private exchange marketplace gives Cigna a potentially attractive opportunity over the long term.","Turning now to how our strategy addresses our growing imperative for payment systems based on performance and value, rather than volume, really [ph] are referenced of significant progress in our CACs in the commercial market, now with 75 programs in place. Another example is Medicare Advantage, where our focus remains on driving differentiated care coordination, outstanding customer service, as well as lower overall costs, fueled by value-based rewards for physicians and health care systems. To that end, today, approximately 75% of our Medicare Advantage customers are currently in a lined physician model to pay for value.","Our focus on ongoing patient service and clinical quality improvement is underscored by our meaningful improvement in our 2014 Medicare Advantage stars ratings. We are pleased with our progress based on the updated ratings. We now expect about 40% of our Medicare Advantage customers to be in a 4 star or better plans. In addition, we are one of the few 5-star rated plans nationally, which is the only 5-star plan in Florida. This rating enables customer enrollment year round, which is a significant competitive advantage. This improvement can be partially attributed to our physician engagement model that rewards physicians for the commitment to the tripling goals, which is to improve health outcomes, delivering greater value for customers and driving better patient engagement and experience.","Transitioning now to the global markets. We are pleased with the results of our focused execution of our Go Global strategy. At CIGNA, we are capitalizing on the evolving global market dynamics, where the middle class is growing and, as such, their needs are expanding. We're effectively reaching new customers through market-leading customer insights and marketing capabilities, combined with innovative distribution strategies.","Our carefully built relationships with affinity partners around the world are helping us to reach customers with our innovative products. As of today, we have more than 150 affinity partnerships, and we are positioned to grow further. For example, in Thailand, we recently deepened our partnership with Tesco, becoming the only insurance company to offer health and accident products within Tesco's -- Tesco Lotus' superstores, our leader customer-centric retailer. In China, Cigna and China Merchants Bank just celebrated the 10th anniversary of our successful joint venture. And we're off to a good start with Cigna Finans, our joint venture partnership in Turkey. These partnerships all bring valuable health, life and other solutions to serve the rapidly growing middle classes in these countries, consistent with our Go Deep, Go Global and Go Individual strategy.","Now looking ahead, grounded in the performance of our diverse portfolio of businesses, which continues to deliver a track record of strong earnings and growth, I'm confident that we will achieve our increased full year outlook for 2013 and carry this momentum into 2014.","Specific to 2014, we expect it to be a challenging year, with the implementation of new laws and regulations and evolving distribution and care delivery models. In this environment, we have positioned ourselves with a diverse portfolio of businesses and differentiated capabilities. In 2014, we expect consolidated revenue and earnings growth over our increased 2013 outlook. It's important to note that we will achieve these differentiated results while we continue to invest for the long term. I would also remind you that our future expectations include the impact of any potential prior year reserve development or future capital deployment. We plan to provide detailed 2014 guidance during our fourth quarter call. Over the long term, we continue to see a competitively attractive growth outlook for Cigna.","Now to briefly summarize before turning it over to Tom. Cigna's third quarter performance marks another quarter of strong, top and bottom line results for our business. This continued strong performance is driven by the contributions of our more than 35,000 colleagues serving our customers around the globe. Their successful execution of our strategy and leveraging our differentiated capabilities across our diverse portfolio businesses in key global markets, we believe we are well-positioned to deliver competitively attractive results for 2014 and over the long term.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas A. McCarthy","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will review Cigna's third quarter 2013 results and provide an update to our full year outlook. I will also provide an update on progress that we've made to improve our financial flexibility, which is one of our strategic priorities.","The quarter included strong revenue and earnings performance in each of our operating segments. Quarterly earnings per share of $1.89, representing growth of 12% over the third quarter of 2012 and continued effective deployment of capital. Overall, the quarter reflects continued focused execution of our strategy and demonstrates the strong fundamentals of our operating businesses. The strength of these results provide us with good momentum and confidence to increase our full year financial outlook in 2013.","Now moving to some specifics. Third quarter consolidated revenues grew 10% over prior year to $8.1 billion, driven by growth in our targeted customer segments. Third quarter consolidated earnings were $536 million, representing 10% growth over the third quarter of 2012.","Regarding segment results, I will first comment on our Global Health Care segment. Overall, Global Health Care reported another good quarter, with continued strong results in our Commercial business and some pressure in Seniors. Third quarter premiums and fees grew 7% to $5.7 billion. We ended the third quarter with 14.3 million medical customers, representing year-to-date growth of 255,000 customers. Third quarter earnings in Global Health Care were $424 million and reflects strong revenue growth and special contributions, operating expense efficiencies and attractive medical costs. Third quarter results were also impacted by a favorable tax adjustment, offset by strengthening of a litigation accrual.","Turning now to medical costs. We continue to manage medical costs effectively and deliver strong clinical quality for our clients and customers. Medical costs also continue to reflect low utilization trends. As a reminder, given that nearly 85% of our U.S. Commercial customers are in ASO funding arrangements, our clients directly benefit from these favorable medical cost results.","Regarding medical care ratios, in our U.S. Commercial guaranteed cost business, our third quarter 2013 medical care ratio, or MCR, was 82.9%. We are pleased with the results of our commercial risk businesses as they continue to reflect both a strong pricing and disciplined underwriting approach and a continued, effective medical management and physician engagement.","In our Seniors business, our third quarter MCR for Medicare Advantage was 85.5% on a reported basis or 86.2% excluding prior year reserve development. This elevated Medicare Advantage MCR is due to a combination of revenue pressure and increased claim severity.","Across our Commercial and Seniors risk businesses, our third quarter earnings include favorable prior period reserve development of $20 million after-tax, of which $9 million relate to prior years.","Moving to operating expenses. For third quarter 2013, the total Global Health Care operating expense ratio was 21.8%. This ratio has improved over time, reflecting our ongoing commitment to drive expense efficiency, while maintaining strong service levels and continued funding of strategic investments. To recap, we had another strong quarter in our Global Health Care business.","Now I will discuss the results of our Global Supplemental Benefits business, which continues to deliver attractive growth and profitability. Premiums and fees grew 29% quarter-over-quarter to $634 million, driven by contributions from our recent acquisitions, most notably Great American Supplemental Benefits and our Turkey joint venture, as well as strong customer retention and new business growth. Third quarter earnings in our Global Supplemental Benefits business were $39 million, reflecting attractive profitability and, as anticipated, our increased funding of strategic investments for future growth.","For Group Disability and Life, third quarter results were strong. Group premiums and fees increased 9% over the third quarter of 2012 to $848 million. Third quarter earnings in our Group business were $92 million, reflecting stable results within our Disability book of business, partially offset by unfavorable life claims. The quarter also benefited from $26 million after-tax of favorable impacts from reserve studies, which compares to a $5 million favorable impact from reserve studies in the third quarter of 2012.","For our remaining operations, results totaled to an after-tax loss of $19 million for the third quarter 2013 and included the benefit of a $14 million after-tax gain associated with an IRS examination. Taken as a whole, our third quarter results reflect strong revenue and earnings contributions from our ongoing businesses, as well as significant free cash flow as a result of a continued effective execution of our strategy.","Now I will discuss our full year 2013 outlook. We now expect consolidated revenues to grow in the range of 10% to 11% over 2012. Based on the strength of our third quarter results, we now expect full year 2013 consolidated adjusted income from operations in the range of $1.9 billion to $1.96 billion. This range is higher than our previous expectations and reflects the strong underlying fundamentals in our businesses. We now expect full year earnings per share in the range of $6.70 to $6.90 per share, which is an improvement of $0.25 to $0.45 per share over our previous expectations.","I will now discuss the components of our 2013 outlook, starting with Global Health Care. We now expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of $1.575 billion to $1.625 billion, an increase of $55 million to $80 million. This increased outlook for Global Health Care primarily reflects the effects of favorable medical costs, as well as improved operating expense efficiencies.","I'll now summarize some of the key assumptions reflected in our Global Health Care earnings outlook for 2013, starting with our customer base. Regarding global medical customers, we continue to expect full year 2013 customer growth of approximately 1%. Relative to medical costs, for our total U.S. Commercial book of business, we now expect full year medical cost trend to be below 5%, which is at least 50 basis points below the midpoint of our prior guidance. We now expect the 2013 medical care ratio to be approximately 81% for our U.S. Commercial guaranteed cost book of business, which is 100 basis points lower than the midpoint of our previous expectations.","For our Seniors business, we now expect our Medicare Advantage MCR for 2013 to be approximately 84%, which is 150 basis points higher than the midpoint of our previous expectations, reflecting the revenue pressure and increased claims severity that I noted earlier.","Turning to operating expenses. We continue to expect our total Global Health Care operating expense ratio to improve by approximately 50 basis points over 2012's full year ratio.","Now moving to the other components of our outlook. For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we expect continued strong top line growth and now expect earnings in the range of $185 million to $195 million, which represents earnings growth of 25% to 32% relative to full year 2012. Regarding the Group Disability and Life business, we now expect full year 2013 earnings in the range of $290 million to $305 million, an increase of $5 million to $10 million over our previous expectations. And regarding our remaining operations, we now expect a loss in the range of $150 million to $165 million for 2013. So all in, for the full year 2013, we have increased our outlook for consolidated adjusted income from operations to a range of $1.9 billion to $1.96 billion or $6.70 to $6.90 per share.","The updated EPS range also reflects our year-to-date share repurchase activity. Specifically, during the period August 1 through October 30, we have repurchased 6.4 million shares of Cigna's common stock for $500 million, bringing our total year-to-date share repurchase to 13.6 million shares for $1 billion.","Now moving to our 2013 capital management position and outlook. Overall, we continue to have good financial flexibility. Our subsidiaries remain well capitalized and are generating significant free cash flow to the parent, with strong return on capital in each of our ongoing businesses.","I would remind you of our capital deployment strategy and priorities, which have not changed. These priorities are: providing the capital necessary to support the growth of our ongoing operations; pursuing M&A activity with a focus on acquiring capabilities in scale to further grow in our targeted areas of focus; and after considering these first 2 items, we'd return capital to shareholders, primarily through share repurchase.","We ended the quarter with parent company cash of approximately $500 million. After considering all sources and uses of parent company cash and setting aside $250 million in liquidity needs, we now expect to have approximately $500 million available for capital deployment at year end. Overall, our capital position and updated outlook are strong, and reflects the sustained performance of our operating segments.","Now I'd like to spend some time talking about progress on one of the goals we identified in the strategic framework we launched in 2009. As you recall, our Go Deep, Go Global, Go Individual strategy is supported by 3 strategic pillars: focusing our portfolio of businesses, improving our strategic and financial flexibility and pursuing new growth opportunities. One key aspect we identified for improving our financial flexibility related to our pension plan and its funding.","As part of our strategic framework, we implemented a multiyear plan to address the underfunded position in our pension plan. We first grow the pension plan, and beginning in 2011, started to make annual pretax contributions of approximately $250 million, which was well in excess of the statutory minimum requirements to address this underfunded balance. Our plan was to make these excess contributions over a 3- to 5-year period.","Based on contributions made to date, a continuation of the equity market strong performance and increases in interest rates during 2013, the funded status of the pension plan has continued to improve. Assuming these trends persist through year end 2013, we expect the funded status of the plan to improve significantly over last year and intend to reduce the amount of our annual pension plan contributions going forward, while still meeting the statutory contribution requirements. This will create additional free capital available for deployment in 2014 for the benefit of shareholders. We will outline the impact of this decision, as well as our 2014 capital management plan on our fourth quarter earnings call.","Now to recap the quarter. Our third quarter 2013 consolidated results reflect the strength of our global portfolio of business and a continued track record of focused execution of our strategy. The fundamentals in our business remain strong, as evidenced by third quarter results to reflect attractive financial performance in each of our operating segments, an increase in our full year 2013 outlook and continued effective deployment of capital. Based on the strength of these results, we are confident in our ability to achieve our full year 2013 earnings outlook, and as David indicated, we expect to carry this momentum into 2014. In addition, we believe our diversified portfolio of businesses with differentiated capabilities are well positioned to deliver long-term growth in revenue and earnings.","With that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First question, just interested if you could give us some more insights into some of the MLR pressure experienced by HealthSpring in the quarter. And maybe just tease out how much of that was revenue pressure related to sequestration, as compared to some of the claims pressure that you cited, and if there were any particular geographies or products that were impacted by the claims pressure in the quarter. And then, just finally, just -- as you think about sort of the 3Q performance, how do you feel about the bids that HealthSpring submitted for 2014?","Thomas A. McCarthy","Scott, this is Tom. So first, again, the comparative basis matters here. You do recall that we are anticipating an increase -- or have anticipated an increase in the Medicare Advantage MLR going into this year based on repositioning for the health reform effects. But the elevated result this quarter, as you pointed out, is from a combination of revenue and pressure, including the impact of sequestration and a revenue true-up reflected in the quarter, I'll get to that in a minute, and some increased claim severity. As it relates to the revenue true-up, some of that related to the full year accrual for revenue due to CMS, so adjustment in the quarter for the full year accrual, and that accounted for about 150 basis points of the elevated third quarter MLR. On the claims severity side, that really reflects a higher cost for claims, so it's not the number of claims or unit cost per se, but a higher cost per claim due to the more complexed conditions and treatments. And again, we are actively working to address those issues. Regarding your comment on the bid, we're confident that we have, through our engaged physician model, we have the levers and the toolkit to manage this dynamic in 2014.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Just then just -- I have a follow-up question just on the initial outlook for 2014, and the fact that you're expecting to be able to grow off of a meaningfully improved base year for 2013, and you've had a couple of competitors come out and talk more about the potential for flattish or modestly down earnings or maybe sort of 2014 being sort of flattish as a floor. So can you help us think about what you think are the key differentiating drivers of the better relative outlook? Is it better performance that you're expecting in the Health Care business, or do you think it reflects the fact that you've got a different business next year with the international and Group Insurance as well?","David M. Cordani","Scott, it's David. We state a little bit of an end [ph], so let me tease out your question relative to '14. First, as you know, we're quite pleased with the fact that we are on track to have a very strong 2013. The backdrop of the '13 results that will carry into '14 are really the strength of our diverse portfolio businesses and our consistent focused execution. As we look to '14, as I noted in the prepared remarks, our expectation is that we will grow revenue and earnings, and to be clear, we exclude any impact of reserve development or capital deployment in that. And you should think about that being driven by the strength of our ongoing organic growth, some additional contributions from the further strengthening of our PBM and then the additional operating efficiencies that we've been able to garner each year, that goes across all of our lines of business, including the international businesses. And then, there's some structural headwinds, but we'll be able to offset those structural headwinds because of the diverse portfolio of our businesses. The final note I would give you is, both given the strength of our 2013 as well as some of those industry structural headwinds, at this point, we indicate that we will expect to grow earnings, as well as, then, obviously, EPS, but probably, earnings at a lower rate than our 2013 growth rate more historical run rate. Nonetheless, positive results leveraging both the diverse portfolio of our businesses and consistent execution.","Operator","The next question comes from Justin Lake with JPMorgan Chase.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So first, just to follow up on 2014. As I think about some of the headwinds and tailwinds, can you talk a little bit about -- I mean, I calculated about $0.50 of headwind just from a lower tax rate, the prior period development that you probably won't put into guidance, et cetera, and then you get that PBM offsetting it, you mentioned some of the other drivers. So one, are those 2, $0.50 and kind of onetime items benefiting this year, $0.25 in the PBM for next year? And then are those -- and then can you talk specifically about 2014 on Medicare Advantage. Given you've taken up the MLR here, how much of a headwind should we expect that to be on MLR and EBIT versus 2013?","David M. Cordani","Justin, it's David. As we noted in our prepared remarks, we'll provide comprehensive and more complete guidance for '14 on our fourth quarter call. But let me give you a little bit more color in terms of how to think about it. First, you're correct. Consistent with our policy, we don't project any reserve development. And through our results, you could see where our favorable reserve development has been for this year, order magnitude, $70 million after-tax plus. So extract that from the consideration, you can make your own estimate on the taxes. Two other headwinds you point to is, one, you referenced Medicare, not going to go through the details of that. We'll go through the details of that in the fourth quarter, but it's an important headwind that, over the long term, we feel very confident on, but it's an important headwind. We'll be able to offset that in our portfolio. And then finally, an item I would just draw your attention to is, as I think you know, the implementation of ACA requires a sunsetting of the line of business, specifically limited benefits. Then we'll have a down tick in terms of our business, and from an earnings contribution standpoint next year, that's also fully contemplated in our expectations. So when you take all of those headwinds together, including our assumption that we're not projecting the favorable reserve development on a go-forward basis, taking all that into consideration, we'll still be able to grow organic earnings in 2014 off of a strong base, and that's something we're excited about.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's really helpful. So am I right in thinking that EBIT contribution from Medicare Advantage is expected to be down? And then, can you tell us what you think -- or can you give us an idea of how to size that limited benefit headwind?","David M. Cordani","Sure. Just directionally, because we don't talk about that, the second component that often. Justin, round numbers, if you think about $25 million, $30 million after-tax for the limited medical benefits business, so you can put that into context. And again, on the Seniors business, we'll talk more comprehensively. I think the headline I'd ask you to take away from that is, first, as Tom noted, we feel good about the bid position we have for 2014. We know we have the levers to be able to manage this business, and we're quite confident over the long term that the engaged physician model and the engaged individual beneficiary model is a sustainable model and something that we will both grow from a covered life standpoint in '14 and grow both lives in earnings thereafter. But '14 is a pressure year for that line of business from a margin standpoint.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. And then if I could just ask a follow-up on the private exchanges. I just wanted to get your comments here, David, in terms of the trajectory here. What you expect over the next 3 to 5 years, let's say, in the active employee market specifically. And then talk about your positioning and what you think the potential impact to your benefits business could be over time.","David M. Cordani","Sure. Well done in terms of sneaking in the third question. So relative to the private exchanges, as noted in the prepared remarks, first, we're in the very early stages of this. And important to note, as you know, based on your question, there are multiple different versions of private exchanges today. So single-carrier, multi-carrier, self-funded, risk-based exchanges [ph], retiree, active businesses, et cetera. Taking a step back, early stages, so long as those exchanges are able to create sustainable value for employers and individuals, we think there's a growth opportunity. We're playing in position to play in many event today. And -- but most importantly, we're confident that we have the capabilities, both the health engagement and network capabilities, as well as the diverse funding mechanisms and consumer engagement capabilities to play in any one of those alternatives, to the extent they demonstrate the ability to create sustainable value. So premature to give you a long-term projection, we think they'll be part of a future distribution model and we're positioned to play in a variety of those as they evolve over time.","Operator","The next question comes from Josh Raskin with Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a follow-up on third quarter Medicare Advantage MLR, I think about the 300 basis points. So your MLR was up 550 basis points year-over-year. In the second quarter, it was 250, right? So the sequestration has been and all that. I think you mentioned 150 bps from the claims severity. So I'm trying to figure out, just on a sequential basis, what exactly deteriorated so much in the third quarter, and maybe some color as to where or why these more severe claims are coming in?","Thomas A. McCarthy","Josh, it's Tom. So again, the impacts you noted are right. The dynamics, the level of impact and the claims severity impact, and the revenue impact, again, depending on the comparison you're making, sequestration as an impact, but obviously, not sequentially. The number that you picked up, though, the 150 basis point impact was related to the revenue -- an additional revenue adjustment within the quarter for the full year results. And the balance roughly would relate to the claims severity item.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got you. So 150 is some sort of risk premium -- some risk-adjusted true-up or something like that, and then another 150 is the severe claims?","Thomas A. McCarthy","Yes, ballpark-ish those are.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. So I guess just any clarity on those claims? I guess we just haven't seen that for many of the other companies talking about the sort of high severity cases. I'm just curious if you think there's any root cause to that, or if there's any geographic sensitivity to it, et cetera?","Thomas A. McCarthy","There are number of drivers, and I wouldn't want to call out any one in particular. But you can be assured that our team is focused on improving that results both into the fourth quarter and into next year.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then a follow-up just on the private exchanges. Could you talk specifically about your experience in 2013 with these exchanges? How you feel as though you're results are? And then, specifically to the Aon exchange which, in my understanding, has the majority of the active enrollees for '14, at least at this point, and your decision not to participate on that exchange.","David M. Cordani","Josh, it's David. As I noted before, early stages of implementation of the private exchanges to the first part of your broad question, therefore, our experience is somewhat limited. They're small pockets of experience and a variety of exchanges. As I indicated on the prior question, there are some single-carrier, multi-choice exchanges that we have experience on. There's multi-carrier alternatives that we have experience on. There's ASO experiences and, then there's some risk-based experiences that we see. Important to note, as I've indicated before, we have the capabilities to play under any of the configurations. We've chosen today to focus in the areas where our customers and our target customers seem to have the highest level of interest. And to date, that has been -- our customers have indicated that they have the highest interest in incentive and engagement-based programs that have pooled or bundled purchasing, a high level of transparency and that's where we focus. The value we're delivering is quite strong as indicated with our further improvement in our medical cost results. However, as we look forward, to the extent that changes and other models are delivering more attractive value, we have the capability to play there on a go-forward basis. So the options are open for us, and the capabilities are on hand to play on any one of those configurations should they prove to have a sustainable result for the benefit of employers and customers.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Was there something specific, Dave, I guess, around the Aon exchange that did not create that level of attraction or opportunity for you that you're not participating next year?","David M. Cordani","Sure, Josh. I don't think it's helpful to go into an individual exchange example. Maybe I'd ask you to just step back and think about everything we've done over the last 4 years has been driven by focus, focus, focus. Our Go Deep strategy has us focusing. So essentially, as we listen to the voice of our customers, our customers and the orientation of what our customers are seeking to purchase was oriented around other alternatives today. So we focused our resources to date on other scenarios, to the extent the needs and demand of our target customers evolve, we'll evolve by focusing our energy. But I'd ask you to think about it that way. We're not trying to be all things to all people. We're trying to focus on the needs of our customers and deliver a differentiated result in both '13 results and our projected '14 results show that we'll continue to grow and keeping that level of focus.","Operator","The next question comes from Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was hoping maybe you could address the outlook for January enrollment. And maybe, along with that, comment on the pricing environment you're seeing on the risk side and an update on your progress getting the industry fee and related tax impact reflected into commercial pricing.","David M. Cordani","Matthew, it's David. A little bit of color. So in terms of looking at January enrollment, as you'd expect at this point in time, we have a better view in terms of what we historically call national accounts and a less complete view in the regional in the select segment. So let me give you some color on national, and then take the opportunity to give you a little bit color on the overall relative to our growth, then I'll ask Tom to make a comment relative to the positioning of the tax from a pricing standpoint. Relative to national accounts, to remind you, we define that a little differently than everybody else. So those are commercial employers with 5,000 or more employees that are multistate. So we define it a bit more tightly. That segment of the population, the employment base is shrinking in a 1% to 2% range. That's our view of that target segment. Our strategic objective is to maintain share and continue to penetrate those engagement in incentive base buyers. And for 2014, we would expect to achieve that. Our pipeline of new business opportunities was down a little bit, as I indicated on the prior quarter call. Our pipeline of our opportunities that were out to date was also down somewhat. Taken altogether, our national account results will be year-over-year equal to slightly improved for 2014. If you look at our commercial book of business in total, at this point, we'd expect our commercial book in total to be about the same year-over-year. When you adjust for the known run-off of the limited benefit business that I made a reference to before, you can think about that as about 1% of covered life that went off in 2014. So Commercial, in total, about the same year-over-year, strong retention across our portfolio businesses, some reasonable good new business growth, and overall, that's going to contribute to a nice revenue results. As Tom mentioned, we have strengths in 2013 and we expect that strength in 2014. I'll ask Tom to make a comment on the industry fee.","Thomas A. McCarthy","So Matt, first to the overall question on pricing dynamic, really, no change from the market. Pricing dynamic seems to be traditionally or typically rational. There's occasional pockets of accelerated competitiveness, but no major turn to call out. And on the industry fee, in particular, as you know, we tend to have a disciplined pricing underwriting approach. And the industry fee is another cost factor that we have built into our process, and we've included it in the amount we need to recover just for the fee and our pricing, and so far, we seem to be encouraged by the results there.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And if I could just one follow-up here. On the commercial trends, are you seeing the continued bias to self-insuring in the middle market in particular? Has that accelerated because of the industry fee on the fully insured side or vice versa? Are you seeing any inroads from the private exchange fully insured model offsetting that to some degree?","David M. Cordani","Matthew, it's David. Two comments relative to buying trends. First, before I get to the funding mechanism, I would submit to you just a continued intensity of focus on proven wellness programs for venture programs, consumer engagement programs, a high level of interest in what the industry may call higher performance networks. We call them our collaboratives or engaged physician networks. As it relates to funding mechanism, we've seen just a continuation. I wouldn't attach it to any one item. We've seen a continuation of interest demand and attractiveness to more transparent funding mechanisms. So take that as the self-funding mechanism, so we've just seen a continuation of that. And for 2013 and as we look to 2014, we see no material impact of drain off from that demand from a guarantee cost standpoint.","Operator","The next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","There's been some movement in the ASO market and national accounts. I was maybe hoping you could talk about that segment specifically, just the competitive landscape and what's going on there. And then along those lines, can you maybe talk about the profitability of lives by segment? Again, we've seen some movement in national accounts, whether it be swapping carriers or moving risk pay or so with seemingly little, if any, financial impact. So is it fair to say a profit per life is much lower international versus a middle market or select account?","David M. Cordani","Ralph, it's David. So a couple of comments here. First, consistent with my prior comment, as we look to 2014, on an all-in basis, adjusted for the, again, known sunsetting of the limited benefit business, we expect our commercial customer performance to be about the same year-over-year. So that's an all-in basis. As it relates to national accounts, again, we define it a little bit more narrowly than some of the competitors. So those commercial employers of 5,000 and more employees that are multistate, our current outlook is for a slight uptick in performance or improvement in performance year-over-year, driven mostly by retention. So the sales results are about consistent, but it's mostly an improvement in retention. So you can look at our book of business. While there's always going to be put and take here or there, our book of business is about the same across the franchise with a little uptick in the national accounts. I give you a little directional color on your profitability question. The primary drivers of profitability are long-term relationships. We are delivering sustainable value for your client and customer, and we earn the right to expand their relationship from our point of view with multiple products and services. So the specialty portfolio, the health improvement, the prevention, the wellness are critical parts of our business strategy. Said otherwise, we seek to not sell a stand-alone ASO-funded relationship as an example. To that end, the penetration or cross-selling grade is the highest down market in the select segment the package solution works in the most intense way and the lightest of international account segment. So general rule of thumb, you can conclude that as you go from the largest sized accounting segment down to the medium and smaller size, all of these remaining equal, profitability dial is up somewhat, but that's largely driven by further penetration of the specialty business. Final comment for Cigna. As you look at our performance, our revenue, our profitability, our profit for life and our retention performance suggest that we're managing that quite well, and we're delivering good value back to our clients, as evidenced by the retention rate and the continued success we're having.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. All right, that's helpful. And just my follow-up, obviously, we've had a couple of years of lower cost trend. I know coming into this year, I think you priced your book for, I think, 6% to 7% trend. Can you give us a sense at all of what you expect and maybe priced going into next year?","David M. Cordani","Ralph, it's David. Again, we'll provide detailed guidance at the end of the fourth quarter, so we're not going to give you the specific numbers. You should assume, though, that our consistency of our approach. So we will, in our pricing, to our best estimate of medical cost trend and the medical cost trend outlook, we're taking a basic assumption of somewhat of an uptick in utilization as we had last year. To the extent that, that plays out, we will have priced that into our book of business. To the extent that doesn't play out, we'll be reporting back on the results in 2014. But on the fourth quarter call, we'll give you the specifics just anchor it in the fact that we're pricing at our underlying cost level that we're projecting for 2014, which includes somewhat of an uptick in cost pressure.","Operator","The next question comes from Christine Arnold with Cowen.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Could you speak to your -- I'm trying to -- I know you're not getting into specifics on Medicare Advantage, but could you speak to your bidding strategy and how that 75% in collaborative care arrangements represents a lever and some of the other levers that you're using to offset some of the pressure? And then the full year accrual in MA that we saw this quarter, was that, in fact, a risk-adjusted accrual?","David M. Cordani","Christine, it's David. I'll start with the bidding strategy. I'll ask Tom to come back to the in-quarter revenue adjustment. So at a macro level, and as we talked before, the bidding strategy for our Medicare book of business is being consistent, consistent with what HealthSpring's philosophy has been and Cigna-HealthSpring and similar philosophy, and that is, you want price to have a sustainable set of relationships with your clients and customers, you want to avoid large wild undulations in the rate shop or otherwise and you want to have long-term sustainable relationships. So taking that forward, we took a position to price our book of business for 2014 and our new business offerings on a MSA or market-by-market basis to our best estimate of what would create a good value proposition for beneficiaries, both existing and prospective, as well as a reasonable balance of margin knowing there's a lot of disruption. To the specifics to where I think you're going at, we do have the lever, and the lever is an engaged physician model with incentive and risk sharing and reimbursement sharing with the physicians. That's a very important lever because the physicians are engaged with us in our dialogue in terms of how we're configuring that value proposition for 2014 in this case. And those physicians want to work with us jointly, arms locked to make sure we get the best possible value proposition in place. So it's a very collaborative operation that happens market by market. And our expectations right now based on our look at our pricing, the product attributes market by market as the competitive data comes out broadly around the country, we're pleased with how we're positioned from a product and price standpoint. Of course, there's going to be puts and takes by market, but if you take the national position we have in our key markets, we're pleased with our positioning for 2014. And we would expect to grow our Medicare Advantage covered lives in spite of some margin pressure, given all the industry change that we confront in 2014. Tom, can I ask you to reclarify the revenue item?","Thomas A. McCarthy","Just hold on to that comment for a second, David. So first, Christine, you asked about the general lever. So there is a physician engagement model, I'd also point out for the other obvious one, benefits adjustments. And I'd also point out, we have a number of markets where we're still in the early stage of focusing in physician engagement model. And in fact, another lever for 2014 is more focused on those markets where that model is a little -- in the earlier stages of development. And as David said, overall, lots of positive things mitigate the impact. But we still are expecting margin pressure in Medicare Advantage in 2014. So to your second more specific point, yes, that adjustment is largely related to risk adjusters.","Operator","The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I was wondering if -- you talked about some of the headwinds into 2014. Can you talk about some of the tailwinds that you are looking for that gives you confidence in being able to deliver earnings growth on top of the higher guidance for this year? Obviously, the PBM would be one area. But anything else that you would highlight as giving you confidence for growth next year?","David M. Cordani","Kevin, it's David. I'll highlight 3 items. First, I would just highlight this organic growth. We expect to, again, grow revenue and grow revenue at an attractive level. So what's behind that? What's behind that is, in the core medical business, some customer growth; two, further expansion of our specialty business; three, continued growth of our Group Insurance disability asset; and lastly, continued attractive growth of our global business. So organic growth will be one; two would be the point you raised, the further strengthening of our PBM will create a tailwind for us; and third, I would highlight, we now have a track record of continued prudent operating efficiency leverage in the franchise, so that would be a contribution as we go into 2014, all while we continue to invest back in the franchise for the long-term. So those will be the 3 primary tailwinds I would highlight for you.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow-up question, I guess, back on to the private exchanges. I think Edwin, on the conference call, talked about the movement of ASO back to risk is being something that would increase profitability of membership 4x to 5x. And I understand where their math is coming from. Do you see that same opportunity? I wasn't sure if your focus on stop-loss as a supplement to the ASO business might change the dynamic, and how you thought about shift from ASO back to risk?","David M. Cordani","Sure, Kevin. It's David. So giving you just a grounding point and then how we think about it. The grounding point is to be clear, we have the ability to offer ASO\/stop-loss shared return and risk alternatives in the market we do every day. For example, in the Select Segment, a segment that's growing very nicely for us and has proven the ability to grow on a consistent basis, we frequently report in front of a client and a prospective client an ASO\/stop-loss alternative side-by-side with the risk alternatives. And then a consultative fashion gets to the right outcome for that client at that point in time. So as Tom would like to say, sometimes we're a bit agnostic. You want to get to the right solution for the employer, and you want to have the capability to be able to deliver good value for the client, as well as a fair return from a shareholder standpoint. With that said, I would submit to you that, not speaking about the competitive landscape but speaking about it from the Cigna's landscape, our success in terms of having a vibrant portfolio of specialty businesses and the ability to package solutions and deliver an overall proposition has presented an environment where our ASO profitability is quite attractive. So I wouldn't look at a similar leverage point as you move between a simple ASO -- stripped-down ASO business versus risk piece of business. And then finally, I feel compelled to state the obvious, the capital efficiency needs to be taken into consideration under any of those scenarios. Clearly, we take that into consideration because we underwrite risk business everyday in our company, but I think it's a little bit of a pause to say, you're just going to line up a profitability pro life. So one, we have the ability to do this today; two, we do it shoulder-to-shoulder everyday; and three, our success in terms of packaging solution, whether it's an ASO proposition or risk proposition, gives us confidence that we'll be able to thrive under either of those scenarios going forward.","Operator","The next question comes from Chris Rigg with Susquehanna.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just wanted to come back to Medicare Advantage quickly here. Just to clarify, is the claims pressure across the board, or is it isolated to a handful of plans or a region? Or any color as to what you're seeing there would be helpful.","Thomas A. McCarthy","Chris, it's Tom. I wouldn't call it across the board, but I wouldn't call it isolated either. It's in a number of markets. Some models are more intense than others. And again, we're working aggressively to address the problem right now.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then is it in one sort of bucket of utilization inpatient, outpatient pharmacy or is it, again, just across the board?","Thomas A. McCarthy","Yes. It's generally in the facility costs.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay, okay. And then just real quickly here. On the Disability and Life business, it looks like you'd stabilized from relatively low level of profits in the first quarter rebounded in second and third quarter, now it looks like you're expecting that to drop back off in the fourth quarter. Is that -- is there something to highlight there?","Thomas A. McCarthy","No. Again, I'd take you back to that. It's Tom again. I'd take you back to headlines first, and you have kind of picked up on the overall headlines. The group results -- the group businesses has been performing really well in a challenging environment. The reporting dynamics on that business are a little different from what you're used to in our core for health care business. There is more variability in results due to the nature of the business. So really, what we're talking about is some normalization across the year to a good result.","Operator","The next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you quantify the impact of the health insurance fee and the premium tax fee, the per-member fee in terms of the midyear enrollments? So what's going to be the headwind for next year or what's the earnings impact of that this year, I guess, is the question.","Thomas A. McCarthy","Peter, it's Tom. That's an estimate, of course. But right now, we would estimate that as kind of a 10% -- $0.10 EPS headwind going into '14.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then it seems like on a, firstly, weekly basis, we're getting more and more things that look like they're causing the risk pool on the exchanges to get worse, whether it be the delaying the employer mandate, or the website not working, or the change in terms of how the ability for hospitals, perhaps, the pay premiums or enrollees, maybe going forward, the cost-sharing subsidies not being -- or being coming susceptible to the sequester cuts, or even a delay in terms of the individual mandate if that happens or an extension of the time frame to sign people up. What's your -- when does this become too much in terms of making the risk pool too sick to the point where you guys decide to step away from the exchanges altogether?","David M. Cordani","Peter, it's David. You're painting an interesting picture. But to step back, putting it back into a Cigna context, as you know, Cigna has historically not had a meaningful small employer, under 50 lives licensed [ph] employer or individual guarantee cost book of business. Therefore, we were not forced to take action to protect the portfolio of businesses. As you know from our prior conversations, we sought to test the market over about a 3-year period of time with some new benefit offerings distribution strategies, and then we stepped in on a very focused basis in 5 states, working with physician collaboratives to offer solutions that we think offer a very good value and can be sustainable. So point one is, we're very focused for 2014 in the limited number of markets, with our physician partnerships in hand in those markets. Our expectation is that, we're in a very early innings, and when you're in a very early innings of anything, it is going to be rocky. We're going to maintain a very sharp focus. And as we've consistently said, we've cautioned to not to look at this opportunity, for at least our company, as a watershed moment for revenue or earnings contribution whether that's for '14 or '15. It may present a long-term opportunity, and we want to be in position relative to that. But we're running our business that the core of the franchise needs to be able to deliver, and it will, for 2014, both revenue and earnings growth despite the challenges you just articulated for that early emerging marketplace.","Operator","The next question comes from Carl McDonald with Citigroup.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So I wanted to see if you could come back to the underlying earnings base for '13. So I can back out all the positive things that you've disclosed from $0.50 to $0.55. But it also seems like every quarter, there's a handful of negative things that you don't disclose. You talked about the unfavorable life experience this quarter, the strengthening of litigation reserves. So just interested if you have a view relative to your $6.80, $6.90 guidance, what we should think about as being the underlying earnings number for '13?","Thomas A. McCarthy","It's Tom. I'm not sure it's going to be really helpful to get into the nits and nats of that. As you point out, some of the items end up in the -- being more fully discussed, and some of the items end up being just kind of in the run rate. The results in the quarter are pretty clear. This is a strong quarter. And the last few quarters have been strong quarters. Fundamental results, we've had consistent better-than-expected operating expenses, consistent better-than-expected medical costs in commercial. Our disability results over the course of the year, despite some of the ups and downs of the reserve studies, have been good for the year, and we've continued to show really strong results in supplemental benefits and revenue earnings. This quarter did have a couple of unfavorable impacts in it. But overall, good fundamental results are driving the quarter's results.","David M. Cordani","Carl, it's David. Just to add to Tom's point. When you take that together, you take our all-in reported number for 2013 and our revised upward outlook for that, we're committing to be able to grow our earnings base and grow our revenue base going into 2014. Tom and I highlighted a few of the items that you could view as -- I'm thinking about differently in a prior comment, Tom just commented on the industry fee headwind that's created. We have the run-off of a line of business that I commented, maybe up to $25 million, $30 million. We've got favorable medical costs and the reserve development, those are all chunks that you can model out. But I think the headline here you can step back and look at is, '12 was a very strong year. We grew off the base of that in '13, we've continued to grow '13 throughout the course of the year. And our expectation is despite all the moving parts, albeit the rate of growth from a percentage basis will be a bit smaller than our historical run rate, we're going to be able to grow earnings in 2014 as well, and we're very excited about that.","Operator","The next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies.","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I wanted to start on capital, if I could. I'm guessing that your priorities for capital deployment are probably very similar to what they have been in the past. If not, I'll let you elaborate. But I am curious, your comment about reducing contributions to the pension. Would you expect to have more capital for deployment? And if so, would you be more interested in deploying that for acquisitions? Has your appetite been renewed there? Or should we expect, perhaps, more share repurchase with that capital phase?","Thomas A. McCarthy","Dave, it's Tom. You started with the conclusion. You're right, our capital deployment priorities haven't changed. Our first priority is to fund the organic growth; second is, to seek M&A opportunities that fit with our strategy; and then we'll return capital to shareholders primarily through share repurchase. And again, I wouldn't -- we wouldn't change those priorities, and I wouldn't try and foreshadow activity in one area or the other. Again, we'll be very closely focused on what aligns with our strategy. To your more specific comment on pension plan, yes, I think you've drawn a right conclusion there. Over the last few years, targeted $250 million pretax to fund the pension plan, and that consciously funded above the minimum requirements. In 2014, it's likely and we do have to wait until we get to year end and see how market conditions are then in the final reporting on the plan. But it's likely we would transition to a minimum funding approach, which in 2014, would likely mean about $100 million pretax contribution to the plan instead of $250 million.","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, very good. And then apart from a lot of the health care comments here, I wondered if there were any particular, I call them, hotspots, in some of your other businesses, international, ex patriot, et cetera, that are worthy of note in regard to maintaining or accelerating growth in some of those other segments?","David M. Cordani","David, it's David. You used the term hotspots, so I'm taking the connotation of caution. The only thing I would draw your attention to is that, as noted in our prepared remarks, we continue to invest in even on an accelerated basis in the third quarter, our Global Supplemental Benefits business. But broadly, for the portfolio, we feel quite good. The track record of revenue growth, earnings growth and customer base expansion in the other lines of businesses is quite strong. We expect to continue that, and we're taking the steps to further accelerate investments that we think are prudent in all of our businesses.","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Very good. I actually did mean good things.","Operator","The final question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","First, a specific question on the PBM. You referred to that as one of the positives for next year. I know when you originally announced the deal, you guys said that transition costs would come first, and it'd be about a $0.10 to $0.15 drag in the third quarter before it swings positive or neutral in the fourth. I want to just confirm that, that is what you're seeing, and is the transition going about as you gauged it in the summer when you announced the deal?","Thomas A. McCarthy","A.J., it's Tom. So that specific point on the quarterly dynamics, the pace of spending was actually a little less than we expected in the third quarter, but we're still on track in the overall plan and we still expect little net impact overall in 2013. So really, comfortable with where we're headed on that project right now.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just broadly, signing new -- 9 new collaborative care relationships. I wondered with the dynamic of right on top of the rollout of exchanges, et cetera, what is the dynamic of your discussions with providers around these collaborative care relationships? Has it changed any in the last 6 to 12 months? Is it -- you see more or less opportunities? Or are you -- are you seeing, I guess, competition for other people trying to put these together, as well as you? Has that changed in any way?","David M. Cordani","A.J., it's David. First, just by way of a backdrop comment here. Remind you that we started and we set up our first collaborative back in 2008. We stood up 8 of them [indiscernible] a variety of different models. So we've been at this for a while. That's the first point. Second, with the 75% [ph] up in operational on the commercial side plus having 75% of our Medicare Advantage customers and physician engagement model, we're well in excess of 1 million lives that are experiencing these services today on a dedicated or comprehensive basis. As it relates to the market dynamic, you should think about it as a market dynamics of increased demand not stable or decreased demand from physician and delivery system partners. And if I were to describe any change in that, the intensity and [ph] uptick in terms of what I'll call the facility-integrated systems on top of what has been the physician organization. So more demand increasing in the physician space, as well as now increasing in the integrated facility base. Your reference is to more competition. This is an area that everyone is talking about. There's a lot of activity. I would submit that our team is extremely well positioned as we've been at this a while. From a Medicare standpoint, the HealthSpring team has been active for well over a decade, with very proven track record. And from a commercial standpoint, we've now put 5 years of experience here. So a good outlook for the future to continue to grow this. And what's most important is, at the end of the day, are you able to deliver differentiated result for your client and customer? And the exciting part here is that, from a commercial standpoint, we could point to improved results, better medication compliance, better clinical engagement on a lower medical cost that are passing through, that's a positive from sustainability standpoint.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. David Cordani for closing remarks.","David M. Cordani","Thank you. In closing, I'd like to underscore just a few points from our discussion this morning. Cigna's third quarter results reflect strong revenue in earnings contributions from each of our ongoing business segments, continue our track record of strong financial results and our momentum from the first half of the year. We are confident in achieving our increased full year earnings outlook for 2013. Looking ahead, we expect to grow revenue and earnings in 2014 over our increased 2013 outlook, and this excludes any future reserve development or capital deployment. We continue to deliver our Go Deep, Go Global and Go Individual strategy to leverage our capabilities around customer insights, consultative selling and physician engagement to guide us through an evolving and disruptive environment.","We thank you for your participation today and for your continued interest in Cigna, and we look forward to our future conversations.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the question-and-answer session, is being recorded.","We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Will McDowell. Please go ahead, Mr. McDowell.","William McDowell","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I'm Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom McCarthy, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Tom will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's third quarter 2014 financial results, as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2014. David will also provide insights on our expectations for 2015, as well as our over -- our long-term growth outlook. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. Specifically, we use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and earnings per share on the same basis as the principal measures of performance for Cigna and our business segments. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com.","In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2014 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.","Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. First, please note that when we discuss the number of covered lives for our global medical customers, we will be doing so on a basis that excludes those individuals that were previously covered under Limited Benefits plans. As a reminder, we exited the Limited Benefits business as of December 31, 2013, as required by the Affordable Care Act regulation. Second, when we discuss our earnings outlook for 2014, it will be on the basis of adjusted income from operations. And finally, I would also note that when we make any prospective comments on earnings or EPS outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future capital deployment or prior year development of medical costs.","And with that, I will turn the call over to David.","David M. Cordani","Thanks, Will. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. Before we get started, I'd like to take a moment to thank Ted Detrick for his many years of leadership with Cigna. Ted has done an excellent job of communicating our business strategy and performance to the investment community, and we all wish him the best in his upcoming retirement. As you just heard, Will McDowell has already assumed the role of Head of Investor Relations. With his colleagues, Will and his team look forward to continuing the discussion with you as we look to our future.","Now to begin, I'll review the highlights of our third quarter financial results. Next, we'll take a closer look at our transparent funding capabilities, in particular, within the Select Segment. This segment is one of our fastest-growing businesses where our expertise in tailoring unique offerings through a consultative approach continues to drive value for our customers and clients, as well as sustaining growth for Cigna. I'll then discuss our attractive long-term growth prospects across many of our established and growing markets, and address our strategic positioning in emerging markets. I'll also provide some high-level comments regarding our expectations for 2015. Then Tom will offer insights on our performance and our outlook as we enter the final quarter of the before we take your questions. And following the Q&A, I'll provide some closing remarks.","We'll get started with some highlights. Cigna's strong performance in 2014 continued in the third quarter with solid revenue and earnings contribution across our businesses, highlighted by continued delivery of favorable medical costs and operating expense discipline in our Global Health Care business, and strong results in our Global Supplemental Benefits business, which continue to be driven by our differentiated distribution capabilities.","Our third quarter 2014 consolidated revenue increased 9% to $8.8 billion. We reported adjusted income from operations for the third quarter of $519 million or $1.95 per share. In total, our third quarter results reflect strong, consistent performance, driven by continued effective execution of our strategy.","Now I'll discuss the rapidly changing market for health care. Employers and individuals are increasingly recognized that health insurance's traditional role of financing sickness is no longer sufficient. And as such, are adapting programs that focus on health improvement, health risk reduction and value-based care delivery. By aligning the incentives of clients, customers and physicians, Cigna is delivering differentiated results. We've spoken about physician engagement before, and today, we're going to focus on client engagement via our Select Segment. I'll highlight how our efforts around engagement are delivering superior outcomes for clients and customers, as well as strong differentiated growth for Cigna.","Across the U.S. today, more than 60% of covered workers are in plans that are completely or partially self-funded, while the vast majority of large firms participate in these plans, currently, there is much lower adoption rate for smaller firms. This represents a significant opportunity for Cigna, given the proven differentiated value we are delivering, fueled by our broad capabilities in this space.","Our approach integrates a broad array of innovative specialty health services, along with our base medical offerings that ultimately lead to better health outcomes and differentiated results. The opportunity to provide value is clear as our customers and clients confront an array of challenges related to affordability, predictability and health status.","One of our fastest-growing self-funded target markets is Cigna's Select Segment, a historically underserved market segment, where we customize solutions for employers with between 51 and 250 employees. The employees in the Select Segment constitute approximately 25 million lives of the 160 million employer life market. To effectively serve this segment, we apply our unique health and risk management capabilities to deliver customized solutions that ultimately drive savings for employers and their employees, while effectively managing overall health and medical outcomes, as well as employee productivity. And as for results, we have consistently delivered an industry-leading medical cost trend. For example, below 5% over the past few years.","Cigna's actionable, company-specific clinical reports and wellness program data help Select Segment clients understand how their employees are using medical benefits, whether it be emergency room visits or out-of-network care. Cigna delivers recommendations and aligns incentives to improve affordability and value, including the identification of and paths to address emerging health risks. Risks that, if remain unaddressed, will result in significant health issues in the future. We help clients focus on prevention and health improvement by tailoring services such as health coaching and awareness, as well as support programs, including on-site biometrics and care management solutions, which is unprecedented in the small employer space, and which helps individuals maintain and improve their health, while also assisting with the recovery when they confront illness. The results here are clear, increasing demand for expertise in designing flexible, transparent plan offerings for these employers has driven mid-teens organic customer growth on an average annual basis over the last 5 years in this segment. Today's low market penetration of self-funded solutions in the Select Segment, which represents about 25%, coupled with the market proof points and value delivery of our innovative approach, presents a significant and exciting opportunity as we look to the future. This business is a great example of the type of growth that we expect to see over the long term in our commercial health care business.","Now move to a broader view of the drivers of our long-term growth in a global business environment characterized by demand for affordable and high-quality care, shifting customer dynamics and changing market forces. As we execute our strategy, we continue to have a keen focus on where and how we add value for clients and customers, which in turn has resulted in strong revenue growth and attractive returns for our shareholders.","As we look to the future, we plan to double Cigna's revenue base over the next 7 to 8 years, as we drive an 8% to 10% average annual revenue growth on an organic basis. We expect to attain this competitively attractive results through a strong execution of our multiple well-positioned avenues for growth.","In our targeted commercial markets, in both the U.S. and overseas, our continued focus on health, wellness and value-based care delivery is driving improved health outcomes and translating it into strong retention and meaningful new customer growth. Taking into account the rapidly changing market environment, we expect high single-digit compounded annual revenue growth in our commercial employer business over the long term, reflecting both the dynamics of our focus market segments and the characteristics of clients that are attracted to our value proposition. In our U.S. individual business, we expect double-digit compounded annual revenue growth over the long term with the potential for even higher additional growth as the public exchange market evolves.","In our Seniors markets, given the favorable demographics and Medicare advantage participation trends, combined with our very effective physician engagement model, we expect to grow revenue in the high-single digit range over the long term.","In Group Disability and Life, our innovative productivity improvement programs are helping employees return to work at a faster pace, driving value for customers, as well as clients. Based on our focused, differentiated programs and results, we expect this segment to generate mid- to high-single digit growth rate over the long term.","In the International markets, our deep experience and broad geographic reach over 30 countries and jurisdictions provide a strong foundation for us to serve the growing middle class and some of the world's most attractive markets. As we profiled on prior earnings calls, we expect the Global Supplemental Benefits business to deliver a mid-teens revenue growth on average over the long term. And we've build a foundation for sustained strong growth loan for the future through ongoing strategic investments in high-growth markets such as China, India and Turkey. When you couple this attractive organic growth outlook of 8% to 10% on an annual average basis with our industry-leading margins and strong cash flows, we expect to deliver differentiated earnings, significant free cash flow, and as a result, differentiated EPS.","Now turning to 2015. We expect to deliver another year revenue, earnings and EPS growth. I'll provide a little color on how we will achieve this. Now to be sure, there are some headwinds for 2015, including a further increase in the industry tax. Our expectations of a rise in specialty pharmacy cost trend and, for planning purposes, the absence of favorable prior year reserve development. There could also be variability in the rate and pace of both medical cost utilization, as well as our spending for strategic investments. We will offset these headwinds and drive growth with a number of tailwinds. These include: continued growth in our medical customers; growth in Medicare Advantage customers; continued strong performance of our specialty products, including Pharmacy, Stop Loss and Dental; continued growth in our Global Supplemental Benefits business; further financial improvement in our individual public exchange business; and further operating expense efficiency.","All in, we expect to leverage our multiple growth businesses to deliver revenue, earnings and EPS growth again in 2015. In addition, we expect our well-performing portfolio will again drive strong free cash flow levels to generate additional shareholder value creation opportunities.","To summarize my remarks before Tom provides more detail on our results, Cigna's strong third quarter financial performance continues a track record of superior results and attractive revenue and earnings growth. We remain focused and continue to execute well in our target markets. We continue to create value for our clients and customers through unique industry-leading wellness and prevention offerings, as well as our innovative global marketing and distribution capabilities. We are strategically positioning Cigna to succeed in emerging market opportunities as they continue to evolve in a highly dynamic macroeconomic environment. And we are excited by our ability to double Cigna's revenue over the next 7 to 8 years and further expand the broad customer base that we have the privilege to serve around the world.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas A. McCarthy","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will review Cigna's third quarter 2014 results and discuss our outlook for the full year. This quarter's results are strong, driven by continued effective execution of our strategy. Key highlights in the quarter include consolidated revenues of $8.8 billion, which grew 9% by continued growth in our targeted markets, consolidated earnings of $519 million, quarterly earnings per share of $1.95 and continued strong free cash flow with $1.4 billion of share repurchase on a year-to-date basis. The strength of these results provides us with good momentum and confidence to increase our full year financial outlook for 2014.","Regarding the segments, I will first comment on our Global Health Care segment. Global Health Care delivered another good quarter with continued strong results in our employer group business, improving results in our individual business, and solid results from our Seniors business. Third quarter premiums and fees for Global Health Care grew 7% to $6.1 billion. This reflects continued good growth in our self-funded programs as demand for these products remained strong.","We ended third quarter 2014 with 14.3 million global medical customers, growing by approximately 270,000 customers on a year-to-date basis. Third quarter earnings were $434 million and reflect business growth, operating expense efficiency, favorable medical cost and specialty contributions.","Turning now to medical costs. Our commercial medical trend continues to be among the lowest in the industry. And given that over 85% of our U.S. Commercial customers are in transparent ASO funding arrangements, our clients directly benefit from these favorable medical costs.","We continue to deliver medical costs that reflect better health outcomes and strong clinical excellence for our customers and clients as a result of our deep collaborative relationships with physicians and our focus on personalization of care. Medical costs also reflect a continued low utilization trend. Regarding medical care ratios, our employer risk businesses continued to deliver strong results, reflecting strong pricing, disciplined underwriting and continued effective medical management and physician engagement.","In our U.S. Commercial guaranteed cost business, our third quarter 2014 medical care ratio, or MCR, was 80.8% on a reported basis, or 81.1%, excluding prior year reserve development. This MCR reflects continued strong results in our employer group business, as well as improving results in our individual business. In our government business, our third quarter MCR for Medicare Advantage was 84.3% on a reported basis, or 84.6%, excluding prior year reserve development. Medicare Advantage results continue to reflect progress on the network and medical management actions we discussed in previous quarters, along with continued revenue pressure from the low reimbursement rate environment.","Moving to operating expenses. For third quarter 2014, the total Global Health Care operating expense ratio was 21.9%. This includes the impact of all health reformulated taxes, which added 110 basis points to the expense ratio in the quarter. To recap, we had another strong quarter in our Global Health Care business.","Now I will discuss the results of our Global Supplemental Benefits business. This business continues to deliver very attractive growth and profitability. Premiums and fees grew 17% quarter-over-quarter for Global Supplemental. Third quarter earnings grew to $83 million, reflecting business growth and effective operating expense management. These results also reflect nonrecurring favorable tax items totaling $21 million after-tax.","For Group Disability and Life, third quarter results reflect premium and fee increases of 7% over third quarter 2013. Third quarter earnings in our group business were $55 million, reflecting unfavorable claims experience in the Disability business. For our corporate and other operations, results totaled to an after-tax loss of $53 million for the third quarter of 2014, and this result includes an unfavorable tax item of $12 million reported in the Corporate segment. I would note that third quarter earnings in aggregate benefited from onetime tax items netting to $9 million after-tax with the previously mentioned favorability in our Global Supplemental Benefits business, partially offset by an unfavorable impact in corporate and other operations.","Overall, as a result of the continued effective execution of our strategy, our third quarter results reflect strong revenue and earnings contributions from each of our business segments, as well as significant free cash flow.","Turning to our investment portfolio. In the third quarter, we recognized net realized investment gains of $15 million after-tax, coupled with a strong net investment income result. The high quality and diversification of our investment portfolio continues to drive our overall investment results.","Now I will discuss our outlook for 2014. We expect to continue to deliver differentiated value for our customers and clients and strong financial performance for our shareholders in 2014. We now expect consolidated revenues to grow at the high end of our range of 5% to 8% over 2013. Based on the strength of our third quarter results, our outlook for full year 2014 consolidated adjusted income from operations is now in the range of approximately $1.95 billion to $2 billion, or $7.25 to $7.45 per share. This represents EPS growth of 7% to 10% over 2013, a strong result in a challenging year.","Consistent with past practice, our outlook excludes any contribution from additional capital deployment and any prior year reserve development. As I noted in our second quarter earnings call, full year 2014 adjusted income from operations includes approximately $110 million after-tax or 40% per share of acquisition-related amortization expense. We are highlighting this information as it is our intent to exclude acquisition-related amortization expense from earnings and EPS estimates when we provide more specific 2015 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call. I will now discuss the components of our 2014 outlook, starting with Global Health Care. We expect full year Global Health Care earnings to be in the range of approximately $1.61 billion to $1.64 billion. Regarding global medical customers, we now expect 2014 customer growth to be at the high end of our outlook range of 1% to 2%.","Turning to medical costs. We expect full year 2014 medical cost trend for a total U.S. Commercial book of business to be at the lower end of our 4.5% to 5.5% range. A range that we lowered in the second quarter. This improvement reflects continued individual engagement, effective medical cost management, physician engagement and low utilization trends.","Regarding medical care ratios. For our U.S. Commercial guaranteed cost book of business, we now expect the 2014 MCR to be towards the middle of our current range of 81% to 82.5%, a modest improvement over our previous expectations. This reflects continued strong results in our employer group business and improved individual results. This outlook also anticipates a higher fourth quarter MCR due to an increased seasonality impact from the growing share of high-deductible plans in our employer group and individual businesses.","For our Seniors business, the outlook for our Medicare Advantage MCR for 2014 is unchanged, and continues to be in the range of 84% to 85%. Regarding operating expenses for 2014, we now expect our total Global Health Care operating expense ratio to be at the low end of our current range of 22.5% to 23.5%. This outlook reflects increased spending for open enrollment costs and strategic initiatives in the fourth quarter, which will impact both the Global Health Care operating expense ratio, as well as adjusted income from operations.","Now moving to the other components of our outlook. For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we continue to expect strong top line growth and earnings now in the range of $230 million to $240 million, an increase over our previous outlook. Regarding Group Disability and Life, we now expect full year 2014 earnings in the range of $310 million to $320 million, slightly below our previous outlook. Regarding our remaining operations, that is corporate and other operations, we now expect a loss of $195 million for 2014.","So all in, for full year 2014, our outlook for consolidated adjusted income from operations is in the range of approximately $1.95 billion to $2 billion, or $7.25 to $7.45 per share. Now moving to our 2014 capital management position and outlook. Overall, we continue to have excellent financial visibility. Our subsidiaries remain well capitalized and are generating significant free cash flow to the parent with a strong return on capital in each of our business segments. Our capital deployment strategy and priorities have not changed. These priorities are: providing the capital to support the growth of our ongoing operations; pursuing M&A activity with a focus on acquiring capabilities and scale to further grow in our targeted areas of focus; and after considering these first 2 items, we will return capital to shareholders, primarily through share repurchase. Regarding free cash flow, we ended the quarter with parent company cash of approximately $425 million. During the period July 31 through October 29, we repurchased 2.8 million shares of Cigna's common stock for $250 million, bringing our total year-to-date share repurchase to 16.3 million shares for $1.4 billion. After considering all sources and uses of parent company cash, we now expect to have $500 million available for capital deployment during the balance of the year.","Overall, our financial position and capital outlook remain strong. The high returns on capital from our businesses, coupled with our strong balance sheet, means we will continue to generate significant free cash flow to deploy for the benefit of shareholders.","Now to recap. Our third quarter 2014 results reflect the strength of our diversified portfolio of global businesses, and a continued track record of effective execution of our focused strategy. The fundamentals in our businesses remain strong, as evidenced by strong growth in revenue and earnings, industry-leading medical cost and quality outcomes and continued strong free cash flow. Based on the strength of these results, we are confident in our ability to achieve our increased full year 2014 earnings outlook.","And with that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess, first on just the Exchange business. You talked about sort of improvement there. Can you just give us a sense of how you sort of saw that sequential improvement? And maybe where you stand on the 3Rs and whether that sort of helped cushion the third quarter relative to the second? And then maybe where margins are running on the exchange at this point?","David M. Cordani","Ralph, it's David. There's about 7 questions in there. I'll try to take a few of those and ask Tom to give you a little bit of color. First, back to the Public Exchange business. For context, as you recall, about 3% of our total enterprise revenue is in the individual portfolio business. Secondly, as we indicated entering the year, we didn't expect that this portfolio would make money and that transpired, and we began to see additional pressure relative to that portfolio of business. But we committed to manage that within the overall portfolio of Cigna. In the third quarter, we saw some improvement to the performance relative to the first 2 quarters, driven by fundamental improvement in results in the third quarter, as well as some favorable evolution in terms of what the first and second quarter results were. Lastly, before I turn it over to Tom, you'll recall from the prior quarter's call, we indicated relative to the 3Rs that the majority of the position we had taken to date on the 3Rs were reinsurance-related. But as we got further into the year, we'd give additional insights, marketplace insights in terms of the other 2Rs and we have a little bit more of those insights for the third quarter. Tom, could you give a little bit more color on the 3Rs?","Thomas A. McCarthy","Sure. Just a little more on the results in the quarter also, right? I mean, we did see some pretty strong improvement in results on the claims in the first 2 quarters. So they developed favorably from our initial estimates. Second, as David said, that dynamic carried over into third quarter. And then finally, we did get some more insight into some of the factors for estimating recoveries under the 3Rs. So as you recall from our previous comments, our visibility into some elements of the risk protection programs was limited before. And during the third quarter, we received some additional insight into relative performance that allow us to update our accruals. So through the third quarter, our accruals for the 3Rs are now total to about $130 million after tax. The majority of that accrual continues to be related to the reinsurance element of the 3R program. There are some for risk adjusters and a smaller amount for risk corridor recoveries.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And one sort of follow-up. There's been a lot in the market around sort of shift to private exchanges, and potential for sort of dumping onto the exchange, particularly among small employers. David, I mean it sounds like you're suggesting pretty healthy growth in your Select Segment, which would somewhat go opposite that unless you're thinking you're going to be sort of a bigger player around some of those new marketplaces. So could you just reconcile sort of your statements relative to maybe what the thought process is in the market now about sort of greater shift away from ASO into risk?","David M. Cordani","Two different dimensions. So I'll call it the Select Segment and then a little bit of more color on how we see the exchange marketplace more broadly. First, relative to the Select Segment. I think it's a great example and an important example of stepping back and not trying to lump all employers into any one bucket. So even within the Select Segment, which we define as 51 to 250 employees, so obviously excluding under 50, there are multiple micro-segments within there. And we tend to target on those employers who, as we say, value incentive- and engagement-based programs, who want to more actively work with their employee base to lower health risks, to improve health outcomes, to drive increase in productivity and see that as a fundamental part of running their business. That's not every employer of the 25 million lives that exist here, but it is a large cadre and we've had great success, as I noted in my prepared remarks, growing that on an average compounded basis of mid-teens in terms of covered lives. And we will continue to do so by leveraging our broad portfolio of businesses. As it relates to the private exchanges more broadly, as we've discussed, we see that as an early innovation marketplace, so early stages of development. We have capabilities, and we are participating in the vast majority of those markets, including our own proprietary exchange, which interestingly targets the Select Segment employer marketplace, as well as the regional segment marketplace. So over the long term, we see some good opportunities for growth here for both medical business, supplemental business, be it for active or retiree lives, as well as specialty business. So core growth in the Select Segment employer base, based on those focused on health risk reduction, health improvement productivity, leveraging our capabilities, well-positioned in the emerging, but just that emerging private exchange marketplace for both medical, supplemental and specialty business, and we see growth opportunities in both areas as we look to the future.","Operator","The next question comes from Justin Lake with JPMorgan.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","David, a number of your peers have taken the time in the third quarter call to comment on their comfort level with 2015 consensus EPS, which for Cigna implies about 10% growth year-over-year. I was hoping you might be able to give us some color here around how this view looks versus your internal expectations, excluding your move to cash EPS.","David M. Cordani","We're not providing 2015 guidance at this point. I'll try to give you a little bit more color of how we look at the marketplace. First, jumping out of 2014, as Tom updated our outlook for 2014, that range brackets a 7% to 10% EPS growth rate, and it's something we're quite pleased about being able to deliver in this competitive marketplace. As I noted in my prepared remarks, we are committed to growing revenue earnings and EPS in 2015. There are multiple drivers of growth for us in terms of customer growth in both commercial and Medicare Advantage, continuation of our positive momentum in our broad specialty portfolio of businesses, continuation of momentum in our Global business, and continuation of operating efficiencies. In the face of that, there were some headwinds, which we discussed, industry tax, specialty pharma. As you know, we don't talk about or don't plan for reserve development. So all in, we're excited about being able to, once again, grow the corporation's top line and bottom line. We'll continue to invest, and we look forward to providing a detailed guidance next quarter.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just on the exchanges. To get to the second quarter, we estimated, and I mean myself estimated, about $100 million of after-tax losses for exchanges were implied in the second quarter guidance. Can you give us an update here on how exchanges are going? Is that $100 million still ballpark in terms of losses this year? And where you might expect this to kind of go in 2015 in terms of getting better?","David M. Cordani","It's David again. So to give you a little color around that, and I appreciate the way you described it, \"your estimate\". So if we step back last quarter, I would say, in the ballpark, your estimate is probably a little bit bearish.","Per Tom's comments, you should expect that, that estimate has improved. So the loss is smaller this year. And if you think about Tom's comments relative to the medical care ratio, our range remains, for the medical care ratio outlook for the full year, but instead of being at the high end of the range, we're more in the middle part of the range. Throughout the course of the year, the employer book of business has been consistent, strong performing. So the delta there, Justin, is really the individual block of business. So we see some improvement relative to that. And, by the way, we still see the ability to improve the financial performance as we step into 2015 and beyond that.","Operator","The next question comes from Josh Raskin with Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","First question, just a clarification on 2014. Within -- there's always sort of a lot of moving parts, and I think, Tom, you broke out some one-timers this quarter. What's the sort of cumulative impact of one-timers, both positive and negative, in 2014 as like a starting point that we should think about?","Thomas A. McCarthy","Josh, I'm not sure I could actually give you an orientation on that. Our results include some favorable and unfavorable one-time events as a normal course of business. We really just call them out to make sure you're better informed about what's going on in the results as opposed to trying to set a level for expectation going forward.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Maybe we can talk about that separately. So next question, just on Stop Loss. On your offerings there, I'm just curious how those have continued to evolve in the marketplace. I'm curious if you're seeing or offering lower attachment points or aggregate or individual points and sales that are in the Stop Loss. And then any specific commentary on the impact from specialty pharmacy and if that's having an impact on rates that you guys are going to have to charge for 2015?","David M. Cordani","Yes, it's David. Relative to Stop Loss, as you know, relative to us, we have a long history of a broad portfolio of Stop Loss programs, and those programs are pretty mature in the, what we call the regional segment. As you think about employers' needs, employers have fundamental needs for affordability, they have fundamental needs for predictability and they have fundamental needs for positive health and productivity outcomes for their employee base. So Stop Loss really fits into a predictability opportunity for the benefit of our employer clients. We've continued to expand those programs as part of our portfolio of services, and been able to grow that portfolio services every year with a variety of offerings, to your terminology, both aggregate and individual and continue to innovate those programs for the benefit of our employer clients.","So continued growth, continued good market need and acceptance. Really around the peace of mind for our client to have predictability and, I'll call it, risk mitigation in any given year. Specific to specialty pharma, specialty pharma, as we've discussed in the past, continues to be probably the single highest trend category driver once you fragment all the medical cost categories. And we see that in 2014 within our underlying pharmacy trend across our portfolio of businesses. By the way, our aggregate medical cost trend is a very attractive competitive result in the 4.5% to 5% range. And secondly, as a flag for 2015, for the overall portfolio, we expect that specialty pharma will continue to provide a headwind trend that we will offset with our broad portfolio of other capabilities looking forward.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So it doesn't sound like specialty pharmacy is creating any specific dislocation in the market. I mean, I am just thinking about attachment points of say $50,000 being a big difference in hep C for example, today versus last year. So -- but it doesn't sound like that's creating a big difference in the way you're approaching the market.","David M. Cordani","Josh. I appreciate your follow-up. So if you break specialty pharma down, if you think about in the broad portfolio of comprehensive medical offerings, no. It's a driver, but as our results demonstrate, offset with all the other active management programs. Secondly, to your point on Stop Loss, not a triggering event. Broadly speaking, I wouldn't think about that as a triggering event. Thirdly, as you think about pharmacy specific offerings that only focus on pharmacy, then you're going to have more of a leveraged effect there. So if you think about the pharmacy offering more primarily, you'll have a leveraged effect there but broadly in our commercial book of business, that's integrated with our medical offering.","Operator","The next question comes from Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First of all, I just want to extend my best wishes to Ted as well on his retirement. And then, just moving -- just a first question. Just interested on Medicare Advantage and if you can give us some early observations on how the annual enrollment period is going for HealthSpring? David I know you mentioned that you do expect growth in MA enrollment for next year, so just interested if you think that the business could return to more of a market type growth rate for MA for 2015.","David M. Cordani","Scott, so relative to MA, again, we're not providing detailed guidance but as I noted in prepared comments, we expect to grow our covered lives from an MA standpoint. To remind you, we always focus on the individual MA market, we're not really focus on the employer MA marketplace. Based on a look at the competitive environment, and especially our critical Go Deep markets, we are pleased with our net positioning of our overall benefit offerings, our price point, the ability to continue to leverage our collaborative physician relationships, and we're looking forward to having a good growth year as we step into 2015 for the MA marketplace in terms of covered lives for the vast majority of our Go Deep markets. As you know, there were some markets where we're repositioning. There are some markets that we're investing and entering. So I think about it in terms of the mature markets. Well, very good results there based on what we're seeing right now. Finalizing some repositioning markets and then our indicators are relative to the markets we're investing into growth, the new markets we've opened up, early indicators there positive as well.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just I had a follow-up question, just around Select and just interested in terms of on the cost side whether you saw any type of cost issues emerge there. Obviously, one of the competitors did cite seeing some pressure there, not sure if it's sound like the employer business. It sounds like the cost trends overall have remained very favorable, but just interested if you could spike out on the Select Segment there.","David M. Cordani","Your headline conclusion is correct. We've seen no spikes and Scott, I think it's important to step back and understand how we attempt to go-to-market there and how we focus the programs. So they're beyond the traditional insurance offerings. As noted in my prepared remarks, the health engagement, the diagnostic programs, the ability to do on-site biometrics illustratively for 100-life or 125-life employer, on-site health coaching, et cetera, all of that is paying dividends. First, for the employer and the employees and as such, for us as we go forward. But overall, we are really pleased with the medical cost trend that we're able to deliver and adjacent to that, therefore, the medical cost quality we're also delivering for those clients in the Select Segment.","Operator","The next question comes from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I'm just trying to understand the guidance for the last bit of the year here in the context that I think last quarter, or after last quarter you guys talked about overall and health care earnings being relatively level between 3Q and 4Q. And looks like you did quite a bit better in 3Q than that implied. And a number of things moving favorably for you, so why not raise the overall health care guidance? And why now have this lower view of 4Q? And if it's seasonality, is there something that makes you think that, that seasonality is stronger than your view maybe 3 months ago?","David M. Cordani","David, just a couple of comments and I'll ask Tom to tease out a couple of specifics. Most importantly, overall, we're very pleased with our 2014 results to date and our 2014 outlook as the range for 2014 indicates a 7% to 10% EPS growth rate in this marketplace is a very positive outcome. Secondly, you've hit upon an important point. There is seasonality in the fourth quarter. There's seasonality in the makeup of the medical benefit, so I'll ask Tom to reiterate and give you more color on, as well as our spending pattern, both the fundamental spending pattern running the business as well as our discretionary spending pattern of our ongoing investments. Those are the 2 categories I would highlight. And off the strength of our portfolio, we will continue to make sure we're investing for the long haul as well. So Tom, could you give a little more insights on the fourth quarter seasonality as it relates to MCR, and then maybe a little color on where the spending uptick is in the fourth quarter?","Thomas A. McCarthy","Sure. So -- again, as I mentioned in my remarks, we are expecting and had seasonality in the fourth quarter MCR, and that's largely due to the growing share of the high-deductible plans in both our employer group and individual businesses. And as individual has grown, they tend to be leaning towards more higher deductible plans and even in our employer group plans, we tend to have more high deductible plans this year than prior years. So combined with the normal seasonality for underlying medical costs in the fourth quarter, which typically, we do have more medical expenses because of the -- during the fourth quarter. We do expect our MCR to increase both sequentially and quarter-over-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2014. So just to reiterate, the fundamentals of the business remain strong and this impact that we're anticipating simply reflects seasonality in the mix shift dynamics and is fully contemplated in the guidance that you referenced. Now on expenses, again, we have the normal seasonality drivers of one-one readiness, probably more invested in open enrollment and clearly, we have some options on strategic initiative investments that probably weigh more heavily on the quarter. I'd also point out, Matt, in the quarter-over-quarter dynamics, we had anticipated a tax benefit in the fourth quarter that actually got accelerated into the third quarter. So that also changes the dynamic a little bit from our earlier expectation.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","All right, that's fine. And just lastly, is a follow-up. On the disability claims pressure, is that something you expect will abate in the next quarter going into next year?","Thomas A. McCarthy","Just to give some high-level comments in group first and then get to that specific point. I mean, we have our group business viewed as a very attractive part of portfolio. We've got a differentiated model with a focus on health and productivity that delivers great value for clients, customers and shareholders. And have a track record of solid revenue growth and strong return on capital in this business, in what has been a very challenging economic climate. As I mentioned in my remarks, there is some higher visibility benefit ratio this quarter, mainly related to higher average claim size. And while we do expect some variability quarter-to-quarter in this business, we do expect group results to improve in the fourth quarter. And I'm confident that our differentiated capabilities that I referenced earlier will allow us to continue to drive value for both customers and shareholders in this business.","Operator","The next question comes from Christine Arnold with Cowen.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","National selling season and also anything that's renewed. How are you feeling about the national selling season? And also, there were some gnits and gnats second quarter that elevated some of the other MLRs. I'm sensing something may have happened there. Third quarter, is there anything kind of onetime to call out in the other businesses, say experience rated Stop Loss, those?","David M. Cordani","And it's David. I'll give you little color on the National Account segment, and ask Tom to comment on the MLRs. The headline relative to national accounts is no new news from what we discussed on last quarter's call. So to remind you, very importantly, we defined this segment more tightly than the marketplace norms. So commercial employers with 5,000 or more employees that are multistate. As we define it, that is a shrinking market place due to the U.S. employment patterns in the current environment. Our goal has been, and continues to be to hold share overall, but to continue to evolve our share as it relates to geographic depth of where those covered lives are as well as the percent that are engagement- and incentive-based. For 2015, the new business opportunities that we had the opportunity to bid on were about the same percentage over the prior year, and our look at our close ratio and our ability to win is about the same year-over-year. The percent of our business that was up to bid for '15 versus '14 was up a bit, and that was relative to procurement cycles of the nature of the business for 2015. Our retention rates over the average of it will continue to be strong, but because there's a little higher percentage out to bid, they'll be a little higher percentage of loss. Net net, no massive change in terms of the patterns, and with the ongoing strength of our Select and regional portfolio of business as I noted in my prepared remarks, we expect to again grow our customer base in 2015. Tom, could you give a little color on the loss ratios?","Thomas A. McCarthy","Sure. Christine, again, with respect to the group of businesses that are outside of our guaranteed cost MCRs, so that would be the variety of lines, the shared return, Stop Loss, dental, et cetera that are outside of the guaranteed cost MCRs. As I've talked about before, those lines all behave a little differently so you need to be careful in looking at that very narrow MCR result. But business-wise, there's no news to report there, things are performing as we'd expect and as it happens, this quarter, if you do the math, at least as we've done the math, on the risk ratio result for that segment of the business, it's about 77.1%. And that is pretty much consistent with the sequential results in the second quarter of 77%. So not really seeing anything even in the overall metric. And certainly, as we look at the business fundamentals, there's nothing to call out as unusual.","Operator","The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. Just wanted to go back to your kind of long-term guidance, which was helpful to think about. You kind of focused on the top line. Any thoughts on kind of how margins develop over that time, whether it's just based upon the relative growth rates of the different products kind of whether you see a little bit of margin compression, just trying to think whether we should expect organic earnings growth to approximate the revenue number that you talked about, or whether we should think about something a little bit less organically?","David M. Cordani","Kevin, it's David. I appreciate the follow-up here. First and foremost, we're quite pleased with the strategic positioning of the businesses we talked about. So the broader Commercial Employer business, the U.S. and Global, the ability to grow that high single-digits; the individual business, double-digit; the international business, mid-teens; seniors, high single-digits; group, mid- to high single-digits. As it relates to your margin question, a little color or way of thinking about it, natural headwinds for a business over this time horizon like ours, there'll be natural headwinds that will trigger margin compression just as a normal course of business. The ability to offset that will be predicated on -- be on growth, and just basic fixed cost leveraging. The ability to combat that will be continued innovation to be able to deliver value of a diverse portfolio of businesses. Operating efficiency gains beyond just traditional fixed cost leveraging. Over this horizon, all things remaining equal, when you look at the makeup of this business portfolio, it would suggest that run rate margins will be similar, natural headwinds will push a little bit in the face, maybe they decrease them somewhat. And as long as we are committed to ongoing innovation, we should be able to mitigate most of that, but not all of it. So if I was to predict out 8 years, all other things remaining equal, I'd say probably a little margin headwind off of a scale of a business that doubled in size.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. That's very helpful. And then just -- the other follow-up question would be on the 3Rs. Because I think you said $130 million of accruals, I think last quarter, you had $65 million. And I thought that you said that you're expecting to have only $65 million in the back half of the year total. Am I right on that? So it feels like the 3R growth is a little bit higher than what you thought last quarter. And if it is, how you reconcile that with the improved results there?","Thomas A. McCarthy","Kevin, it's Tom. I think we suggested kind of the running rate would continue into the last half of the year. So the accrual is maybe a little bit higher, but really, in the same general ballpark. And one of the reasons that it is a little tricky to talk about the 3Rs, is they are so interrelated. So the components are a little different, but in the same general ballpark. And I would expect as we said last quarter, that kind of the run rate is generally the same going into the fourth quarter, maybe a little more, but nothing materially different in the overall scheme of things.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just to be clear, you're now talking about a risk corridor and a risk adjuster, both of those would be receivables?","Thomas A. McCarthy","Yes.","Operator","The next question comes from Carl McDonald with Citigroup.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I'm going to ask Josh's question around the onetime benefits or benefits from favorable development. So it looks like in health care, you've called out, order of magnitude $55 million after tax in favorable development this year. So as we think about the outlook into '15, would you take the -- call it the midpoint of the health care guidance, $1.62 billion back out the $55 million and use that as the base to grow into 2015? Anything you'd change in that assumption?","David M. Cordani","It's David. As you know, we do not project reserve development. As reserve development unfolds, we obviously create clarity relative to that. So I'd invite you to draw your conclusions relative to that. I think the important headline here when you think about reserve development, is you step back and say what's driving that? What's driving that is fundamental execution and consistency in terms of delivery of positive medical cost outcomes. And what we're pleased with is our sustained track record of setting a goal relative to medical cost outcomes, and it you look at the medical trend outlook for the corporation that we've achieved or improved year-after-year and delivered at the lower level. There's a lot that contribute to that. Alignment of individual incentives, objectives and engagement, alignment of physician incentives and engagement et cetera, but as it relates to the math, I'd invite you to draw your conclusions. When we provide guidance for '15 we'll clearly articulate what the basis of that guidance is, but we continue not to take a posture of projecting any reserve development.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then separately on the -- as you think about the competitive environment for the nonrisk Select Segment, just any general commentary on how competitive that business is? And then just maybe a thought on how easy is it for other companies to get into? My suspicion is that having a successful large group ASO business, does not necessarily prepare a company well to get into the Select Segment.","David M. Cordani","Carl, so a little bit more color relative to that and to your question, I think you underscore within your question, there's multiple buyer's and buying types within the Select Segment. So as we noted, it's a group of about 25 million lives. So it's a large segment. It's a large segment, therefore it's a diverse segment. Secondly, as we've seen over the years, the percent of new business sales in that segment have continue to grow as it relates to transparent funding versus risk, but we continue to offer both of those funding alternatives. It's a competitive market. The market is a competitive marketplace and the key to success is your ability to deliver results. A couple points of differentiation that we have and continue to invest in. One, the core capabilities around just transparency and aligning incentives and objectives. Two, a very diverse portfolio of specialty businesses that need to line up, including the clinical engagement capabilities of being able to do on-site biometrics, virtual health coaching, on-site health coaching, et cetera. And then finally, an important point just to tease out a little bit, it's the client management and service staff that wraps around it that delivers what we'll call employer reporting and actionable insights to the employer and their broker intermediary, if they work with a broker, to illuminate where and how the drivers are cost health risks engagement opportunities exist? That's very difficult to replicate over the scale that we're talking about because it's easy to do that for a 100,000-life or a 10,000-life employer. It's difficult to do it in scale, monthly or quarterly for the number of cases it would take at 100 lives or 125 lives. But this is an area where innovation will continue, and we'll continue investing, innovating our capabilities, talent, insights on a go-forward basis. And finally as I noted, this scenario where we see continued tremendous growth opportunity because there's great value creation for those clients.","Operator","And next question comes from Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just wanted -- I know you're not giving guidance for 2015, but I was hoping you can talk around 2 items. The losses in the ACA compliant book. Obviously, we all have our own estimates, but how much -- what percentage do you think is the reasonable amount of losses you could claw back? And then second, on the Catamaran partnership, is it still about $0.25 additive to next year's EPS?","David M. Cordani","Chris, it's David. So on the ACA book, so -- we'll talk a little bit more broadly relative to our individual block of business. As indicated with our prior question, our -- we entered the year with the expectation that we would lose money and we would manage that within our overall portfolio. We're -- by the way, we're achieving that goal. And earlier this year, we indicated that those losses grew. This quarter we're indicating that, that rate of growth is a abated a little bit and results are improving, but still at a loss pattern. Secondly, we will improve that result in 2015, but to be clear, by no means do we project in 2015 that, that will be a run rate level of targeted and sustainable margins of 3% or better. So it'll be a less of a loss in 2015. And we don't view this clawing back. We view this as 2014, '15, '16, a really version 1.0 of this marketplace, and we're being highly focused on where and how we're playing in the market. As it relates to our pharmacy business more broadly, step back and put that in context. First, we continue to be very excited about our PBM asset. We continue to own and operate a very well-performing PBM asset and that we further strengthened with bulk purchasing leverage through mail-order fulfillment leverage, through the ability to leverage an innovative technology platform. The headline here is good progress on all of the above, good progress on the organization's ability to move forward relative to that. As it relates to your specific question, let me give you a little bit color. We looked at 2014 as a transitional year and 2015 as a run rate year. So the easiest way for that to be internalized as your reference is, we said the run rate year is $0.50 of EPS accretion. Therefore, the transitional year, you can think about half of that. The good news is we're ahead of our trajectory for 2014, largely driven by our own rate and pace of internal investments that we had assumed to be able to drive various initiatives within our Pharmacy business. So headline one is we are ahead of trajectory relative to 2014, largely driven by the rate and pace of our own internal activities. Secondly, line of sight to the run rate for 2015 remains intact. As a result, the Delta between '14 and '15 will be less than the implied $0.25. But most importantly, the run rate is there and maybe with a little upside as we continue to innovate within our overall PBM capabilities.","Operator","The next question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a couple of well, quick ones hopefully. But the first one was on the Part D business, I know this is a very specific one, but it looked like year-to-year, you were up about 1,300 basis points in your MLR and that created even though a small bit of a year-to-year headwind for you. What -- anything to call out there? Or highlight?","Thomas A. McCarthy","A.J., it's Tom. So as you know, the Part D business tends to have a lot of variability quarter-to-quarter and this quarter, does include some timing-related items. So I'd suggest you focus on the year-to-date results to get a picture of where things are headed here rather than just looking at the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we're also running a little behind last year about 250 basis points worth, worse. Mainly 2 factors driving this. First, is the impact of somewhat higher-than-anticipated specialty drug costs, including Sovaldi. And then second is an increased mix of higher cost brand drugs that we had expected in the portfolio. I'd note that our outlook reflects continuation of these pressures into the fourth quarter. We do expect to make network and formulary adjustments to ultimately help mitigate these impacts over time.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then as the follow-up. The comment was made about -- David about International mid-teens sort of growth into the future. Can you just comment a, any particular areas near term this quarter and looking in the fourth quarter that are doing particularly well, any challenges? And then does that long-term outlook corporate a broadening footprint, or can you do that type of growth with the existing base of business you have now?","David M. Cordani","A.J., so as we're talking about that mid-teens, we're talking about the international individual business. So strong performing asset, variety of countries that we operate in today. Remind you of the core capabilities. Our core capabilities, there are really marketing and consumer insights that enable us to microsegment the current and emerging middle class and our target markets match specific solutions to those microsegments and importantly, match what we call, preference-centric distribution campaigns around those microsegments. And we continue to iteratively go at that in our target markets. So the drivers of growth here are really 3 things. First, in our existing markets that we're focused on, continued evolution of economic growth is growing in ever present middle class and the need statement matches up very nicely relative to our capabilities. Second, our ability to innovate in those markets further to expand our portfolio of solutions for our existing customers, because we want to be a solution provider of choice for those customers off of my first point. And then third is to expand geographies. So currently as you know, we took the step to expand into Turkey. That is performing very well for us. We're making the strategic investments to expand in India. We started selling business earlier this year, and the rate and pace of continuing to expand in those countries as well as additional countries will continue on a go-forward basis. Taking it all together, this is an exciting growth segment for us that we will continue to invest in both the capabilities from a technological standpoint and geography and then talent necessary to continue that growth rate.","Operator","Mr. Rice, the next question comes from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners.","Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Again following up on the margin profile for a couple of businesses from a normalized basis. I think you've seen about a couple of years of margin compression on Medicare, at least on the MLR. This year, looking forward into '15 and beyond, do you think you're MLR will settle out at the 84 to 85? Or is there any potential to bring it back closer to what you had with HealthSpring, either through pricing of Stars or network strategies and whatever?","David M. Cordani","Ana, it's David. As it relates to margins in Medicare more specifically per our prior discussions. We today, are not at our margin objectives. So to be clear, we see upside opportunity here. Secondly, as it relates to the drivers of it. Number one, our benefit positioning in our chosen Go Deep markets continues to be strong. Two, we'll step out of this year with a very good Stars position, an improving Stars position further going into '16 and further improvements that we see beyond that. And third, the Go Deep markets benefit by proven physician partnerships and physician relationships. So to your point, as you framed it, as we look to '15, '16, '17, we see the ability to move the margin forward but we're going to be smart relative to that and balance it versus our growth objectives as we continue to drive forward. So we're not at our objective today, upside opportunity going forward, and we'll be disciplined in terms of balancing that with our growth objectives.","Operator","The next question comes from Sarah James with Wedbush.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Your peers have been talking about pricing to a 50 to 150 basis point cost trend uptick in 2015. So it's the largest increase that we've seen in recent years. Can you touch on the cost trend that you've been baking into your 2015 renewals so far?","David M. Cordani","Sarah, it's David. Again, we're not providing '15 guidance. The way to think about it is if you step back and look at our prior years, we've tended to build a bit of an uptick in trend relative to what we had in any given year under the notion that we may see some additional utilization trend and\/or as I flagged earlier, specialty Pharma trend. So we're pleased with the '14 trend outlook of 4.5% to 5.5% and, as Tom noted, trending towards the low ends of the range. You should assume that we build that trend up based on our known contracting and then utilization assumptions. And most probably, it will be upticked a little bit relative to next year. Final point I would make here and very importantly, when you think about our portfolio business, I'd ask you to remember, that about 80-plus percent of it is transparent funding mechanisms. Another portion of it is assured returns, and then when you get into the guaranteed cost portfolio, because we don't play in the under-50-life book of business. In most cases, we are pricing those accounts based upon the experience within those accounts. With a lot of back and forth and dialogue with clients, so aggregate trend assumptions are interesting, but client-specific experience is what's important, and that's a part of how we work, whether it's in the ASO space, the shared return space or even by the inherent makeup of our guaranteed cost book of business because we're not in the pooled products of under-50, so just a little color, I think it's important and differentiated for us.","Operator","The next question comes from Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So just -- I appreciate your comments earlier on your expectations or priorities around capital deployment. Maybe just provide a little more color around that, with particular advances on maybe your appetite for M&A? Or is there any capabilities within maybe Medicare or even Medicaid that you feel like you need to acquire to help gain sufficient scale?","David M. Cordani","Sure. Relative to capital deployment, Andy, and acquisition specifically, first, when you think about capital deployment you need capital with which to deploy, and we continue to be very pleased with the positioning of our businesses and the ability to produce the sustained free cash flow that we're able to produce off of a base that, as Tom noted in his prepared remarks, we have well-capitalized operating subsidiaries to start with. As it relates to our capital priorities, they remain unchanged and our second priority is to pursue strategically attractive and financially attractive M&A. Our priorities there remain consistent. So to further expand our seniors capabilities, including the capabilities that serve the dual-eligible population. Second, is to further expand our global footprint. Third, expand our retail capabilities further and fourth, what we'll call local density plays, which typically fall more in the tuck-in category framework. And we have the capital positioning to do so. And as we've proven in the past, when we've taken action, we have a proven track record of being on strategy in converting those acquisitions to positive shareholder outcomes as we execute those acquisitions.","Operator","And the next question comes from Brian Wright with Sterne Agee.","Brian M. Wright - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just wanted a little clarification on the 3Rs because I thought last quarter, you said the $60 million to $65 million after tax included -- was mostly reinsurance, so I thought that would imply some risk -- the risk corridor and maybe some risk adjustment. So I just want to understand like they're going up to $130 million this quarter, how that is kind of just within the range after all the 3Rs? Because that could be like 550 basis points on the guaranteed cost MLR.","Thomas A. McCarthy","Well, Brian, again, you've kind of got the dynamics right. The reinsurance is still the largest share of the estimate. Last quarter, I think, we commented that we didn't make any -- or maybe we didn't comment, but we didn't include any estimate for risk adjustors, we just didn't have any information. And as information has become available, we've been able to make a risk adjustor estimate, but it basically has moved around some of the estimates in the other Rs over time. So we're really, generally on the same trend as we thought we'd be, maybe a little more accrual in the 3Rs, but in the same ball park.","Operator","Our final question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies.","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Maybe a little granular, but on the Medicare Advantage book. In 2014, I guess, my understanding is the repositioning that Herb and the team have done is largely focused in Pennsylvania, and the membership declines there are what is kind of holding back membership growth for MA this year. I guess, I'm wondering if those same dynamics play out into 2015, and how -- kind of coming back to an earlier question, how we should really think about member growth for MA, relative to kind of market growth in light of that dynamic?","David M. Cordani","David, it's David. You have a pretty good recall, so let me add a couple more pieces and then talk about the prospective piece. We had a couple of items going on in 2014. One, when we provided guidance for '14, I'd ask you to recall that we indicated that there were certain markets that we would fundamentally exit and we categorized that as 2 to 3 points. Additionally, beyond that, there were some repositioning and retrenchment and that's the part you recall. But there was 2 items that were in play. Largely in 2015, you don't need to think about large-scale market exits, number one. Two, there's finalization of some repositioning. But three, offsetting that, there is further traction relative to the new market entr\u00e9e, investments from 2014 and county expansion in 2015. Taking it as a whole, our covered life performance or our customer growth performance for MA will be positive and attractive in 2015 versus the repositioning in 2014.","Operator","I will now turn the call over to David Cordani for closing remarks.","David M. Cordani","Thanks, just to conclude our call this morning, I want to emphasize a few key points. Our strong third quarter results reflect solid revenue and earnings contributions from each of our business segments. This performance was driven by the many contributions of our more than 35,000 dedicated colleagues across the world, who bring our strategy and mission to life every day. We're continuing to build and strengthen our global capabilities and consultative expertise to fulfill our mission of improving the health well-being, and sense of security of the individuals we serve. Based in part on our performance over the past 3 quarters, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our elevated 2014 outlook, and we expect meaningful revenue growth over the next 7 to 8 years, with the goal of doubling our revenues, leveraging our business in established growth markets and potential emerging marketplaces. As a result we remain committed to achieving our average annual EPS growth target of 10% to 13% over the long term.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the question-and-answer session is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Ted Detrick. Please go ahead, Mr. Detrick","Edwin J. Detrick","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I'm Ted Detrick, Vice President of Investor Relations and with me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ralph Nicoletti, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David will begin by commenting on Cigna's second quarter results. He will then review our approach to delivering value for our customers and clients. He will also identify our key earnings drivers and why we believe Cigna is well-positioned to deliver attractive top line and bottom line growth on a sustained basis. David will conclude his remarks by discussing our capital deployment strategy and how we have invested in our businesses by adding differentiated capabilities that will create shareholder value over the long term. Next, Ralph will review the financial results for the second quarter, and provide an update on Cigna's financial outlook for full year 2012. We will then open the lines for your questions. And following our question-and-answer session, David will provide some brief closing remarks before we end the call.","Now as noted in our earnings release, Cigna uses certain financial measures which are not determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP when describing its financial results. Specifically, we use the term labeled adjusted income from operations as the principal measure of performance for Cigna and our operating segments. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. Now in our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking comments. We would remind you that there are risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations and those risk factors are discussed in today's earnings release.","Now before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our second quarter results and disclosures. Relative to our runoff reinsurance operations, our second quarter shareholders net income included an after-tax, noncash loss of $51 million or $0.17 per share related to the guaranteed minimum income benefits business otherwise known as GMIB. I would remind you that the impact of the financial accounting standards towards fair value disclosure and measurement guidance on our GMIB results is for GAAP accounting purposes only. We believe that the application of this guidance is not reflective of the underlying economics as it does not represent management's expectation of the ultimate liability payout. Because of the avocation of this accounting guidance, Cigna's future results for the GMIB business will be volatile as any future change in the exit value of GMIB's assets and liabilities will be recorded in shareholders net income. Cigna's 2012 earnings outlook, which we will discuss in a few moments, excludes the results of the GMIB business and therefore, any potential volatility related to the prospective application of this accounting guidance.","Also please note that when we discuss our full year 2012 outlook, it will be on a basis which excludes any future capital deployment and includes the year-to-date results of our Run-off Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefits business known as VADBe but does not include an estimate for future impacts as these potential impacts, including the effect of changes in capital markets or periodic updates to long-term reserve assumptions are not known or reasonably estimable.","And one last item, I remind you that Cigna will be hosting our upcoming Investor Day on November 16 in New York City.","With that, I'll turn the call over to David.","David M. Cordani","Thanks, Ted, and good morning, everyone. Before Ralph reviews our results and outlook, I'll comment on our second quarter performance, then I'll discuss how the focused execution of our strategy is strengthening our ability to drive sustainable growth in revenue and earnings, as well as strong free cash flow. Finally, I'll highlight how we are further investing in our business to create differentiated value for customers and clients.","Turning to our results. We are pleased with our performance in the second quarter, specifically delivering another quarter of strong revenue and earnings contribution, making good progress on integrating HealthSpring, continuing strategic investments to ensure we are well-positioned to serve our targeted markets and customer segments and as a result, continue to deliver attractive revenue and earnings growth. With the momentum we've continued to build in 2012, we are again increasing our full year outlook for earnings and capital available for deployment.","More specifically for the quarter, we reported adjusted income from operations of $444 million or $1.52 per share. Our consolidated revenue increased by 35% to $7.5 billion. These results demonstrate the ongoing effectiveness of our Go Deep, Go Global and Go Individual strategy, and our commitment to consistent execution of our business fundamentals, including clinical quality, service excellence and pricing discipline. Each of our ongoing businesses, Health Care, International and Group Disability and Life provided strong revenue and earnings contributions in the second quarter and year-to-date. Our Health Care business results benefited from strong client retention and growth in our targeted customer segments. Revenue grew 46% in Health Care relative to the second quarter 2011, reflecting a full quarter of contribution from HealthSpring and solid organic growth. Our U.S. medical customer base grew by approximately 1.1 million during the first 6 months of 2012, representing 10% net growth from year end 2011, including 6% organic commercial customer growth. I would highlight that essentially all of this organic growth has been in our ASO products.","In our International business, revenue increased by 22% compared to the second quarter 2011, driven by solid customer retention and continued new sales in our high-performing businesses. In our Health, Life and Accident business, we leveraged our expertise and customer insights to bring to market innovative solutions at attractive price points. In our Global Health Benefits business, our portfolio of highly specialized health programs and our global network of more than 1 million health care professionals continues to provide a competitive advantage in serving the globally mobile employee market. In Group Disability and Life, our revenue growth was 4% over the second quarter of 2011, and we reported solid earnings, which is a competitively attractive result. This growth demonstrates the value of our health and productivity programs for the benefit of our customers and clients.","Overall, the second quarter results reflect the strength of our differentiated capabilities and our focused multi-year growth strategy. In a dynamic global economy with challenges faced by health systems around the world, we continue to deliver strong client and customer retention while broadening our existing relationships and winning new ones in our targeted segments and markets. The consistent execution of our strategy puts us on track to deliver our third consecutive year of attractive revenue and earnings growth.","I'll now highlight how we are focused -- how the focused execution of our strategy positions us for sustained growth. In our U.S. Commercial business, the differentiated value we offer through our customer focus, our consultative sales approach and physician engagement capabilities continues to create good demand for our health and productivity programs. Our customer focus enables us to take a highly targeted approach to employee engagement through incentive alignment. This personalized approach allows us to move customers from passive recipients of care to active, value-conscious customers of their own health and wellness.","We support our customers with 24\/7, 365 live phone service and online decision tools to deliver transparency of health care costs and quality. More and more employees are realizing that the way to control their medical costs is by keeping their employees healthy, by helping them lower their health risks and by making it easier for those facing chronic or acute conditions to obtain high-value health care. Through our consultative sales approach, we design health and wellness plans based on our client's corporate strategy and culture, their workforce health status and their benefit goals.","As we have discussed before, physician engagement is key to improving our customers' health outcomes and achieve sustainable cost. In the second quarter, we've further accelerated our leadership and physician engagement by adding 10 new Collaborative Accountable Care initiatives. We launched our first Collaborative Accountable Care initiative back in 2008, so we've been at this for some time now. Today, we have 32 programs spanning 16 states. These programs are designed to deliver improved clinical quality and medical costs while increasing customer satisfaction.","Our approach incorporates 3 elements to drive physician success: First, we provide actionable data to help physicians identify potential gaps in care and we do this in a way that is fully aligned with their operating protocols; second, we align financial rewards with their performance on keeping patients healthy and delivering the highest quality care; and third, we support their practice with clinical care coordinators who focus on improving medical compliance and identifying patients who could benefit from our health, lifestyle and chronic care programs. When you consider Cigna's Collaborative Accountable Care footprint combined with HealthSpring's proven physician engagement model, we believe our breadth and depth of these programs is unmatched in the industry.","In our U.S. Seniors business, we are making solid progress pursuing opportunities to further fuel HealthSpring's growth by deepening their presence in existing markets and extending the value of their physician engagement model to develop new commercial offerings. Following the first quarter close of our HealthSpring acquisition, we launched sales of HealthSpring's group Medicare Advantage products to Cigna's commercial clients in targeted markets and we are beginning to generate good interest. We also introduced a new preferred network product in Tennessee and Houston that takes advantage of HealthSpring's high-performing physician network to offer our commercial clients greater access to affordable high-quality care. Overall, our HealthSpring integration continues to go well and we are on plan to deliver our expected synergies.","In our international business, we see continued demand for our Health, Life and Accident products amongst the growing middle class and emerging markets who want to enhance their coverage beyond their government-sponsored programs. Success in our International business is driven by leveraging our deep marketing insights to understand our customers' needs. We match solutions to address their needs and we deliver them through the appropriate direct-to-consumer distribution channels. This proven model enables us to deliver ongoing growth in our target markets and we are expanding this winning model to Turkey and India. Additionally, we continue to see strong demand for our highly specialized global health solutions from multinational companies and in the governmental organizations.","Now I want to take a moment to discuss how we are effectively using capital management to invest in our business in a way that creates sustainable shareholder value. We continue to have a strong balance sheet and good financial flexibility. Our capital deployment strategy remains focused on 3 core tenets: First, to provide the necessary capital to support our ongoing businesses; second, to pursue mergers, acquisitions and partnerships to accelerate our growth and create strategic competitive differentiation; and third, to return capital to our shareholders. I'll briefly address each of these.","We are supporting our current businesses with the capital required as a result of our ongoing growth. In addition, we continue to make targeted capital investments to support capabilities that position us for sustained growth. An example is our ongoing investments in our technology to better serve our existing and future customers, as well as our physician partners. We're also investing in key technology initiatives to yield operating efficiency gains. Second, relative to strategic acquisitions, we continue to explore and pursue opportunities that align with our growth strategy. In the U.S., our inorganic focus to date has been on acquiring differentiated capabilities and scale in the Seniors market, as well as retail capabilities.","Acquiring the best-in-class physician coordination model of HealthSpring is a clear example of our focused execution. We are further extending our health solutions to more individuals in the U.S. with our recent agreement to acquire Great American Supplemental Benefits Group, one of the largest manufacturers, distributors and marketers of supplemental health insurance products in the U.S. These 2 investments position us with ongoing growth opportunities and the ability to provide greater value to our customers across all stages of their lives. Within our International business, we continue to seek opportunities to expand our reach in geographies with significant middle-class growth potential and to drive greater scale.","To accelerate our growth in Turkey during the second quarter, we've signed a joint venture with Finansbank, a large retail bank that operates the country's sixth largest life insurance company. The joint venture strengthens our direct-to-consumer distribution capabilities by partnering with a well-established local financial institution to leverage their network of 500 retail banking branches and more than 10 million customers.","After fully considering our first 2 priorities for capital deployment, those are supporting the growth of our ongoing businesses and pursuing financially attractive strategic M&A activity, we evaluate opportunities to return capital to investors. To date, that has been primarily through share repurchase.","Now before I turn the call over to Ralph, I just want to reiterate a few key points. Our second quarter and year-to-date performance reflects the strong revenue and earnings contributions from each of our ongoing businesses, reinforcing how our key differentiators are resonating in our target markets. We accelerated our investments in high-growth customer segments in emerging markets, with the announcement to acquire Great American Supplemental Benefits, and a new joint venture in Turkey, helping us to plant additional seeds for our future growth. HealthSpring is performing well and is on track. Our results reflect the dedication and customer-focused mindset of the more than 35,000 Cigna colleagues around the world who, every day, work to help to improve the health, well-being and sense of security of people we serve. And finally, the momentum we've created through the first half of 2012 provides us the confidence to achieve our increased full year outlook for earnings and capital available for deployment.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Ralph.","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will review Cigna's second quarter 2012 results and provide an update to our full year outlook. In my review of consolidated and segment results, I will comment on adjusted income from operations. This is also the basis on which I will provide our earnings outlook. Before I get into the specifics of the quarter, I wanted to highlight that the quarter reflects continued effective execution of our strategy, revenue growth and strong earnings, operating expense ratio improvement and strong contributions from HealthSpring. These results provide us confidence to increase our full year outlook for earnings and parent company cash.","Now moving to results. Our second quarter 2012 consolidated revenues grew 35% to $7.5 billion, driven by contributions from the HealthSpring acquisition and growth in our targeted markets. Second quarter consolidated earnings were $444 million or $1.52 per share, excluding the after-tax loss of $0.03 per share from the results of the runoff VADBe business.","Turning to the segments, overall Health Care results for the second quarter of 2012 were strong and reflect continued effective execution of our growth strategy highlighted by strong year-to-date customer growth of our ASO products, continued underwriting and pricing discipline, effective integration of the HealthSpring franchise, while making investments in future capabilities.","Second quarter premium and fees for Health Care grew 52% to $5 billion, reflecting the first full quarter of HealthSpring revenues and organic growth in both our commercial and Medicare businesses. Excluding the effect of HealthSpring, premiums and fees grew 8%. Second quarter earnings for Health Care were $332 million, and reflect revenue growth including further specialty penetration and the impact of favorable prior-year claim development. As we highlighted last quarter, results also include strategic spending to support our business growth and service capabilities, as well as targeted investments that will deliver operating expense efficiencies beginning in the second half of this year.","We ended the second quarter of 2012 with approximately 12.6 million U.S. medical customers, representing year-to-date growth of approximately 1.1 million customers. The year-to-date increase is comprised of organic growth of approximately 750,000 commercial customers, primarily in our priority markets and roughly 400,000 HealthSpring customers. Essentially all of our organic growth in commercial customers for 2012 has been ASO product offerings.","Turning now to medical cost. In the quarter, we continued to deliver quality health care for our clients and customers. I would remind you that 85% of our commercial customers are in ASO funding arrangements where they directly benefit from these medical cost results. Across our commercial and Medicare risk books of business, our second quarter earnings include favorable prior-year claim development of $17 million after-tax, net of our rebate accrual, compared to $25 million after-tax in the second quarter of 2011. Specific to commercial guaranteed cost, our second quarter 2012 Medical Care Ratio or MCR was 80.1% on a reported basis. Excluding prior year claim development, the commercial guaranteed cost MCR for the second quarter was 81%.","When we provided our initial outlook for 2012, we planned for an increase in medical cost in our commercial book of business over the course of the year and we began to see this emerge during the second quarter, primarily in outpatient and professional services. Importantly, these increases were contemplated in our pricing. Our second quarter 2012 MCR for Medicare Advantage was 80.4% on a reported basis or 80.9% excluding prior-year claim development. Overall, we are pleased with the results in our Medical Risk businesses and they continue to reflect good pricing and underwriting discipline, as well as sustained clinical quality for our clients and customers. For the second quarter, the total operating expense ratio is 22.6%, which is 380-basis-point reduction over second quarter of 2011's expense ratio and primarily reflects the change in business mix associated with the HealthSpring acquisition, inclusive of strategic spending to support our business growth and service capabilities.","Now I'll discuss the results of our International business. International continues to deliver attractive growth and profitability. These results reflect targeted new sales, strong retention and further product penetration to existing customers. Premiums and fees grew 22% quarter-over-quarter, driven by strong customer retention and growth within our Health, Life and Accident business, particularly in Korea, and increased risk membership in our Global Health Benefits business. Second quarter earnings in our International business were $65 million, and reflect continued strong margins, in line with our long-term expectations for this business.","For Group Disability and Life, results were strong overall in a difficult environment as this business continues to deliver value to our clients and customers through market-leading disability management and productivity management programs. Group premiums and fees increased 4% over the second quarter of 2011. Second quarter earnings in our group business were $89 million, which includes a net favorable impact of $35 million after-tax, related to a reserve study on our group disability business. Results for our remaining operations, including run-off reinsurance, other operations and corporate totaled to an after-tax loss of $52 million for the second quarter. Corporate results include a charge of $10 million after-tax for the termination of a vendor contract related to the previously discussed operating expense efficiency initiatives. Additionally, these results include a reserve strengthening of $10 million after-tax related to our run-off VADBe book of business. The reserve strengthening relates to the impacts of changes to our long-term lapse assumptions for a segment of the business.","Overall, as a result of the continued effective execution of our strategy, our second quarter results reflect solid revenue and earnings contributions from each of our ongoing businesses and as a result, we continue to generate significant free cash flow.","Turning to our investment portfolio, we are pleased with the results of the second quarter. Our commercial mortgage loan portfolio is performing well in a challenging economic environment. During the quarter, we completed our annual review of the $3 billion loan portfolio, which indicated there has been an improvement in the average loan-to-value ratio to 66%, compared to the previous estimate of 70%, along with improvements in our average debt service coverage ratios. Overall, our strong investment management capabilities, diversification of the portfolio and disciplined approach to risk management continue to deliver solid results.","Now turning to our outlook. Based on the strength of our second quarter results, we are confident in our ability to achieve our increased full year outlook. We now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations in the range of $1.53 billion to $1.63 billion, and consolidated EPS of $5.25 to $5.60 per share, reflecting continued strong underlying results in each of our ongoing businesses. This increased outlook represents an increase of $0.05 per share over our previous expectations. I remind you that consistent with prior practices, our outlook excludes any contribution from additional prior-year reserve development or capital deployment.","I will now discuss the components of our 2012 outlook, starting with Health Care. We now expect full year Health Care earnings to be in the range of $1.21 billion to $1.27 billion, which is an improvement of $15 million from our previous expectations, at the midpoint. This increased outlook for Health Care reflects the impact of favorable prior-year claim development recognized in the second quarter and continued effective execution. Regarding U.S. medical customers, we continue to expect full year 2012 growth of approximately 1.2 million people, of which 800,000 is in our commercial book of business. This year's growth is essentially all in our highly transparent ASO funding arrangements and across all of our targeted customer segments, including national accounts, middle market and select size employers. We expect to provide additional value to our larger clients by expanding our suite of solutions over time, which will drive increased revenue and earnings for these relationships. Overall, we are pleased that employers of various sizes continue to value our consultative approach and differentiated health and productivity programs.","Turning to medical costs. Our outlook continues to assume an increase in medical costs during 2012, which we began to see during the second quarter. For our total commercial book of business, we continue to expect full year medical cost trend to be in the range of 6% to 7%. These expected medical costs have been reflected in our pricing for 2012. We continue to expect the full year MCR to be in the range of 80% to 81% for our commercial guaranteed cost book of business. And we now expect the full year Medicare Advantage MCR to be in the range of 81% to 82%, which is an improvement of 50 basis points from our previous expectations, the majority of which is driven by favorable claim development. We continue to expect the operating expense ratio for the full year 2012 to be in the range of 22.5% to 23.5%.","Now moving to the other components of our outlook. For our International business, we continue strong top line growth and continue to expect earnings in a range of $265 million to $285 million, which represents earnings growth of 19% to 28% versus full year 2011. Regarding group disability and life business, we continue to expect full year 2012 earnings in the range of $260 million to $280 million. And regarding our remaining operations, including run-off reinsurance, other operations and corporate, our outlook is now an expected loss of $205 million for 2012, reflecting second quarter run-off VADBe reserve strengthening, as well as the vendor contract charge recorded in the second quarter in corporate results.","So all in, for full year 2012, we now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $1.53 billion to $1.63 billion, and consolidated EPS in the range of $5.25 to $5.60 per share. As we indicated on the first quarter call, we expect our quarterly earnings pattern will be different than prior years. Regarding our outlook for earnings per share for the second half of 2012, I would note that there are a number of moving pieces, including a meaningful step up in Medicare Part D earnings in the fourth quarter, as well as the absence of the second quarter favorable impacts of prior year claim development and the disability reserve study. As a result, we expect a quarterly earnings per share pattern similar to the first half of this year.","I will now discuss our updated capital management position and outlook. Overall, we continue to have good financial flexibility as our subsidiaries remain well-capitalized and are generating significant free cash flow to the parent, reflecting strong return on capital in each of our ongoing businesses. We ended the quarter with parent company cash of approximately $650 million. We now expect to have approximately $800 million in parent company cash by the end of 2012, with approximately $350 million available for capital deployment, after considering all sources and uses, including approximately $400 million for our 2 pending strategic acquisitions. This represents a $200 million increase compared to our previous capital outlook, primarily reflecting the increased subsidiary dividends due to improved business fundamentals. Overall, our capital position and updated outlook remain strong and our capital deployment strategy and priorities remain unchanged.","Now to recap. Our second quarter 2012 consolidated results reflect the strength of our global differentiated portfolio of businesses and effective execution of our focused strategy with solid growth in our targeted customer segments. Our second quarter results represent another strong performance, reflecting good progress on the integration of HealthSpring and strong organic revenue and customer growth, which are expected to deliver an increase in $0.05 per share for 2012 -- in earnings per share for 2012, and an additional $200 million in capital available for deployment. Based on the strength of our results, we are confident in our ability to achieve our increased full year 2012 outlook.","With that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","If I could just start off with a topic which has gotten a lot of attention this earnings season, which is if you can comment on now that we've rolled forward 3 months, what you're seeing on the commercial risk base side in terms of price competition and any granularity you can provide around that?","David M. Cordani","Matthew, it's David. I'll give you a little color in terms of the overall market and place in the environment. Consistent with prior comments, we view the marketplace as competitive. You might conclude we're a little bit boring on the topic but we view it as competitive. You may recall, last year, we flagged that we saw a little bit of intensity of competition pickup, specifically for guaranteed costs or risk-based business and we flagged it was down market for the smaller employer size, several hundred employer size. In the face of that, we backed off a little bit on our own guaranteed cost membership growth expectations and replaced that with further acceleration in our growth, which we've been able to post in the ASO -- in ASOs stop-loss environment. So no meaningful change in pattern but I would suggest we've seen an uptick in intensity dating back over the course of the last year, and we've been successful using our ASO product in the face of that environment.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And just a follow-up, shifting to the self-funding side. Are you seeing the smaller and middle market employers continuing to shift to self-funding or have the interest in doing that at about the same level? Has that maybe slowed a little bit or is that maybe intensifying and would you expect it would intensify further if we move towards health reform implementation?","David M. Cordani","Well, Matthew, as you know, per Ralph's comments, 85% of our book of business today is ASO. So part of it is environmental, part of it is our targeting and segmentation but we see continued increased demand for more transparent programs and ASO is a highly transparent program. We've been effective using them over time, as you know, in national accounts, in middle market and regional accounts. But increasing, I would just say, continue to increase momentum as you go into what we call the Select Segment, 50 to 250 life employers. Very importantly, just to amplify, through the use of those programs, we've been able to see elevation in preventative care, elevation in medication compliance, elevation in chronic care program utilization, even for employers that have below average health risks. So it's a quite attractive tool and as a result, we're delivering very good medical cost trends. So increasing intensity of demand is what we've seen and we expect that pattern to continue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just want to talk a little about the loss ratios across the various segments. The guaranteed cost ratio was up year-over-year in the second quarter, which was a bit of a change from the first quarter result where it was actually down year-over-year, so I'm just curious if there was sort of some seasonality or if I'm missing some development changes, things like that? And in second quarter, understanding you didn't have HealthSpring last year in the second quarter but their reported MLR was actually 80.4 so it looks like the MA, MLR was actually down on a year-over-year basis, which I think was surprisingly positive. So I'm curious if that was mostly -- if the $17 million of development in health care was mostly MA? And then I'll leave it at that.","David M. Cordani","Josh, it's David. I'm going to ask Ralph to comment on the commercial side, in terms of what we've seen. And then I'll amplify a little bit in terms of what we're seeing in the MA book and the overall medical cost environment. Ralph?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Josh, on the commercial side, first, as we look at the MCRs and the progression here, I'd say we're performing in line with our expectations. We did come into the year with an expectation that medical costs would begin to move up. Some of the year-on-year changes that you're looking at does get mixed in with different levels of prior-year development with it between the 2 quarters but when you kind of cut through that, on an operational basis, the MCRs are really moving in line with how we plan the year and importantly, how we price the business at this point. So on Commercial, we feel good about where we are. I mentioned in my remarks that we've begun to see some increase in cost, particularly on outpatient services and the mix of services within outpatient and increased utilization on professional services. Again, all in line with our expectations as we plan through the year but I think those are some of the things that you're seeing when you look at the progression, either from year-on-year or sequentially from last quarter.","David M. Cordani","And Josh, picking up on that, as Ralph noted in his prepared comments, our outlook for the commercial MLR is intact and our outlook for overall medical cost trend is intact. Specifically, as it relates to Medicare Advantage, if you put it back in the context that you raised for HealthSpring, first, you have to start with the book of business. So HealthSpring has a long history of being very disciplined in terms of its benefit design and its growth story. And if you look at the MA growth for 2012, their MA growth was in the neighborhood of 6%. I think the industry average was about 7%. HealthSpring does not essentially historically hunt for group MA business so that's a good result given that the others are hunting for group MA business. With that good discipline, they've had predictability to their overall medical costs and profitability outcome. Why is that? Well, it's the focus on the benefit design, it's the great discipline that the HealthSpring team has but it's specifically also driven by the strong partnership and alignment with physicians where you have in excess of 60% of their book of business in very sophisticated physician partnership models. As a result, a strong result through the first 6 months this year and as Ralph noted in his prepared remarks, we actually improved the medical care ratio outlook by 50 basis points. So we feel quite good about that.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on the $35 million favorable visibility in life reserve study in the quarter, was that expected? I mean, it doesn't look like the guidance was moving much. So was that expected? And I guess, maybe more broadly, you've seen a bunch of these over the last couple of years, how do we think about those? Are those one-time items or are those just sort of natural catch-ups that end up getting lumped into one specific quarter but are just a part of the business?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Yes, Josh, it's Ralph. I think your latter observation is more directionally how to think about it. With the reserve level on that business of little over $2 billion, these are what I would call minor adjustments that we look at annually in this quarter. And it reflects 2 things: Our prudent practice in reserving; and our good execution in the marketplace. So the combination of those 2 things on a consistent basis and I think history has shown that, that it sort of results in some minor adjustments to the reserves. And the level this year was pretty comparable to what we saw last year.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So that was included in sort of your expectations, that you'd have similar reserve study to last year?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Not specifically to a number but essentially, as we go into the year and plan, we look at our execution and our reserve practices from being prudent is consistent. So with consistent execution, we do go into the year expecting, I'll call it in a range similar not materially different than what we've seen in the past.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Lake with JPMorgan.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question. Just wanted to dig in a little bit more on the cost trend. Can you add some specifics on how much physician and outpatient was up in the quarter and what you were expecting for those specific trends coming into the year and where you are now? And maybe given we're already halfway through the year, any way you can kind of give us a little more specifics in terms of where you are within that 6% to 7% trend range would be great.","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Okay. Justin, it's Ralph. As it relates to the trend itself, we would expect, as we move through the year, to see a continued increase. I think, when we set the guidance at the beginning of the year, we sort of shaped it to be a gradual increase in the cost trend throughout the year. So we're progressing in the first half at the lower end and we'd expect to be in the middle of the range on average for the year. So think of it in that 6% to 7% range. Regarding the pieces themselves, as I mentioned in my remarks and some of the comments, we did see the mix of services within outpatient increased. So it's not necessarily utilization-based but it's more the mix of services within outpatient. And we did see a step up in some utilization on the professional services side while inpatient was largely flattish in utilization.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And when you saw that mix of services in outpatient, any 2 or 3 that you might be able to point out to us, as to where the higher acuity is coming from?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Yes. Essentially, it came really in line with our expectations and there's probably some just shifting from inpatient to outpatient which moved some of that mix up. But largely, it moved as we expected.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. And so on the cost trend what you're saying, I guess, just to paraphrase what you're communicating is that coming into the year, maybe you were closer to the 6% range in the first quarter, that's now kind of progressed to the midpoint and you expect to kind of end the year closer to 7%, is that reasonable to think of?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Yes. I would just look at it as more in the middle of the range as we progress through the year. I don't think you should think of it as a steep curve here, but more of a gradual curve. And if you -- at or around the middle of the range for the balance of the year is where we'll be.","Justin Lake - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And you've got a lot of large group business and I know that, that pricing gets set pretty early on in the summer, kind of early fall. So you're kind of in there pricing business right now. Is it fair to say that you would be pricing business conservative, you're setting a conservative view or trend there given what you're seeing and therefore, pricing business kind of north of that 6% to 7% range for further cost trend increases next year?","David M. Cordani","Justin, it's David. Obviously, we're not providing 2013 guidance. Some business is already out, we've already put bids on the market for 2013. A small percentage of our business is bid. I think the important piece is: One, our medical costs for 2011 were better than our expectations and developed favorably; our medical costs thus far for 2012 are in line with our expectations and we've priced accordingly and we're using a similar approach to set the prices and establish the pricing for 2013. Also very important to your point, since our book of business is larger than average, right, especially since we don't have an under 50 block of business, you're looking at the specific credibility of those cases as well, so you're a little less exposed to averages when you're dealing with those cases. Our team is working on the case-specific credibility and that helps to pinpoint because now you're deeper into the market specificity off of our Go Deep strategy. Lastly, while you didn't ask about MA, I think it's important to amplify, from an MA standpoint, the medical costs are also year-to-date, in line to slightly favorable with our expectations. That's quite important because as you know, the bid process for that is well-established and well underway and the same successful HealthSpring team that has led that process for many years continues to lead that process and we feel good about jumping off a strong base in the first 5 months of the year to establish those bids as well.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So you're not seeing the same increase in cost trends in Medicare Advantage that you were seeing in the Commercial side?","David M. Cordani","That's correct. And again, let's separate the 2. In Commercial, when we established the outlook for the year, we indicated that we were expecting for and priced for a gradual increase in medical cost trends throughout the course of the year and it's beginning to manifest itself in the second quarter. Within MA, we didn't plan for or expect for that same increase and it's not manifesting itself. In fact, we've been able to improve the Medical Care Ratio outlook. And so, Justin, you ask yourself the question, why might that be? Well, in part, as you know, in Medicare, inpatient plays a very pronounced role in the overall cost category. Inpatient is intact in Commercial. It's intact in Medicare Advantage but it's a larger part of the pie. Secondly, in the very successful HealthSpring model, as I indicated before, in excess of 60% of the block of business is in highly transparent physician partnership models meaning tightly aligned incentives, very sophisticated clinical management programs that continue to deliver great value for the individual Medicare customers in partnership with physicians. All of that's come together to deliver medical cost result in Medicare that's quite attractive right now and in line with our expectations.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ana Gupte with Sanford Bernstein.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So the first question is just to follow up on your commentary, David, earlier on Medicare. I think Humana specifically has reported agents and their scores being lower than the utilization and so the margin profile seems to be shifting more negatively. And then I'm hearing from other sources as well that the 65% to 75% cohort is less profitable than the 75%-plus because the risk floors have not been established. Any comments on that? And as you have your 81% to 82% Medicare MLR for this year, as you're looking in mix shift, star headwinds, the Affordable Care Act headwind possibly lower prior period, directionally, how do you see that playing out year-over-year into '13?","David M. Cordani","Ana, first, just kind of re-establishing the base for HealthSpring, number one, a consistent track record of delivery. With their focused execution, what you've seen in HealthSpring over time is that good growth but now it outpaced membership recovered life growth year after year. And I think that underscores the discipline in terms of getting the benefit design in balance with the premium and the revenue stream along with the physician partnership. As I noted earlier, just shy of 6% covered life growth with an industry average of 7%, a little lower because I'm not playing in the group MA space but continued profitable growth. We don't see a pronounced difference in the book of business. I would note that without the physician partnership model, there would be some erosion or some challenge in terms of the medical cost. However, there's a decade-plus of success with the physician partnership model and you're able to actually take some costs out of the equation to get the MLR to work. As it relates to the MLR, well, we noted a 50-basis-point improvement. We're pleased with that. If you take the current Medical Care Ratio that the portfolio is running at and you adjust it for all of the moving parts we expect to transpire as the dust settles with the Affordable Care Act, on average, the portfolio is running about where it needs to be. Of course, there'll be a little puts and takes by market and the HealthSpring team is taking that into consideration as they're positioning for 2013, and they're already thinking about the 2014 bid strategies. So overall, very strong performing block of business. No meaningful noise in the block of business thus far.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. So it sounds like the future model would be more tightly controlled primary care gatekeeper in Medicare to try to achieve the kind of margin sustainability going forward?","David M. Cordani","Yes. Ana, just slightly different words and framing, but directionally correct. And now when we say future model, you could assert that the HealthSpring model, all along, for the last decade-plus, has been that. So they've been playing to a subsegment of the market and playing there very successfully. And to your assertion, we believe your assertion is correct and the marketplace for that opportunity is going to expand. The slight difference I would say is it's not 15 years ago, gatekeeper model. It's more of a physician-directed model with care coordination, which looks and feels substantially different and those that have gone out and looked and felt and touched the model, it feels different. With embedded care coordinators in the physician practice, with different information in data flows, higher engagement in prevention, wellness, lifestyle management programs, for those who value that approach, it is high-quality, high-value, high-satisfaction. And to your point, we think the marketplace demand for that is going to grow and HealthSpring is phenomenally positioned for that.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","David, just switching gears, just on the cap deployment, you talked about $800 million in cash at the end of the year at parent. After HealthSpring, you did the supplemental deal on med supp, I think you guys have also mentioned individual as a potential area of opportunity. So as you're thinking about your other inorganic needs and then reflecting on Amerigroup and Bellpoint and possibly your strategy on duals, can you comment on how you're thinking about this going forward?","David M. Cordani","Ana, you're very efficient about getting many questions in. So just a few points. As Ralph noted, we're delighted to, now second quarter this year, increasing our outlook for capital available for deployment. We increased it by $100 million in the first quarter. We increased it by another $200 million this quarter. And after -- as Ralph noted, after paying for the pending acquisitions that we have out there, $800 million or $350 million additional capital available for deployment. Our broad targets and categories haven't changed. So our objectives for M&A have been to expand our global footprint on a targeted basis, secure leading seniors capabilities and we haven't actually stated individual, we've specifically stated retail capabilities because we think the marketplace continues to evolve into a much more retail-oriented market. And we're pleased to have secured the great American capabilities that take us more towards the retail space in the U.S., and be able to add that to our leading global Health, Life and Accident portfolio. So when we take all that together, we feel quite good about what's been secured and now having much more capital flexibility for deployment in the second half of the year and we're pleased in terms of how we're positioned. Lastly, as it relates to duals, we've been very consistent on duals. That priority 1, 2 and 3 for us was to secure a leading senior set of capabilities with a clinical program that is differentiated. We're pleased to have done so with HealthSpring and we've been consistent by saying after we secure that, we believe the dual and the high-risk Medicaid market is an attractive opportunity for us in our targeted geographies and we will pursue that marketplace. Clearly, HealthSpring's successfully served some of that market today and we will pursue that market on a geography-by-geography basis. Predominantly, either through HealthSpring's organic capabilities, what they have in hand today, or partnership, that's our preferred approach currently but it's to build off of the success that the HealthSpring model has.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Merrill Lynch.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just wanted to go back to some of the comments before about HealthSpring and how you're starting to leverage that. I think last quarter you indicated that the commercial opportunity was kind of a 2013 opportunity and group MA was 2014. But I think in the prepared comments, it sounded more like you're trying to accelerate things a little bit. Can you talk a little bit about what you're doing in Tennessee and Houston, and then comments about already launching sales efforts on the group MA?","David M. Cordani","Sure, Kevin. It's David. Your memory is correct. As we laid out the acquisition case, we talked about the meaningful opportunity beginning to unfold in '13 and '14, but our team was immediately at the ready and starting to get to work. So what we flagged in the prepared remarks is early progress. You should not read into the early progress to suggest that any of those items are going to move \u2013 demonstrably move our revenue or earnings contribution from the outset in 2012, but we're working at it, and we're working at it aggressively. So on the commercial side, to give you an example, what we've been able to do, dating back actually to May of this year, we were able to stand up a commercial solution in Houston, a marketplace where HealthSpring is quite deep and we have a broad portfolio, we were able to stand up a solution that uses HealthSpring's very successful and deep physician management model and deliver a revised solution for a large commercial employer who wanted access to that as they saw it as an opportunity to get even further enhanced clinical quality and care coordination and as a result, improve value and costs. That's an example of success. Similar approach in Tennessee. So 2 very deep markets for HealthSpring. Two very strong markets for Cigna, where we've already seen good inbound demand from clients around the solutions. Similarly, on group MA, this is a matter of reshaping solutions within the HealthSpring portfolio and proactively bringing them to market and creating awareness for our existing client base and per the prepared remarks, early interest is positive. So we're pleased with that direction and we want to be moving on this so we're able to step into '13 and '14 with some momentum.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that makes sense. And then, I guess, on the international side of things, obviously, the global economic outlook is a bit shaky right now. Are you seeing any kind of impact on that? Obviously, you reaffirmed your international guidance but just wanted to see if you thought that, that was having any kind of impact on any of your markets?","David M. Cordani","Kevin, it's David. Broadly, the answer is no, to date. A little more color on that, 2 large businesses there. First, the business for the globally mobile corporate and IGO clients. The globalization of the economy, that pace continues and the deployment of executives continues around the globe and our positioning is quite well-received in the marketplace. Secondly, the individual Health, Life and Accident business, key to success there is continued innovation and targeting specific solutions for specific buying segments. So you could argue it's a little harder in the case of a little bit of economic headwind. But to-date, if you look at our results, success remains in terms of retention, good customer relationship expansion and good new business adds.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christine Arnold with Cowen.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","As we think about 2013, you're pricing large groups now. Are you expecting a continued creep in medical trend or do you look at the professional and outpatient utilization and say, ultimately, we're going to see inpatient and we expect a leap rather than a creep in medical trend? How are you thinking about that going forward? And then my follow-up is could you talk about the ASO pipeline? It looks like the 50 to 250 continues to accelerate in growth but you had a spectacular growth year this year. How do I think about that ASO pipeline?","David M. Cordani","Christine, I think I'm going to take it in reverse order.  I'll speak to the ASO pipeline, give a little color on pricing and ask Ralph to expand on that. Specific to the ASO pipeline and you're referencing the select segment, so employers between 50 and 250 lives, we're delighted with the performance of that portfolio, simply stated. We've continued to build on the successful acquisition several years ago of Great-West. By securing that acquisition, we brought on some additional capabilities and we've targeted individual markets, driving those capabilities with further depth and the success continues. Throughout the residual part of this year, we expect to see continued momentum in the ASO Select segment and there's no indication that, that will abate as we step into 2013. Key to that is continuing to make sure we're innovative and delivering the right solutions to the right employer clients and evolving some of the clinical models but we're doing that very successfully currently. Just macro, as it relates to the pricing environment, as I noted before, a small percentage of our, if you will, risk business is out to bid for -- or the bids are out for 2013. As you very well know, the majority of our business is large or average case size. So again, the importance there is there's credibility to the individual case's medical experience. That's quite helpful in an environment that we operate in like today. So we're able to look at that benefit design, the changes in the benefit design, the underlying experience and then make case level decisions as opposed to aggregate, blended book of business decisions that you might have to do if your book was mostly under 50 or mostly under 100 life. And final comment as I hand it to Ralph is our medical cost performance in 2012 is in line with our expectations. So we're not seeing a spike that is broadly speaking outside of our expectations currently. Ralph, just explain a little bit around our approach to pricing for '13.","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Sure. Thanks, David. I think, first, just to reinforce the point, we have the benefit with the mix of our business skewed to the larger sized cases that we can take a look at those on a very case-specific basis. So calling the macro trend is important and as we set up our strategy for pricing, but most importantly is we've got good visibility to the clients and customers that we service. So that helps us a lot. As it relates to the trend itself, we would plan -- I'd say, still a lot more to learn and discern as it relates to what the trend might look like going into next year specifically. Because if you think about it, we're really only starting now to see some change in the trend, which we did plan for but we're only really starting to see some of that now. So we're going to be looking at that very, very closely. I would say though that our posture will be more, I'll call it conservative in the context of we want to be sure that we're pricing our business in line with medical care ratios that are essentially flattish to where we are. And so that will be our posture going in. We want to make sure that our margins are thoroughly protected. And frankly, where we could deliver a lot of value for our customers is on the -- not only just the base services but a lot of the other value-added things that we do in the specialty area as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carl McDonald with Citigroup.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","In the commercial risk business, you guys have seen stable to up enrollment this year. It looks like the PMPM yields first half of this year are basically equivalent with last year. So I'd just be interested in where you're seeing that stability to growth, whether it's coming from limited benefit or some of the more traditional risk products, given that a lot of the competitors are seeing some meaningful enrollment declines this year?","David M. Cordani","Carl, it's David. First, contextually, as you know, the risk portfolio is less than 10% of the overall franchise in terms of covered lives. There are puts and takes in the portfolio. And the one I would call out, we've been driving some targeted individual primary medical programs in the U.S. now over the last 2.5 years, and we've been driving targets in a subset of our Go Deep geographies, with the objective of learning and being in position well in advance of the 2014 exchange environment. And we've achieved our growth objectives over the last year and we're achieving our growth objective there. So you actually see growth in the individual block of business offsetting somewhat of atrophy in the employer block of business that's being offset with the ASO sales. That would be the trend I would give you for guaranteed cost.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","All right. And then a separate question on the Medicare business. I think it would just be interesting for people to hear some of the contrast for HealthSpring, particularly around new members. Since the comment was made earlier, Humana has talked about new members being less profitable. HealthSpring has historically said, not only are new members more profitable, they're substantially more profitable, at least in certain periods of time. And so as I said, it could just be interesting people to hear some of the reasons why you think that is?","David M. Cordani","Carl, it's David. So I guess the broad framing, I'm not going to speak about what others are experiencing, I'll clearly speak about what HealthSpring experiences. First and foremost, as I noted earlier, the HealthSpring team has had a long track record of being very disciplined in terms of how it establishes the benefit design in their targeted market. So we call it Go Deep, they'll call it targeted market. So very disciplined. And if you track them over time, good growth but not ebb and flow outpace growth. So that's data point one. I think when you cut to the core of your conclusion, which we agree with, in terms of the HealthSpring model actually being highly attractive to new members, largely, the reason is their physician partnership and clinical model engages an individual at a level that the industry, broadly speaking, doesn't do. And now you hear the buzz around accountable care organizations, et cetera. Well, they've been at it for over a decade. And what transpires is as a senior comes into the HealthSpring model, quite a comprehensive health assessment transpires and significant clinical coordination ensues with the individual or patient and their physician. And what HealthSpring does, HealthSpring enables that. They enable it with information, they enable that with financial incentives, and very importantly, they enable it with care coordination resources. So embedded nurses, embedded case managers, embedded health coaches. For some physician practices, actually taking real estate right next to the physician practice and having a healthy living center where the annual physicals are conducted and the health coaching sessions and the lifestyle coaching sessions take place. So Carl, when you take that picture together, you get out of the box with a well-positioned product design. And then as you get to your new customers on board, you're actively engaging them very importantly with their physicians and care coordinators, aligning the information, the financial incentives and the clinical programs, that's why the HealthSpring model has been able to deliver significant value for new customers. Part of that, it shoots back to the individual in terms of health, quality of life benefit coverage. Part of it goes back to the physician in terms of the financial incentives, only when the health status improves, and part of it has come back to HealthSpring and the shareholder. And that model is successful and we're seeking to grow it as fast as possible.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Windley with Jefferies.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to come back to the reserve study. I had in my notes that you had actually pushed your expectation for this to 3Q and so I wanted to see if that hitting in 2Q had the effect of rebalancing your earnings expectation or your earnings distribution for the year? And just particularly, kind of digging for, was it not upside to your -- was it included, to some degree, in your guidance and included in the second half and that's why the guidance is not going up any more than it is?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Yes, David, it's Ralph. Just regarding the timing, we didn't really move anything. I think the reserve study on disability, we perform in Q2, and that's been what we've done in the past and we do a more in-depth life study in Q3 and we'd expect to have that. So that's how we enter the year with our expectations of the work and we'll remain on track to complete the life study in Q3.","David M. Cordani","David, as it relates, to add on. As Ralph noted earlier, second part of your question was around the, I'll call it forward-looking earnings expectations. While there isn't an express number that we have relative to, for example, the disability reserve study in the second quarter, as Ralph noted previously to a question, with the consistent execution of the reserving process and our disability clinical model, what we've seen over the last couple years is positive reserve development, you noted there's a $2 billion reserve base. And we take into consideration the prior experience and we have a range built into our expectations. And what Ralph's noted is what was posted in the second quarter was in line with our expectations of what we thought would transpire in the second quarter. Hence, no change in our forward-looking outlook.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So then the other question that I had is around your technology investments that you called out a little more specifically in 1Q. Did those continue in 2Q? Are your \u2013 are the benefits of those still unchanged or still the same in terms of the amount? And do you also expect that amount to be realized -- or the amount that you expected to be realized in the second half of '12 to be the same?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","David, maybe specific -- I'll talk a little bit more specifically on the technology investments. But kind of step back to our overall operating expense ratio, we continue to be on track with the guidance that we have provided there on OpEx expenses for the year. And as we noted, on the technology side in particular, we were making some investments in the first half of the year. And in fact, I even noted in my remarks, we even took a charge related to a vendor contract in the quarter that was also related to some investments we're making in technology that will have benefits in the back half of the year and we are on track in the back half of the year there. So if you think about where we are then first half, second half, you'd expect to see the operating expense improvements from some of these efficiencies from the first half. And then also, we will make some investments in the back half of the year, particularly as it relates to getting ready for 2013 readiness. But overall, we are on track on our op expense ratio and the technology investments that we set out are also performing as we -- or on track to perform as we expect.","Operator","Our next question comes from the Melissa McGinnis with Morgan Stanley.","Melissa McGinnis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","On the $350 million, I think you said that you now expected to have in deployable cash and we've seen the company be quite acquisitive with some little acquisitions still very much aligned with your focus on senior and international. Do you still see other capability gaps or places where you want to bolster the senior platform or regions of the world where you want to bolster your International platform? Are we getting back to a place where we might see more robust reentry into those share repurchase market?","David M. Cordani","Melissa, it's David. First, what we underscored is we're pleased that we're actually able to increase our outlook in the first quarter for another $100 million of capital available for deployment, and then take it up another $200 million above that this quarter. So that's a very positive message. Broadly speaking, your recollection is correct, our inorganic priorities have been expand our global footprint, secure leading seniors capabilities here in the U.S., and then expand our retail capabilities. And those broad objectives remain and we'll be opportunistic with in-kind scale tuck-in acquisitions or leverage acquisitions. Broadly speaking, we feel great about having been successful over the last 2 years, securing what we wanted to augment the strategy. And we're well-positioned. Now we have the opportunity to be opportunistic, to the extent opportunities present themselves to either do further bolt-on our tuck-ins to our leading seniors capabilities, some further geographic expansion outside the U.S., but our geographic priorities remain intact there. So we feel quite good about what's in hand in front of us from an M&A standpoint.","Melissa McGinnis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And then can you also just update us, maybe some of your recent thoughts, as you started to get farther along in integration process with HealthSpring, how you're thinking about the pharmacy opportunity you might have with your PBM, now that you're controlling more drugs then?","David M. Cordani","Sure. First, broadly speaking, we noted that the HealthSpring, I'll call it integration, although it's a very light integration, is progressing quite well and we feel quite good about it. Specific to pharmacy, the pharmacy opportunity was a meaningful opportunity as we were able to secure the HealthSpring acquisition. First, to put the PBM in context, we've been quite consistent that our PPM is an important part of our clinical and service strategy. Secondly, a couple years ago, when there was a lot of activity in this space, we did a very comprehensive look at our PBM, and we concluded that our PBM was well-run, highly profitable and we had expectations that it would continue to grow. And the good news is we actually have grown it organically. Now to your point with having secured the HealthSpring acquisition, the scale of that asset is poised to grow if we so choose meaningfully. And therefore, that can create a lot of shareholder value. As such, we're stepping back, making sure we understand all the alternatives that are in front of us but the exciting part of that is any alternative is a meaningful step in shareholder value, as well as continuing the good value we're delivering to our customers. So we're excited about the opportunities there in front of us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Was wondering if you could give us an update on Texas Medicaid and what HealthSpring has been seeing down there in STAR+PLUS, and particularly in Hidalgo, given some of the issues raised by some of the other Medicaid peers?","David M. Cordani","Scott, we have a very small position in Texas and specifically in the county that you reference. Order of magnitude, think about less than 1% of the corporation's revenue and a de minimis part of the overall covered lives. Having said that, within that context, we're seeing some of the same pressure that the marketplace is seeing, that's fully contemplated in our earnings outlook and guidance, et cetera. There's a lot of interaction that's taking place with obviously the physicians but also the state, as the state understands the performance. And there's good directional progress with the states to rectify some of the issues as we go into the second half of this year.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And any sense on a rate increase there, David, both Molina and Santen [ph] had disclosed that the state and indicated they would be receiving rate increases. So interested if HealthSpring will be receiving one as well?","David M. Cordani","Yes, we expect to and it's an attractive one in the context of the undergoing medical cost to rectify the situation toward the latter part of the year. Think about the end of the third quarter beginning of the fourth quarter. So good continuity in terms of how the state is dealing with the various vendors down there and the -- everybody is aligned in terms of trying to get this program back lined up. Just important to underscore for you, Scott, it is a very small portion of the overall portfolio for us, number one. And it's secondly, the economics around that are fully contemplated currently in our guidance.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. Just going back to the launch of the group MA product and some of the HealthSpring markets. So are those the 2 markets where you've launched so far, Tennessee and Houston, or are there are additional markets as well? And then is there a way to size how many commercial retiree members you have in those markets right now, in terms of thinking about the upsell opportunity you might have in terms of moving commercial ASO members into a group risk MA product?","David M. Cordani","Scott, first, Tennessee and Houston were markets we called out actually for the commercial solution, so standing up a new commercial solution that takes the advantage of the very successful HealthSpring physician model. Those markets, plus a few others come into play as it relates to MA. I think it's early for that conversation for us. We don't see it as a silver bullet by any stretch of the imagination. Rather, we see it as another tool we're able to bring in for our team to offer our clients as they're working through, how do they deal with the significant challenges of their long-term retiree medical costs. And in those targeted markets where the HealthSpring portfolio delivers great value, we think we'll see good success going forward. Early interest is high but until there's meaningful runs on the board, we're not going to get overly excited, which is why when we did the business case and framed it for you, we said, think about this in the some contribution in '13 but really a '14 opportunity. And we expected actually to see some traction beginning to unfold on the commercial side in '13, a little earlier than that.","Operator","Our final question comes from Chris Rigg with Susquehanna.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Have you guys sized how much revenue you're buying for the $400 million? And can you give us a sense for possibly shorter-term profitability there or at least directionally, whether those transactions will be accretive next year and then just give us a better sense for how you sort of look at the longer-term returns on these investments?","David M. Cordani","Chris, I'll start with it. First and foremost, 2 different relationships. So one, you have about $100 million on the joint venture in Turkey with Finansbank. We have been very successful in our Health, Life and Accident business outside the U.S., heretofore, driving significant attractive growth with high margins, high returns supported by strong retention. We're quite excited about that opportunity. We launched our business in Turkey organically in 2011, so we have the organization on the ground. We have early traction relative to sales and this is really going to supercharge that and accelerate our growth curve meaningfully. Organically, it typically takes 4 to 5 years to break even in a marketplace. This will dramatically reduce that time and put us on a pretty attractive trajectory starting next year. So we feel good about that investment. The U.S. investment, in terms of the supplemental business, that is an expansion on strategy of our retail capabilities, our direct to individual capabilities and it really is going to build on our successful global direct to individual Health, Life and Accident portfolio, where we have been successful. Broadly speaking, both of these opportunities are profitable as we approach day 1. They will be accretive as we go forward. Clearly, the assumptions around what your base case is, we compare it to other alternative deployments of capital, in terms of share -- including share repurchase and the like. But these are on strategy and financially attractive opportunities for us.","Operator","I will now turn the call back over to Mr. David Cordani for closing remarks.","David M. Cordani","Thank you, all. In closing, I just want to highlight and reinforce a few key points from our discussion today. Our second quarter and year-to-date performance reflects strong revenue and earnings contributions from each of our ongoing businesses, reinforcing how our key differentiators resonate in our targeted markets. We accelerated our investments in high-growth customer segments and emerging markets with our announcement to acquire Great American Supplemental Benefits and a new joint venture in Turkey, helping us plant additional seeds for future growth. Our HealthSpring acquisition is performing well and we are on track. And the momentum we have created through the first half of 2012 provides us confidence to achieve our increased full year outlook for earnings and capital available for deployment.","We thank you for joining us on our call, and your interest in Cigna, and we look forward to continuing our discussion in the future.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Cigna's second quarter 2012 results review.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the question-and-answer session, is being recorded.","We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Will McDowell. Please go ahead, Mr. McDowell.","William McDowell","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I am Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom McCarthy, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks, today, David and Tom will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's first quarter 2015 financial results as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2015.","As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. Specifically, we use the term labeled \"adjusted income from operations\" and \"earnings per share\" on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com.","In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2015 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.","Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. As a reminder, beginning in 2015, we have simplified our guidance and disclosures for our Medical Care Ratios or MCRs by reporting them on a basis of total Commercial and total Government. The total Commercial ratio encompasses all of our commercial risk products, including medical, pharmacy, dental, stop loss and behavioral products, provided through guaranteed cost or experience-rated funding arrangements in both the United States and internationally. The total Government ratio includes our Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D and Medicaid businesses.","Finally, consistent with past practices, when we make any prospective comments on earnings or EPS outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future capital deployment or additional prior year development of medical costs.","And with that, I will turn the call over to David.","David M. Cordani","Thanks, Will. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today.","To begin, I'd like to read the highlights of our financial results for the first quarter. Next, I'll discuss how we are leveraging Cigna's integrated capabilities to engage individuals to help them optimize their health and well-being, and how this is translating into value for customers and clients.","Then Tom will provide more detail around our first quarter financial performance and update our full year 2015 outlook. And following your questions, I'll leave you with a few closing remarks.","Let's dive in with some highlights from the quarter. Cigna's first quarter 2015 performance represents a strong start to the year. We are pleased with our results, which extends our track record of attractive financial performance. Once again, our success was driven by the effective and disciplined execution of our strategy, which continuously guide our actions in a dynamic marketplace.","Our first quarter 2015 consolidated revenue increased 11% to $9.5 billion, with strong contributions across our business segments. We reported adjusted income from operations for the first quarter of $513 million or $1.96 per share. Our Global Health Care revenues increased 12%, driven by strong performance in our Commercial and Government businesses. Our Global Supplemental Benefits business, once again drove strong revenue growth in high single-digit after-tax margins, while we continue to make targeted investments in support of future growth, and we achieved 6% revenue growth in our Group Disability and Life business.","Overall, our diversified portfolio of businesses continues to produce significant free cash flow that further enables our financial flexibility with more than $500 million deployed for share repurchase on a year-to-date basis. Our continued focus and effective strategic execution are generating strong results, enabling ongoing investments in our business portfolio and helping us meet the unique local market needs through the right balance of affordability and personalization of our products and services.","As we've discussed previously, we have a clear framework to drive ongoing future value creation for Cigna. First, our diversified businesses are well positioned to create attractive value for our customers and clients and, as a result, differentiated revenue growth. Second, we are focused on targeted and effective capital deployment to create ongoing shareholder value through investments in our business, strategic M&A and share repurchase. Our businesses generate high levels of free cash flow, which give us financial flexibility and the opportunity to deploy capital to further create value for the benefit of shareholders. And finally, we continue to seek new and emerging opportunities to expand in new distribution marketplaces, new geographies and new buying segments.","Guided by this framework and coupled with effective execution, we continue to expect to deliver average annual revenue growth rate of 8% to 10% over the long term. This framework also positions us to support our focus on enabling health care over financing sick care, which is well aligned with Cigna's efforts to improve the current health care system.","The United States spends $3 trillion a year on health care. Studies consistently show approximately 25% of the total expenditures are wasted through inefficiency or breakage. At the same time, 50% of all adults have at least one chronic disease, conditions which translate to 7 out of the top 10 causes of death in the U.S.","In this dynamic environment, Cigna continues to convene key stakeholders to work toward a sustainable health care system. Health care stakeholders from individuals to corporate employers and government organizations are seeking a common set of core goals. These include maintaining or improving health and productivity, affordable and predictable cost outcomes and greater personalization of solutions and services. To meet these goals, we must continue to accelerate the transition from yesterday's view health insurance as a mechanism for financing the cost of illness to an orientation center around maintaining and improving the health and wellness of individuals. At Cigna, we are and we'll continue to make significant strides toward achieving a more sustainable health care system, by engaging with individuals and physicians through coordinated offerings and alliance incentives.","We have moved beyond the typical multi-product sales and services approach to engaging individuals and coordinate care at a very personal level, as we work to improve health and wellness, all by harnessing information, incenting and supporting individuals and partnering with physicians, the result of which is a service experience for customers that achieves the right balance of personalization and affordability.","I'd like to share with you a few examples of how we are leveraging the power of integration and coordination, with our broad solution suite, by encouraging maintenance and prevention among the healthy, providing coaching to the healthy at risk, enabling coordinated care for those with chronic conditions and facilitating access to centers of excellence for those with acute conditions.","Our health care professionals engage with customers and clinicians to improve health every day, leveraging the breadth of our clinical capabilities, which spans over 4,000 professionals from doctors and nurses to behavioral health professionals, health coaches and pharmacists.","Relative to our behavioral professionals, our capabilities include engaging with a cardiology team when a health event transpires, as we have seen a strong correlation between these types of illness and depression; engaging with our experts in disability programs to improve health and maximize personal productivity; and helping individuals recover from an injury by taking a more holistic view of mind and body. As for result, our customers are empowered by active coordinated care through coaching, support services and incentive programs. And the impact, Cigna clients with integrated offerings have 29% fewer mental health and substance abuse related outpatient visits and 8% fewer inpatient events compared with those without integrated offerings.","Another powerful example of our success, with our coordinated approach, is for customers who are expectant moms. In today's health care system, the cost of a premature birth is nearly 11x higher than that of a full-term birth, not to mention the impact on the family stress and, in some cases, lifelong health challenges. CIGNA's Healthy Pregnancies, Healthy Babies program engaged with customers to optimize health during pregnancy, by working with nurses who can assess risks; develop personalized care plans; and continue supportive outreach and coordination with OB\/GYN teams; and finally, providing coaching on newborn care. Active participation by expected mothers in our integrated program is key. In fact, for those who enroll, there is nearly 50% reduction in premature births versus the U.S. average. This is a huge impact for the family, the child and society overall.","The benefit of integrated and coordinated care is also impactful within Cigna's Specialty Pharmacy programs, where our pharmacists and clinicians engage with customers and health care professionals to improve the effectiveness of drug regimes to drive better overall health outcomes. Our engaged customers have higher medication adherence and lower specialty drug costs, resulting in a 15% lower overall medical cost versus individuals who do not have these coordinated offerings.","Our coordination also works with dental care customers, where there's a high correlation between periodontal health and improved health outcomes. In our dental programs, individuals with diabetes, heart disease or stroke, who have both medical and dental coverage with Cigna have seen higher health quality and lower medical costs. For example, patients with diabetes participating in our coordinated and dental programs saw lower average annual medical costs of approximately 28%, when receiving coordinated care. And for patients with heart disease, costs were low by approximately 25%.","As a final example across the U.S., our 4,000 plus clinical professionals continue to engage and help our customers in increasing numbers through a rapidly growing collaborative care relationships. Today, we have more than 120 of these relationships spanning 29 states. As for impact, more than 90% of Cigna's collaborative care relationships with at least 2 years of experience are seeing success in managing improved medical costs and nearly 80% with at least 1-year of experience are seeing success in total medical cost results or clinical quality measures. Examples of medical results include an improvement in blood pressure, an improvement in BMI and an improvement in total cholesterol levels. These examples reinforce our successful efforts to improve health and quality-of-life while working to remove cost from the system. By leveraging our integrated capabilities and coordinating clinical care resources for each individual through their health journey, we are improving affordability while creating a more sustainable health care system. Over the long term, we believe our approach to health care rather than sick care will promote better health, sustainability and economic vibrancy and lower the cost burden on customers as well as employers.","And this success translates to shareholder value as we leverage our capabilities and meet customer needs with products and services that are enhanced through our highly aligned coordinated offerings. This value is evidenced by our industry-leading medical cost trend over the last several years, high customer retention levels and strong growth in our specialty and integrated services that achieve the personalization of services outcomes that I previously referenced.","As demonstrated by our discussion this morning, our integration and coordination of care has moved beyond the simple multi-product solution. Today, we are engaging individuals in a very personalized way, leveraging actionable information, partnering with health care professionals and utilizing care resources that both reduce costs and produce superior health outcomes.","Now to summarize my remarks before turning it over to Tom. Cigna's strong start to 2015 continues our long-term track record of financial performance in delivering competitively attractive revenue and earnings and gives us confidence in our increased full year 2015 outlook. The strong free cash flow from a high return on capital and high-margin portfolio of businesses provide ongoing financial flexibility in capital management and deployment. We are effectively executing our strategy and creating value for our customers and clients by leveraging integrated capabilities that promote health care rather than sick care and driving improved personalization and affordability for the benefit of the individuals we serve. We remain committed to our long-term objective, which is to double the size of our business over the next 7 to 8 years, yielding an 8% to 10% annual revenue growth rate on average. And over this time horizon, we expect to continue to deliver competitively attractive long-term EPS growth of 10% to 13% annually on average, all while we continue to invest in our company's business portfolio. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas A. McCarthy","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will review Cigna's first quarter 2015 results and discuss our outlook for the full year.","We've had a good start of the year with strong revenue and earnings contributions across our diversified portfolio of businesses, driven by continued effective execution of our strategy.","The highlights in the quarter include consolidated revenue growth of 11% to $9.5 billion; consolidated earnings of $513 million; quarterly earnings per share of $1.96; and continued strong free cash flow with approximately $515 million returned to shareholders through share repurchase on a year-to-date basis. Overall, the strength of our first quarter performance provides us with solid momentum for the year.","Regarding the segments, I will first comment on our Global Health Care segment. Global Health Care results were solid in the quarter. First quarter premiums and fees grew 12% to $6.7 billion, driven by customer growth in our Commercial and Government businesses as well as specialty contributions and rate actions. We ended first quarter of 2015 with 14.7 million global medical customers, including approximately 200,000 new customers from our QualCare Alliance Networks acquisition. First quarter earnings were $444 million, reflecting medical and specialty business growth, continued effective medical cost management, improving results in our individual business with some offset from increased spending for strategic investments as well as higher seasonal costs in our growing Medicare Part D business.","Turning to medical costs. We continue to deliver medical costs that reflect better health outcomes and strong clinical excellence for our customers and clients as a result of our deep collaborative relationships with physicians and our focus on personalization of care. Our commercial medical trend result continues to be among the lowest in the industry. And given that over 85% of our U.S. Commercial customers are in transparent ASO funding arrangements, our clients directly benefit from these favorable medical costs.","Regarding medical care ratios, our first quarter 2015 total Commercial Medical Care ratio or MCR was 75.2% on a reported basis or 75.9% excluding prior year reserve development.","Overall, we are pleased with the results of our commercial risk businesses in the quarter, reflecting strong pricing, disciplined underwriting and continued effective medical management and physician engagement. Results in our individual business continue to improve in the first quarter and are in-line with our expectations.","In our Government business, our first quarter 2015 total government MCR was 89.4% on a reported basis or 89.9% excluding prior year's reserve development, reflecting continued good performance in our Medicare Advantage business, partially offset by seasonal costs from our growing Medicare Part D business. Across our Commercial and Government risk books of business, our first quarter earnings included favorable prior year reserve development of $25 million after-tax compared to the $30 million after-tax in the first quarter 2014.","Moving to operating expenses, for first quarter 2015, our total Global Health Care operating expense ratio was 21.7%, which reflects an expected increase in spending for strategic investments. Overall, we've had a strong start to 2015 in our Global Health Care business.","Now I will discuss the results of our Global Supplemental Benefits business, which continues to deliver attractive growth and profitability. Premiums and fees grew 8% quarter-over-quarter in global supplemental or 12% on a currency-adjusted basis. First quarter earnings grew 21% or 25% on a currency-adjusted basis to $69 million, reflecting business growth and strong operating expense management as well as some favorable operating expense timing.","For Group Disability and Life, first quarter premium and fees increased 7% over first quarter 2014, reflecting growth across the Disability Life and Accident product lines. First quarter earnings in our group business were $51 million, which include unfavorable claims experienced in our life insurance business as well as an expected increase in operating expenses.","For our Corporate and Other operations, results totaled to an after-tax loss of $51 million in the first quarter of 2015. Overall, as a result of the continued effective execution of our strategy, our first quarter results reflect strong revenue and earnings contributions from our ongoing businesses and significant free cash flow.","Turning to our investment portfolio. In the first quarter, we recognized net realized investment gains of $48 million after-tax, coupled with a strong net investment income result. The high quality and diversification of our investment portfolio continue to drive our overall investment results.","Now I will discuss our outlook for 2015. In 2015, we expect to continue to deliver strong financial performance for our shareholders by leveraging our differentiated capabilities to deliver affordable and personalized solutions, effectively deploying capital and targeting new and emerging opportunities where we will seek to drive additional value for shareholders. We continue to expect consolidated revenues to grow in the range of 8% to 10% over 2014.","Our outlook for full year 2015 consolidated adjusted income from operations is now in the range of approximately $2.12 billion to $2.21 billion or $8.15 to $8.50 per share. This represents an increase of $0.10 to $0.15 per share over our previous expectations.","I will now discuss the components of our 2015 outlook, starting with Global Health Care. We now expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of approximately $1.75 billion to $1.8 billion, an increase over our prior expectations.","I'll now summarize some of the key assumptions reflected in our Global Health Care earnings outlook for 2015, starting with our customer base. Regarding global medical customers, we now expect 2015 customer growth of 2% to 4%. This increase over previous expectations primarily reflects customers added through the acquisition of QualCare Alliance Networks, which was completed in the first quarter of 2015.","Turning to medical costs. In our 2015 -- our 2015 outlook continues to assume some increase in medical utilization versus current levels which has been reflected in our pricing. For our total U.S. Commercial book of business, we continue to expect full year medical cost trend to be in the range of 5% to 6%.","Now turning to our medical care ratio outlook. For our total commercial book of business, we continue to expect the 2015 medical care ratio to be in the range of 78% to 79%. For our total government book of business, we continue to expect the 2015 medical care ratio to be in the range of 84.5% to 85.5%.","Regarding operating expenses, we continue to expect our 2015 Global Health Care operating expense ratio to be in the range of 21% to 22%. Overall, we expect full year 2015 Global Health Care earnings to be approximately $1.75 billion to $1.8 billion.","The other components of our outlook are unchanged. For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we continue to expect strong top line growth in earnings in the range of $230 million to $250 million. Regarding our Group Disability and Life business, we continue to expect full year 2015 earnings in the range of $320 million to $340 million. Regarding our remaining operations, that is other operations and corporate, we expect a loss of $180 million for 2015.","So all-in, for full year 2015, we now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $2.12 billion to $2.21 billion or $8.15 to $8.50 per share. This represents an increase of $0.10 to $0.15 per share. I would remind you that our outlook continues to exclude the impact of additional prior year reserve development or any future capital deployment. While we do not anticipate the impact of future capital deployment in our EPS outlook, we continue to expect the additional free cash flow that we generate will be deployed for the benefit of our shareholders either through value-creating acquisitions or share repurchase.","Now moving to our 2015 capital management position and outlook. Overall, we continue to have excellent financial flexibility. Our subsidiaries remain well capitalized and are generating significant free cash flow to the parent, with a strong return on capital in each of our business segments. Our capital deployment strategy and priorities have not changed. These priorities are: providing the capital necessary to support the growth of our ongoing operations; pursuing M&A activity with a focus on acquiring capabilities and scale to further grow in our target areas of focus; and after considering these first 2 items, we'd return capital to shareholders, primarily through share repurchase.","Regarding free cash flow, we ended the quarter with parent company cash of approximately $1.3 billion, which includes approximately $900 million of proceeds from our recent issuance of long-term debt. These proceeds were subsequently used to redeem existing debt in the second quarter of 2015. During the period February 5 through April 29, we repurchased 3.2 million shares of stock for approximately $400 million, bringing our year-to-date share repurchase to 4.3 million shares for approximately $515 million. After considering all sources and uses of parent company cash, we now expect to have approximately $1.3 billion available for capital deployment during the balance of the year. Our free cash flow outlook continues to reflect the industry-leading margins and returns on capital in our businesses and a high level of capital efficiency, particularly from our fee-based businesses. This capital efficiency allows us to fund attractive organic growth while continuing to generate significant free cash flow to be deployed for the benefit of shareholders.","Now to recap. Our first quarter 2015 consolidated results reflect the strength of our diversified portfolio of global businesses and continued effective execution of our focused strategy. The fundamentals of our business remain strong, as evidenced by our first quarter results, which reflected strong revenue and earnings contributions across our diversified portfolio of businesses, industry-leading medical cost trends and high clinical quality and continued strong free cash flow. Based on the strength of these results, we are confident in our ability to achieve our increased full year 2015 earnings outlook.","And with that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I was hoping we could just drill into the Government MLR for a little bit and maybe just talk about first just on Medicare Advantage, how utilization trends looked in the quarter, and if you've seen any type of recent indications of any type of inpatient admission acceleration in recent weeks. And then second, just relative to the PDP MLR, just how that tracked relative to your expectations in the quarter. And clearly, given when there's outsized growth in PDP membership there's sometimes risk of higher MLR, so just interested in terms of what you're seeing around script trends and just around general performance in the PDP business so far this year.","Thomas A. McCarthy","Scott, it's Tom. So first, we're very happy with the position of our Government business. Our outlook for the Government MCR in 2015 reflects strong results in our Medicare Advantage business and some expected pressure in Part D, as you mentioned. The quarter-over-quarter increase, specifically in the Government MCR, is mainly due to Part D with continuing good Medicare Advantage results. As you pointed out, we reported significant growth in Part D customers in 2015. And as a result, we've had a more pronounced seasonal impact from Part D this quarter. These new customers have a period of time to transition from their previous formulary to our formulary. So as we expected, we saw some additional first quarter cost impacts. And all-in, we continue to expect our government MCR to be in the range of 84.5% to 85.5% for the full year, which we're happy with. As far as the outlook or the utilization outlook, we really didn't see any significant change in MA utilization in the quarter.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, and then just a quick follow-up. Just in terms of the cost trends view reiterating that 5% to 6% for the full year. Just interested if you could give us some flavor in terms of just in the first quarter itself and Commercial MLR looked quite favorable again. So just interested, do you have a sense of where you were sitting within that range in the first quarter.","Thomas A. McCarthy","Yes, Scott, well, we're really pleased with our medical trend results. And as we mentioned many times, we delivered a cost trend below 4.5% in 2014, building on a very strong track record we've had for several years, with industry-leading results. Our outlook for 2015, medical cost trends, 5% to 6%, does anticipate some uptick in utilization over the course of the year and some expected increase in pharmacy trends due to specialty drug costs. And commenting on the first quarter, we haven't seen the uptick in utilization, but we are seeing some expected pharmacy trend impact. So overall, we're comfortable, we're going to again deliver a competitively attractive medical cost trend in 2015.","Operator","The next question comes from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, I was hoping that maybe you could address what you're seeing in the marketplace in terms of middle-market employers and the extent to which there's interest in self-funding, if you've seen that accelerating, if you think that's going to continue and maybe on the larger end of that, what -- you're getting a taste of in terms of product preferences for 2016.","David M. Cordani","Matthew, it's David. As it relates to -- you used the term middle-market, so we'll talk about the regional segment. We define that as employers with 250 to 5,000 employees as well as large single-state employers. The broad theme, I would tell you, is that the market's appetite and interest in transparent funding and aligned funding, which include ASO, continues to grow. It continues to grow both in the regional segment. That has always been a meaningful portion but not the totality of it, but very importantly, as you move downmarket into the Select Segment as well. So point one is continued high and accelerating interest in transparent funding because it aligns incentives, it provides transparency and enables better functionality of the incentive alignment programs and the engagement programs we like. The second theme we see is continued elevation and engagement in we typically call them carve-in or specialty programs. We look at them more as a coordination of care programs. Many of the examples I cited in our prepared remarks. So those will be the 2 predominant trends we continue to see: elevation in transparent funding and then continued movement in what you might call carve-in, we call them coordination of care programs that are delivering the superior medical costs and quality outcomes that Tom made reference to a few moments ago.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. Just on a separate angle, if you don't mind. Can I just ask if you have any comments about the outlook for your PBM relationship, now that there's a change of control event coming with Catamaran and UNH.","David M. Cordani","Sure, Matthew. Just by way of backdrop, important to note that we continue to own and operate a very highly performing PBM for the benefit of our customers and clients, and that high performance is being demonstrated through continued growth in customer lives, strong medical trend in clinical quality performance. As you know, we further strengthened those capabilities about 2 years ago, with our expanded relationship with Catamaran seeking several features to strengthen, and we're seeing the benefit of those. As we've talked about that in the past, while we continue to own and operate our PBM, we maintain significant optionality and flexibility in that structure. And then, while we don't typically comment on details of transactions, we view that the PBM marketplace is and will continue to be very dynamic. As such, we ensure that there is adequate deal protections for us that gives us meaningful flexibility going forward.","Operator","The next question comes from Josh Raskin with Barclays.","Joshua Richard Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just getting back to the commercial -- I'm sorry the Government MLR. I'm just struggling to understand what caused the 290 basis point impact, like if you hold Medicare Advantage and Medicaid MLRs flat year-over-year, it implies the PDP was up 12 or 13 percentage points. It's just not big enough in terms of the growth there to make the difference. So when you think strong performance on MA, is that mean the MLR was down? Or just trying to understand a little bit more of the granularity there.","David M. Cordani","So, Josh, just to answer your last question, the MLR and MA adjusting for reserve development is flattish quarter-over-quarter. And in fact, the impact we're seeing in the Government MCR this quarter is largely due to PDP. And again, we're not going to get into the specifics of the loss ratio, but the PDP MCR is always highest in the first quarter, as you know, because of the benefit design and transition period for new customers. And this quarter, in particular, for us, given we have a significant new customer growth, the seasonality was higher than normal.","Joshua Richard Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","But I guess, Tom, I mean PDP was up 11%. The overall Government revenues were up closer to 17% or 18%. So you have to see -- when you say the seasonality, I guess why is that product changing? Or are you just saying that the loss ratio and PDP was higher?","Thomas A. McCarthy","Well, both. The loss ratio and PDP was higher, and again, we have a more significant mix of new customers, which is accountable for the loss ratio impact. Most of the impact is from the larger customer base and the transition period for the new customers. And we do expect to see the normal seasonal pattern with improved results over the balance of the year. We also get some lift from our agreement with Gilead. It was effective April 1 in Part D, and we have anticipated some modest cost pressure, as we've mentioned, including last quarter continuing for Part D in our outlook for the full year, but that was as expected and then it's reflected in our outlook.","Joshua Richard Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just switching topics a little bit, the public exchange accounts, like the individual businesses running a lot better and more in line with your expectations. Any comments on Reliance on the 3Rs, any change in your estimations for the 3Rs?","Thomas A. McCarthy","Well, first, a little bit on the performance in the business, and we're still in the very early stages. Results in the quarter did see some improvement both from the repositioning of our medical mix and the improved customer demographics, and we are seeing some targeted medical management actions that have lowered lost cost. So over the long term, we're still optimistic that we will see improved results and this will become an effective market segment. As far as the 3Rs are concerned, our accrual for the 3Rs in the first quarter was about $30 million after-tax. The majority of that relates to reinsurance, and we're continuing to accrue in line with the program parameters, and we didn't really make any material change in accruals for the 3Rs related to 2014 business, and we don't really see any significant adjustment to that until we get the final results from the government mid-year.","Operator","The next question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So first of all, maybe just to continue on the Medicare Advantage question. Obviously, we got final rates for 2016. Do you have any comments on that and also -- and what that means for you in terms of -- I know there's talk about average update of 1.25%, but each company has their own inputs, if you got a sense of where you guys would fall out on that.","David M. Cordani","A.J., good morning, it's David. So as we look to 2016, first, we expect to have a base that'll have approximately 60% of our customers in for STAR+PLUS plans, noting a step-up from the prior year. And we expect to think forward beyond '16 to continue to step that up. As it relates to the rate setting environment, the net effects for our mix of our portfolio is that the vast majority of our plans are going to have about a flattish rate impact from all the moving parts from CMS. With the exception of 2 of our plans that will have a meaningful reduction based on the risk adjustors and the accounting rebates, et cetera. The net result for our portfolio of that is, again, the vast majority of our business markets flattish, 2 with meaningful reductions weighted on an all-in base. It's about a 2% reduction. As we looked at taking it as a whole, considering our very well-positioned portfolio of coverage services and collaboratives, we feel like our businesses are in good position stepping into 2016, as such, we continue to expect to both grow customer base, again, stepping into 2016, as well as being able to expand margins stepping into 2016.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. And then maybe just a follow-up. I know you recently announced an alliance with SCAN Health Plan in California. I wondered if you might give a chance to comment on what you're hoping to do there, and what that opportunity might represent.","David M. Cordani","Sure, A.J. When -- and you used the term alliance, which I appreciate. We have a multiple examples of alliances with, in some cases, traditional competitors, not-for-profit competitors, for profit competitors and the like. This most recent relationship with SCAN aligns our very high-performing employer portfolio of businesses in California with their well-performing Medicare capabilities and enables us to deliver an employer-sponsored Medicare Advantage solution to employers that are on target for them, but we had distribution reach and lever their capabilities. So it's a wonderful example of playing to both organizations strength, enabling us to deliver an expanded set of solutions and capabilities on a more accelerated time frames than we would've been able to do organically and be able to deliver value for our existing clients and expand SCAN's relationship net win for both organizations.","Operator","The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess a couple of clarification questions. The commentary about the MA rate for 2016, was that including the Star pickup or before the star pickup?","David M. Cordani","It's net of all the moving parts, Kevin.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then on the individual commentary, I guess I don't remember, if you said it specifically or not, but it sounded to me like you're still expecting to lose money in 2015 on the public exchanges?","David M. Cordani","Net-net, as we've discussed before, Kevin, we look at '14, '15 and '16 as the version 1.0 of the marketplace. We built that business plans not around achieving the revenue or EPS significant contributions out of this book of business. As you know, we expect it to improve the performance of the block of business going from '14 to '15 that is taking place. So on a fully-allocated basis, there's a loss in the business, but is less than 2014, but we'd expect that to improve further as we step into 2016.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just -- at the beginning, you talked about some of the medical management capabilities that you guys are bringing. Some of them, like the preterm births, is really something that comes in pretty usefully in the Medicaid side of the business. I wonder if you feel like you guys are better positioned to participate in that side of the business, RFP-wise I have seen a couple of other companies, who haven't historically been in that market get more aggressive. How do you think about RFPs that seem to be coming up over the next couple of years?","Thomas A. McCarthy","Relative to the Medicaid space, we've been very consistent that we see opportunity in the higher risk or coordinated care dimensions of the Medicaid space, so we can call that the dual space and the various other high-risk portfolios. We have targeted examples of success to date, most notably in counties within Texas where we just -- we're recognized for an award of coordination of care with our behavioral and clinical capabilities. So we do see [indiscernible], we do see opportunities. It's highly geographically targeted in our Go Deep markets, and it's within those programs that enable significant coordination of care both engaging the individual and working with the clinical professionals. So we see targeted expansion opportunity over the next several years here.","Operator","The next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Can you give us a little bit of sense of why you did grow so much in PDP maybe kind of where it came from, if you could, at what percentage maybe was auto assigned and then just give us a sense of where it all kind of shook out relative to your expectation.","Thomas A. McCarthy","Ralph, it's David, at a macro level, the majority of our growth was not auto assigned, so the step function to highly targeted geographically, and the significant amount of work was done within the benefit-design configuration to target subsegment of buyers in key geographies. So as Tom noted, meaningful growth, but we expected it. We factored that into our guidance. We talked about it last quarter to acknowledge that there would be -- we recognize there's a transition of care window that largely spans the entire first quarter that transpired, but largely not assigned targeted geographies, targeting by segment and design products with that in mind.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, right. That's helpful. And then, can you just update us on where you sit on private exchanges? I know one of your customers recently moved and my understanding is actually that you retained a large percentage of the book. But can you talk about conversations you're having with customers and your opportunities there for sort of the existing as well as new opportunities?","David M. Cordani","Sure, relative to the private exchange marketplace, we continue to view this as a potentially attractive long-term market as it unfolds. As such, we've allocated leadership, significant resources to the portfolio of businesses here. We are currently positioned in the vast majority of third-party exchanges that exist in the marketplace up to and including, also having our own captive exchange. To date, the performance is generally speaking in line with our expectations, which we thought was a slower market transition than maybe some had flagged in the grand scheme of things. To date, we've seen some wins and losses in terms of our portfolios we've discussed before. As we stand here today, we have several hundred thousand lives when you span across our core medical and specialty capabilities as well as additional lives in the supplemental space. But it's in the early innings. We're positioned and we're evolving within the marketplace. And as you know, as our existing customers choose to transition, we have a brand positioning and a service proposition that tends to win us a lot of business in the choice marketplace. So performance in line with our expectations thus far.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's helpful. Just real quick and a follow-on to that. Just on the transition, if you have an ASO customer and they move to a private exchange and you retain that customer, ASO to ASO, is the profitability essentially the same?","David M. Cordani","It's varied, obviously, depending on the configuration, but you should assume that the way we are seeking to position ourselves on the exchanges is to ensure that our offerings enable us to have enough of the, we'll call it, coordination and specialty reach that I made reference to in my prepared remarks to be able to deliver differentiated value and not move back to I call it TPA administrator. So the simple answer is, it depends, because all the exchanges are not created equal. Our strong operating bias is the integration and coordination because that's where we deliver our step function value.","Operator","The next question comes from Christine Arnold with Cowen.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Thanks for your commentary on the Government segment. Can you give us the same kind of commentary on your Commercial segment? How did you track with respect to stop loss versus experienced rate versus guaranteed cost relative to from a year ago in your expectations?","Thomas A. McCarthy","Christine, it's Tom. So overall, the headline in the commercial segment is the commercial MCR is very consistent with our expectations for the quarter. Again, the headline messages the employer group business continues to perform very well, individual business continues to improve. Quarter-over-quarter, in particular, the MCR is about flat. That reflects the improvement in individual with some offset by business mix impacts. But again, within those businesses the MCR is performing as we'd have expected by product line. Then I would point out, we would expect some increase or some improvement from the increased health insurance fee, but I would point out that our mix has that impact smaller than most others.","Operator","The next question comes from Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So just first, the National Account selling [ph] can you give us some updates -- on your last call you indicated you had an elevated percentage out for bid this year based on the procurement cycle. So curious how that's progressing.","David M. Cordani","Sure, Andy, it's David. First just let me redefine our national health, as we defined it a bit differently than our competition. For us, it's commercial employers with 5,000 and more employees that span multiple states. So we exclude the large single-state commercial employers that's part of our regional segment. You have a good recollection. Year-over-year as we look back to last year, our pipeline was about equal to the prior year, but our -- portion of our book of business that was out to bid was elevated due to procurement cycles. As we look at the current cycle, looking forward to 2016 relative to the pipeline of new opportunities, number of cases is about the same. Average case size is somewhat elevated. So on a life-basis, but more lives to look out but then a similar number of cases. As it relates to the percentage of our book of business out to bid, the percent is back down because that procurement cycle that's moving through. So early in the overall sales cycle, a healthy pipeline of opportunities to look at, a reasonable percentage of our book of business is out to bid. We continue to be focused on retaining the right business and earning the right business that has engagement and incentive alignment, expanding our specialty capabilities as indicative of our continued ability to grow revenue and earnings in the space by delivering value to those clients that are on target for us.","Operator","The next question comes from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners.","Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Wanted to follow up on the question on the commercial loss ratio, just as far as, individual off-exchange on-exchange, the guaranteed cost and the stop loss. So I get it that it's in line with expectations. I think there was a lot of pressure on your off-exchange book last year. It seems like you've seemed to have traded with some of the membership is that coming from off exchange. And are you seeing the overall individual book negative but that book of business is kind of returning to profitability at this point?","David M. Cordani","So it's David. Let me just frame it a little bit relative to the individual. First, as Tom noted in the employer book, the employer book last year, this year continues to perform well and in line with our expectations. Within the individual book of business, as you very well know relative to us, it's small in the grand scheme of things in terms of covered lives. As it relates to the grandfathered and some of the transitional block, one of the states where we had a large grandfather block of businesses, a state where we don't operate on the exchange, specifically California. So we saw attrition relative to the grandfathered block stepping into 2015, which was in line with our expectations. We still maintain a mix of on-exchange and off-exchange business and that, taken as a whole, the loss ratio of our business, and therefore, the underlying performance of the individual business steps forward and improved in line with our expectations going from '14 to '15.","Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","And then on the guaranteed cost legacy book, have you seen margin expansion? Some of your competitors are very commercially focused. There's some really nice margin expansion. I'm just trying to get to the underlying metric here.","David M. Cordani","And, Ana, are you referencing individual or group?","Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Group, group.","David M. Cordani","Within our group block of business, as you know, we don't play in the small group employer. So you need to take the under-50 block and remove that from the way you think about us. Relative to the over-50 block of business, our performance was strong and remained strong in that portfolio of business.","Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","And then finally on stop-loss, is that trending flat or are margins coming in or expanding? You've seen a nice 19% growth in premiums there.","Thomas A. McCarthy","Ana, it's Tom, margins and stop-loss are just where we'd like them to be. So the result -- the performance in the book is good.","Operator","The next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Question on your strategy around M&A going forward. You're a little bit subscale to some of the other national account players, which you -- now you focus on some geographically concentrated markets as a way to compensate for that. But just some books of business likely to come up, one in particular, just the other day is being shopped. It's more of a broad book of individual business and there's some expectation that some of these smaller plans that are focused on certain geographies exchange base business that are going to come up for sale. Do you think some of those books will be interesting to you guys? And if they are, a lot of why they're up for sale would be that they're under pressure. And so the -- some of the business is underpriced. How would you react to fixing books of business that you see up for sale?","David M. Cordani","Peter, David. Let me give you a little color on M&A. You factored in many statements and questions there. So first, broadly relative to M&A. M&A continues to be a component of our value creation framework. So it's effective deployment of capital, strategic M&A is a component within there. Our priorities have been consistent in terms of where we see the ability to create step-function value, specifically smartly furthering our global footprint; two, expanding our MA and dual capabilities; three, expanding our retail capabilities; and four local tuck-ins. And we've had a successful track record of accomplishing targeted acquisitions over the last 5-plus years in line with our strategy. As it relates to your scale comment, we've chosen to redefine our orientation around scale to ensure that we have appropriate scale to have competitive cost structure from an administrative cost standpoint, which we have. We've been able to prove productivity gains year-in year-out and free capacity to further ongoing investment back to within the franchise. And then you come down to medical cost to your dialogues, and that's a very localized conversation and it's not a localized conversation at the state level. It's an MSA level, and increasingly, within our marketplaces, it's coming down to a sub-MSA level. So we're highly focused on key geographies and our ability to win and deliver value for our clients and customers. As related to appetite for future M&A, I mean, opportunities where we're very aware, engaged and highly focused. So as long as the transactions are on strategy relative to the items I talked about before. On a final note, I'm not going to speculate on how you would rehabilitate an underperforming book of business, but our organization has demonstrated the ability to deliver high performance within our targeted segments, and again, we see M&A as a forward-looking opportunity to create smart transactions and good shareholder value.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then, just it's on the Part D business, one further question. You talked about some of the higher MLR being from transition issues. Is your guidance going forward making the assumption that those transition issues are resolved in Q1? Or do you expect that to continue into Q2? And what if it -- if it isn't transition issues and you're not able to resolve it, will that impact your guidance and by how much?","Thomas A. McCarthy","Peter, it's Tom. I think that a little differently. This is the prescribed 90-day period for new members to stay on their old formulary, while they transition to our new formulary. So we would expect that to work itself through during the first quarter.","Operator","And the next question comes from Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just wanted to focus on the guidance for a minute, particularly in a Global Health Care segment. You raised by $15 million at the mid-point, but you had $25 million of TPD. I'm just wondering why the raise wasn't at least in line with the level of reserve development.","Thomas A. McCarthy","Chris, it's Tom. We're really pleased that we've been able to increase our outlook this early in the year. Again, we expect to deliver attractive growth and revenue earnings and EPS across the company and in Global Health Care in 2015, just as we have in each of the last 5 years. So really I'd see our revised outlook as just reinforcing our confidence that we're on track to deliver those results.","Matthew Coffina - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just with regard to the comments in the press release about the investment spending in the quarter, in the health care segment, was that -- that was expected in the original outlook just to be clear?","Thomas A. McCarthy","Yes.","Operator","The next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies.","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","On the operating expense guidance and ratio, I guess I'm just looking at your starting year toward the higher end of that range. Your trends tended to rise, intra-year, rise through the year in historical years, and you're mentioning some favorable impacts in, I think, disability this quarter -- excuse me, sub this quarter. So I guess, I'm thinking it should rise this year as well unless you tell me otherwise. So how do you see that trending over the balance of the year to hit that range that you provided?","David M. Cordani","Dave, it's David. So directionally first off, we knew the first quarter was going to have an elevated level of expenses. As such, on the last quarter when we talked about the first quarter pattern, we flagged that and it was called out, as mentioned, in the further questions as we looked at many of our strategic spend initiatives. Two, as you made reference to our outlook is to see that our operating expense ratio will show a year-over-year improvement as we have been able to demonstrate for many years as we look back and our organization is tightly aligned relative to that. So the performance of that will transpire a little differently into 2015 quarters as opposed to the prior quarters. But Q1 was known as an uptick. Our outlook is to see an improved expense ratio and organization is on track to achieve that.","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So if I can -- if you can clarify just a little further, would you expect the investments that you flagged in 1Q to then exit or evaporate in 2Q and it's a drop back down significantly and then turn back as it normally does? Or is it just a completely different pattern this year?","David M. Cordani","Yes, Dave, I wouldn't expect the strategic spending to decline over the balance of the year. I think what I'd expect to see is both a little different pattern of revenue and earnings to get to the result we've talked about.","Operator","The final question comes from Sarah James with Wedbush Securities.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","One of your peers recently indicated their discussions with employers suggest that there could be a step-up in conversions to private exchanges in the next 1 to 2 years. Are you hearing similar from your clients? And if you could share with us what percentage of your private exchange book is self-funded and what percent are new members to Cigna?","David M. Cordani","It's David. First, the dialogue with employers has been active around private exchanges, as it has been around consumer-directed engagement programs, et cetera. I think the broader picture here is that, employers of all sizes are looking for the higher value creation benefit strategies that are going to be sustainable for them. That's the broader dialogue. And private exchanges represent a tool that many employers are trying to explore to determine whether or not it is part of the overall portfolio. What we've seen, and what the market has seen is a relatively modest adoption rate of that toolset, but it's early on, as we've indicated, in the private exchange cycle. Two, what we've seen is a continued elevated performance of self-funded consumer-directed aligned incentive and coordinated integrated offerings. As it relates to our own experience within the private exchanges, to the second part of your question, the vast majority of those employers are in the self-funded space given the profile of what we operate in, but we have guaranteed cost lives there as well. We have integrated and nonintegrated lives, but again it's small in the grand scheme of things in terms of what we're seeing. And a portion of the lives we're seeing there are new to Cigna. Greater than 50% of those are transitioning from existing Cigna relationships carried over to the exchanges. But the important part is that it's still a small part of both the marketplace as well as our portfolio. Two, we've deployed significant resources to make sure we're in position on the various exchanges, including our own captive and proprietary exchange. And three, we seek to be very consultative with our employers to make sure they understand all the choices that are available to them.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","And as employers are evaluating their different options, you mentioned, within the high deductible plans or private exchanges, can you tell whether or not one is emerging as the more likely way that employers are trending, or if there's any difference in how they are trending based on employer size, whether they're not going towards the private exchanges versus high deductibles?","David M. Cordani","Well, Sarah, I think we could point to both the track record of actions as well as the emerging actions. So the more tangible track record of actions is that, employers of a variety of sizes continue to move toward the transparent funding, which includes ASO. That's a consistent track. Two, elevation of aligned incentive programs, whether they're consumer-directed, full-on CDHP programs or if they're coinsurance programs, coinsurance programs with aligned incentive models, those would be the 2 most tangible pieces I think you could point to. And then over the last couple of years, an emerging trend too, as I referenced before, carving in or even more adoption of integrated care programs that are coordinated to delivering the value back. But private exchange, if you will, trend again is still in the early stages and I wouldn't flag it as one where we would see the majority of buying behavior over the next 2 buying cycles. But as we're positioned, we're positioned for an elevation and volume should unfold.","Operator","I will now turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks.","David M. Cordani","Thank you. Just to conclude our discussion this morning, I'd like to reiterate just a few important points.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the question-and-answer session, is being recorded.","We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Ted Detrick. Please go ahead, Mr. Detrick.","Edwin J. Detrick","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I'm Ted Detrick, Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom McCarthy, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer.","In our remarks today, David and Tom will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's first quarter 2014 financial results, as well as an update on our financial outlook for full year 2014.","Now as noted in our earnings release, Cigna uses certain financial measures, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP, when describing our financial results.","Specifically, we use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and earnings per share on the same basis as the principal measures of performance for Cigna and our business segments. And a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com.","Now on our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2014 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of the risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note in today's earnings release and our most recently filed reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Now before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. First, beginning this quarter, in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement, we have combined the results of the Run-off Reinsurance, Other Operations and Corporate segments into one reporting unit called Corporate and Other Operations.","This change to simplify our reporting was enabled by Cigna's exit of the Run-off Reinsurance business in 2013. We have revised our prior period results to conform to this current presentation, and as a result of this reporting change, there is no change to our historical results.","On a separate point, please note that when we discuss the number of covered lives for our global medical customers, we will be doing so on a basis that excludes those individuals that were previously covered under Limited Benefits plans. As a reminder, we exited the Limited Benefits business as of December 31, 2013, due to ACA regulation.","And lastly, I would note that when we discuss our earnings outlook for 2014, it will be on the basis of adjusted income from operations. And in addition, our outlook for earnings per share for 2014 excludes the effects of any future capital deployment.","And on that basis, I will turn the call over to David.","David M. Cordani","Thanks, Ted. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call.","I'll begin today with a review of our first quarter performance and highlights of our financial results. And I'll offer our perspective on how we are anticipating and adapting to the ongoing evolution of the business environment. Then I will discuss how we are developing personalized and localized solutions that improve quality and affordability through Cigna's Collaborative Care initiatives. These actions ultimately translate into differentiated value for our customers and clients and, as a result, greater value for our shareholders.","Next, Tom will provide specifics on our performance and highlight our outlook for the year before we open the floor to your questions. After that, I'll leave you with a few closing remarks.","Let's get started with some highlights. The first quarter 2014 continues our track record of strong performance and begins a new year of delivering competitively attractive financial results. Our results this quarter once again reflects strong contributions from each of our businesses.","The first quarter 2014 consolidated revenues increased to $8.5 billion. We reported adjusted income from operations for the first quarter of $501 million or $1.83 per share, which represents a per share increase of 6% over a very strong first quarter of 2013.","Turning to each of our segments. In the Global Health Care area, we continue to drive strong results across our targeted markets. Our focus on continued high-quality clinical outcomes is driving favorable medical costs for our customers and clients, with the vast majority of our clients directly benefiting from these results through our transparent funding arrangements.","These outcomes are helping us grow and deepen our relationships with more medical customers globally through a combination of retaining customers and continuing to add new ones.","In addition, our first quarter results also underscore the good progress we have made on our remediation efforts to address the claims pressure in our U.S. Seniors business.","Our Global Supplemental Benefit business continued its strong performance as we capitalize on our differentiated marketing and distribution capabilities in our targeted geographies.","In our Group Disability and Life segment, our results reflect strong performance and business growth in the midst of an improving but still challenging economic environment. Overall, this quarter's results were once again driven by our focused strategy, effective execution and differentiated capabilities that create value for Cigna's stakeholders.","Our performance for the first quarter gives us confidence that we will achieve our increased 2014 outlook.","An essential element of Cigna's sustained ability to deliver strong results in this dynamic and rapidly changing environment has been our focused strategy of Going Deep, Going Global, and Going Individual, which allows us to effectively target subsegments of the market where we can create competitively superior value for customers and clients based on our differentiated capabilities. We do this around the world, fueled by our global footprint, which is unique in our industry, with operations in more than 30 countries and jurisdictions.","As part of our Go Deep strategy, we place a continued emphasis on localizing our initiatives in our global markets, harnessing analytics and the customer insights they generate to deliver products and services that are personally relevant and adaptable to the unique needs of our target customers and clients.","We do all of this in close consultation with clients and distribution partners and in collaboration with our health care delivery partners. Cigna's ability to work collaboratively to help to improve health outcomes and reduce costs is of critical importance as many systems around the world remain challenged.","Highlight the magnitude of the opportunity in the U.S., recent studies, including those from the Institute of Medicine, have shown a majority of the patients are not receiving evidence-based clinical care. And nearly 1\/3 of all medical costs are spent on unnecessary services that do not improve health outcomes.","Research also indicates that positive health outcomes are stagnating, while costs increase due to a singular focus on volume that puts tremendous pressure on the entire health care system.","At Cigna, our emphasis on collaboration and personalization of care has driven us to create a model that encourages the highest levels of quality and affordability through aligned incentives with our physician partners. Our approach combined these aligned incentives with specific actionable information and care extenders, including health coaches and case managers, to provide individualized local support.","Given our proven success in collaborative arrangements with large physician groups, in the first quarter, we announced an expansion of our value-based initiatives to better serve a large subset of our customers with high-risk conditions and complex needs, who seek care from small physician groups as well as hospital facilities.","We have also expanded our collaborative programs to include targeted specialist groups, where our focus is on 5 specialties to compromise -- comprise nearly 60% of all medical spending, such as oncology as well as obstetrics, where our advanced Healthy Pregnancy, Healthy Babies program enables more full-term natural deliveries and helps mothers and babies stay healthy during pregnancy as well as following birth.","Our latest analysis shows that our most mature Cigna Collaborative Care arrangements have delivered quality performance and total medical costs that are superior to market averages. For example, we are encouraging these urgent care facilities and offering extended office hours, which helps reduce unnecessary emergency room visits by up to 50%. We have closed 21% more guests in care, thanks in part to our embedded care coordinators who helped with prescription adherence and work to ensure continuity of care for our customers. And one of our initiatives recently demonstrated a diabetic compliance rate, which is over 20% better than market average.","Today, the scale of our efforts is significant. These programs encompass more than 1.3 million customers in 31 states, with over 63,000 doctors, including more than 24,000 primary care physicians and nearly 40,000 specialists.","Our commitment to affordable and superior health outcomes for our customers and the ongoing innovation we continue to drive is one of the key ways Cigna continues to deliver differentiated value and ensure superior competitive positioning for the future.","As we look ahead, we recognize we are operating in a dynamic global environment, characterized by existing and emerging disruptions that create formidable business challenges as well as opportunities.","As we have discussed in the past, Medicare Advantage programs will face disruption. We believe our strong U.S. Seniors footprint and leading physician engagement capabilities positions us for a long-term success in this growing segment.","While global markets remain fluid, our focused strategy, differentiated capabilities and competitively differentiated global footprint positions Cigna for sustained long-term growth. For the full year 2014, we are confident that each of our business segments will deliver continued growth.","In addition, our businesses are producing strong returns on capital, giving us the flexibility to create additional shareholder value through capital deployment opportunities. Taking these items into account, we remain committed to our long-term average annual EPS growth target of 10% to 13%.","Now to briefly summarize my remarks before turning it over to Tom. Cigna's strong financial performance during the first quarter marks another quarter of competitively attractive earnings and revenue growth and provides a strong start to 2014. Our strong balance sheet and high levels of free cash flow give us flexibility to deliver additional shareholder value.","In this disrupted environment, Cigna is leading through change, ensuring that our customers, clients and shareholders will benefit from the value of our differentiated capabilities and focused strategy execution. Within that environment, we have demonstrated proven capabilities with our physician collaboratives to deliver outstanding clinical and affordability outcomes.","And now I'll turn the call over to Tom for a more detailed look at our results and outlook. Tom?","Thomas A. McCarthy","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will review Cigna's first quarter 2014 results and discuss our outlook for the full year.","We've had a very strong start to the year, driven by continued effective execution of our strategy, with significant contributions from each of our business segments.","Some key highlights from the quarter include consolidated revenues grew to $8.5 billion, driven by continued growth in our targeted markets. Consolidated earnings were $501 million. Quarterly earnings per share were $1.83, representing growth of 6% over the first quarter of 2013. And free cash flow was strong, and we returned $650 million to shareholders through share repurchases on a year-to-date basis.","Overall, the strength of our first quarter performance provides us with solid momentum for the year.","Regarding the segments, I will first comment on our Global Health Care segment. Global Health Care results were strong in both our Commercial and Seniors books of business. First quarter premium and fees for Global Health Care grew 3% to $6 billion. This reflects continued good growth in our Commercial business, partially offset by the expected reimbursement reduction in our Seniors business and our exit from the Limited Benefits business.","We ended first quarter 2014 with 14.2 million global medical customers, growing by 90,000 customers.","First quarter earnings grew 3% to $439 million and were driven by revenue growth and specialty contributions, as well as favorable medical costs across both our Commercial Employer and Seniors businesses.","Turning now to medical costs. As David indicated, we continued to improve health outcomes for the benefit of our customers, driven by engagement with physicians and value-based solutions for our customers and clients. Our commercial medical cost trend continues to be among the lowest in the industry. And given that 85% of our U.S. Commercial customers are in transparent ASO funding arrangements, our clients directly benefit from these favorable medical costs.","Regarding medical care ratios, in our U.S. Commercial Guaranteed Cost business, our first quarter 2014 medical care ratio, or MCR, was 76.1% on a reported basis or 78% excluding prior year reserve development.","Our Guaranteed Cost results reflect continued favorable medical costs within our Employer business. Overall, we are pleased with the results of our commercial risk businesses, which continued to reflect strong pricing, disciplined underwriting and continued effective medical management and physician engagement.","In our Seniors business, our first quarter MCR for Medicare Advantage was 82.7% on a reported basis or 84.1% excluding prior year reserve development. First quarter Medicare Advantage results were better than expected, with good early progress on the network and medical management actions we discussed last quarter to improve medical costs for our Seniors business.","Across our Commercial and Seniors risk books of business, our first quarter earnings included favorable prior year reserve development of $30 million after tax compared to $48 million after tax in the first quarter of 2013.","Moving to operating expenses. For the first quarter of 2014, the total Global Health Care operating expense ratio was 21.9%, which reflects the impact of the industry fee, which added 110 basis points to the expense ratio in the quarter, as well as efficiency gains and some favorable timing impacts. To recap, we've had a strong start to 2014 in our Global Health Care business.","Now I will discuss the results of our Global Supplemental Benefits business, which continues to deliver attractive growth and profitability. Premiums and fees grew 13% quarter-over-quarter for Global Supplemental. First quarter earnings were $53 million, reflecting strong customer retention, business growth and effective operating expense management with some modest claim pressure in South Korea.","For Group Disability and Life, first quarter results were strong, with premium and fee increases of 7% over first quarter 2014. First quarter earnings in our group business increased to $67 million, driven by business growth as well as lower benefit and operating expense ratios.","For our Corporate and Other Operations, results totaled to an after-tax loss of $58 million for the first quarter of 2014.","Overall, as a result of the continued effective execution of our strategy, our first quarter results reflect strong revenue and earnings contributions from each of our business segments, as well as continued significant free cash flow.","Turning to our investment portfolio. In the first quarter, we recognized net realized investment gains of $27 million after tax, coupled with a strong net investment income result. We continue to be pleased with the quality and diversification of our investment portfolio.","Now I will discuss our outlook for 2014. We expect to continue to deliver differentiated value for our customers and clients and strong financial performance for our shareholders in 2014. We continue to expect consolidated revenues to grow in the range of 4% to 7% over 2013.","Our outlook for full year 2014 consolidated adjusted income from operations is now in the range of approximately $1.93 billion to $2 billion or $7.05 to $7.35 per share. This represents an increase of $0.20 per share at the midpoint over our previous expectations. Consistent with past practice, our outlook excludes any contribution from additional capital deployment and any additional prior year reserve development.","I will now discuss the components of our 2014 outlook, starting with Global Health Care. We now expect full year Global Health Care earnings in the range of approximately $1.61 billion to $1.64 billion, an increase over our prior expectations. This increased outlook for Global Health Care primarily reflects first quarter favorable prior year reserve development, strong execution in both our Commercial Employer and Seniors businesses, with some offsets from the current outlook for our U.S. Individual business and the spending pattern of operating expenses for the remainder of the year.","I'll now summarize some of the key assumptions reflected on our Global Health Care earnings outlook for 2014, starting with our customer base. Regarding global medical customers, we continue to expect 2014 customer growth of approximately 1% to 2%.","Turning to medical costs. Our 2014 outlook continues to assume some increase in medical utilization versus current levels. For our total U.S. Commercial book of business, we continue to expect full year medical cost trend to be in the range of 5% to 6%. This strong medical cost trend result delivers value for our customers and clients across our broad array of funding types.","Turning now to our medical care ratio outlook. We are pleased with the performance of our overall Commercial Guaranteed Cost book of business, particularly the Commercial Employer component of our Guaranteed Cost book. As a result, the MCR outlook for the -- our employer book remains unchanged. We are, however, increasing our outlook for our U.S. Individual book of business MCR based on our early view of results.","Taken together, the 2014 medical care ratio for our U.S. Commercial Guaranteed Cost book of business is now in the range of 81% to 82.5%. For context, while our U.S. Individual business is growing in 2014, it will approximate 3% of enterprise revenues. As a result, we continue to expect the impact of the -- of this business will be manageable within our overall diversified portfolio. For our Seniors business, our Medicare Advantage MCR for 2014 continues to be in the range of 84% to 85%.","Regarding operating expenses for 2014, we continue to expect our total Global Health Care operating expense ratio to be in the range of 22.5% to 23.5%. We expect the operating expense favorability that we saw in the first quarter to be offset over the balance of the year by increased spending on strategic investments and some expense timing impact.","Overall, we expect full year 2014 Global Health Care earnings to be approximately $1.61 billion to $1.64 billion.","The other components of our outlook are unchanged. For our Global Supplemental Benefits business, we continue to expect strong top line growth and earnings in the range of $195 million to $215 million.","Regarding the Group Disability and Life business, we continue to expect full year 2014 earnings in the range of $305 million to $325 million.","Regarding our remaining operations, that is, Corporate and Other Operations, we continue to expect a loss of $175 million for 2014.","So all in, for full year 2014, we have increased our outlook for consolidated adjusted income from operations to a range of approximately $1.93 billion to $2 billion or $7.05 to $7.35 per share. This represents an increase of $0.20 per share at the midpoint, building on a strong 2013.","Now moving to our 2014 capital management position and outlook. Overall, we continue to have good financial flexibility. Our subsidiaries remain well capitalized and are generating significant free cash flow to the parent, with a strong return on capital [indiscernible] of our business segments.","Our capital deployment strategy and priorities have not changed. These priorities are: providing the capital to support the growth of our ongoing operations; pursuing M&A activity with a focus on acquiring capabilities and scale to further grow in our targeted areas of focus; and after considering these first 2 items, we would return capital to shareholders, primarily through share repurchase.","Regarding free cash flow, we ended the quarter with parent company cash of approximately $475 million. During the period February 7 through April 30, we repurchased 5.4 million shares of Cigna common stock for $425 million, bringing our total year-to-date share repurchase to 8 million shares for $650 million.","After considering all sources and uses of parent company cash, we now expect to have approximately $1.25 billion available for deployment during the balance of the year. This represents a $100 million increase compared to our previous capital outlook.","Overall, our financial position and capital outlook remains strong. The high returns on capital from our businesses, coupled with our strong balance sheet, means that we will continue to generate significant free cash flow to deploy for the benefit of the shareholders.","Now to recap, our first quarter 2014 consolidated results reflect the strength of our diversified portfolio of global businesses and continued effective execution of our focused strategy. The fundamentals in our businesses remains strong, as evidenced by our first quarter results, which reflected attractive growth and revenue earnings, favorable medical costs that directly benefit our customers and clients and continued strong free cash flow.","Based on the strength of these results, we are confident in our ability to achieve our increased full year 2014 earnings outlook.","With that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First question, just relative to the improved HealthSpring results in the first quarter, can you talk about how that broke down between seeing less claim severity possibly relative to the back half of the year, what you're seeing just in terms of general utilization trends at MA and then compare that relative to the actual company-specific initiative that you put in place to help improve results? So really looking at sort of how much was the broader environment as compared to the company-specific initiatives that you've now been putting in place.","David M. Cordani","It's David. I'll give you a little color there. First, to headline, we're pleased with the results and the progress that the first quarter demonstrated. When we take a look at the results to highlight a few items, one, clearly, the fourth quarter of last year matured favorably versus expectations. So that contributed to reported results, but it also contributed to a jump-off. I'll come back to that in a moment. Secondly, we're seeing some positive impact in the first quarter relative to our own performance from the contributions of the benefit positioning we've put in place for 2014. And third, specifically, we are seeing an impact of some of the target remediation efforts we embarked upon, whether it's the targeted recontracting in key markets, some network optimization or some additional focused medical management activity. So I would suggest that from our point of view, we're pleased with the results, and the results we're demonstrating here are primarily driven by own actions. Stepping back, a little bit more color. Year-over-year, what we know is the flu season was less severe in the first quarter of '14 than it was in the first quarter of '13. So that's an industry event. And finally, at least from our point of view, given the markets we operate in, as best we can understand, we did a de minimis impact to the weather from an overall operation. So maybe a little bit less utilization in the first quarter tied to the flu. The rest of it is broadly driven by some of our actions.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, got it. Then just the follow-up question, just following up on Tom highlighting that you're increasing the MLR expectations for the Individual business. Just if you can walk through some more color on that and just interested in how much of that is affected by what you're seeing on the exchange and expectations in terms of profitability there as compared to in the existing Individual business and, I guess, relative to some of the unexpected policy changes that developed over 2014.","Thomas A. McCarthy","Thanks, Scott. It's Tom. First, before we get to the specifics under Individual, I do want to step back and remind you that we're still very happy with the overall fundamentals of our risk business. They've been strong in the quarter and have been for some time reflecting the disciplined pricing and underwriting and strong clinical management and physician engagement capabilities. And in case you missed it, we are not changing the MCR outlook for our Employer business. All of the change in our Guaranteed Cost to MCR outlook does relate to Individual. A few points to make here. Our early claim experience for this business and a cautious view on recoveries from risk adjusters in risk quarters has caused us to increase our view of the Individual MCR for the full year. So that really is the driver, some caution seen in the early claims experience and uncertainty about what the future looks like. I'd also point out to you that while Individual is a small portion of our overall business, it represents a growing share of our Guaranteed Cost business. It's about -- now about 25% to 30% of our total Guaranteed Cost business. So again, the uncertainty on the MCR outlook and the growing share of the overall Guaranteed Cost book is what's caused us to increase the GC MCR. And I would also remind you that in the context of our overall company, Individual is still small, representing about 3% of our total revenues.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And, Tom, just to clarify, the early experience where you're seeing some of these higher claims, that's on the new exchange lives that are coming in?","Thomas A. McCarthy","I'd say it's the new ACA lives, so both ACI-compliant policies on exchange and off exchange.","Operator","The next question comes from Josh Raskin with Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just, Tom, could you quantify the favorable operating expense? I think you mentioned the timing impact. Just want to see exactly what that was and what the impact on the quarter was relative to expectation.","Thomas A. McCarthy","Yes, Josh. I don't think I want to get into the specific timing. We have a few things going on in expenses in the quarter. First, we kind of have the ramp-up over the year of strategic spend. So I think you know we're launching our duals project in Illinois. We've got the India launch in Global Sup. We also have timing of some IT portfolio spend and the -- some specific timing on hiring ramp-up that we might have over the course of the year. If you look at the impact of the favorable results in the quarter, it's pretty evenly mixed between the medical cost, the expense savings and the continued strong revenue contributions from our businesses.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, [indiscernible] quantification. And then could you talk a little about private exchanges? I mean, did you guys see anything in terms of net gains or losses in the first quarter in 2014, any of your customers sort of discussing the opportunities for private exchanges? I know you guys have your own initiatives in-house? I'm just curious, did you -- were you guys sort of net winners or losers on private exchanges? And where do you think that goes this year?","David M. Cordani","Josh, it's David. Well, let me give you a little color. First, just to frame our view of the private exchanges and then I'll tell -- I'll get right to your -- the heart of your question. As we've discussed in the past, we view that the private exchange environment is still in the early phases of adoption and clearly may create a very attractive sustainable marketplace for time to come, leveraging some retail purchasing environment and transparency. A little color to think about in terms of as you know, there's a lot of different private exchange models. So retiree versus active, single carrier versus multi-carrier, highly localized versus broader rating areas, employer remaining involved versus employer not remaining involved and lastly, pooled funding versus transparent funding. To date, our experience is around our participation in many of those models, including our own proprietary exchange. Today, our target clients have continued to reinforce a desire to stay engaged, have more personalization and localization and maintain more transparent funding arrangements. The net of all of that, through our experience, has been de minimis, meaning puts and takes, wins and losses, relatively small volumes and a relatively small net movement within the portfolio. Important in your question is around dialogue. There's a lot of dialogue because this is a new mechanism. So clients and prospects are wanting to learn more in terms of what are the value creators both in year 1 as well as sustainability of the value creators, and we're actively engaged in those conversations. But I think the important headline is heretofore de minimis impact to our business in terms of the net puts and takes.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And, David, is there actually been more specific, I was looking more on the active employees. So I don't know if there's sort of puts and takes, you're doing better on one, retiree versus active? Is there a difference between those 2 platforms?","David M. Cordani","Yes, I appreciate the clarification. Net-net, no. The aggregate puts and takes for our organization, again, whether I look at the retiree environment, whether I look at the active medical, whether I look at the specialty components, it's all netting to a very small number right now. Having said that from my comments, you should take away that we're active in engaging in multiple as the models, and we're active in kind of exploring additional value creators for the benefit of clients and customers. But to date, both active and retiree is relatively small.","Operator","The next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just want to go back, the 100 basis point increase in Guaranteed Cost MLR seems pretty large in the context of how small your just sort of Individual book is. And if it is coming from exchange, it would obviously suggest significantly higher costs there. So hoping you can give us more details on the risk of business that you brought on or the people that are signing up much sicker than you would have expected, age cohorts, if you have that detail or if it's your sense that across the board, just the population that's on the exchanges just were soft across the board relative to just your existing book.","David M. Cordani","Ralph, it's David. Let me try to give you a little bit of color. Just 2 sets of comments: one, put the size in context; two, the early experience. So when you think about the size, as Tom referenced earlier, is Guaranteed Cost represents a smaller portion of our overall portfolio. And we look at Guaranteed Cost going into 2014. As you know, we have the impact in terms of lives of running off the Limited Benefit business. So the aggregate number of lives and Guaranteed Cost decreases and then the growth in the Individual business. And Tom referenced, while the Individual business is about 3% of our enterprise revenue, it's in the 25% range of the guaranteed cost environment. As it relates to the early experience, a comment in terms of 2 waves of buyers that we see: the early initial buyer group and then the latter surge that the press talked about in terms of wave 1. What we know is that in the early buyer group, on average, that buyer group was older than our expectations. They bought a bit richer benefit plan than our expectations, so what was still the nucleus, but it's a bit richer benefit plan. And their medical utilization in the first month or so of experience was much higher than any of the -- our book of business norms, including some categories of severity around that. What we also know is that in that second wave or the latter surge of buyers, that population is younger than the initial population and more in line with our age expectations. Two, they bought leaner benefits on average than the first group and a bit more in line with our expectations. What we don't know is what the utilization is because they just signed up very recently. And as Tom pointed out, within our outlook, we took into consideration our early experiential set and projected that forward with some reasonability in terms of our overall outlook, and the most important thing here is that it's manageable in the aggregate context of our overall organization.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, okay. That's helpful. And then want to go to sort of hep C cost in the quarter. I think you have some details there what it was last year, what are your projections, I guess, around that for this year and then maybe how you're attempting to control it.","David M. Cordani","Sure. Just a little context and then specific to my experience. First, I think it's important to recognize that specialty pharmaceutical costs have been and continued to be a major trend and cost driver. As far as our internal processes, we project specific medical trend for specialty pharmacy, taking into consideration what we know about existing drugs, utilization patterns and, importantly, what's in the emerging pipeline. And while Sovaldi was not specifically broken out as a trend item for Sovaldi, our experience in the first quarter suggested our trend assumption for specialty pharmacy is in line with our overall aggregate experience, including the Hep C experience. Lastly, very important to note from our point of view, to achieve the right AAA outcome of clinical quality, service quality and affordability, you have to be able to manage the medical experience, the pharmacy experience and the specialty pharmacy experience, so the overall whole person could be managed with the right physician engagement. Specific to our financial results, when you think about the guaranteed cost in the Medicare population to the nearest $10 million or so in the first quarter, it's about $10 million for us, the rate of growth was accelerating throughout the quarter, and we've taken that into consideration, our full year outlook that Tom made reference to and still is considered in our medical trend outlook, which has not changed at this point in time.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Just on the ASO side, though, you customers there, what can you do, I guess, to control it at that point from that side of the business as oppose to an issue for you all, specifically?","David M. Cordani","Sure, and I appreciate the clarification. Important to note that in terms of our clinical programs, clinical engagement within our company, in general, we don't differentiate the way we actively engage physicians for an ASO customer versus an experienced rated person with a guaranteed cost customer. The clinical guidelines, clinical efficacy guide set. So the same level of active management with the physicians around that patient population, understanding medication compliance, alternative treatment categories and active management take place. And again, to date, while an acceleration of cost specific to that drug, our overall specialty pharmaceutical trend is, generally speaking, in line with our expectations. And our overall medical trend, as Tom made reference to, remains in line with our expectations. So the same active management takes place regardless whether or not it's an ASO client, a shared risk client or a guaranteed cost client.","Operator","The next question comes from Justin Lake with JP Morgan Chase.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First, a follow-up on the Medicare Advantage book. Looking ahead to 2015 bids in June, can you tell us if you expect to try to bid back to mid-single-digit margin target that you've typically discussed for the current low-single-digit you're expecting for 2014?","David M. Cordani","Justin, it's David. Macro level, not helpful to publicly discuss our bid strategy and margin objectives. To give you a little bit more color than that, first, stating the obvious, the improvement we're experiencing in the first quarter of medical cost performance, as well as the favorable maturation of the fourth quarter, is obviously directionally helpful in our journey. Secondly, as you referenced, our long-term margin objectives are not the margin performance that we are experiencing in 2014. That's clear. So as we set our expectations, you should expect it on a, obviously, market-by-market and on a very precise basis to seek to ensure that we are positioning a benefit program that is differentiated and attractive, while balancing a fair return, and we would like to see a step forward in terms of our performance as we go into '15 and then '16 and beyond. So, directionally, yes, but as for specifics, we're not going to comment in terms of what our margins objectives are for 2015 at this point.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And then just a couple more follow-ups on this Individual segment. First, it sounds like you guys are taking a cautious look at the 3Rs and specifically, Tom, you talked to the -- I want to ask you about the risk corridors. Given the government discussion of budget neutrality here, can you tell us whether you feel comfortable booking a receivable in places where you are into the risk corridor because you have negative margins?","Thomas A. McCarthy","Yes, Justin, again, as you kind of did pick up, we are taking a cautious view on the 3Rs. Now that specific accounting question, we'll get to that someday. But right now we haven't incorporated any impact for risk adjusters or risk corridors and given the uncertainty and the dynamics, we're not really expecting any significant impacts for the year. So I don't think that's going to be a key issue.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And so what kind of margins are you expecting in Individual?","Thomas A. McCarthy","Justin, your question, for 2014 or long term?","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","No, '14, I'm sorry. So what are you now kind of embedding in guidance for individual book?","David M. Cordani","Justin, we didn't obviously break out the margin specifically. To give you a little bit more color, as you recall from our -- let's go back to the strategic positioning here. We said we would take a very focused position, we've positioned ourselves in 5 states, in a limited number of markets in those states. We suggest very consistently that we did not expect that this will be a profit driver or a positive profit contributor before the year started. That's where we stand today, even acknowledging the bit of margin pressure that Tom made reference to. And we think it's appropriate at this point in time to take a cautious view of the component of the 3Rs, which may present some softening opportunity on a go-forward basis, but our current first quarter performance does not contemplate that. And important part is how do we position ourselves for 2015 as we go forward. As we sit here today, our bias is to extend into a few additional markets, we know which markets those are, we haven't made the final calls there, but we have a high level of engagement with physician and hospital partners who would like that expansion, and we're making that assessment. So clearly, taking into consideration our current experience, we still have a bias to extend, but we haven't declared that at this point in time.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I'm sorry, just one clarification. You're expecting to lose money in the Individual market for 2014?","David M. Cordani","It is correct, and that is consistent with our expectations before the year started.","Operator","The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just wanted to understand the guidance a little more. It seems like the raise in the guidance on the commercial side is kind of less than the PPD that you saw in the quarter. And if you adding in the share repo in PPD, the guidance raise looks to be entirely related to value and there was additional outperformance in the quarter. And, guess, maybe Individual is just a little bit worse, but just trying to understand what the delta is more specifically.","Thomas A. McCarthy","Sure, Kevin, it's Tom. So first, again, stepping back, there are a lot of positives in the first quarter, and we do expect they will continue to provide positive momentum for the year. We have continued solid execution of our strategy, we have the good growth in our targeted markets, we have strong medical cost management, leading to lower-than-expected medical cost in both commercial and seniors and disciplined expense management, resulting in favorable operating expense. So all good things. That said, it is early in the year. And while we're pleased with the positive result for medical cost in the quarter, we're really not ready to project that, that will continue favorable for the full year. Our outlook does, as we've talked about, include some caution regarding Individual results as the early stages of that market are unfolding. And as we've also referenced, we have some timing impact to offset in the first quarter operating expense favorability, including a ramp up of strategic spending over the course of the year. So on balance, that lets us do the outlook we've offered. And overall, we're really pleased with the start for the year and confident in that full-year outlook.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And I guess, maybe, in response to one of the questions earlier, David mentioned that the favorable development in the MA book kind of give you a better starting off point than maybe you thought kind of entering the year. Can you just go back to what you now know about Q4? Talk about what really -- what is the issue and how much of a variance it was versus your expectations as you enter 2014?","David M. Cordani","Sure, it's David. So a little bit more color there. What we did see is, as we play back the tape, in the latter part of Q3, we saw some elevation in cost. We saw that play through in the early portion of Q4, and we represented that as we went through the year-end activity. The good news is that as the latter part of Q4's claim experience matured, that matured more favorably than that spike that transpired in the latter part of Q3 and the early part of Q4. Secondly, that abatement continued into the first quarter of 2014. And finally, some of the very targeted actions that we begin to execute, whether they were re-contracting, network optimization, also started to make contributions in the first quarter. All net-net positives. And as Tom said, at this point, we're not ready to declare kind of a full projection on a go-forward basis. We're really pleased with the jump off, we're really pleased with the favorable development in the fourth quarter and we're very pleased with the net performance in the first quarter.","Operator","The next question comes from A.J. Rice and with UBS.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","First of all, if I just might ask for an update on with respect to the PBM, the integration with Catamaran, are you -- how's that -- any update on that and where you're at relative to the -- getting ready for the selling season this year and what are your expectations for the PBM selling season?","David M. Cordani","A.J., it's David. Just a moment of backdrop and then specific to your question. Our PBM is well-positioned, strong performing assets. We've been able to demonstrate that our approach to the market around integration, medical and pharmacy, delivers a very positive, both clinical outcomes, service outcome and affordability. The actions we embarked upon to further strengthen our cost of goods sold, secure an innovative technology platform and accelerate our innovation cycle, because of that, are going to be net adds to that. The headline is we're tracking very positively to our expectations. Secondly, good marketplace receptivity from clients in the overall marketplace, relative to both our current value proposition, as well as our enhanced value proposition as we see in the marketplace. You'll note that we had some slight growth in our pharmacy business in terms of net covered lives, again, which we're pleased with. But we're optimistic that, that momentum, obviously, continues on an go-forward basis, and we're on track with our expectations.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And I might just come back to the Sovaldi question in a different way. I guess, with your ASO membership, obviously, they're holding that cost themselves, you're working whether to try to mitigate that. At a time when people out there telling them, \" Hey, join the private exchange, give up that, go back to fully insured.\" Is -- give us some flavor for whether this is creating confusion among that self-insured base at this point. Are people -- or is it creating any kind of disruption that might further that push to private exchanges from your perspective?","David M. Cordani","A.J., it's David. So taking the intent of your relative to using Sovaldi as a cost driver and a cost driver putting affordability pressure. At the end of the day, I think you hit a really important macro theme here, which is there's a fundamental affordability challenge societally, whether the client or an employer is financing it, an individual is financing it and as we see whether or not governmental entities are financing it. So what we see, to your point, is clients are more open and active than ever to explore solutions that can demonstrate really significant value in terms of improving clinical quality and more sustainability of cost. To date, as we've demonstrated, we've been quite successful in terms of being consultative, working to put the right benefit design, incentive and engagement capabilities in place, wellness programs, specialty programs, network designed with our collaboratives and then offer a variety of funding alternatives. So you should envision, A.J., that in many cases, our consultative selling-- sales force offers more than one way to finance a benefit program and consults with our clients to be able to make a choice. We think more of that consultation will take place in the future versus less, and employers will continue to choose what works best for them. What I don't think is, I don't think Sovaldi or Hep C, as an example, is a binary trigger to make a client do something very different with their benefit programs. It raises awareness that doing the same thing over and over, if you're not getting a positive result, is probably not going to yield a positive result next year. And we're pleased with the fact that our clinical quality is strong, we've yet to deliver another year of outstanding medical cost performance relative to any industry benchmark, and that comes from being consultative, engaging the client, working differently with their individual customers and working differently with the physicians, and we think more of that will come in the future.","Operator","The next question comes from Carl McDonald Citigroup.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","First question is on the guaranteed cost business. If I look at the enrollment and back out the individual growth, it looks like the, we'll call them, group guaranteed cost, was down about 10% sequentially in the first quarter. So can you just walk through what you're seeing there, if that's aggressive pricing, if that's ASO conversions, and any other factor?","David M. Cordani","It's David. Just at a more macro level, as I referenced previously, when you look at the year-over-year, first and foremost, of the guaranteed cost block, historically, it's been a smaller portion of our overall portfolio of businesses, 8% to 10% of our covered lives. Two, as we step into 2014, we're rolling off the Limited Benefit business, which was a guaranteed cost portion of the pool. We have a, I'll call it, a well-performing employer book, as Tom made reference to, book of business, and then we have a growing individual block of business. So that's the guaranteed cost, if you will, from a slide standpoint. Overall marketplace, we continue to see a high level of receptivity for some of the more transparent funding alternatives within the employer space. ASO, ASO with Stop Loss, assured returns. And then finally, importantly, in a segment that is historically valued, both guaranteed costs and otherwise, what we call the Select Segment, employers between 51 and 250 employees, we regularly offer guaranteed cost side-by-side with ASO Stop Loss, and we continue to be successful there with both programs. However, a bit greater than 50% of the new business sales there and ramping up beyond that are ASO Stop Loss. So market trend, more transparency. Two, changing our book of business with the run-off of the limited benefit business, replaced with growth of the individual block of business, and a, I'll call it, a somewhat stable, in terms of aggregate lives, well-performing group insurance block of business that we have in our portfolio today.","Thomas A. McCarthy","And the dynamics that have been impacting our guaranteed cost business, are as David has suggested, the dynamics of which programs customers are choosing. Keep in mind, we don't have really any play in the small group market segment, which seems to be where the commentary around intense price competition has been coming up. And the segments we're playing in, the pricing environment continues to be pretty rational.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","All right. So my down 10% figure adjusted for the Limited Benefits. Taking from your comments that you're saying most of it is conversions to ASO, then?","Thomas A. McCarthy","That's in the ballpark. Conversions is a tricky word, right? I can't -- this is a segment that has -- the lower end of this segment has a lot of turnover, so I'm not sure whether it's all conversions from risk to customer to ASO in that segment. It's more, as the new customers are coming in, they tend to be buying ASO programs more than they have in the past.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then the other question was just, if I take -- again, focusing on health care, if I take out the guaranteed cost in the Medicare component, it looks like the loss ratio on all of the other products experienced, rated, Stop Loss, et cetera, was about 500 basis points better, sequentially. The fourth quarter loss ratio was inflated versus what you've been historically. But just the question is, is the first quarter loss ratio in the other segments a sustainable number for the rest of the year?","David M. Cordani","Yes, again, Carl, as we talked about last quarter, there's a lot of things in that residual component of loss ratio calculation. But I would highlight, as we said last quarter, the results last quarter were somewhat of an anomaly, and that all the businesses reported on in that group of products have been performing pretty well for us. So I'd say, the performance we've seen in the quarter, we'd expect to be consistent. Whether that ratio moves around, as mix of business changes, it's a little hard to know how that would play out over the course of the year, but we were happy with and continue to see good performance in those other product lines.","Operator","The next question comes from Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So your India [indiscernible] officially began to find products in the country recently. Maybe, how is that relationship is developing? Maybe how should we think about the long-term earnings contribution from the interim, national markets like India, Turkey, et cetera. Do you continue evaluating new market entries, or are you still focused on increasing footprint penetration in your existing market?","David M. Cordani","Andy, it's David. So relative to the global marketplace, thinking about 2 major marketplaces we compete in, and then I'll address India, Turkey and the like. One is, we call it, the Global Employer marketplace. Historically, for expats, for corporations, IGOs, NGOs, that business, we currently serve truly globally around the world, and we have customers, individuals we service across the globe, that business continues to grow very attractively. We have the largest delivery network in the world in terms of supporting those individuals on behalf of our clients, and we'll continue to grow that. Secondly, within that business, increasingly, we're hearing from some clients within key geographies where they have critical mass, a desire for some, I'll call it, health improvement and productivity improvement programs. So think about the employer businesses global across all geographies. The business that you're referencing is our direct individual supplemental benefit business. Two markets that we sought to enter strategically were the ones you referenced, Turkey and India. Turkey, we are successfully selling and has been successfully selling now for some time. And we're pleased with the direction of trajectory there. India, very exciting. We completed all the regulatory reviews and approvals, and in the first quarter, we actually began selling products and services there. We view India as a long-term attractive, very attractive growth opportunity, both for the individual business, as well as for clinical services. For example, India has the highest percentage of diabetics in the world and it is a major burden for the social mandate and were viewed as being part of the solution within that. Finally, as it relates to additional geographies, there are some additional geographies that are attractive to us, but most importantly, within our portfolio today, our existing markets, plus India and Turkey, present a very nice growth profile, and we will systematically identify new markets that are attractive to enter as we go forward over the next few years.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And then just a follow-up on something else here I have to clarify. What are you now expecting for exchange enrollment, including the March and April surge we saw, and how does that compare to your expectations? Are you now expecting exchange enrollment to be kind of above your initial expectation?","Thomas A. McCarthy","So Andy, it's Tom. I'll give you some context on the overall Individual block. So by the end of the year, by the end of 2014, we'd expect to have about 290,000 customers in the Individual segment. About 40% of those customers will be on ACA policy and about 60% will be of the legacy non-ACA policy. So a combination of early renewals or keep your plan states. And of the ACA policies, we'd expect about 60% to be on the exchange and 40% to be off the exchange.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And how does that compare to your kind of original expectations heading into the year?","Thomas A. McCarthy","A little bit.","Operator","The next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Looking at the reinsurance and recoverables, it was up from $150 million both sequentially and year-over-year to $250 million. So that really sort of helped out your performance a little bit. Can you talk about why that improved, why you have so much more in reinsurance recoverables. I know you said you didn't book anything for risk adjusters or risk corridors, so I'm kind of curious what drove that.","Thomas A. McCarthy","That reinsurance recoverable -- this is Tom, that reinsurance recoverable number is a function of some of the business we seeded off. And you might recall the run off reinsurance business has some market value sensitivity to the reported financial statements. So that really is largely just readjusting the seeded amounts based on market performance. There's really nothing going on there. And the impact of the 3Rs on that is nonexistent at this point.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And that was tied to the medical claims payables. So you're still leaving the runoff reinsurance have impacted that? Just from the claims payables line stated $1.9 billion.","Thomas A. McCarthy","I thought you were asking specifically about reinsurance. So medical claims payable, again, that's just regular operating activity. There's really medical reserves are up at the end of the quarter, no surprises in that result.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Actually, there were $1.9 billion, both sequentially and...","Thomas A. McCarthy","You take that to another digit, it would actually be up, it's actually up almost $100 million, I guess, if you take it the one to the next digit. So again, so that means it was like 1850 going to 1950 or in that ballpark. So again, if you look at the days claims payable, they're up. If you look at the -- if you had the specifics of the dollar balance are up, there's no issues in the -- we still feel very comfortable with our reserve position in all of our businesses.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then can you talk a little bit about your 2015 selling season, and what you think will be different from 2015 relative to 2014 in terms of the number of clients available or the number of the business moving and what clients are looking for at this point?","David M. Cordani","Peter, it's David. Early in the cycle, so I'll give you some directional comments. As it relates to the 2015 selling season, by way of purchasing dynamic, we continue to see those clients that we both serve today, as well as prospects, very aggressively addressing incentive and engagement-base program designs. That could be a coinsurance program with an incentive pool attached to it. It could be a consumer-directed program, but a whole variety of way to use incentive and engagement-based tools. Secondly, much more active utilization within consideration around health coaching and advocacy, health advocacy services, including an increasing appetite for on-site health coaches, something we do very well. And then third major theme is in terms of increase in specialty carve-in demand. So some of the themes that we put specialty carve-outs, we see some direction in terms of more integration. As it relates to volume from a pipeline, early indicators relative to the, we typically call the national account pipeline, let me just define that, because we define it differently. So it will be commercial employers with 5,000 or more employees, that's the way we define it, it's a little bit different than the market, that are multistate. Early indications for that pipeline is inbound opportunities, outbound opportunities, no major macro change in pattern there, decision-making cycle, a little longer because of the complexity of some of the benefit attributes I just talked about today, and we would expect to have a net market competitive positive performance as our strategic direction go into 2015.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And what about on the smaller group and select size? Do you see them looking more at public options and things like that or exchange options?","David M. Cordani","Yes, It's quite early to talk about 2015 for the smaller group. Remember, we don't play under 50. In the Select segment, which is 51 to 250, we're in the heart of the 2014 selling season everyday, and will be through the second quarter and the third quarter. As it relates to the makeup of our book of business, we have a high percentage, even in that book of business of clients who value what I referenced before. They're actively engaged, using incentives, we have examples of 75 and 100, 125 [ph] employers that are using on-site biometrics, health engagement, et cetera. So we don't see dramatically a lot of demand for public exchange within our target subsegment there. But important to note, we're in the heart of the 2014 selling season within that portfolio as we sit here today.","Operator","The next question comes from Ana Gupte with Leerink.","Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Yes, just to follow-up on some of the question on your commercial book of business. It looks like the big growth right now is happening in Select, where you've grown almost 15% on membership, Stop Loss is growing 20%, I'm assuming there's a lot of correlation between that. And finally, in Individual, where you're talking about, this year at least, having some headwinds to profitability. The rest of it looks flattish, which is actually better than maybe some of the competitors there are reporting in some cases. So if you look at that book and the growth rates, how do you think about de-risking in and do you expect to keep that level of growth within those markets, specifically retention and growth in select? And then how would you grow your Individual book by making it more profitable?","David M. Cordani","Ana, it's David. I think overall, you painted a picture of the various segments. So starting where you started. Our Select segment, which is, again, employers with 51 to 250 employees has been and continues to be a very attractive growth segment for us. Within that segment, we sell guarantee cost and we sell ASO with Stop Loss. Typically, in a highly bundled fashion with our specialty products and services. And we're somewhat agnostic, meaning in terms of providing the choices for clients and giving them the financing options that works best for them. Our growth in that segment, we're very excited about and pleased with, comes in an environment where our team is consultative and working to design benefits that are positioned for those specific employers. And historically, this segment has not have a lot of choice. This segment has had prepackaged guaranteed cost alternatives only and is tired of confronting an environment of a sustainable medical cost trends. So we see this as a continued growth segment for us and it's one we're quite excited about and we're comfortable with the risk profile here. As it relates to the next segment that you inferred about but didn't speak specifically about, the regional segment, which we define as a large segment of our book, so 251 to 5,000 employees, I mean, large single-state employees. That business has grown and grown competitively and attractively year-on-year, and we expect that throughout the residual portion of the year, we'll demonstrate some growth there. Finally, to your point, in the Individual segment, we have a little higher growth, a little higher growth than we expected. It is not profitable. We did not expect for it to be profitable in the first year, very important. We did not plan for it to be profitable and we view that, that was manageable within our portfolio, and we expect to, on a very pinpointed basis, channel the market learnings and the evolution of the market as we position that portfolio for 2015. So net-net, for the enterprise as a whole, we actually like our positioning coming out of the first quarter this year with good growth, good revenue performance, good specialty penetration, strong medical cost performance that positions us for this year, and then stepping into 2015.","Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","So what you're saying is that your competitive strength continues and the likelihood of any shift to public exchanges, particularly into the lower end of the market is at this point?","David M. Cordani","Yes. And Ana, I would just pinpoint 2 comments. Again, knowing that we don't play in the under 50 market; and two, the target clients on a very specific basis. So I'm not speaking for the entire client universe between 50 and 250. I'm speaking towards, in our core markets and for the clients we are targeting, we continue to see high receptivity for the active engagement programs as evidenced by our growth, as evidenced the our strong net retention, as evidenced by our market-leading medical cost trend, and within that, as long as we continue to deliver value, we see good opportunities in the future.","Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Now on the International, which is the other growth segment, and I think you talked about Turkey and India. But just on the core growth, it looks like the U.S., both Korea and the China JV you are growing, overall you had good revenue growth, you saw some margin compression, I think you made some commentary about claims cost in Korea ticking up and some retention initiatives and so on. And you alluded to some pressure in the fourth quarter of '13. Is this a structural margin compression story, or is there any pricing or other action you can take to get the margins back up? And would the normalized growth rate of 7% to 14% that you've guided to potentially go at the upper end or even higher, 2015 and beyond.","Thomas A. McCarthy","And it's Tom. So first, again, stepping back, we continue to get good results in our Global Supplemental Benefits business. We have great revenue growth in the quarter, very consistent with our expectations. And the earnings in the quarter were actually also consistent with our expectations. We have a little bit of a tough quarter-over-quarter comparison, given the strong results we reported in 2013. But this business is performing as we'd expected. We're continuing to make investments to expand the business. We already talked about India, we've got some investments in new distribution sources. You pointed out Korea. Our Korean operations continued to perform pretty well. We did have that higher seasonal claim pattern that we report at the end of 2013 that did continue into early 2014, but now it's back to normal levels at the end of March. So I think, overall, we're pretty happy with the positioning for this segment and comfortable that it's going to be a good segment for us with fast growth.","Operator","The final question comes from Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just, David, you had talked about sort of 2 waves of sign-ups with regard to the ACA's compliant plans. Can you give us sort of a sense of the pace of the sign-ups when you sort of finished up with the wave 1 and then moved into the wave 2, just might help with some context around the change in the MR outlook.","David M. Cordani","Sure, Chris. As I think about the wave 1 of business that came on, known and is being serviced in the first part of the quarter. So came through, obviously, the entire fourth quarter of last year, but the wave that we were servicing in the month of January. Then think about a pretty meaningful low in terms of the wave, obviously, lives are coming on with a significant surge coming in the March and latter part of March timeframe, whereby, we know the profile of those individuals, as I referenced, younger, than the original group. We know the benefits they purchase by medical category, leaner. We know some kind of risk characteristics to that group better than the first group. What we don't know is the utilization pattern in the first quarter results we're talking about here. But we would point toward a better risk profile than the first group. So think about bucket 1 on-board, being serviced, throughout the fourth quarter, small, additional growth throughout the quarter, and then a big surge toward the latter part of the quarter enrolling literally at the end of the quarter or going into the April timeframe","Operator","I will now turn the call over to David Cordani for closing remarks.","David M. Cordani","Thanks. To conclude, I'd like to emphasize a few key points from our discussion this morning. Cigna's first quarter results were strong and with meaningful contributions from each of our business segments. Our results are driven by the continued effective execution of our focused strategy, which reflects the commitment and dedication of our more than 35,000 colleagues working around the world. By aligning our capabilities with the goals of our customers and clients, we are improving the health, well-being and sense of security of the people we serve around the globe. We're confident in achieving our increased outlook for the full year of 2014, and we remain committed to achieving our long-term average EPS growth of 10% to 13%.","Thank you for joining us this morning and for your continued interest in Cigna, and we look forward to continuing our discussions in the future.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Cigna's first quarter 2014 results review.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the question-and-answer session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Ted Detrick. Please go ahead, Mr. Detrick.","Edwin J. Detrick","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I'm Ted Detrick, Vice President of Investor Relations, and with me this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ralph Nicoletti, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer.","In our remarks today, David will begin by commenting on Cigna's third quarter results. He will then discuss how continued effective execution of our strategy, coupled with our differentiated capabilities, are creating significant value for our global clients and customers. David will also review our capital deployment strategy and the progress we have made toward achieving our goal of delivering meaningful shareholder value over the long term. And finally, David will conclude his remarks by making some brief observations about 2013, which we will discuss in more depth when we provide our 2013 outlook at our Investor Day in New York City on November 16. Next, Ralph will review the financial results for the third quarter and provide an update on Cigna's financial outlook for full year 2012. We will then open the lines for your questions. And following our question-and-answer session, David will provide some brief closing remarks before we end the call.","Now as noted in our earnings release, Cigna uses certain financial measures which are not determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, when describing financial results. Specifically, we use the term labeled adjusted income from operations as the principal measure of performance for Cigna and our operating segments. And a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com.","Now in our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking comments, and we would remind you that there are risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations, and those risk factors are discussed in today's earnings release.","Now before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our third quarter results and disclosures. Regarding our results, I note in the third quarter, we recorded 2 charges to shareholders' net income, which we reported as special items. The first special item was an after-tax charge of $50 million or $0.17 per share for severance and other costs associated with a series of actions we are taking to improve our organizational alignment, operational effectiveness and efficiency. The second special item was an after-tax charge of $12 million or $0.04 per share for transaction costs related to the HealthSpring acquisition. I would remind you that special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations in today's discussion of our third quarter results and our full year 2012 outlook.","Now relative to our Run-off Reinsurance operations, our third quarter shareholders' net income includes an after-tax non-cash gain of $32 million or $0.11 per share related to the Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefits business, otherwise known as GMIB. I would remind you that the impact to the financial accounting standards or its fair value disclosure and measuring guidance on our GMIB results is for GAAP accounting purposes only. We believe that the application of this guidance is not reflective of the underlying economics, as it does not represent management's expectation of the ultimate liability payout. Because of the application of this accounting guidance, Cigna's future results for the GMIB business will be volatile, as any future change in the exit value of GMIB's assets and liabilities will be recorded in shareholders' net income. Cigna's 2012 earnings outlook, which we will discuss in a few moments, excludes the results of the GMIB business and therefore, any potential volatility related to the prospective application of this accounting guidance.","And also, please note that when we discuss our full year 2012 outlook, it will be on a basis which excludes any future capital deployment and includes the year-to-date results for our Run-off Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefits business, known as VADBe, but does not include an estimate for future impacts for this business, as these potential impacts, including the effects of changes in capital markets or periodic updates to long-term reserve assumptions, are not known or reasonably estimable.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to David.","David M. Cordani","Thanks, Ted, and good morning, everyone. Cigna is a global company, but I do want to take a moment to acknowledge the recent events back here in the United States. This has been a tough week for many of you impacted by Hurricane Sandy on the East Coast, and I know that New York, New Jersey and Connecticut were hit particularly hard, and many dedicated individuals are focused on leading us to recovery. For those of you who were impacted by the storm, we appreciate you joining us on today's call. We hope you and your families remain safe and that you experience a speedy recovery.","Now before Ralph reviews our results and outlook, I want to take a few moments to comment on our third quarter performance. I'll then discuss how the focused execution of our strategy and ongoing strengthening of our capabilities are creating value for our clients and customers across the globe. I'll also review our progress on deploying capital to support our goal of optimizing long-term shareholder value. And finally, I'll briefly comment on our expectations for 2013.","Turning to our results. We are pleased with our strong performance in the third quarter. We delivered outstanding revenue growth, our earnings exceeded expectations, and we further grew our medical customer base. We also increased our strategic investments in targeted markets and in capabilities to position us to drive sustainable growth. Based on our third quarter results and the momentum we've experienced in the first 9 months of 2012, we are once again increasing our full year outlook for earnings and capital available for deployment.","Moving to the specifics of the quarter, we reported adjusted income from operations of $496 million or $1.71 per share, representing a 33% increase in earnings per share versus the third quarter of 2011. Our consolidated revenue increased by 31% to $7.4 billion. These results reflect the effective and disciplined execution of our Go Deep, Go Global and Go Individual strategy. We continue to deliver on the fundamentals of our business, including clinical quality, service and pricing discipline while providing clients and customers with solutions that improve their health, well-being and sense of security. As a direct result of our focus, each of our ongoing businesses: Health Care, International and Group Disability and Life, provided attractive revenue and earnings contributions in the third quarter.","Specific to Health Care, results reflect continued organic growth in our target customer segments and significant contributions from our HealthSpring acquisition. Our Health Care revenues grew 46% relative to third quarter 2011. Our medical customer base grew by 1.25 million people during the first 9 months of 2012, representing nearly 11% net growth from year-end 2011, including more than 7% from organic commercial customer growth. Essentially all of our organic growth was in our highly transparent, self-funded ASO products, which enabled Cigna clients to design benefit plans from our comprehensive suite of productivity and health solutions and effectively manage their costs. Our ability to retain, expand and acquire new clients and customers in our targeted segments reinforces the value we are delivering in the marketplace.","In our International business, Cigna delivered top line growth of 22% compared to the third quarter of 2011, driven by attractive customer retention rates, successful cross-selling and new business sales, as well as the acquisition of FirstAssist. We are seeing continued demand for our Health, Life and Accident products amongst the growing middle class, who want to supplement coverages and fill gaps in the government-sponsored programs. And we continue to see demand for our highly specialized health programs for globally mobile individuals employed by multinational companies and governmental organizations.","In Group Disability and Life, our revenue growth was 8% over the third quarter of 2011, and we reported solid earnings, demonstrating the value of our health and productivity programs for Cigna clients and customers.","Overall, our third quarter results reflect strong and focused execution of our growth strategy. Our portfolio of businesses: U.S. Commercial, International and Seniors, strongly position us for sustained growth in markets where we have a leading position and offer distinct value to our clients and customers. And our key points of differentiation are helping to improve health outcomes, increase work productivity and enhance well-being for the people we serve. These points are customer centricity, physician engagement and consultative distribution. To maintain our competitive position and fuel for future growth, we will continue to invest in these differentiators to address client and customer needs for greater value and affordability. I'm going to briefly comment on each of these differentiators, and then we will provide a more in-depth review when we're with you during our Investor Day on November 16.","With respect to customer centricity, Cigna was at the forefront of transitioning to a retail-oriented, consumer-driven approach in health care. We have invested in resources that empower individuals to make better health and quality decisions through a personalized, helpful and simple service experience. In our U.S. Commercial business, our customer focus is delivering demonstrable results. We were the first and remain the only global health service company with 24\/7, 365 live telephonic support. We continue to develop tools to allow customers to connect with us anytime, anywhere on the platform of their choice. For example, our customers can access us through cigna.com from any mobile device to price medications, access account balances, get real-time cost-of-care estimates on prospective treatments as well. In September, our innovative search engine for finding doctors and services was named one of the top 10 technology innovations of 2012 by InformationWeek magazine. Internationally, our effective customer segmentation and direct-to-consumer distribution gives us a competitive advantage in our ability to design the right products to meet our customers' needs and deliver those products through channels preferred by our customers.","Another key element of our success is our ability to work effectively and partner with physicians. We took a leadership role in physician partnership long before the U.S. Affordable Care Act. We started in 2008 with the launch of our first Collaborative Accountable Care initiative, or CAC, which is Cigna's approach to accountable care organizations. In the third quarter of 2012, we announced 9 new CACs, and we now have 42 programs spanning 18 states. We are on track to reach our goal of 100 programs by the end of 2014. With the addition of HealthSpring's physician engagement programs, we have accelerated our ability to reshape the delivery of health care. Specifically, we are actively expanding HealthSpring's footprint for 2013 by deepening their presence in existing markets and offering HealthSpring's customers access to home delivery pharmacy benefits. We are supporting growth in new markets with development for 2014 well underway already, and we're extending the value of the physician engagement model to develop new commercial offerings. Most recently, by leveraging HealthSpring's physician engagement programs to launch 2 new CAC initiatives, that together increase access to high-quality coordinated care for Cigna's commercial customers.","Next, I'll discuss our approach to consultative distribution of our products and services to our clients and customers around the world. In our U.S. Commercial business, our consultative distribution approach helps employers to design customized programs to improve the health and productivity of their workforce while maximizing the value of the overall spending. Similarly, in our International business, we drive strong retention and sales through our market-leading sales organization, with in-country telemarketers leveraging more than 200 affinity partnerships. In addition, we effectively use Bancassurance channels, Internet distribution, Direct Response TV and home shopping programs to meet our customers' needs.","Combined, these differentiated capabilities: customer centricity, physician engagement and consultative distribution, continue to drive growth in Cigna's customer and client relationships.","Now I'll discuss how we are creating sustainable shareholder value through the disciplined management of our capital and our focus on continuously identifying operating efficiencies. We continue to deploy capital with 3 priorities in mind. Our first priority is to support our current business with the capital required while making investments to develop capabilities that position us for long-term growth. As we have discussed previously, we are experiencing a challenging global economy, and yet at Cigna, we have grown meaningfully during this time because of a disciplined focus on our strategy and ongoing investments.","As we look at 2013, we expect to see continuing economic headwinds, and we believe that now is the time to further accelerate our investments in targeted areas in order to strengthen our competitive posture. To provide additional capacity to further invest, we proactively identified efficiency gains throughout our organization. As a result, we are taking a $50 million after-tax charge in the third quarter to cover a series of actions that will yield annual after-tax expense savings of $60 million. These savings will allow us to reinvest in priority markets and in capabilities that will further improve our ability to provide superior service and affordable solutions for our clients and customers while delivering sustainable value for our shareholders.","It's important to view these actions in context. Over the past 3 years, we have increased our revenue by more than 50% and our net employment base by 17%. This announcement, while difficult, reflects the necessary steps to support our ongoing expansion of our business and drive sustained success.","Second, relative to strategic acquisitions and partnerships, we continue to pursue opportunities that align with our growth strategy and create strategic market advantage and differentiation. In the U.S., for example, our inorganic growth to-date is focused on acquiring unique capabilities in the Seniors market and expanding Cigna's retail capabilities. Acquiring HealthSpring, with their best-in-class physician coordination model, is a clear example of our ability to successfully deliver inorganic growth. We're also strengthening our capabilities to win in the U.S. individual market with our acquisition of Great American Supplemental Benefits, which we closed during the third quarter. With the Great American acquisition, Cigna is now one of the largest producers, distributors and marketers of supplemental health and related products in the U.S. This business is highly complementary to our successful global Health, Life and Accident business.","Within our International business, our joint ventures in India and Turkey will further expand our reach in geographies with significant middle-class growth, while our acquisition of FirstAssist adds a portfolio of travel-related products to extend to our customers. These investments will enable Cigna to capitalize on high-growth opportunities and enhance our ability to provide value to our customers across all stages of their lives regardless of how we access those customers, through an employer, through the government, through an affinity relationship or directly.","After fully considering the first 2 priorities of capital deployment, specifically supporting the growth of our ongoing business and pursuing financially attractive strategic M&A activity, we evaluate opportunities to return capital to investors. As of November 1, we repurchased approximately 4.4 million shares of our stock for $210 million. Our disciplined investments in ongoing operations, our successful track record with acquisitions and our share repurchase program demonstrate Cigna's commitment to deploying capital to build sustainable shareholder value.","Now turning to 2013. We have been operating in a dynamic environment for some time, and we see that environment, particularly the uncertain global economy continuing for the next several years. That said, we are stepping into 2013 with strong momentum created by our focused effective execution of our strategy, which has resulted in attractive revenue and earnings growth in both 2011 and 2012. We believe we are well positioned in our targeted markets, and we will continue to build off that positive momentum. As such, we expect 2013 to be another successful year in which we deliver both revenue and earnings growth. We look forward to providing you with more insights on our outlook for 2013 at our Investor Day on November 16.","Now before I turn it over to Ralph, I'd like to re-emphasize a few key points. We delivered attractive revenue growth in each of our ongoing businesses, and our earnings exceeded expectations. Our customer base grew, demonstrating the unique value we offer and our ability to retain, expand and acquire new clients and customers in our targeted segments. We continue to increase our strategic investments in targeted markets and customer segments while strengthening the value we offer customers and clients by further developing our capabilities in customer centricity, physician engagement and consultative distribution. Our results reflect the focus and commitment of our Cigna colleagues around the world who work to help to improve the health, well-being and sense of security of the people we serve.","Based on our third quarter results and the momentum we built during the first 9 months of 2012, we are again increasing our full year outlook for earnings and capital available for deployment. And I'm confident in our ability to achieve our full year outlook and believe our performance in 2012 gives us strong momentum to deliver continued success in 2013.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Ralph.","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will review Cigna's third quarter 2012 results and provide an update to our full year 2012 outlook. In my review of consolidated and segment results, I will comment on adjusted income from operations. This is also the basis on which I'll provide our earnings outlook. Before I get into the specifics of the quarter, I want to emphasize that the results of the quarter were better than our expectations, which enabled us to further increase our full year outlook and are primarily driven by favorable pharmacy and medical costs in our Health Care business and favorable loss ratios in our International business.","The quarter was highlighted by strong revenue and EPS growth and continued effective deployment of capital, including the resumption of share repurchase activity and the acquisition of Great American Supplemental Business. These results provide us confidence to increase our updated full year outlook for both earnings and parent company cash.","Before reviewing the specifics of the quarter I will comment briefly on the alignment -- the realignment and efficiency plan we implemented during the quarter. We reported a special item charge of $50 million after-tax related to the actions we are taking across our global operations to enhance our focus and ability to deliver value and affordability to our customers and clients and increase our productivity and operational efficiency. The majority of the expected of annualized savings of $60 million after-tax is expected to be reinvested in the business to enhance our ability to growth in our targeted markets.","Now moving to operating results. Our third quarter 2012 consolidated revenues grew 31% to $7.4 billion, driven by continued contributions from the HealthSpring acquisition and growth in our targeted markets. Third quarter consolidated earnings were $496 million or $1.71 per share, excluding the after-tax loss of $0.02 a share from the results of our Run-off VADBe business.","Turning to the segments. Overall Health Care results for the third quarter of 2012 were particularly strong across both our Commercial and Seniors businesses. Third quarter premiums and fees for Health Care grew 51% to $4.9 billion, reflecting strong contributions from both HealthSpring acquisition and organic growth in both of our Commercial and Senior businesses. Excluding the effect of HealthSpring, premiums and fees grew 7%. Third quarter earnings for Health Care were $384 million, highlighted by revenue growth, including further specialty penetration, favorable pharmacy and medical costs and continued underwriting and pricing discipline. We ended the third quarter 2012 with approximately 12.7 million U.S. medical customers, representing sequential growth over -- of over 110,000 customers and year-to-date growth of approximately 1.25 million customers, of which about 850,000 are commercial customers primarily in our priority markets.","Turning now to medical costs. Across our commercial and Medicare risk books of business, our third quarter earnings reflect favorable pharmacy and medical costs, including favorable prior period, favorable claim development of $24 million after-tax, of which $6 million after-tax related to prior years. Specific to commercial guaranteed costs, our third quarter 2012 medical care ratio, or MCR, was 80.2% on a reported basis. Our third quarter 2012 MCR for Medicare Advantage was 80% on a reported basis. I will remind you that 85% of our commercial customers are in ASO funding arrangements, where they directly benefit from these medical cost results.","Overall, we are pleased with the results as they continue to reflect good pricing and underwriting discipline, as well as sustained quality health care for our clients and customers. For the third quarter the total Health Care operating expense ratio is 22.9%, which represents a significant improvement over the third quarter of 2011, driven by the change in the business mix associated with the HealthSpring acquisition, benefits of our cost savings initiatives and strategic spending to support our near- and long-term business growth and service capabilities.","Now I'll discuss the results of our International business. International continues to deliver attractive growth and profitability. The results reflect targeted new sales, strong retention and further product penetration to existing customers. Premiums and fees grew 22% quarter-over-quarter, driven by strong customer retention and growth in our Health, Life and Accident business and increased risk membership in our Global Health Benefits business, as well as contributions from our recent acquisitions. Third quarter earnings in our International business were $79 million and reflect improvements in operating expense, efficiencies and favorable claims experience in both Health, Life and Accident and Global Health Benefit businesses.","For Group Disability and Life, third quarter results were in line with our expectations in a difficult environment. Group premiums and fees increased 9% over the third quarter of 2011, driven by 11% growth in disability premiums and fees. Third quarter earnings in our group business were $62 million, reflecting favorable life claims experience, which was partially offset by unfavorable claims experience in the disability business. Results in this quarter also include a net favorable impact of $5 million after-tax related to reserve studies completed during the quarter.","Results for our remaining operations, including Run-off Reinsurance, Other Operations and Corporate, totaled to an after-tax loss of $36 million for the third quarter. These results included reserve strengthening of $6 million after-tax to our Run-off VADBe book of business.","Overall, as a result of the continued effective execution of our strategy, our third quarter results reflect strong revenue and earnings contributions from our ongoing businesses. And as a result, we continue to generate significant free cash flow. Regarding our investment portfolio, we continue to be pleased with our results. Overall, our strong investment management capabilities, diversified portfolio and disciplined approach to risk management continued to deliver solid returns","Now turning to our outlook, based on the strength of our third quarter results, we are confident in our ability to achieve our increased full year outlook. We now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations in the range of $1.655 billion to $1.705 billion and consolidated EPS of $5.70 to $5.90 per share, reflecting continued strong underlying results in each of our ongoing businesses. This increased outlook represents an increase of $100 million in earnings at the midpoint and $0.30 to $0.45 per share over our previous expectations, driven primarily by the strength of this quarter's Health Care and International results. I would remind you that, consistent with prior practices, our outlook excludes any contribution from additional capital deployment.","I will now discuss the components of our 2012 outlook, starting with Health Care. We now expect full year Health Care earnings in the range of $1.29 billion to $1.32 billion. This increased outlook for Health Care reflects the impact of better-than-expected pharmacy and medical claim development recognized in the third quarter and continued effective execution of our strategy. Regarding U.S. medical customers, we now expect full year 2012 growth of approximately 1.25 million people, of which 850,000 is in our Commercial book of business. Overall, we're pleased that employers of various sizes continue to value our consultative approach and our differentiated health and productivity programs.","Turning to our outlook for medical costs. For our total commercial book of business, we now expect full year medical cost trend to be in the 5.5% to 6% range. We have also updated our expectations for our full year medical costs -- medical care ratios and now expect an MCR of approximately 80% for our commercial guaranteed book of business and MCR of approximately 81% for our Medicare Advantage business. Both represent an improvement of 50 basis points from the midpoints of our previous expectations.","We also have updated our operating expense ratio outlook and now expect the full year 2012 ratio to be approximately 23%, in the range of our previous guidance. As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect a low level of Health Care earnings -- a lower level of Health Care earnings from the third quarter due to in absence of favorable prior year -- prior period medical cost development, risk sharing nature of our Medicare Part D businesses, seasonally higher medical Costs in our commercial risk business and an increase in operating expense to support January 1 readiness and Medicare enrollment, as well as continued strategic investments.","Now moving to other components of our outlook. For our International business, we expect continued strong top line growth and now expect earnings in the range of $280 million to $290 million, which represents earnings growth of more than 25% versus full year 2011. We expect the fourth quarter results to reflect more normalized claims experience and an uptick in strategic investments. Regarding Group Disability and Life business, we now expect full year 2012 earnings in the range of $265 million to $275 million. And regarding our remaining operations, including Run-off Reinsurance, Other Operations and Corporate, our updated outlook is now an expected loss of $180 million for 2012.","So all in, for full year 2012, we now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $1.655 billion to $1.705 billion and consolidated EPS in the range of $5.70 to $5.90 per share, which reflects the share repurchase activity through October 31.","I will now discuss our updated capital management position and outlook. Overall, we continue to have good financial flexibility, as our subsidiaries remain well capitalized and are generating significant free cash flow to parent, reflecting a strong return on capital in each of our ongoing businesses. We ended the quarter with parent company cash of approximately $435 million. And during the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares of Cigna common stock, and we subsequently repurchased an additional 2.5 million shares through October 31 through the deployment of approximately $210 million of available capital. After reflecting the capital deployed for the share repurchase through October 31, we now expect to have approximately $700 million in parent company cash by the end of 2012, with approximately $250 million available for deployment. This represents a $125 million increase compared to our previous capital outlook, primarily reflecting increased subsidiary dividends due to improved business fundamentals. We are confident in our updated outlook, and our capital position remains strong, and our capital deployment strategy and priorities remain unchanged.","Now to recap, our third quarter 2012 consolidated results reflect the strength of our differentiated portfolio of global businesses and a consistent and disciplined execution of our focused strategy with continued growth in our targeted customer segments. Our quarterly results represent another strong performance, reflecting solid organic and customer growth, which are expected to deliver an increase of $100 million in earnings or $0.30 to $0.45 in earnings per share for 2012 and an additional $125 million in capital available for deployment. We effectively deployed capital during the quarter for our strategic acquisition of Great American Supplemental Benefits and share repurchase. And based on the strength of these results, we are confident in our ability to achieve our increased full year 2012 outlook.","With that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Could you just talk about what you're seeing on the commercial -- well, also Medicare medical cost trend side and the degree to which that's changed from the first half, and also how it influences your view of trend for next year?","David M. Cordani","It's David. I'll just frame that and see if Ralph wants to expand a little further. But as you track us throughout the course of the full year, our medical cost trend outlook for the year has improved overall for our total portfolio of business. You'll recall that last quarter, as well as this quarter, we acknowledged some further improvement in our overall loss ratios. And at the end of the day, broadly speaking, our contracting and our effective partnership with physicians and hospitals is working, in line with our expectation And broadly speaking, overall, the rate and pace of projected escalation utilization is not as significant as we might have thought it would be earlier part of this year. Ralph, can I ask you to expand in terms of -- as we look forward to the latter part of the year, our expectations?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Sure. Matt, regarding as we look at the balance of the year, we would see that the fourth quarter, in the 5.5% to 6% range kind of reflecting a continuation of the trend that we just saw this quarter. And in terms of some of the pieces, by and large they really haven't changed materially versus what we talked about in the first part of the year, in-patient is pretty muted; and professional service utilization, up a little bit, as well as outpatient, principally in the side of claims.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And if I just could as a follow-up, on the pricing side, incrementally, have you seen anything that you would characterize as a shift in the degree of pricing pressure you face, if you can sort of average that out across different markets and segments?","David M. Cordani","Matthew, it's David. Consistent with prior dialogue, I would say no macro shift. So we've continued to say the pricing environment is competitive. There's always puts and takes in geographies given the breadth of our portfolio or segments, but no major shift in movement. I would add to that, that the breadth of our capabilities, our funding mechanisms, so having the full breadth from the ASO through the experience rate and in guaranteed cost capabilities helps us in environments if there are smaller flare-ups. But broadly speaking, no major change in the environment. It's still very competitive from a pricing standpoint.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First question, just interested in any impacts that you're expecting from Hurricane Sandy. And specifically, just relative to utilization, would you expect that you'd probably see some lower utilization in some of the Northeast markets in the fourth quarter as a result of the storm?","David M. Cordani","Scott, just broadly speaking, I'll go at that in 2 phases. First and foremost, when something like this transpires, there's a lot of actions that are put in place to expand access to care, expand ease of access through pharmaceuticals, professional services, outpatient services, offer more coordination points, even working with the Red Cross to get the right medications to the right people the right way. So those activities, unfortunately, we're well attuned in how to manage, and that's well underway. But broadly speaking, I wouldn't expect a material effect given, again, the broad portfolio of our book of business. You might see a little dampening for a very short period of time, but we're not projecting a broad impact here at all.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow-up question just on 2013, and you highlighted you expect revenue and earnings growth. Maybe some preliminary thoughts you can give us on membership growth and specifically, how the national accounts selling season ended up closing out for you?","David M. Cordani","Sure, Scott. A few points. As we noted in our prepared comments, for 2013, given the momentum we continue to build through '11 and '12, our broad expectations are that we will grow revenue as well as earnings. And I'd ask you to step back and think about some of our capabilities to enable us to do that in this really challenging environment, and then I'll comment on national accounts. First, our broad funding capabilities in the United States are very helpful, as employers of all sizes are looking for the most effective way to align their incentives and engage their employees. Secondly, our broad portfolio of specialty capabilities, health improvement and productivity capabilities continue to be a strong add to us. Third, we now have a very well-positioned Medicare Advantage portfolio of businesses. And fourth, our International portfolio of businesses will be extremely helpful to us as we step into 2013. As it relates to national accounts, the national account selling season, it's sufficiently complete. There's always some open switches that are in front of us. As we sit here today, we would expect for our national accounts, which we define as commercial employers with 5,000 or more employees that are multistate, so we define it more narrowly than some define it. For that marketplace, we'd expect at this point in time, overall, a good retention rate. We had an outstanding retention rate in 2012. We expect a very good retention rate in 2013. At this point in time, we see less business as having moved in either direction. So the net effect of that is we're expecting that we will keep share or maintain share in aggregate in the national segment. We view the national segment as a shrinking segment if you track the employer profile. So that's about a 2% shrinkage factor that we expect exists in the overall national account marketplace because of the employment pattern, and we expect to maintain share in that environment. The last thing I'd add is we expect to further grow revenue and further grow our specialty penetration in that portfolio based on the focus of repositioning that book of business.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So basically, just maybe down a couple percentage points in national accounts for '13?","David M. Cordani","Broadly speaking, yes, and again, I'd amplify with strong retention, good specialty penetration and overall revenue growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Barclays Capital.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a quick question on a couple of the charges. I guess just starting with the HealthSpring transaction cost. I might have missed it, but it looks like there was $28 million in the first quarter, and then $12 million in the third but nothing in the second. So I'm just curious what's going on with the timing of transaction costs with HealthSpring.","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Sure, Josh. You can think of it as in the first quarter, the costs you mentioned really were to complete the transaction we closed at the end of January. In the third quarter, what you see there is a settlement of a final shareholder appraisal rate situation, and that was the charge we put. And that would be the end to what we would expect to see on those kinds of costs.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. That was sort of a 6-month run-out type of thing.","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Right.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just on the $50 million realignment, maybe you could just give us a little bit of color as to what that means from an organizational efficiency. Is this just sort of a headcount reduction? And then I guess, combined with that is just where exactly are the targeted investments going into? I mean, if you're saving $50 million, $60 million a year, where should we think about that increased spending going?","David M. Cordani","Sure, Josh. It's David. So let me frame that a little bit more broadly. First, by way of context, consistent with our strategy, we've been able to improve our operating expense ratio each in the last several years, both as we've grown the business, but as we've secured productivity gains. And we would expect that to continue into 2013 more broadly. In addition to that, as we referenced, we've taken a series of actions to further strengthen alignment and identify some operating efficiencies in the company. And we're going to use that, broadly speaking, as an additional pool of resources to reinvest. The $60 million after-tax is a run rate, so you should expect that to get to a run rate level as we get to 2014 because those actions will be executed throughout the course of 2013 and the latter part of 2012. Specific to the types of investments, you should think about those as continuation of things that we've been doing. So market expansion, technology and solution capabilities and brand building would be 3 types of examples of where those resources, in addition to existing resources, would be amplified to further drive our profitable growth going forward.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So -- okay, so you said, David, at the $60 million run rate, that these actions are going to continue through 2013. Does that mean there's additional charges coming as well, or is this to cover the expected severance and actions taken over the next, say, year or so?","David M. Cordani","They're not additional charges. It is expected to cover actions that will be taken over the next several quarters.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Lake with JPMorgan.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a couple of quick follow-ups on '13. Outside of national accounts, I know -- I remember last year, you'd talked a little bit more broadly about overall health care membership growth, expectations for 1\/1, just wonder if you could share that number. And also, when you talk about earnings growth, can you just verify, you're talking about net income growth next year?","David M. Cordani","It's David. At this point, we're not providing detailed guidance for 2013. We'll give you a little bit more insights at our Investor Day, and then when we blow out the entire segment view. But at this point in time, we have good visibility in national accounts, and that was what we sought to frame. As we step back, the comment specifically on earnings is net earnings, so operating earnings growth very specifically and separable from EPS, which we'd obviously expect contribution there. And more broadly, as we said in our prepared remarks, we expect to profitably grow our revenue yet again in 2013.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Any reason why at this point last year you had a little more visibility on membership? Is the decision being made later in the year or anything on that nature?","David M. Cordani","I would say nothing broadly. Again, we're not going through detailed 2013 guidance today. We'll provide you more insights at Investor Day. A little bit later decision-making cycle, but you know our business pretty well, Justin, so national accounts, good visibility today. Our regional segment, which is our largest segment, the higher end of the size of the case count, good visibility, but there's a lot of business in the 3, 4, 5, 6, 700 life account class that are still being worked today with -- we are bullish on that segment. And in the Select Segment, which is our fastest-growing segment, that selling season for 2012 ends on December 31, 2012. So we're clearly selling for 2013. Broadly speaking again, we will grow revenue. So you should expect to see growth from the franchise, but we'll provide more insights in the near future for you.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. Then if I could just even step further ahead into 2014, I'd just ask a couple of quick questions. One, in Medicare Advantage, there's going to be an MLR floor instituted, 85%. If you look at some of the staff filings for HealthSpring, there are MLRs in some states that are in the kind of mid- to high-70s. So curious as to what you think that impact might be from the implementation of MLR floors. And then on the other hand, as you get into 2014, you've got the industry tax or the industry fee, whatever you want to call it, kind of being implemented and only on risk-based business. If that stays that way, one would think that there might be a further shift in the move of mid-sized employers from risk to ASO, which could benefit you. I'm just curious if you started also to kind of get the temperature for the appetite for employers to do that.","David M. Cordani","Well, Justin, first, let me just put a backdrop on this. I'll go right to the, I'll call it the direction of the MLR for 2014, and then I'm going to ask Ralph to expand on our pricing posture relative to the industry tax which I think is very relevant to your comment. Broadly, to frame this though, 85% of our portfolio today is ASO. And we're a company that believes in having transparent, highly aligned programs for our clients and customers. And we continue to see good demand today in those programs, and we see that continuing. Specific to the MLR for Medicare Advantage and HealthSpring, you're correct, there's puts and takes in individual markets and geographies. But if you step back, one, as you very well know, there'll be adjustments to the calculation to the numerator and the denominator for activities that are engaged in, health improvement, health management, et cetera. When you take that into consideration, in aggregate, the HealthSpring book of business today is approximately compliant with the MLR with some outlier markets. We take that into consideration and are actively taking that into consideration with the ongoing management of the HealthSpring book of business throughout 2013. And as we approach the 2014 bidding cycle, that will be front in mind for us. Said otherwise, we do not expect that as a large step-function headwind by the time we step into 2014 for the HealthSpring book of business, but there will be some puts and takes in individual geographies that we need to manage once you adjust for all the health management activities and programs. I do want Ralph to expand a little bit in terms of our posture relative to how we're dealing with the industry tax as we step throughout 2013 and this year with an eye towards 2014. Ralph?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Sure. Thanks, David. Justin, as we look at the tax, just our philosophy on pricing is essentially to price underlying cost trends, which we would view this part of so beginning in 2013 with -- for policies that overlap into 2014, we will include and reflect the industry tax in that pricing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ana Gupte with Sanford Bernstein.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So just wanted to explore the Medicare outlook for 2013. The selling season has now been underway for a few weeks. Can you give us a sense for would you likely expect to exceed the CMS average forecast of pricing at about 11%? And then from a margin perspective, as you're looking into your designs and comparing it with some of your competitors that might have been adversely selected against, would you see this 81% loss ratio as carrying forward into 2013?","David M. Cordani","It's David. Just again to put your very important question in context, if you look back over time, the HealthSpring strategy and approach to positioning products and services forward 1 year has been to try to get that delicate balance between enhancing benefits to providing great value to the customers or beneficiaries, working in tight concert with their very innovative physician partnership relationships, and then generating a fair return from a shareholder standpoint. The result of that has been, on average, they've generated market average growth in their book of business. They've had relative stickiness with their portfolio because it hasn't undulated back and forth to large land grab movements in any way, shape or form, and that process continues as we go forward to try to get that balance. The same team that has actively managed and successfully managed the HealthSpring portfolio to-date is managing the bid process and manage it through 2013. And again, we're not providing detailed guidance, but we'd expect to grow that portfolio. As you know, that portfolio is largely individual MA, so we'd expect the average growth to be in line with the overall business. We'd expect that to have good retention, and we expect it to have a very good profitability profile at this point in time.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","But following up again on the Medicare angle, you have distribution as 1 of your 3 big pillars of differentiation. I might have missed this, but I don't think you have a retail partnership on the Part D side. And I think United put something out, the 72 [ph] this year, and we already had Humana and Aetna and Coventry with something. What are your thoughts on partnering with pharmacies on Part D? And then on the group side, the group selling to Medicare Advantage, given that was one of the pillars of synergies between Cigna and HealthSpring, any movement on that front, and what's the outlook for 2013 and '14?","David M. Cordani","Sure. So 2 very important points. To date, when you bring both of the organizations together, both Cigna and HealthSpring had approximately the same size PDP books of business. Both of those books of business were largely auto sign and then web enrollment relationships that came through the CMS with some additional bolt-on activities. And our strategy to-date has not been to deviate from that. As we look to 2013, broadly speaking, we expect to keep share or have slight erosion in the PDP book of business but maintain the profitability profile that is very attractive in that book. Secondly, you're correct, the group opportunity is a prospective synergy between Cigna and HealthSpring. We indicated that, that would be a ramped opportunity as we went forward, and we did not articulate a significant step-up in 2012 or 2013. There's been some targeted market activities. There's been some demand. There's been some market-driven demand because of the attractiveness of the HealthSpring value proposition and network, and we'd expect to see some movement in that through 2013. But broadly speaking, as you think about 2013, what drives the Medicare chassis for Cigna, Cigna-HealthSpring is the individual MA book of business that has been a strong-performing, stable, high-retention and good-growth book of business, tightly aligned with the physician partnership, discipline across the PDP and then some growth opportunity in the group space, which will ramp over time with some movement in 2013.","Ana Gupte - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And then final one, on SG&A, can you give us a view on what your target efficiency savings are for SG&A in the next 1 to 3 years as you put this workforce reduction and efficiency program in place?","David M. Cordani","Yes, Ana, we've not provided 2013 guidance. When we do, we will lay that out for you. But in my prior comments, I noted that we have generated, in line with our strategy, expense ratio leverage each of the last 3 years, and we'd expect to generate expense ratio leverage in 2013. But when we provide guidance, we will break that out for you as we have in the past.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Question for you on a couple times during the call and release you talked about the pharmacy costs being a driver to some of the strong results in the Health Care segment. Can you just talk a little bit about what specifically that you're referring to there? And I might have missed it, but I thought that maybe in the comments, you indicated you were driving or doing some home delivery of drugs to your Medicare beneficiaries. Is that something that Cigna was doing, or is that a new product through Catamaran?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Sure, Kevin. It's Ralph. Just overall on pharmacy, that business is performing well. Saw primarily here in the third quarter is a mix shift to generics and lower costs in that area as well, so that's primarily what was driving our results in the third -- the favorable results in the third quarter, and as I noted in my remarks, even a little beyond what we had internally expected as they came in favorable. But regarding home delivery, maybe I'll ask David to comment on that.","David M. Cordani","Sure, Kevin. Essentially what you see, broadly speaking is a little bit of a best of both worlds, so our objective for the benefit of our customers or the beneficiaries, in this case of PDP, Medicare Advantage, et cetera, is to get the best value, and we take a total low-cost and clinical efficacy approach. PDP is notoriously low from a mail-order penetration standpoint, and you're able to get a great convenience for seniors by getting maintenance medications for a 90-day supply delivered to their home. We're at the early stages of getting some leverage there, and it's leverage of both the existing HealthSpring relationship, as well as the Cigna PBM capabilities.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So with pharmacy in particular, is that just -- is that kind of your PDP earnings being higher or is that just general kind of medical trend being lower because of the shift to generics?","David M. Cordani","Kevin, it's both meaningful on the PDP side, with what Ralph referenced in terms of both the further movement in generic, the mix in generic and therefore, the cost profile, that again, very importantly, benefits the beneficiary, as well as us. In addition, because of the ongoing strong performance of our PPACA  PBM  [ph] in our Commercial portfolio of business, we see continued improvement there from a pharmacy standpoint.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then, finally, you guys keep taking up your cash flow guidance, and I think that next year, we're looking at another good year for you from a cash flow perspective. I mean, how do you think about dividends when you think about those 3 capital priorities that you outlined earlier for this year? I mean, does that change at all as you get a full year benefit of all the HealthSpring cash flow next year?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Kevin, it's Ralph. Clearly, we feel great about the cash flow. And on the business and the strong return of capital we have across the different business lines, would expect to -- that to continue into next year. Our capital priorities haven't changed, as David alluded to in his remarks, principally around supporting the base operation, strategic M&A across the priority areas that he articulated. And then we'll look at share repurchase and dividend policy on a regular basis as another means of creating value.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Christine Arnold with Cowen.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","International earnings, you've seen a lot of growth with acquisitions. Can you give us some kind of same-store earnings growth that you've seen this year? And is there any reason that, that shouldn't grow double digits, which was kind of your same-store guidance entering this year going into next? And then just following up on Kevin's question, if we think about kind of the cash flow, if it feels like $1.7 billion in subsidiary dividends might be doable next year, how do we think about how much cash you feel you might need to keep as powder dry for subsidiary capital requirements for growth versus how much you could use given what's happening in 2014?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Sure, Christine. First, on the capital and the cash flows, clearly, feel good about where we're landing this year and have opportunity to deploy. We have been averaging a little above our net income on cash generation, and that already reflects strong capitalization of our subsidiaries, so they're generating sufficient cash to keep our RBC ratios well intact and then have ample room for dividend to the parent. So that's why you see us ahead there. Okay?","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So something in the neighborhood of $1.8 billion plus in terms of what might be available next year.","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Well, I don't think at this point we want to project where next year is going to be. But I think if you look at our track record, we've been able to bring in strong cash flow, as you saw this year and deploy it right. We'll cover that more as we talk in a few weeks at Investor Day.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And then how should we be thinking about International?","David M. Cordani","Christine, just taking that up. As you noted, we've had some very targeted acquisitions. I'd also note, offsetting that in a way has been our focus on additional investment within the franchise. So organically, we're making the investments to open and expand Turkey. Organically, we're making the investments to enter India effectively. So stepping back, we're very pleased with both the top line and bottom line growth of that franchise. And I think at the core of your question, is it reasonable to assume double-digit earnings growth as we look forward? We've indicated to you before, that's on our strategic horizon, and we'll provide more detail for '13 specifically, but double-digit earnings growth is a reasonable assumption for that business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carl McDonald with Citigroup.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Wanted to focus on your experience rate of business in the context of the industry tax and anything else that you'd highlight specific to that business that may be a little bit different as we head into '14.","David M. Cordani","Carl, it's David. Just broadly speaking, what I would start with amplifying is that, that business we've continued to indicate is a bit of a niche business and specifically focused on a subsegment of buyers. It's performed well over time, it continues to perform well and we see it as being an important product as we look forward. Secondly, from an industry tax standpoint, it would be deemed to be more risk based than non-risk based, so it would be exposed to the tax activities. And the important part when you take it all into consideration is are we able to provide a good, highly transparent relationship with an employer, wrap the clinical programs, it is highly penetrated with our specialty capabilities and deliver a overall net cost that an employer likes. That would be, I'll call it revenue management and expense management, the benefits of an employer because of the reassuring nature of the product. So we would expect it to continue to be used on a very targeted basis going forward.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So the conversations that you've had to this point haven't indicated that the tax would be enough to make those experience or your customers consider switching to a fully self-funded product?","David M. Cordani","Yes, Carl, I think it's always hard when you say in an absolute sense, right? So our whole approach is, as we talk about our consultative selling, we sit with clients, we call an employer a client, and we have that broad set of capabilities. So long before the industry tax, we have environments where experience-rated employers would move to ASO or vice versa. We expect that phenomenon to continue. The important part is are we able to demonstrate good value by improving health, lowering health risks, managing total costs and clinical quality, and we think that, that will continue. So are there employers who may move from experience-rated to ASO? Sure, but that happened in the past as well, and the industry tax is just another factor that comes into the thought process.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I want to circle back to the cost trend questions from before. You talked about in the second quarter cost trend being 6% to 7%. In this quarter, you're saying 5.5% to 6%, I think you said. It's a 75-basis-point improvement. Yet when you broke it down by subcomponent, you really didn't see any changes other than maybe on the pharmacy side, which seems lower. Did all of that 75 basis points of improvement come from the pharmacy trend? And if so, was it -- it seems like that would be hard to do just from a shift to generics all in one quarter. Was there something else that altered your view on trend? And then lastly, regarding pricing for next year, you would have been pricing at, say 6% to 7% before, so do think your position now if cost trend stays at the 5.5% to 6% range should have more substantial margins next year?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Peter, it's Ralph. Just to clarify on the medical cost trending as it relates to the second quarter and the movement from the 6% to 7% down to the 5.5% to 6%, that's really across all components, in pharmacy and other medical as well. And as I mentioned earlier, what we saw was essentially the same components move but at a lower rate of increase than what we had thought they would at the end of the second quarter. So pharmacy was a piece of it, but clearly, the other aspects of it were part of what you're seeing in the favorable medical costs in the third quarter.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","The prior period development was mostly on the pharmacy side based on your Part D MLR. So I assume that's where a lot of the PPD came from this quarter.","Ralph J. Nicoletti","No, actually, the prior period was largely in the medical side. And the pharmacy was more, as I mentioned earlier, around the mix in generic side within the quarter.","David M. Cordani","Peter, on the second question -- it's David. Go back to the context of our business, 85% is ASO, the residual 15% is split between experience-rated and guaranteed costs. So for our ASO customers, you're reflecting a trend projection, you work with them in terms of what they would like to build into their own respective budgets. Similarly, you do the same thing from a experience-rated standpoint, agree upon a revenue stream. And lastly, for our guaranteed cost book of business, because we do not play in the under 50 market, the vast majority of our business is rated on the credibility or the experience of those cases. So point is you have more case-specific visibility of costs that you're baking into pricing. Now having said all that, to the extent our secular trend pick at a given point in time is higher than it actually turns out to be, there may be some favorable development. And if that transpires, we would talk about that quarter-to-quarter, as we have in the past. But the case-specific visibility and the, I'll call it the shared-risk visibility tends to mute that for our company.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just on the experience-rated book of business, going into next year, are we going to see that business have to give back some of the profitability, or are you going to be in a position where you're not really doing that this year?","David M. Cordani","Peter, there are some puts and takes in there. When we look at the overall book of business, that book of business has been pretty stable over I'll call it the case level performance and the average portfolio performance, and we see no meaningful change looking into 2013.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Windley with Jefferies.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So, David, on your individual business, you generally talked about that as being small and opportunistic as we move into exchanges. I wondered if you could comment on a couple of things there. One, you saw pretty solid membership growth, and what's the focus or emphasis there that drove that growth? And then two, what are your current thoughts and expectations about readiness of exchanges and Cigna's preparedness to launch into exchanges?","David M. Cordani","David, you're correct. To date, our focus -- your question is relative to U.S. individual and U.S. individual primary, more comprehensive insurance. Our focus to-date for the past 2.5 years or so has been to pick a limited number of markets where we have a strong value proposition and then target and test a whole variety of product offerings, distribution strategies, et cetera, so we could test and learn and be in a better position as the marketplace moves going forward. And you see the results of that coming through our overall portfolio of business. Through that process, we've tested a whole variety of distribution strategies, and we've leveraged some of our non-U.S. experience, whereas we've talked about in the past and I mentioned, we have significant experience in terms of direct-to-consumer distribution, Internet-based distribution, affinity-based distribution and the like. As it relates to exchanges, as you very well know, there's a lot of moving parts still in the marketplace relative to exchanges. We have our internal view and our posture in terms of those markets using our Go Deep strategy that are highly strategic, and we have a bias to playing in. And our priority for the organization is to get the organization ready to both comply with and play in target markets from an exchange standpoint. But we're keenly focused on the amount of moving parts that exists within the regulatory environment and within the state and federal environment over the next 2 to 3 quarters.","David H. Windley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Very good. And then shifting for my follow-up over to operating expenses. You had talked about some investments from earlier in the year in technology and some other things. Wondered if you could give us an update on the progress there and if you're seeing the efficiency enhancement from those investments already. And then also, as you think about this realignment, I'd be curious to understand a little bit more deeply your decision process around dropping those savings to the bottom line versus reinvestment and how much reinvestment do you think you need to do?","Ralph J. Nicoletti","Sure, David. First, the investments we did make in the first half of the year are paying dividend for us in the back half on operating expense efficiencies, particularly the larger ones, as we had noted previously, was in the kind of the telecommunication infrastructure area, and that's benefiting us in the back half, as we expected. And that's reflected in our operating expense ratio in the third quarter and our full year projection. Maybe, David, you want to comment on the overall?","David M. Cordani","Absolutely. So expanding on, again, your rightful framework. I'll just pick the word you used, it's balance. The key for us in terms of executing our strategy is to make sure balancing both the near term, the intermediate term and the long term. What we're pleased with is that we've been able to deliver expense ratio improvement in each of the last years. And as we've noted, we will further improve the expense ratio looking into 2013. Above and beyond that, we were able to secure a program to identify additional efficiencies to target investments. Some of those investments will bear fruit relative to efficiencies. Some of them will be product capabilities and new solutions. And some market entr\u00e9e to further accelerate. So we're seeking that right balance, and I would submit to you that our results thus far as we've executed our strategy over the last 3 years, we've delivered double-digit EPS growth, operating expense efficiency and attractive revenue growth. That's the balance we're going to seek to have as we go forward as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","There's been somewhat of a reemergence of private exchanges, at least in the news. I guess what's your view here or what are you seeing or hearing in terms of the interest level, with the conversations you've had specifically with ASO clients.","David M. Cordani","Sure. Yes, there's been some dialogue in the marketplace around private exchanges. Broadly speaking, the way we think about them is it's another distribution mechanism, and it's a different way to frame the market. It's a way to capture choice and deliver it back to an individual for the employer. We think you'll see some movement in private exchanges over time. We've been actively managing and engaging in those activities. We're actively engaged today, and we think that'll be part of the equation as you go to the future. We don't think it'll be the sole equation, but it'll be part of the equation as you go to the future. Last thing I would add to it is going back to our non-U.S. experience, we have meaningful experience outside the U.S., where we now have over 10 million individual supplemental policies in force, including our joint venture in China. And we have significant experience working with affinity partners, working with electronic distribution, working with choice. And some of those, both marketing and distribution capabilities, will serve us well here in the United States as it relates to public exchange, private exchange or direct individual distribution. So it's a part of the equation going forward. We're actively engaged in it today. And we're going to leverage some of our non-U.S. capabilities to play there.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, any updated thoughts on the PBM and plans for HealthSpring or maybe even just timing on how you're thinking about that going into the New Year?","David M. Cordani","Ralph, broadly speaking, no directional change to our thought process around the PBM, so let me make sure I rearticulate what it is. Our PBM has been a strong performing asset for the corporation and for the benefit of our clients and customers. Our recent results yet reinforce that. It's a growing asset. It's contributing nicely. And when you think about pharmaceuticals as the #1 gap in care in America, it's an important clinical quality and service enhancer for our customers and clients. Having said that, once we're able to secure the acquisition of HealthSpring, it was acutely obvious that they can aggregate pharmacy capabilities of the company were going to grow. And therefore, we needed to make a conscious decision of how we wanted to grow that, and we've been very clear that we are thoughtful around making sure that we properly think through all scenarios that are in front of us relative to how we'll manage the PBM capabilities for Cigna, as well as for HealthSpring, which is now part of Cigna. The final note I would make is we understand that PBM is made up of a bunch of different parts: mail-order, retail, formulary management, et cetera, and we have a keen understanding of all those parts. The good news is we have a high-performing asset. It's a growing asset, and we have a large growing asset within HealthSpring, both of which have an opportunity to create a lot of value for both our customers and shareholders going forward.","Operator","Our last question comes from Sarah James with Wedbush.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","In the past, you've talked about cost trends benefiting from collaborative care models with hospitals. And with the HealthSpring acquisition, you have the opportunity to view things from the other side with captive clinics and improved understanding as you come to the negotiation table, as well as adding more members. So post these benefits from HealthSpring, how are you seeing unit cost increases developing versus past years, and how impactful do you think this has been on your enrollment growth or enrollment growth as it pertains to next year?","David M. Cordani","Sarah, it's David. An important topic and pretty rapidly evolving space, as we noted in prepared remarks, before we get to HealthSpring within Cigna, we now have 42 Collaborative Accountable Care organizations, which is our approach to alignment up and running for the benefit of our commercial customers. Within that portfolio, which started back in 2008, we see some meaningful improvement in both service and clinical quality, as well as some cost improvement for the benefit of our clients and customers. You're right to note that HealthSpring has well in excess of a decade of great experience around physician partnership. That's been a net beneficiary to the Medicare Advantage population that they serve today, serve very well and has continued to grow over time. As we look to the future, as we noted in our prepared remarks, partnering with physicians is a key part of the equation. It's a key part of the equation because it's the means in which you improve clinical quality, and you take relative costs out of the system and deliver more value. We're passionately committed to this, and we've seen enough proof points both through the HealthSpring model, as well as our model, to indicate that there is significant opportunity going forward. Lastly, I would say from a Cigna result standpoint, we're just at the early, early, early stages of seeing some of that come through, which is why this is so exciting as an opportunity to further generate quality and cost improvements that then convert over to benefit for our clients and customers. So more to follow on this.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just to clarify that last point there, if it's still in the early stages, is it too early to quantify how it may be impacting 2013 cost trends maybe from a unit cost side?","David M. Cordani","Yes, Sarah, for Cigna, so if I come back to the commercial population, if I take an individual client experience that has a lot of concentration in the Collaborative Accountable Care, you see some phenomenal results in clinical quality service results and overall cost trends. So you could see low single digits. You could see zeros in terms of cost trends when you take a well-designed benefit structure along with the Collaborative Accountable Care. The size of the coverage of our 12.5 million lives versus the number of lives that are going through these programs today tell you that it's muted in the averages that we talk about. But our approach in Go Deep is localized, so in those local geographies where those programs are running and with those employers that have high concentration, the results are outstanding, and we would expect to see more and more momentum. But to date, the aggregate numbers that Ralph walked through have a modest, modest, modest contribution because it's still a small part of the overall average. That's why we're excited about the future.","Operator","And I will now turn the call back over to Mr. David Cordani for closing remarks.","David M. Cordani","Thank you. In closing, I want to emphasize just a few key points from today's discussion. We delivered attractive revenue growth in each of our ongoing businesses and exceeded earnings expectations; our customer base grew, demonstrating the unique value we offer and our ability to retain and expand and acquire new clients and customers in our targeted segments; we continue to increase our strategic investments in targeted markets and customer segments while strengthening the value we offer customers and clients by further developing our differentiated capabilities in customer centricity, physician engagement and consultative distribution; and based on our third quarter results and momentum we've gained through the first 9 months of 2012, we're once again increasing our full year outlook for both earnings and capital available for deployment. We thank you for joining us on our call today, and we look forward to our future discussions.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Cigna's Third Quarter 2012 Results Review.
