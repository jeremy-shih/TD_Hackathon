Earnings Conference Call. My name is Marianna, and I will be your operator for today's call.","I will now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Agnes, you may begin.","Agnes Lee - ResMed, Inc.","Thank you, Marianna, and thank you for attending ResMed's live webcast. Joining me on the call today are Mick Farrell, our CEO, and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release it can be found on our website at investors.resmed.com.","I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company, corporate strategy, integration of acquisitions and performance.","We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in filings made by ResMed with the SEC.","I will now hand the call over to Mick Ferrell.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks, Agnes, and thank you to all of our shareholders who are joining us today, as we summarize our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. We achieved solid double-digit global revenue growth this quarter, led by sales from Brightree and strong growth in our device platform categories.","For the call today, I'll review high level financial results, outline regional highlights and then discuss progress towards our ResMed 2020 strategic goals. Then, I'll hand it over to Brett who will walk you through financial results in more detail.","We continued to see the benefits of our leadership in connected care. The ongoing value proposition of the AirSolutions software resulted in strong growth for device platforms in both sleep and ventilation. Brightree's value to providers also led to recurring Software as a Service revenue from that part of our business.","At the bottom line, in terms of non-GAAP net operating profit, we grew at 11% on a year-on-year basis in Q1. Including financing costs, our diluted earnings per share was $0.62 on a non-GAAP basis, which represents 5% year-on-year growth.","We continue to balance revenue growth, gross margin improvements as well as ongoing investments in both R&D as well as SG&A, as we prepare for upcoming product launches across our global markets.","Now for some regional highlights: The Americas region produced double-digit revenue growth. These results were fueled by Software as a Service revenue from Brightree and 10% growth in that region in devices. Device growth was up against a robust 40% year-over-year comparable. The mask and accessories category in the Americas was flat in the quarter. We are very confident that we will drive strong growth with mask technology that we are launching this quarter. Just yesterday we started selling our brand new AirFit F20 product into our European market and we will launch another mask technology imminently in Europe.","We tested both of these technologies with customers during the quarter and they were very well received in market trials with physicians, providers, and with patients. We plan to launch these new technologies into the Americas market during the current quarter. We are incredibly excited about these new products.","In the Americas region, growth in devices was driven by the ongoing strength of the AirSense 10 and AirCurve 10 systems, powered by the cloud-based AirSolutions Software platform including AirView, U-Sleep and myAir offerings. In addition, we also saw solid performance in our respiratory care device platforms with the launch of cloud connected Astral ventilation systems.","We achieved good growth in our combined EMEA and APAC regions with balanced contributions from both devices and mask categories. We are now on a solid positive growth trajectory in ASV therapy in the region. We're seeing good growth in patient groups including central sleep apnea, complex sleep apnea and pain management. We will see mask and accessories growth accelerate as we move forward with current and very near future product launches in the category as well as ongoing resupply partnerships throughout fiscal year 2017.","We will show some of our new mask technologies to physicians and providers in the U.S. next week at Medtrade. Patient, physician and provider feedback from controlled product launches have been excellent and we know these masks will be very well received as they transition to full market launch.","Let me now provide an update on our ResMed 2020 growth strategy. We continue to lead the field of connected care, one of the key foundations of our growth strategy. We have high-quality Software-as-a-Service revenue from Brightree that continues to grow strongly. We are on track with our work to integrate Brightree software functionality with our core AirSolutions platform.","We continue to invest in a portfolio of cloud-based computing solutions that help HME customers become even more efficient and help them free up cash flow that can be reinvested to drive even better patient care.","Connected care solutions are improving operating efficiency, eliminating waste, increasing therapy adherence and improving patient outcomes. We are growing our connected care solutions in COPD as well as linking our technology to include other chronic care applications. This technology is a valuable asset that we will continue to leverage and provide insight to channel partners. This foundation of connected care is an integral part of our long-term strategic plan.","Let me now take a few minutes to update you on the progress against each of the three horizons in our 2020 growth strategy and then I'll hand over to Brett. In our first horizon of growth, which focuses on our core sleep-apnea business, we have achieved sustained year on year growth since the launch of the AirSolutions platform more than eight quarters ago.","We were a sponsor at the annual meeting of AdvaMed, the Advanced Medical Technology Association that was held last week in Minneapolis. One of the main themes at AdvaMed 2016 was the importance of digital health, and the convergence of technology from data analytics to connectivity to patient engagement.","This represents a significant shift from two to three years ago. I was on a panel titled Unlocking the Transformative Potential of the Internet of things, with colleagues from Deloitte and Medtronic, one of the other med-tech leaders in this area of connected care. While many companies are talking about digital health and connected care strategies, just a few of us are leading the way to value.","We now have well over 2 million 100% cloud connected medical devices sitting on patient's bedside tables, liberating data every day. We turn Big Data into actionable information, which can unlock value for the patient, the provider, the physician and the payor. We are helping to reduce costs for providers and improve outcomes for patients. With our expertise in sleep and respiratory medicine, we are also taking the lead with digital patient engagement tools that drive therapy adherence.","Since we launched AirSolutions, we have been actively involved in clinical studies that show increased patient adherence and customer efficiencies, as well as demonstrate the value of our AirSolutions platform. Technologies like their AirView and U-Sleep improve patient adherence from baselines of 50% to 60% adherence all the way up to 80% adherence and above. These are game-changing capabilities.","We just announced the results from the world's largest study on sleep apnea and connected care using our MyAir technology. This study included over 128,000 patients. These data will be presented at the Chest Medical Meeting tomorrow in Los Angeles and without stealing too much thunder from the investigators, at the highest level, these online self-monitoring tools engage patients and improve adherence to therapy.","In the MyAir study, we showed an absolute increase in adherence of approximately 17 percentage points. This represents a relative increase in adherence of over 24%. This adherence study was executed in our core sleep apnea market, but we know that these technologies and capabilities can be applied to our ventilation and to our portable oxygen concentrator technologies for use in patients with COPD, neuromuscular disease and other chronic diseases.","During the quarter, we enhanced myAir with the launch of a new smartphone app, which has been very well received by patients. We now have well over 1,000 patients each day signing up for the myAir app. Patients love getting a daily myAir score for their sleep, learning about the quality of their sleep and learning about the quality of their breathing at night. Patients like to engage with their sleep health as much or more than their exercise health and the nutrition health. Our view is that these are three equal parts for good overall preventative healthcare.","Moving on to the second horizon of our ResMed 2020 growth strategy. This quarter we announced positive results from a randomized controlled trial in the field of home oxygen therapy and home mechanical ventilation. The Acronym for this trial is HOT HMV. The data from this study were presented in September at the European Respiratory Society Congress in London.","In HOT HMV, patients who received non-invasive ventilation in addition to home oxygen therapy had an astounding 51% decreased risk of re-hospitalization or death in the first year compared to patients who received oxygen therapy alone. Additionally, the patients who received at home NIV and oxygen experienced an average of 4.3 months without a hospital admission or death compared to 1.4 months for those on oxygen alone.","The reduction in mortality speaks for itself for caregivers and loved ones. The extra almost 90 days without hospitalization also speaks to government payors and to private payors. In the U.S. market, hospitals face a Medicare payment penalty if COPD patients are readmitted to hospital within 30 days for any reason. A future where NIV and portable oxygen concentrators are standard of care to reduce mortality and reduce hospitalizations in COPD patients upon discharge is well within our second-horizon view.","Turning to progress in our respiratory care product portfolio, more broadly, we launched cloud-connected conductivity for the Astral platform. We continue to enhance AirSolutions to provide more value for Astral so that it can provide value for COPD and neuromuscular disease patients and beyond. We are on track with the Inova acquisition integration process and we're leveraging our quality systems and product development expertise to further improve the Activox portable oxygen concentrator or POC platform. We expect to make good progress in the global rollout of Activox over the following 90 days and beyond. We have significant opportunities to grow POC revenue by selling through our global market channels throughout fiscal year 2017.","COPD, as a reminder, is the number three cause of death in the Western world and it is the number two cause of re-hospitalization. We know that our spectrum of cloud connected respiratory care products across our portfolio will play a big role in reducing costs for providers and improving outcomes to millions of patients with this debilitating disease.","Our third horizon of growth includes a portfolio of long-term opportunities including sleep health and wellness, atrial fibrillation, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and the broader field of chronic disease management. In the area of sleep health and wellness, we announced a sleep awareness partnership with The Dr. Oz Show through the use of the S+ by ResMed device. The S+ is the world's first non-wearable sleep device and smartphone app designed to help people track, better understand and improve their sleep. Dr. Oz dedicated an entire show to the field of sleep wellness with guests including Dr. Michael Bruce, a board certified sleep specialist and Arianna Huffington, the Co-founder of the Huffington Post who has written broadly about the importance of sleep health.","The sleep awareness campaign involves selling thousands of S+ devices and tracking anonymous sleep data to create a database with over one 1 million nights of sleep. Dr. Oz plans to calculate what he calls America's overall Sleep Score and to announce the results at the Consumer Electronics Show or CES in Las Vegas early in 2017.","For ResMed, this is about driving the importance of sleep health and helping consumers realize that they need to go see their doctor if they have any risky breathing or shortness of breath. These and other signs and symptoms of sleep apnea and COPD impact overall sleep health and overall health. This will be a critical part of the overall sleep awareness work.","Moving from sleep awareness to hard clinical data, we presented positive results from the CAT-HF trial this quarter. The randomized clinical trial results were presented at the Heart Failure Society of America Annual Conference in Florida last month by the cardiologist and electrophysiologist Dr. Jonathan Piccini. Dr. Piccini's analysis showed a reduction in atrial fibrillation burden for heart failure patients who used ResMed's Adaptive-Servo Ventilation, or ASV therapy to treat their sleep disorder breathing. This is the first study to show that addressing sleep disorder breathing with ASV may improve cardiovascular outcomes for patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. This is a large population of heart failure patients for which there is no Class 1A guideline therapy.","Researchers are finalizing the manuscript for full publication of the CAT-HF study. We are excited about the patient outcome data and the potential opportunities to save hospitalization costs for the healthcare system globally.","Let me close with this. We are incredibly excited about the ongoing launch of our new mask technologies globally. We continue to lead in connected care with enhanced solutions that lower costs for providers and improve outcomes for patients. Customers are voting for this technology by signing up for our patient engagement apps and by voting with their wallets. We are also leading the industry driving consumer awareness of sleep so that undiagnosed consumers go to see their doctors and healthcare providers for diagnosis and for treatment.","We look forward to executing on our strategies to benefit physicians, providers, payors, and most importantly to improve the lives of tens of millions of undiagnosed sleep apnea and COPD patients around the world as we move forward.","With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett for more comments. Over to you, Brett.","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 with more detailed commentary around revenue, given our recent acquisitions last fiscal year.","As Mick noted, we had a solid start to the year. Group revenue for the September quarter was $465.4 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue also increased by 13%. Excluding the acquisition of Brightree, revenue increased by 5% over the prior year quarter.","Excluding all acquisitions, organic revenue increased by 3% over the prior year quarter. Taking a closer look at the geographic level and excluding revenue from our Brightree acquisition, our sales in the Americas were $267.9 million, an increase of 5% over the prior-year quarter. Sales in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific totaled $164.5 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific increased by 5% over the prior year quarter.","Breaking out revenue between product segments, Americas' device sales were $145.6 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $122.3 million consistent with the prior-year quarter. For revenue in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific, device sales were $113.6 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms also an increase of 6%.","Masks and other sales were $50.9 million, an increase of 2% over the prior-year quarter and in constant currency terms an increase of 4%. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 8%, while masks and other increased by 1% over the prior-year quarter. Brightree revenue for the first quarter was $33.1 million.","During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers \u2013 the non-GAAP measures adjusted the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles and one-time expense associated with the field safety notification. In the prior year comparable, I've excluded the amortization of acquired intangibles. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our first quarter earnings press release. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the September quarter was 58.9%. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin increased by 90 basis points, reflecting manufacturing and procurement efficiencies and the favorable impact from our Brightree acquisition, partially offset by an unfavorable but moderating product mix and typical declines in average selling prices. On a sequential basis, our gross margin increased by 70 basis points, largely attributable to manufacturing and procurement efficiencies. Assuming current exchange rates and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we are narrowing our guidance range and expect gross margins to be in the range of 58% to 60% for fiscal year 2017.","Moving on to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $128.9 million, an increase of 16% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 15%. Excluding the impact from acquisitions, our SG&A expenses increased by 6% in constant currency terms. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 27.7% compared to 27% that we reported last year. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 27% to 28% for fiscal year 2017.","R&D expenses for the quarter were $34.4 million, an increase of 27% over the prior-year quarter, or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 21%. This increase largely reflects the impact of our recent acquisitions and incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. Excluding the impact from acquisitions, our R&D expenses increased by 8% in constant currency terms. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 7.4% compared to the year-ago figure of 6.6%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for fiscal year 2017.","Amortization of acquired intangibles was $11.7 million for the quarter, an increase of $9.4 million over the prior year, reflecting the additional amortization associated with our recent acquisitions. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $12 million.","Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $111 million, an increase of 11% over the prior-year quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $87.7 million, an increase of 4% over the prior-year quarter. Net income for the quarter was $76.1 million. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.62, an increase of 5% over the prior-year quarter, while diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.54.","Overall, foreign exchange movements negatively impacted first quarter earnings by $0.01 per share, reflecting the unfavorable impact from the weaker British pound and a stronger Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.","On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.1%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2017 will be in the range of 20% to 22%.","During the quarter, we initiated a field safety notification regarding potential degraded battery performance in our Astral device. Under the notification, we will replace all the batteries in our Astral devices. In our Q1 GAAP results, we have recognized a charge of $5.1 million for the expected cost associated with this action.","Cash flow from operations was $86.2 million for the quarter. This reflects strong underlying earnings offset to some extent by an increasing net working capital balances during the quarter. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $14.6 million. Depreciation and amortization for the September quarter totaled $27.8 million.","Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.33 per share, an increase of 10% over our prior-year quarterly dividend. As previously announced, we have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to recent acquisitions. At present, we expect to recommence the buyback in fiscal year 2018.","At September 30, we had approximately $1.2 billion in gross debt and $391 million in net debt. Our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels. At September 30, total assets were $3.3 billion and net equity was $1.8 billion.","And, with that, I will hand the call back to Agnes.","Agnes Lee - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A and we ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question. If you have any additional question after that, please get back into the queue. Mariana, we're now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Steve Wheen from Evans & Partners, your line is open.","Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.","Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask about the Brightree revenue growth. Just wondering, in the quarter whether or not you've seen any pushback from DMEs with regards to ResMed owning that particular software.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks for the question, Steve. No, we haven't seen customers moving out of the Brightree system since ResMed acquired or announced the acquisition in February or closed the acquisition in April or has formally moved forward from then. So, we've had a good eight months of customers being aware of this, and what we've seen is customer love the value that's been provided. And they actually \u2013 I think the customers I've spoken to love the fact that there's a multibillion-dollar public company that's going to make sure they invest cash in this business for the long run, which is investing in the infrastructure and extracting value for our HME provider customers and adding even more value, as we integrate some of the functionality from Brightree, as we said in some of the prepared remarks, between Brightree and our broader AirSolutions platform across sleep apnea and COPD.","Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.","Okay. And is the gross margin on that revenue similar to what was reported when you gave the historical figures for Brightree when it was acquired?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. Brett, do you want to drill down into some of the GM implications pre and post acquisition for Steve?","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. Steve, it's Brett. I mean, yeah, that's pretty consistent with when we filed the 8-K, for example, on profitability ratios and, obviously, Brightree contributes to our gross margin there as well. Let's just say, we've got \u2013 I mean, it's consistent with our expectations. We're very pleased with how we're progressing and how Brightree is progressing. So I think that's good, probably, business there and it's definitely meeting our expectation.","Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.","All right. Thanks very much.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks for the question, Steve.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ben Andrew with William Blair. Your line is open.","Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC","All right. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Mick, can you \u2013 or maybe Brett, can you talk about kind of the flat M&A or mask and accessory growth in the quarter? Maybe what are the inputs to that? Was it, perhaps, some people holding out purchases typical at the end of the quarter in front of the new product launch because you've been pretty vocal about having stuff coming?","And then my follow-up is, within the 10% device growth, can you give us some flavor about the product mix and what the bigger drivers were within that across the range?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. So, first, the EMEA and APAC masks and accessory growth was 4%. Americas was flat. Obviously, we showed these new technologies at the European Respiratory Society Congress in September and, as you noted, Ben, we've been pretty public about that and so it had been out in the public forum. There may have been some impact on Americas' customers knowing that new products will be coming to market soon in terms of their purchases during the September quarter. But look, the way that we look at it is, we've got some excellent first results here on our controlled product launches on this product, the F20. It's an excellent full face mask that we think is going to be incredibly successful as we've tested it out there. And certainly, there were some customers testing it in the Americas and some customers testing it in Europe, and we did show it at the conference there in European Respiratory Society, but we do expect very significant growth for this throughout fiscal 2017 and we will launch the product, as I said, we launched it yesterday in Europe. And we will launch it \u2013 another technology into Europe and both technologies we plan to launch into the U.S. this quarter. So, I do think the future looks pretty exciting on that front.","To the devices, breaking out the 10% year-on-year growth in devices in the Americas, we don't typically break it out precisely between how much was ventilation and how much of the growth was sleep, but we talk about the sleep apnea market generally growing in that sort of mid to high single-digit number and devices growing in the mid single-digits and masks growing at the high single-digits. So you can sort of look at that 10% and say, well, if it's mid single-digits on the sleep flow generators then there's some incremental growth from the ventilation and the portable oxygen concentrators on top of that.","Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. And, I guess, if you'll allow me, I'll just ask about Activox and how you might size the OUS opportunity as you launch that over fiscal 2017 because that's the first you talked about that rolling out more broadly? Thanks.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah, absolutely. Well, Ben, we'll give an update next quarter as we really start to roll that out. The point I was making in this call is that we've now got the quality to a level that we like and that we are launching it now throughout not only U.S. but our global sales forces over the coming quarter. And as you know, the sale cycle on POCs is an S-curve and you start to ramp that up this quarter, but we'll give an update in 90 days as to the progress on that. Thanks for the questions, Ben.","Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Will Dunlop from Merrill Lynch is on the line with a question.","William Dunlop - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just firstly wanted to ask you about SG&A growth accelerated this quarter, and I'm wondering whether that's related to the upcoming product launches or if there's something else in there, if you could talk about that would be great. Thanks.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Will, there are two factors involved in SG&A. One is the absorption of some of the acquisitions we've made and that has contributed to the SG&A. And in addition to that, as you noted, we're launching two new masks in Europe and we plan to launch them in the Americas and these things that we prepare for. We've done them many times, but you do prepare for them in terms of the marketing, promotional capabilities and so on. So, those two factors of the acquisitions and the preparation to new product launches were both factors in the SG&A.","William Dunlop - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks. And then, on gross margin, despite what seems to be quite a negative product mix effect in the U.S., you still posted very strong non-GAAP gross margin relative to the last few quarters. Can you just talk to the pricing environment in the U.S. and whether you are seeing pressure to cut prices and whether you think you will, as a result of Medicare funding cuts that went live in July? Thanks.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Will, I'll take the second part of that and I will hand it to Brett for the first part of that on the broader GM review and what's going on there. But with regard to pricing, we haven't seen anything out of the ordinary in pricing. You know this. Obviously, we don't break it out in detail here, but what I'd say is we've seen sort of what we've seen traditionally in year-on-year price deltas in our U.S. and other markets, throughout the whole CB process, it's been very visual and open as to what the new prices will be, and we've been working with our customers as soon as prices were announced six months ago, not as they start to go into play during this sort of July, August, September quarter. So, pretty steady as she goes in terms of historic price deltas there.","But, Brett, do you want to provide a little color for Will with regard to what's happening there with GM?","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Sure. Yeah. So, I mean, even though the product mix continued to be unfavorable for us, it's certainly moderating. That headwind has definitely moderated in this quarter, which is good. And the other thing also on ASVs, which is a pretty big headwind, our ASVs returned to a growth trajectory, and that's helping us on the product mix piece of this. It's not a headwind now.","The biggest component there, I think, that has been driving through on the margins being manufacturing and procurement and sort of really getting some traction on those cost-out programs that we've been running all the time, but it's becoming more evident because of that product mix moderating. So, that's sort of working through.","As you know, the first 12 months we couldn't really work on it. We were really concentrating or focusing on just meeting demand. But as we've worked through the last 12 months, we've been really able to ratchet up that program and the team's done a great job just working through on the various cost-out programs, particularly for the platforms. And that's definitely now flowing through on the gross margin. And, I guess, the other one, obviously, the Brightree acquisition is a meaningful contributor as well.","So, I mean, I guess, you're saying some of these headwinds are perhaps turning into tailwinds. So we're seeing that come through on the gross margin.","William Dunlop - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","David Low with JPMorgan is online with a question.","David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.","Thanks very much. If we could now return to Brightree, I was just wondering if you could talk to the level of growth you've seen given we don't have much in the way of historics and perhaps some sense as to what integration benefits or what the opportunity feels like it could be now that you've owned it for, I think, you said, eight months?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. Look, the Brightree growth is in that sort of low-to-mid teens, low teens sort of area, good solid double-digit growth. It's 80, 90%-plus recurring revenue there, David. So the Brightree business is a very solid and strong recurring revenue business. It's providing incredible value to providers automating process flows for inventory management, clinical informatics management, revenue cycle management in terms of ensuring payment and also even managing physician scripts.","And so, when you think about the synergistic value, if you like, between a customer who is operating on ResMed's AirSolutions for patient engagement through myAir and physician engagement through AirView and now HME engagement through Brightree, there are many of those workflows that you can look to if you are removing costs from the front-end of patient engagement and the back-end of inventory management that there can be synergies in saving those costs for the HME provider.","And so, we are working with all our customers who use both AirSolutions, Brightree and particularly those who use both to really help them garner those savings in their own operating costs to improve their own P&L and free up more of their own cash flow to then reinvest in better patient care and drive adherence rates up of the likes of what we've seen in the myAir study and the U-Sleep where we're able to achieve 80-plus percent adherence rates. That's a win for the patient obviously, but it's also a win for the physician getting the patient on therapy and the provider in terms of keeping that sleep apnea patient on good therapy and ongoing resupply.","David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.","All right. Thanks. And if I could just change topics a little bit. You talked about the connected devices and I think more than 2 million connected with AirSolutions now. Just making sure that I understand, I mean, this is AirSense, AirCurve products, are the vast majority of those devices that you've sold effectively, connected devices now?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yes. Since we launched the AirSense 10 and AirCurve 10 lines, every single sleep apnea non-invasive ventilation device that we've sold has communications capabilities in it and so we have more than 2 million of them \u2013 well over 2 million of them sending data to the cloud every day, so that if it's sent at 6:30 in the morning, we call it the halo, hour after last off, by 7:30 in the morning those data are available for the patient that they can review on myAir, for the doctor if they go see them at an 8 o'clock appointment on AirView and even for the government of Finland or United Blue Cross Blue Shield in terms of their population health management into their systems that very day.","David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.","All right. Thanks very much.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks, David.","Operator","Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets is online with a question.","Matthew Henriksson - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. This is Matt Henriksson in for Joanne. Our questions for \u2013 first for R&D and we're looking to see whether or not this increase in guidance is kind of the short-term related to acquisitions and integration or if this is kind of more of a longer-term strategy? And then my follow-up question is, with regards to the Curative acquisition, we're at the one-year mark. Is there any observations that you've made that were different from your initial expectations? Thank you very much.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks for the questions, Matt and I'll hand both of those, actually, over to Rob Douglas, our President and COO.","Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.","Yes, thanks, Matt. Yes, the R&D increase largely has been around bringing the acquisitions in and the engineering work that we wanted to do make sure quality is right and really synchronizing the roadmaps and making sure everything is on track. We're committed to innovating in our industry and we see the R&D program sort of continuing apace. We've got a lot more things on our roadmaps than what we can actually do and a lot more plans and ideas and anything we can invest sensibly into the R&D program we will.","On to your other question regarding Curative, you're asking about any differences from how the early integration program went? We're really encouraged with Curative and its position in the Chinese market. The whole Chinese economy has had some interesting developments and changes and things going on like anticorruption drives and stuff like that have made the market continue to be interesting. We still see a huge opportunity there just in terms of the number of untreated patients, both in obstructive sleep apnea and also in the number of untreated COPD patients in the standard of care there.","We're making great progress on the integration program. We're very happy with the role of a few key players that we've got in China at the moment. We've got Justin Leong, who's sort of heading up our Asia Growth Markets Group and Jason Sun, who's remained as the CEO of the Curative subsidiary and together they are bringing together the team of Curative and ResMed and we're the major player in treating sleep disorder breathing and long-term ventilation in China and we've got lots of good plans to further develop that.","Operator","Andrew Goodsall from UBS is online with a question.","Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.","Thanks very much for taking my question. I just want to know if you've got any early feedback on the launch of the new 20 series mask just from the market testing that you're doing? And then just a follow-up question is, to what extent does your outlook or your upgrade gross margin consider that new mask launch?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks for the questions, Andrew. Yeah, clearly, we've got some really good early data from the controlled product launches of F20 in Europe and in the U.S. markets in these sort of controlled product launches where we've had customers looking at the product, putting it on patients, seeing how the setup goes for a provider and working with physicians so that they can see the change of care. The F20 is a fabulous full face mask, one of the best I've seen that ResMed's produced and I think as you look forward over the next number of quarters, this thing is going to be a real winner for us.","To your second part about upgrading our gross margin guidance, I'll let Brett go into that in more detail. But at a high level, yeah, there's a combination of ASV. As Brett said earlier, ASV has turned from a headwind now to tailwind. Mask growth is at its nadir here as we transition from two-year-old mask products to brand-new mask product and both of those tailwinds in terms of positive GM contributions. But Brett, any further color on that for GM?","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. Maybe we try to look at that and try to factor that in. As you know on gross margin, it's always hard to predict because you've got ASP movements, FX, product mix, geographic mix, what we do in manufacturing and procurement. What happens with how the acquisitions go on and so on, so sort of pool that in. But, I guess we're getting kind of more confidence in the range there on the margin and certainly we saw some really good improvements on the margin in Q1. And clearly we look to build on those.","But in terms of the product mix, to the extent that the mask growth accelerates, then we think these masks will be successful and we do think we'll get shares back with these masks and clearly that's going to be supportive of the gross margin. And then it just depends on relative mix of devices versus masks and so on. But it certainly is \u2013 the expectation is those new masks will be supportive of the gross margin. I mean, you'd have to think that.","Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.","Yeah. Terrific. Thank you.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","Matthew O'Brien from Piper Jaffray is on the line with a question.","Matt O'Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks a lot for taking the questions. Just to follow up a little bit on the mask commentary, given that you have rolled that out internationally and we're going to see it next week at MedTrade, could you just talk a little bit about what are some of the unique or differentiating points that you see in the mask versus what you've been selling and how should we think about things from the cannibalization and pricing perspective? Is this environment one where you can ask for some uplift in pricing versus what you are charging right now?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks for the question, Matt. I'll take the second part, and then I'll hand the first part to Rob to talk about some of the features of the F20. Yeah. With regard to pricing, we work very carefully with our customers in each of the 100 countries we're selling to and each market we're launching to. This is some very innovative technology in these multiple mask technologies that we're bringing to market. And we are certainly working with customers to understand that value and ensure the price is appropriately in line with that value. And, so I see it rolling in as we traditionally have with our mask launches at appropriate pricing that takes account of the value but also takes account of the realistic nature of the markets in which we're selling in the healthcare world. Rob, do you want to take the second part?","Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.","Sure.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","The first part of the question, second.","Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. These masks are really about comfort and feel and ease-of-use. Our early testing \u2013 all of our mask development programs are heavily involved with working with patients and trying ideas and working through, and it's sort of iterative, it keeps going. But we believe the F20 and the N20 have really superior seal and that they just don't leak, and that they're more comfortable and easy to use than earlier masks.","To your question of cannibalization, the market will pull out as to what are the preferences, and people will have to develop their preferences over time for that, and so that will take some time to fallout. But we are extremely excited about the response that we've already had on these masks.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. What I would add on there is, if there is any cannibalization, it's cannibalization of some of the competitors' positions in full face and nasal. So we will not only keep going in the market as we are with Dr. Oz and reaching out to new patients in, but I think we'll be taking some good share in these categories as we launch this amazing new mask technology.","Matt O'Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. And then as a follow-up, just a little bit more color on the North American generator performance in the quarter. You had Astral, you said ASV is a tailwind, you are benefiting somewhat from the COPD purchase. Is it fair \u2013 and I know you have a really difficult comp here in fiscal Q1, but is it fair to say that that business is actually down when you exclude those other products or was it still positive?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","No, it was still up. We are not going to break it out in detail, but what I said earlier, I'll say again, which is the sleep market is growing mid-to-high single digits where the devices are growing mid-single digits, masks growing at high-single digits. We held share in our sleep devices.","Matt O'Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. Thank you.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Victor Windeyer from Citi is online with a question.","Victor Windeyer - Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd.","Yeah. Hi. Thanks very much. Look I just wanted to understand mask growth a little bit more, if I can on . The high-single digit mask rise, perhaps you could, like in the industry, if you like, but perhaps you could break out what is your number one volume growth and what the, I guess, the key factors are that are driving that. How long that can continue for?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yes. Thanks for the question, Vic. With regard to mask growth, revenues and volume, we don't break out pricing delta. What we acknowledged in the prep remarks and I'll say again, we lost some share in masks in the quarter. If masks are growing at high-single digits in the U.S. market and we're growing 01, then we're losing some share. We're very confident with the new masks we are launching. Well, we are launching today, yesterday in Europe and over this quarter. We plan to launch them again in the U.S. and beyond in global markets that we will get back to not only strong market growth, but above market growth as I alluded to earlier. These are great masks that will move us up there. So we're seeing good market growth of mid-to-high single digits in masks and there's always price declines to play in there, so you've got low-double digit growth in volumes of masks in the market that really hasn't changed from Q4 to Q1. It's more about the product lifecycle of our two-year old masks and the brand new ones that are just coming to market.","Victor Windeyer - Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd.","Okay. I guess, I was interested in understanding the importance of your informatics platforms to driving growth in the mask and supply side, and whether you can with your position there, you may get a better part of the share of that going forward?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. Clearly we have a very large investment in the infrastructure with healthcare informatics and AirSolutions. There's a much more direct relationship between the informatics and the connected care and the value we provide to the device growth. We've seen that very strong for now, eight quarters since the launch of AirSolutions, AirSense 10 and AirCurve 10. There is a connection to masks. Clearly, it's often linked when you think about it all the way through to the ReSupply program. So we have ResMed ReSupply, we have Brightree Connect. We have a number of offerings in the U.S. market, a number of different offerings for customers in EMEA and APAC where the go-to-market models are different.","We're engaging patients better than ever. Patients are signing up to understand things like myAir and as part of that we're absolutely contacting patients to let them know when it's time for a new mask and then to push them through the system. And, so I do think that \u2013 and different markets of the world there's different ways of doing that.","You're going to see \u2013 as you look forward over FY 2017, 2018 and beyond, a lot more interplay not only between the informatics and device, informatics and masks but also informatics in chronic disease management, keeping these patients out of hospital and providing holistic value to the healthcare system by what we can do.","Victor Windeyer - Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd.","Okay. Thanks so much.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks for the questions.","Operator","Saul Hadassin from Credit Suisse is on line with a question.","Saul Hadassin - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd.","Thanks and good morning, guys. Mick, maybe the first question on the Astral and just if you could talk to what impact, if any, that field safety notice had? Also on sales and just what you see in terms of take-up of that device in the non-invasive ventilation category, please.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. So I'll take the second part and hand the first part of it to Rob. Sales of the Astral in terms of its use, it's pretty broad. It's different in every market in the world and in Germany, it's far more used as a life support ventilator and in the life support ventilation side. In the U.S., it's kind of split between Duchenne muscular dystrophy, neuromuscular disease and COPD.","With the changes in reimbursement that have been announced recently and have been ongoing for a year-plus in the COPD side, we've actually been focusing since we have no entrenched sales in this field saying to the customers, do you want non-invasive ventilation like an AirCurve 10 SST Bi-Level type product or do you want Astral and for which types of patients would you choose this? We are working with physicians and providers to do that.","And so, we're really partnering with our HMEs and with the physicians to make sure and keeping the whole context of the healthcare economics that are involved to make sure that the right therapy goes on the right patient and that it's sustainable over time. So that's how we look at NIV as well as LSV for neuromuscular disease and COPD.","But as for the field safety notice, Rob, do you want to?","Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. So I'll just give a bit of background on it. We had a small number of reports of degraded battery performance. But there continue to be no adverse health effects from the degraded performance. And there are very clear mitigations for patients around it. But we felt it was the right thing to do to put out the field safety notice and alert ventilator-dependent patients and their carers about the issue, how they should mitigate the risks and where appropriate how to arrange for replacement batteries.","It's a rolling replacement program. It is proceeding well, and we are communicating closely on an ongoing basis with the customers for this. We have to manage the patient population very, very carefully, of course, with this type of device. But the program is running along to plan at this stage.","Saul Hadassin - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd.","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks for the question, Saul.","Operator","Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley is online with a question.","Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.","Good morning, everybody. Two quick questions. Mick, the first one is the \u2013 and I might have missed it, the time to full rollout of the new mask series. So when will it be available to all of your customers?","And, secondly, I don't know if you could give us a sense of organic growth. I know you've split out Brightree nicely for us but broad organic growth for the rest of the business would be great.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","So I'll take the first part, and I'll give the second part of the question to Brett. So the time to the full rollout \u2013 one thing, we're obviously very open here on a public conference call, but we don't want to give full indication to our competitors as to the date, the time and the hour of the launch of the F20 in each of the specific country markets.","I'll talk broadly to the fact that we've launched in Western Europe yesterday. So this is available across major countries in Western Europe already and that our plan is to launch into the Americas and the U.S. specifically this quarter. But I don't really want to go into any more granularity than that for competitive reasons on this call, Sean. But I can tell you this thing is going to take off and it's going to be a very valuable mask as it rolls to each of those countries as we launch it.","Brett, do you want to have a breakdown of the acquisition versus organic growth question?","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Sure. I mentioned that earlier Sean, so the organic growth in revenue for us was 3% this quarter.","Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.","Okay, great. Thank you. That's all I have, guys. Thank you very much.","Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.","Great.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks, Sean.","Operator","Matt Taylor from Barclays is on line with a question.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I appreciate the breakdown of the acquisitions. Can you just talk about not just the top-line growth, how much did acquisitions contribute to the bottom line this quarter?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Brett?","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Yes. Matt, we've sort of broken down and given more details in terms of revenue but we haven't gone down line by line or segmentation out in terms of the acquisition. So at this discussion, we would prefer to keep it that way.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Just curious...","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","I will say that, you know, I mean, you know that in the 8-K on Brightree, for example, which is the largest acquisition by far, the ratios are not inconsistent with historical, so that will give you at least a sense of it.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful.","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Yes.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And then, I want to address, there has been a number of initiatives that have been talked about by the government in terms of being on kind of a watchlist with sleep testing with vents. I guess, is that a risk that you see for any of those parts of your business or do you think this is sort of just normal activity on the part of the government with regard to some of their investigations?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yes, Matt, look, I think the government has regularly looked at their spending in all parts of healthcare whether it's in pharma, in different areas of med-tech and clearly, this is something that is important to make sure that the government's money is invested well.","There are 40 million to 60 million Americans who suffer from sleep apnea and we've only got 6 million of them who are suffocating \u2013 6 million of them on therapy. We need to get to the other tens of millions and it needs to be done appropriately and economically. And we are partnering with every government where we do business to make sure that we can appropriately and economically diagnose and treat those patients and keep them out of the hospital care system because it's much less expensive to have a patient safely breathing at home than badly breathing and needing to visit the ICU or CCU.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks for the thoughts.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Chris Kallos from Morningstar is online with a question.","Chris Kallos - Morningstar Australasia Pty Ltd.","Thank you for taking my question. Sorry to go back to gross margin, but just on the Brightree acquisition, I think previously you've mentioned that that would have added between 70 basis points and 100 basis points. And I'm just comparing that to the actual results this time around, and I know there are multiple factors here but can we \u2013 is it possible to sort of get a correlation between what you expected Brightree and what it actually has added this time around to gross margin?","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. Chris, this is Brett. It would be that the Brightree contributed at the top of that range for this quarter.","Chris Kallos - Morningstar Australasia Pty Ltd.","So out of the 90 basis points, most of that is Brightree?","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","No, there's basically positive and negative, right, so it's going to be \u2013 in absolute terms it's going to be, as I said, on top of that range we said I think 70 to 100 and that's towards the top of that range in terms of basis point contribution. But then in case you have any impacts from ASP declines, you have negative impacts from product mix still flowing through. But we had good contributions, very strong contribution from manufacturing procurement improvements and then also Brightree. They're probably the kind of the four big elements that are playing out on the gross margins. So you can't \u2013 you've got kind of -it's a mix situation that you end up with.","Chris Kallos - Morningstar Australasia Pty Ltd.","Sure. So, it's tracking as expected more or less?","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.","Chris Kallos - Morningstar Australasia Pty Ltd.","Yeah. And Brett, can I just trouble you for the device sales non-U.S? Again, I just missed that number.","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Device sales non-U.S. 6% was the EMEA and APAC constant currency growth.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah.","Chris Kallos - Morningstar Australasia Pty Ltd.","Yeah. Okay. Perfect. Great. That's it for me. Thank you.","Michael J.

There are also other members of the management team here present that will be available to answer questions.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mick Farrell. Mick, go ahead.","Michael J. Farrell","Great. Thanks, Connie, and thank you, all, for joining us today. I'll review the highlights of our fiscal Q1, and then hand the call over to Brett to go through the quarter in more detail.","So first, the financial summary. Global revenue in Q1 of fiscal 2014 grew 5% year-on-year, to $358 million, that's up 4% on a constant-currency basis.","Americas revenue grew 4% to $202 million. Europe, Asia and the rest of the world headline revenue increased 7% for the quarter, which is 5% growth in constant currency terms. We believe the overall global growth of the industry remained steady at 6% to 8%, with global flow generator growth in the 4% to 6% range and global Mask category growth at approximately 8% to 10%.","Net income for the quarter increased 14% to $81 million, while earnings per share increased 14% to $0.56 for the quarter. This bottom line result demonstrates strong global operating performance from the team.","I'm going to start with an overview on Europe, where we saw a strong regional growth, with solid performance in many countries, including France -- particularly France, the U.K., as well as Switzerland. Both our German homecare business and our German dealer business also grew strongly.","The European results were driven by strength in both flow generators and Masks. One of the main drivers of flow generator growth in Europe was the AutoSet CS product. This product includes the proprietary PaceWave algorithm that is designed for congestive heart failure patients with cardiorespiratory disorders, including Cheyne-Stokes respiration, amongst others.","We also saw strong growth in our Respiratory Care products throughout Europe, including continued adoption of our Stellar ventilation platform.","Mask growth was also solid across the European region, with both the Quattro Air and the Swift FX Nano masks being well received across the region.","In France, the government confirmed during the quarter that its telemonitoring requirements would take effect right at the start of this quarter, on October 1. We believe that this announcement during the quarter dispelled any confusion in the homecare provider space in France, and will help ResMed grow its share in both the flow generator and the emerging healthcare informatics space in France, as well as across Europe.","We are starting to see success in the way we position EasyCare Online solutions for monitoring requirements, not only in France, but also in other parts of Europe. Building on the strength in the U.S., this is becoming a global trend. We expect that success to continue.","We announced on our website today that we have acquired an Eastern European-based distributor of sleep-disordered breathing, as well as respiratory care products. The acquisition is in Poland, the country with a population of around 40 million, and a gross domestic product of around USD 490 billion. This acquisition strengthens our presence in Eastern Europe, allowing us to expand ResMed's reach to help more patients with access to comfortable and effective treatment for respiratory disorders and also, to be able to more closely support the local homecare provider networks in developing respiratory care, as well as cardiorespiratory markets. This acquisition is an element of our ongoing global emerging market growth strategy.","In the Asia Pacific region, sales were lumpy, influenced by our business primarily in Japan. The long-term opportunities in this region remain incredibly strong, especially in our emerging markets -- growth opportunities in this region, with a focus particularly on China, as well as India.","In the Americas, we saw steady 5% flow generator growth, knowing that we were up against a very tough prior year comparison. Flow generators were up 17% in Q1 fiscal 2013, and we hit 5% in Q1 2014. This 5% increase is in line with market growth, which we said is around 4% to 6%. We are holding share in this category. The strong mix shift from CPAP to APAP was evident again as the trend to home sleep testing continues to drive this mix shift.","The S9 AutoSet remains our flagship product in this region, and it is growing well. We're seeing a trend that new patient growth is very solid in the U.S. And we attribute some of the growth that is part of that trend to the increased availability of home sleep testing. We estimate that approximately 35% of all U.S. sleep diagnostic tests are now with HST. This is driven primarily by payer mandates.","We also think that HST will grow in the next 12 months to around 40% to 45% of all tests done within the U.S.","Additionally, we continue to see a steady increase in the number of sleep labs involved in HST. We think it's around 55%, based on our latest sleep lab survey data, but sleep labs are really engaging in HST and looking to offer it as a choice to patients. And we're partnering with our sleep labs to help provide our ApneaLink services, our VPAP Tx services and other services that can help them diagnose patients.","In terms of Respiratory Care devices in the Americas, we are seeing positive early trends with our VPAP ST-A and our VPAP COPD products. You'll remember VPAP COPD was just recently launched. Both of these are now on the S9 platform. These products have a long lead sales cycle, and we expect this growth to continue over the coming quarters and beyond. We are taking share in the respiratory care space, and these products are positive margin contributors.","We believe regulatory approval of the Stellar product in Brazil is imminent, and we expect that this will be a great geographic market for growth, given its particular homecare ventilation needs in that geography. We are making good progress on our Respiratory Care pipeline, and we plan to launch a new Respiratory Care platform for patients in fiscal year 2014.","Masks in the Americas were up against a tough year-on-year comparison. Masks, if you remember, grew 13% year-on-year in Q1 fiscal 2013. We acknowledge that we lost share in this quarter due to a competitive product cycle, particularly in the nasal category and, to a lesser extent, in the pillows category. We held share in the full face category, helped by initial momentum from the launch of Quattro Air. It was released late in the fourth quarter.","As I stated in our press release, the Quattro Air is on its way to being one of our best mask product launches ever. And there's lots of runway left for that product. We're only 90 days in. We also launched the Swift FX Nano in the U.S. during September, which is just a couple of weeks ago, the last month, obviously, of the quarter. The Nano has a low-profile nasal cushion, minimal headgear, and we expect the Nano to help get us back on the front foot in the nasal category. We have had a leading position in the masks space for many years and we will maintain that. We obviously expect competition in this space, and we expect customers to sample new competitive products. The increasing competition, in fact, in the nasal and pillow categories demonstrates that the market continues to look for, and reward, new product innovation, despite the ongoing reimbursement pressures. We think that's good for our business because innovation is our strong suit. We have an incredibly exciting pipeline of innovative new masks across all the categories coming out over the next 3, 6, 9 months and beyond, with one mask launch, literally, just around the corner.","There's been a round of competitive bidding launched on July 1, the first day of the quarter that we're talking through here, Q1. And that caused some distraction, as we've talked about, for our U.S. channel in the quarter. Our HME customers had new reimbursement rates that were announced in February but went into effect on July 1. Remember, CB 2 is a significant part of Medicare, which is around 25% of the HME payer portfolio in the U.S. market. HMEs who won new CB 2, or competitive bidding 2 -- I'll use CB 2 as an abbreviation in this call, contracts in geographies where they didn't have a brick-and-mortar presence now have to set up subcontracts. HMEs who won CB 2 in areas where they have an established presence now have to collect paperwork on the new Medicare patients and establish replenishment programs for those new patients.","HMEs who lost contracts in CB 2 are now working on driving new referrals for commercial payers, which is the other 75% of their payer portfolio, and on subcontracting partnerships for the 25%, that is CB 2. It looks to us that CB 2 has temporarily impacted volumes in the U.S. market, but as that distraction clears, volumes will pick up to meet the ongoing growth in patient demand.","As I said earlier, we have seen new patient growth that is solid, and the underlying fundamental patient dynamic of home sleep testing is driving that. And the fact that 85% of this most penetrated of our markets, which is the U.S., 85% of the patients still need to be diagnosed and treated. That's a lot of runway ahead of us.","We continue to see the trends that sleep-disordered breathing and COPD prevalence, awareness and patient referrals are all growing. It's notable that in the Round One Recompete bid that was announced during Q1, the reimbursement rates for sleep and respiratory care products increased versus CB 2. We believe this is a very good indicator. With CB 2 rates and contracts now in effect, and have been in effect for over 90 days, we're encouraged that uncertainty is receding and customers are focusing on how to succeed in this new environment.","We're partnering with our HME customers and helping them take cost out of our mutual supply chain and out of the system. Our solutions include EasyCare Online, U-Sleep, electronic data interchange, replenishment optimization, drop ship programs, PCP awareness, and patient engagement programs and more in the healthcare informatics space.","As a particular example in the healthcare informatics management space, we announced an alliance at Medtrade during the quarter with Brightree. Brightree is a cloud-based software development company. The ResMed online store will now be integrated with Brightree's HME management solutions, simplifying the ordering process for our mutual HME customers. So HME customers who use Brightree's systems will be able to order ResMed products with a single login and access to inventory availability data directly in their own management systems. This makes it easier to do business with ResMed and it makes it more cost efficient to do business with ResMed. Brightree's share of the healthcare informatics space is somewhere in the 30% to 40% range, we believe, in the HME management solutions based in the U.S.","As an example of patient engagement programs, we just crossed over the 1-year anniversary mark for our Wake Up to Sleep offering. Wake Up to Sleep is ResMed's comprehensive sleep apnea support community. It's intended to help people along their entire sleep-disordered breathing journey from awareness, to diagnosis, to treatment, to ongoing adherence. There are already multiple tens of thousands of people signed up for the program, which focuses on the lifelong value to the patient.","Once engaged, Wake Up to Sleep helps patients through their journey, and helps them maximize adherence. This benefits the patient, but it also benefits the physician, the HME provider and the payer.","Finally, on the intellectual property front, we were just designated by an independent IP firm, Intellectual Asset Management, as the leading global company in the Asia Pacific region with, in their words, \"world-class IP functions and strategies and strong IP protection.\" So ResMed is seen by them as a truly global IP player committed to asserting its IP rights. We've demonstrated this by defending and protecting our intellectual property and our solid R&D investments over the years, with lawsuits against both APEX and BMC.","Let me wrap up with this. Our respiratory medical market is no longer just about selling equipment to treat sleep-disordered breathing. It's about forming partnerships with our customers and offering full-service solutions for patients, providers, physicians and payers to help manage outcomes of chronic disease. This solutions approach applies in our core market of sleep-disordered breathing, but it also applies in our growing Respiratory Care business, as well as in our fast-growing cardiorespiratory business. For these 3 horizons of growth, the combination of our world-leading quality flow generators, as well as the most comfortable and effective patient interface systems on the planet, as well as easy-to-access, robust and actionable software solutions, makes ResMed the leading value proposition for our customers. We have a robust pipeline of new products in both devices, as well as in masks, as well as in future business process innovations that are planned for sleep, Respiratory Care and cardiology.","We are laser-focused on bringing these innovative solutions to our market, and we're managing the fundamentals of our business. Those fundamentals are that we continue to improve patients' quality of life, we continue to prevent disease progression, and we continue to reduce the burden of health care costs for critical, chronic diseases, such as sleep-disordered breathing, COPD and heart failure.","Now I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer. Brett?","Brett A. Sandercock","Great. Thanks, Mick. Revenue for the September quarter were $357.7 million, an increase of 5% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 4%. Income from operations for the quarter was $96.9 million, an increase of 20% over the prior-year quarter. And net income for the quarter was $80.9 million, an increase of 14% over the prior-year quarter.","Diluted earnings per share were $0.56 for the quarter, again, an increase of 14% over the prior-year quarter. Gross margin for the September quarter was 63.7%, an increase of 230 basis points compared to Q1 FY '13.","On a year-on-year basis, our gross margin benefited from favorable currency movements, favorable product mix and manufacturing improvements, partially offset by ASP declines. Looking forward, we expect our gross margin to be in the range of 62% to 64%, assuming current exchange rates. Additionally, we continue to execute on initiatives targeted at improving our global manufacturing, supply chain and logistics cost structures.","SG&A expenses for the quarter were $101.3 million, an increase of 3% over the prior-year quarter. And in constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 4%. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of revenue, improved to 28.3%, compared to the year-ago figure of 28.9%. Looking forward, and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the vicinity of $0.28 for fiscal year 2014.","R&D expenses for the quarter were $27.4 million, an increase of 1% over the prior-year quarter. While in constant currency terms, R&D expenses increased by 9%. R&D expenses, as a percentage of revenue, were 7.7% compared to the year-ago figure of 8%. Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses, as a percentage of revenue, to be in the range of 7% to 8% for fiscal year 2014. This reflects an ongoing commitment to investing in our product pipeline, tempered somewhat by the depreciation of the Australian dollar, as the majority of our research and development is undertaken in Australia.","Amortization of acquired intangibles was $2.4 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $10.8 million.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.7%, compared to the prior-year quarter effective tax rate of 21.6%. The lower tax rate this quarter reflects the ongoing benefit of lower effective tax rates associated with our Singapore manufacturing operations. We currently estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2014 will also be in the vicinity of 21%.","Turning now to revenue in more detail. Overall, sales in the Americas were $201.5 million, an increase of 4% over the prior-year quarter. Sales outside the Americas totaled $156.2 million, an increase of 7% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas increased by 5% over the prior-year quarter.","Breaking out revenue between product segments. In the Americas, flow generator sales were $88.6 million, an increase of 5% over the prior-year quarter, reflecting solid growth in our APAP and bilevel devices. Masks and other sales were $112.9 million, an increase of 3% over the prior-year quarter, reflecting a very competitive market, particularly in the nasal and pillow segments.","For revenue outside the Americas, flow generator sales were $103.2 million, an increase of 7% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 4%. Masks and other sales were $53 million, an increase of 9% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 7%.","Globally, in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 4%, while Masks and other also increased by 4%.","Cash flow from operations was $90.4 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $16.8 million, while depreciation and amortization for the September quarter totaled $17.9 million.","Our share buyback continues to play a major role in our capital management program. During the quarter, we repurchased 432,000 shares for consideration of $21.1 million. At the end of September, we had approximately 4.1 million shares remaining under our authorized buyback program.","We plan to repurchase at least 2 million shares during fiscal year 2014.","In addition to the buyback, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, consistent with our previously advised dividend policy. Our balance sheet remains very strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter was $616 million, and at September 30, total assets stood at $2.3 billion, and net equity was $1.7 billion.","I'll now hand the call back to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is Andrew Goodsall with UBS.","Andrew Goodsall - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Could I, perhaps, just dig in a little bit to the U.S. flow generators, of course, and just ask you to clarify your comments or elaborate on your comments around volume and price? You mentioned it being weaker sort of in volumes or disruption, I think, through the bidding process?","Michael J. Farrell","Yes, Andrew, so there was some temporary distraction that we talked about from the CB 2 rates that we saw in Q1. The Americas' flow generators growth was 5% year-on-year, which is in the middle of that 4% to 6% range that we think is around that. So reasonably solid growth from us, but in looking at our partners, our HME's business and working with them, we noticed some distraction in, as we said, the contracts from the winners, the subcontracting from the nonwinners and the relationships that have to happen in terms of getting both prescriptions and referrals for patients who were on the replenishment programs for -- who transferred from nonwinners to winners. So all that together caused some temporary distraction during the quarter, and we think that's had some effect on the flow generator growth of the market. And we did reasonably well, I think, in terms of holding our share in a pretty tough quarter for that, where we hit 5%.","Andrew Goodsall - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And just when we look at that 5%, can you elaborate any further on mix, on what was price versus volume? Because you have spoken to the impact of price on the group before?","Michael J. Farrell","Yes. So I mean, as we talked about on our last call in the intervening period, around 5% to 7% is the sort of year-on-year price reductions that we've seen. If you remember, last call, we talked about 4% to 6%. So that's a delta of 100 basis points. We think that is temporary and associated with the distraction that happened particularly in the U.S. market. And that 5% to 7% can possibly go back to the 4% to 6%. And we think that will happen as the distraction clears. So without, Andrew, breaking out the specifics of exactly what unit volumes are, which we never do here, and we just talk about revenue growth, that 5% number has sort of all those factors weighed into it.","Operator","Our next question is Ben Andrew with William Blair.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","The question I guess, for me, first off, is talk a little bit about the revenue that you might be getting from ventilators and ventilatory kind of masks in the quarter in the United States? And kind of break that out, if you can, to give us a kind of raw sleep number, if that's relevant. And then second, just on the currency side, for Brett, if rates hold steady, what do you expect for the quarter and the year?","Michael J. Farrell","So I'll take the first part and Brett will take the second. But it will be a quick answer, Ben, we're not going to break out Respiratory Care versus sleep. We're just going to keep flow gens versus masks. Brett, do you want to take the second part?","Brett A. Sandercock","Yes, I do. I mean, the currency impact obviously benefited on the gross margin with the currency this quarter. And if I look -- if you look through from Q1 into Q2, I still think we'll see some favorable benefits there, and I'd estimate probably -- it's probably going to be in the order of 70 basis points, if currencies hold. Go in [ph] with caution, as all these crept up a bit over the quarter. If you looked in -- for the gain in the Q2, Q3, then you'd see something like half of that 70 basis points reversing back into -- in Q3. So we're going a long way out in terms of predicting on currencies. But if you think about it, Q2 will still see some favorable benefits from currency, then if you watch into Q3, that'd probably, on a sequential basis, reverse a little bit. But looking -- kind of underlying theme of favorability from currency movement, I think we're still going to see that play out on the bottom line in the next few quarters.","Operator","Our next question is David Low with Deutsche Bank.","David Low - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just touching on masks. I mean, mask resupply and the growth in the number of masks per patient has been a big trend in recent years. I was wondering if you could, one, comment on that; and two, just comment on whether you're seeing much brand change or seen patients changed the mask model they use once they already establish the user of CPAP?","Michael J. Farrell","Thanks, David. The mask resupply has been, and will continue to be, a strong element of growth long-term for the industry. We partnered very closely, particularly in the U.S. market, with our customers to help drive replenishment programs, really, over the last 3, 5 years, and even beyond that in terms of helping them access their patients, understand adherence rates, understand the importance of that for keeping the patients out of hospital, saving money for the health care system. And that is good for the patient, it's good for the payer and it's good for the provider. So there's a good incentive for all the parties involved. And we've seen that grow really well, as you have, over the quarters. We think that trend will absolutely continue and we will be a part of it. Clearly, in Q1, we did not grow as fast as we'd like to in the nasal and -- particularly, the nasal category but also somewhat in the pillows category. With the launch of the Swift FX Nano, we're back on the front foot in the nasal category. And that's got an S-curve to go up. But as I said in my opening remarks, we have 3 great masks coming out across the categories over the next 3, 6, 9 months. And we believe that those will get us on the front foot for the new patient setup. On the second part of your question about switching patients, masks tend to be like those really comfortable pair of jeans or those really comfortable pair of shoes where it's hard to get someone to change. And if they change, they often buy the same pair of jeans or the same pair of shoes that they were wearing before. And it's difficult to get patients to switch. We think that fundamental is still there. And that's why it's all the more important for us to get these great new masks out and get back on the front foot for new patient setup because there's a trailing revenue opportunity and a trailing opportunity to really help the health care system by keeping those patients with masks for their lifetime.","Operator","Our next question is Saul Hadassin with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Saul Hadassin - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Mick, just a question on -- you mentioned the temporary disruption that you've seen post company, can you talk to how long you think that disruption's likely to last?","Michael J. Farrell","Thanks, Saul. Yes, it's a temporary distraction in the U.S. market associated with CB2, right? So the U.S. market, which is 50% of the global, it's within that 25% that's [indiscernible] as Medicare. That temporary distraction -- how long is a piece of string? We don't have 100% knowledge on how long it'll take, but we believe it's a matter of months. It's not a matter of weeks. But it's not a matter of quarters. This is a matter of months and we think the U.S. customers have been dealing with this for, now, 90 -- across 20, we're talking about 110, 114 days now. It's not new to them, we've been partnering with them over this period. They know what the challenges are and they're working hard at getting all the paperwork sorted out, getting the subcontracts sorted out, getting the new prescriptions, getting the patients on their databases and working with them. And we are partnering with them -- as we said, with things like the Brightree to make it single order entry, single approach to 1 health care infomatic system to be able to order and resupply. So we think that, over the next number of months, we'll be able to help them through that process, and we're pretty confident in that. Jim, I don't know if you want to add a couple of comments, Jim Hollingshead, who is our President of the Americas, might add a couple of comments. He's closer to this.","James Hollingshead","Sure. I mean, to give you guys a sense of the scale of it, roughly half of competitive bid to contracts were won by HMEs who did not have physical facilities in the place where they wanted, right? And so as Mick referred to in the opening comments, that means that there's a lot of subcontracting arrangements that have to be worked out. And so if you just think that side of it alone -- just think of the contracts that had to be set up -- and the subcontracting model is actually new, for the most part, in the HME world. So there's a big administrative burden. Once you've figured out a model, you've got a lot of paperwork you've got to do and you've got arrangements, you have to set up around who owns the inventory and how does it get shipped and things like that. It creates an extra burden on top of, and parallel to, the reimbursement cuts. And so, how long will it take to work through? We see people working through it already. Our customers are very good business people. They have historically shown real resilience in dealing with administrative burden created by both government payers and, well, by Medicare and private payers. So we think we seen working through it now and we think it's probably months and not weeks, but it's not an all year thing. We think they'll clear it and we think they're working through it right now.","Saul Hadassin - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Again, just a follow-up question for Brett. Just wanted to ask where you are in terms of manufacturing production out of Singapore and where you think that might get to over the next 12 months or so?","Brett A. Sandercock","Yes, we're around the 60% mark. We're a little bit more on the Flow Gens, a little bit less on the Mask, but you can sort of blend it around the 60%, And I think, as we said before, I think we just progressively kind of lift that as our production increases. So, also, we predict exactly where we'll be, but that will certainly become a larger percentage of our manufacturing over time.","Operator","Our next question is Steve Wheen with JPMorgan.","Steven David Wheen - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just on your rest-of-world numbers and Asia Pacific you referred to as being lumpy. Could you sort of give it a little bit more color as to what's happening there, and in particular, your reference to Japan? What is going on in that market?","Michael J. Farrell","Yes, thanks for the questions, Steve. I'll hand that to Rob Douglas, our Chief Operating Officer.","Robert Douglas","The Japan market has always been lumpy for us. Probably you're aware we've got just a few large customers there that run very significant home care businesses, and they replenish their fleet periodically. Tracking the underlying patient numbers and the whole progression of the sleep business there is progressing well. But order, timing and that just meant that we were in a low part of the lumpy run in Japan. We're very confident of the business there. We've got great relationships with our customers and our teams are working well together in serving those markets. That was really the main issue. The other smaller markets in Asia-Pac all did pretty well and we saw good growth through the emerging markets in there, but they're not yet material enough to show up on these numbers.","Steven David Wheen - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just also on France, the formalization of that, I guess, compliance regime. What sort of response are you seeing from the buyers in that market?","Michael J. Farrell","Okay, Steve. So we're 110 days in, and we think it's months away on CB2 lineup. We're 23 days in to the French announcement of the telemonitoring, and so 3 weeks -- Anne Reiser, who's our President of Europe, is all across this. She's actually our previous President of France, and ran that business since we hired her from Medtronic for almost a decade in sales and laying it [ph], so she knows the French market intimately. And we have good relations with both the authority and excellent relationships with our customers in France. And we have seen this coming and have been planning for it. We have had great learning from our U.S. market, with EasyCare Online now becoming the leader in healthcare informatics for the sleep disorder breathing space, and we have been able to scale that business very well over the last number of years in the U.S.","So we have the systems, the tools and the scalable capabilities that we have now taken, literally, to within the country of France and availability now across the European Union. So it's early days. We think the customers are starting to get to grips around it and understanding how to work with us. We think it's going to be a benefit for the S9 order set, for the S9 order set with wireless capabilities and for our EasyCare Online solution in France. But, Steve, it's too early days to say how quickly that S-curve will start to happen, but the starting gun just went off.","Operator","Our next question is Matthew Prior with Bank of America.","Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Mick, just a question, just peeling back the layers on CB a little bit further, the 100 basis points of discounting or price pressure that you saw since the last update. Can you give us a sense as to whether that was pressure from private insurers or payers? Or is that driven more from a competitive element, given that volumes are depressed from the distraction factor and various manufacturers fighting for volume?","Michael J. Farrell","Matthew, we don't have visibility into the exact per-customer, per-payer knowledge of our customers and so what we do is look at it as a portfolio. Clearly, globally, we saw 100 basis points with the 5% to 7% year-on-year price declines. So there's some impact there, but breaking it out between public and private is very high. What we know are the facts. The facts are that CB2 was announced in February, and went into play in July 1, and that's the main impact that's happened across that payer portfolio. There have been very minor changes in private payers that are not out of the ordinary in and what was happening over the last, not just 5 quarters, but 5 years. So I'm affected by CB or CB1 or CB2. So I'd say that you could deduce that, primarily, price changes were driven by CB2, but we don't have true visibility into it. So it's an assumption, but a pretty good one, based upon the data that we have in hand.","Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just a follow-up question, I guess, for them all. Have you seen any change in competitive behavior, to the extent that, again, lower volumes from the distraction factor? Are all various manufacturers still behaving in the same manner which they've behaved, and that it gets around 1 in previous near quarters, given this backdrop of low-volume growth?","Michael J. Farrell","Yes, look, I think the pricing behavior has been pretty steady in that 5% to 7% range. I mean, clearly, the new product introduction behavior is that there have been a number of new products introduced by, primarily, our 2 major competitors. Without going into detail, we talked about the nasal category and the pillows category being where they are looking to enter and the customers are sampling those products. We're very confident that not only the Quattro Air's success but Swift FX Nano's great start. And without going into detail, the pipeline that we have coming in the next 3, 6 to 9 months will get us back on the front foot for that first-time setup. So if I was to summarize competitive behavior, I'd say it's about innovation and it's about competition through small, acquired and more comfortable, and better for the patient. Because everyone is starting to realize that adherence is the outcome that matters. That's what saves money for the payer, it's what saves money for the employer and it's what benefits the patient directly each night. That level of competitive behavior of innovating on value, is something that we think is healthy for the industry, but we also think plays to our strong suit over the last couple of decades, and something that we are absolutely confident we can get back on the front foot.","Operator","Our next question is Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.","Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Can we spend a moment on gross margins? Which were pretty spectacular this quarter. How sustainable is that? And what drove almost 100 basis point uptick sequentially?","Michael J. Farrell","Brett?","Brett A. Sandercock","Yes. I mean, the big one, sequentially, would have been FX impact. So, sequentially, that contributed around 90 basis points. So you think on that, that's basically most of that expansion, if you like. I mean, but if you're still looking at trend buys, we're still getting product mix benefits and things like CPAP to APAP, the Respiratory Care business, all those provide, if you like, sort of a bit of tailwind for us on the gross margin. And some geographic mix, there's some benefit around geographic mix this time around, which -- generally, we probably don't get to the same magnitude we got this time. So there's a few things playing out. The other one is on -- I mean, we're working really hard in the manufacturing and the cost outside of the business as well. And you're seeing that sort of manifest pretty consistently now through the gross margin, and we're absolutely committed to those programs. So, again, you'll see them flowing through as well. And what we're looking to do is -- and you've probably seen it here in the last year or 2 is really do enough through the product mix, through manufacturing logistics to offset the ASP decline.","Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, now I know you don't like to give revenue guidance, but given all of the pushes and takes that are happening in the first quarter, and quite frankly, the constant currency growth rate which is a meaningful step down from where you have been, can you comment on what you think your revenue may grow at, even if it's a range, for 2014?","Michael J. Farrell","No, Joanne, we don't give guidance on revenue. I'll reiterate our market guidance, that we believe that the global market will grow at 6% to 8%, Flow Generators will grow at 4% to 6%, and Masks will grow at 8% to 10%.","Operator","Next question is David Clair with Piper Jaffray.","David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I guess, just kind of a bigger picture one for me, but how do you defend your market share from lower-cost manufacturers and kind of the post-competitive bidding environment? At Medtrade that seems like a lot of kind of fringe players who are talking about this as an opportunity to take some share.","Michael J. Farrell","David, low-cost competition is nothing new in our industry. It's been around for over a decade. Many of the players at Medtrade are players who have been trying to enter this market and\/or other markets. When I say this market, the one you're at, at Medtrade, the U.S. market and\/or other markets around the world, for many years. And the way I'd look at it is if supply was unable to enter the Chinese market or the Brazilian market and their levels of focus on quality and cost trade-off, what are their chances in the U.S. market? So I think it comes back to the fundamentals. The fundamentals here are that health care systems are growing at a fast rate, relative to GDP, for every major developed country. And the U.S. is at 18% of its GDP on health care. Most of western Europe is somewhere in the 10% to 12% of its GDP on health care. Every healthcare system around the world is looking for outcomes and value, and that's driven by long-term adherence and reduction of cost with improvement of quality of life of the patient. We have focused very closely on this, and every new product we bring to market, every new solution we bring to market, looks to take cost out of the system and improve adherence rates for the patient, and reduce the long-term costs for payers and for employers. So, in that environment, with all that going on, I don't think a low-cost solution that has low value has a great opportunity to get into the market. We have great value, our products, at good value prices. So this is happening on a global scale. But I guess you were in the U.S. at Medtrade, maybe I'll hand it to Jim Hollingshead to give some detail on what's happening in the U.S. market with those new entrants.","James Hollingshead","Well, the first thing -- I think it's a great question and I completely agree with Mick's answer. But if I just think, with our customers, right? The basic equation for our customers is they need products to work. So they need to be able to easily set up a patient. They need to be able to track the compliance of that patient, make sure the patient gets compliance and then create a resupply model. And so the better the product works, the better off they are. And our products work better than other products on the market. We have the best products on the market. Most of the low-cost sort of Asian entrants are producing products that really are not in that class. They don't work that well. They create cost at setup, they create lower compliance rates, et cetera. It's not a very good value proposition. Having said that, we're very mindful. I mean, we're watching the competitive set. And the key thing for us, over time, is to be able to continue to innovate with great product, which we have a great track record of doing, right? So that's it. Now, one of the things we found, and I was actually going to suggest we might turn to Dave to comment is the other issue was around our intellectual property. So, in this space, intellectual property is very strong. And as you guys know, we've defended our intellectual property against a couple of Asian entrants. And that's another way we defend. But I think that the basic way we defend is we have the great products that work that create more revenue for our customers.","Michael J. Farrell","Yes, it's a good suggestion. Dave, you want to address the IP side and also to APEX and BMC deal?","David Pendarvis","Sure. So the key here is, when people come in to compete and they compete with using our intellectual property, we're not going to let it happen. So, whether that's a small competitor or whether it's a large competitor, we intend to enforce our intellectual property. And that's a different question from a small competitor who comes in and tries to compete using their own R&D, which obviously they've got to get off their own merit. But we're not going to hesitate to continue to enforce our intellectual property against market entrants who want to use the innovation of our hard working employees. And that's something we're continuing to fight with APEX and BMC on. We expect to continue to win those battles. And then at the same time, we expect to be able to be prepared to launch them if we need to. We prefer to see competitors respect our intellectual property and battle on the field. But if we need to battle in court, we won't hesitate to do that.","David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","And then in terms of the temporary distraction that you guys saw during the quarter, how would you -- would you kind of say that things started out badly in early July and it kind of got progressively better as the quarter rolled on or was it just kind of depressed throughout the quarter?","Michael J. Farrell","David, we have daily conversations with our customers. It's hard to get a read on this at that level of detail, but what I can say is the temporary distraction is receding, and it's a question on how fast it recedes. We're 111, 114 days in. It's better than 100 days in, it's better than 90 days in. And it's going in the right direction and we believe it will resolve over a matter of months. The exact kinetics of it, during the quarter, is something that we just don't have visibility to. But the needle is moving in the right direction.","Operator","Our next question is Ian Abbott with Goldman Sachs.","Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just wondering, in bilevels, whether you can talk to some of the initiatives you're doing to perhaps broaden the channel and the class of patients that use those products.","Michael J. Farrell","Yes, absolutely. And we are very focused on our VPAP ST-A, our VPAP COPD and across our pipeline in the COPD space. So that's the first market that we have huge opportunities for our bilevels. The VPAP COPD product was just launched in the end of Q4. So it's initial part of its S-curve. It involves some interaction through the pathway, with the sleep lab, where we have excellent channel access and channel control. And we have our VPAP Tx titration devices available in sleep labs across the country, and so we're really excited about the opportunities in COPD. Secondly, in the bilevel side, long-term, there's a huge opportunity in heart failure. And as you saw, we talked about our European growth being very strong during the quarter. That is helped by the fact that we are running SERVE-HF in France, Germany, the Nordics, as well as the U.K., as well as sites outside Europe. But we're seeing a halo effect from that trial, in the cardiorespiratory space. So, the order set CS product, which is an adaptive servo-ventilation product, an extension of those bilevels, saw some incredible growth. Not just during Q1, but over the last number of quarters. That is a long S-curve, and as we get to the end of results from SERVE-HF, which is mid-2015, there could be an inflection point in really accelerating those cardiorespiratory sales. So I'd summarize, Ian, by saying we've got great initial movement on our S9 bilevels, but there's a heck of a lot of runway ahead for us, particularly in the cardiorespiratory space.","Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","For my second question, can we -- just changing topics to DMEs. Just wondering, if you look at your U.S. business and breaking the DMEs into some of the large nationals, and then obviously you've got the regionals and then some of the smaller single-person operator. If you look at, say, your business last year and then projecting your business -- maybe not this year, but maybe another year out -- to what extent do you see the percentage of your business changing across those sort of various classes of DMEs, is it going to be material or is it going to be relatively gradual?","Michael J. Farrell","Yes. We have good relationships with all those segments of customers from large nationals to regionals, to mom and pops. As to the exact change of it over time, I'm going to hand it to Jim Hollingshead for some thoughts there. Jim?","James Hollingshead","Thanks, Mick. The consolidation has been a gradual tectonic move in the channel over the last several years. And I think it will continue at that. Logically, you might expect a little bit of acceleration to consolidation because of CB2, but right now, we're not seeing a massive step change on that basis. And bear in mind, too, that DME is such a local business, that in many cases the local setup shall still be done by DMEs who are now subcontracting, right? So I continue to see it as a more gradual movement.","Michael J. Farrell","Partnerships like our partnership with Brightree really help the regionals. We've got EDI partnerships which really helped the nationals. We've got PCP awareness which helps the mom and pops, the regionals and the nationals. So we're willing to partner across the segments and across the categories of customers and products, and we see it as a pretty solid and steady move going forward, would be my summary there.","Operator","Our next question is Dan Hurren with UBS.","Dan Hurren - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","We've noticed, when we're talking to the market, that there's a range of deals out there -- as we'd expect for sort of discounts of volumes and those sorts of things -- just wondering how they impact the P&L over time, and the other discounts. Upfront or is there a count-back? Does a customer have to do a certain volume before they get the rebate? So will that hit the P&L later on? Just wondering how that flows through over time.","Michael J. Farrell","Brett, you want to talk about how we count for our deals?","Brett A. Sandercock","I mean, they'll be a combination of all those, Dan, really. And on things like volume rebate and so on, what you do there is you have to be -- it's pretty dynamic in terms of estimating where you think volume is going to be. And then if we think they're going to hit those, then we certainly accrue as we go. So it's not like you're just going to get lumped with them all of a sudden. That will be spread out through the course of the year or whenever the volume contract is over. And then, of course, you have to make a call on what you think's really sticking and what you think that particular customer will achieve in terms of volumes.","Dan Hurren - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So, I guess what I'm trying to understand is that are we seeing sales today that will actually result in lower sales when the rebates gets headed back in future periods.","Brett A. Sandercock","No. No, because we'd be accruing or offsetting an accrual for that rebate as we go.","Operator","Our next question is Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity.","Jeffrey Chu","This is Jeff filling in for Jason. Wanted to switch gears a bit and ask about the termination of the distribution agreement with CareFusion, which I think you announced about this time 1 year ago. First off, is this timing correct? And secondly, I was hoping you'd quantify the U.S. Flow Generator business during the quarter that were from products that were part of this distribution agreement. I'm just trying to understand the impact over the next several quarters, as you anniversary this termination of this agreement.","Michael J. Farrell","Jeff, the distribution agreement with CareFusion was immaterial 1 year ago, and it remain immaterial now. How we're distributing the Stellar range of products which were involved in that agreement is that we have our own respiratory account managers across the U.S. market, which is where that bill is focused. And our respiratory account managers and our respiratory clinical specialists, who are part of our core sales force, have picked up this product. And we did better in our first quarter with our team selling our product than another team trying to sell our product over 1 whole year. So we're seeing some good momentum with Stellar, which has done incredibly well in France and Germany, where it was primarily designed for. But some really good upside opportunities that have come to us in the U.S. But, particularly, as I mentioned in my introductory remarks, Stellar is a great product in the Americas geography, for Brazil, where we see the need for home care ventilation. And in some of those emerging markets, our products that are in the value space in respiratory care, have a great opportunity in that geography. So, in the Americas, I'd say one of the best geographic opportunities is right there in Brazil. But here in the U.S., we've taken over that distribution and we've started to move pretty well in it. And there's more, as I said in my opening remarks, in this market, through the end of fiscal '14, we're going to see some very interesting platform launches in the respiratory care space.","Operator","Our next question is Anthony Petrone with Jefferies Group.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","One on mix and one on the overall U.S. market. On mix, I know you don't tend to give mix on Flow Generators, but certainly, APAP over CPAP has been a driver. It seems that, that was a driver in gross margin in this quarter as well. So I'm wondering if you can just give us an update on the runway there is still left in that mix shift as we move more towards APAP over CPAP.","Michael J. Farrell","Yes, so we won't break it out, Anthony. But what I'll say is that, with 35% of the diagnoses in the U.S. market being home sleep testing, pretty much every prescription that comes from a home sleep test requires some type of APAP device. And so there's a sort of good relationship between us. It's not necessarily one for one, because physicians get to see products like the S9 order set and get to love it and want to use it for many of their patients and prescribe it for [indiscernible] from the lab as well as from HST. But if you're looking for an indicator, that may be one that can help you in your calculations for working the downstream split between APAP and CPAP. But one thing remains, is that there is a positive mix shift from CPAP to APAP. Why? Well, of course there's the HST trend in the U.S. market. But if you look at other markets around the world, APAP, and particularly the S9 order set, has gained share because it's better for patients. It adjusts during the night, it adjusts night to night and it is very good long-term care. And so we're seeing good outcomes from that. There's people focused more on the outcomes and the value of therapy. We're seeing products like the S9 order set get more and more attention.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","That's very helpful. And then just on the U.S. market, just going back to reimbursement trends overall. I know in the past you've touched on private reimbursement relative to CMS. Is there an update as to where they stand relative to CMS at this point? And perhaps, again, as you look forward, is there any indication of direction or where private pays may be going?","Michael J. Farrell","Yes, sure, Anthony. Well, as I said earlier in the Q&A here, CMS announced CB2 in February, it went into effect in July and we saw some effect in Q1. But private payers, during the last 90 days, did what they've done over the last 9 years, which is the steady reductions over time, by geography, by state. There's been business as usual as we look across the private payer space within the U.S. market.","Operator","We are now at the 1 hour mark, so I will turn the call back over Mick Farrell for his closing remark.","Michael J. Farrell","Great. Well, thanks, everybody, for coming and listening in on this call. I'd like to say thanks to our investors, to the analysts and our many customers who listen to this conference call. Importantly, I'd like to take this opportunity to say a special thank you to the 4,000-strong global ResMed team, from Asia-Pac, Europe and the Americas, for your hard work, dedication and continued excellence.

My name is Angela, and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. ","The company has asked me to read -- address certain matters. First, ResMed does not authorize the recording of any portion of this conference call for any purpose. Second, during the conference call, ResMed may make forward-looking statements such as: Projections of future revenue or earnings, new product development or new markets for the company's products. These statements are made under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from the forward-looking statements. ","These factors are discussed in ResMed's SEC filings, such as forms 10-Q and 10-K, which may be accessed through the company's website at www.resmed.com.","With that said, I would like to turn the call over to Dr. Peter Farrell, ResMed's Chairman and CEO. Dr. Farrell, please go ahead, sir.","Peter C. Farrell","Thank you, Angela, and I think we still have some time left. And thanks, everyone for joining us. I'll begin with some summary remarks, and then turn the call over to Brett Sandercock, our CFO. And Brett will provide more granularity on the numbers. And then we'll go to Q&A. So first, the financials. A short summary. We finished with a very solid quarter. Global revenues were $349.1 million, up 11% headline growth or 13% constant currency. Revenues in the Americas grew by an extremely robust 18% year-over-year to $189.9 million and ROW revenue increased by 4% headline or 7% in constant currency to $159.2 million. This represents the 69th consecutive quarter in which we've grown the top line that is quarter-over-quarter since we went public in 1995. And obviously we're pleased with that result and will be able to continue that record growth. Net profit after tax increased 21% to $64.6 million while GAAP EPS increased by robust 29% to $0.44 for the quarter. Excluding amortization of acquired intangibles, EPS was a record $0.46. ","With respect to product performance, let me first start with masks, this category continued to perform extremely well especially in the Americas. The 3 new masks in the FX trilogy, the Quattro FX, the Mirage FX and the Swift FX, as well as the for her versions of these masks continued to enjoy brisk sales. In fact, the Mirage FX is doing particularly well and we are steadily gaining additional share in this category. In fact, our data show that the Mirage FX is currently the biggest selling nasal mask on a global basis. And the new Swift FX Bella, mask for female patients, with loops that wrap around the ears, and this allows us to not have additional headgear, that is also doing very well and we expect to see continuing traction with it. ","As we've been highlighting in the last few quarters, another big reason we continue to see strong growth in the Mask category, other than the continued introduction of outstanding products, is that there is excellent business in the resupply replenishment to the existing patient base. Our global growth in Flow Generators this quarter was primarily driven by our high-end devices, which are now all on the S9 device platform. Strong sales reflect the benefits of having these products configured on the small but more appealing S9 platform. In the Americas, the S9 VPAP bilevel range is also regaining market share because of its excellent quality algorithms and also the performance that we get with those algorithms. The bilevels are providing strong value proposition for both HMEs and positions. Growth in the basic Flow Generator segment is still problematic and, partially, this is driven by the positive mix shift to APAP or our AutoSet from basic CPAP. And this is primarily due to the ongoing growth of home sleep testing. Europe continues to be challenging due to difficult macroeconomic environment there. Although sales were relatively  strong in Germany and the U.K. Although the European economic climate remains somewhat muted bilevels, AutoSets and Stellar Stellar products all continue to do well. ","We also just announced the release of our new patient compliance management solution called EasyCare Online. This innovative new tool used by sleep labs home medical equipment and DMEs and other healthcare providers aggregates usage and efficacy data from sleep-disordered breathing, obviously patient's on CPAP therapy, with simply a single click. Simple to use while saving time and money. The EasyCare Online employs a secure cloud-based system that provides compliance data that can differentiate our customers and is critical in today's environment. ","The S9 Flow Generators, our FX mask series plus now the new EasyCare Online bring superior compliance in patient management for quick and easy access to patient data in one centralized cloud-based location, unlimited providers can be associated with each patient to ensure the best possible therapy. We are quite excited about EasyCare Online. ","Ventilation sales of the Stellar 100 and the 150 continue to grow, particularly in Europe and Asia. We launched the Stellar 150 in Europe at the end of the calendar year and we are seeing incremental acceptance. These ventilator products will roll out progressively over the next few quarters. Of note, the Stellar 150 includes iVAPs, our new automatic bilevel mode. The success of the Stellar is another positive indication of our continued progress in product development. We also have further plans for ventilation. ","The new Grundler humidification about the HumiCare D900, is in a controlled product launch in Europe and going well. And we are working on FDA's submission to launch the 900 in the U.S. in fiscal 2013. This product will initially launch in the homecare setting which of course is our strength but also are planning to do a hospital lunch. ","On the HST, home sleep testing front in the Americas, commercial payers continues to steer patients towards HST with the requirement of prior authorization for attended PSG test, or polysomnography, and they are encouraging the use of HST as the first line of diagnosis. Currently, Aetna, United and Humana have pre-authorization initiatives for PSG to steer patience towards HST. We expect this to continue. ","In 2011, we estimate 15-plus-percent of all test for HST could even be as high as 20%. We expect to see a continuing adoption of HST during 2012 and onwards. My guess, in this area, is that it will increase another 100% this year. ","On the clinical front, the flow of data substantiating the connection between sleep disorder, breathing and chronic diseases continues to materialize. For example, a new study in the April issue of Pediatrics by Bonuck et al from Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, show that early life sleep disorder breathing in children had a strong persistent statistical correlation to serious behavioral and social-emotional difficulties. And by the time the children reach 4 years old, 40 to 100 -- by the time they reach 4 years old, excuse me. And by the time that they're at  age 7, the prevalence of these behavioral and emotional difficulties was between 40% to 100%. The study published also in circulation, Heart Failure by [indiscernible] from the University of Birmingham, showed that moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea can cause changes in the heart shape and function, that is increased mass, thickening of the heart wall and reduced pumping ability. The new study used to better define and control patient group in newer 3D echocardiograms. ","And then New York University reported results of the study that showed simply using BMI misses nearly 40% of sleep disorder breathing in obese patients. And as much as 50% of sleep disorder prevalence in women. Obviously, this is something that suggest that BMI is not what it's touted to be and the people probably ought to be having sleep tests as a standard of care in just about all patients. We expect that, that will come in the future. ","And as a brief update, our own clinical study which is the SERVE-HF on the use of adaptive servo-ventilation to treat chronic heart failure patients or sleep disorder breathing in chronic heart failure patients, we now have 1,000 patients currently enrolled. ","A quick update, before I pass over to Brett, our management changes. Karen Borg has been appointed as President of Asia Pacific and that was in January of this year. Her career prior to joining ResMed had commercial diversity covering strategic and global marketing, M&A, sales and general management. And during the past 20 years, Karen has worked in Australia, the U.K., Russia, Taiwan and the U.S.A. And more recently, since 2003, she was in the leadership roles with Johnson & Johnson and both Australia and the U.S. Anne Reiser has been appointed President, Europe, and that was in March of this year. Anne has previously served as ResMed's Chief Operating Officer in France since 2007. Anne has demonstrated a great track record in building and leading our successful French organization with both strong sales growth and market share increases. Prior to joining ResMed and worked in various European companies for such companies as Zimmer, American Home Products, Hollister and the most recent  one was Medtronic. ","Now I'll turn the call over to Brett to provide some additional granularity on the financials, then we'll take any questions. Brett?","Brett A. Sandercock","Right. Thanks, Peter. Revenue for the March quarter was $349.1 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter. And in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 13%. Income from operations for the quarter was $76.5 million, an increase of 20% over the prior year quarter. And net income for the quarter was $64.6 million, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.44, an increase of 29% over the prior year quarter.","Gross margin for the March quarter was 60.3%, up sequentially from Q2 FY '12. On a sequential basis, our gross margin continue to benefit from favorable product mix and, to a lesser extent, favorable currency movements. Looking forward to the balance of fiscal year 2012, we expect our gross margin to be in the range of 59% to 61%, assuming current exchange rates. We continue to execute on initiatives targeted at reducing product costs through supply chain efficiencies, product design and manufacturing improvements.","SG&A expenses for the quarter were $101 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 10%.  SG&A expenses, as a percentage of revenue, improved to 28.9% compared to the year ago figure of 29.5%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect the SG&A, as a percentage of revenue, to be in the range of 29% for the balance of fiscal year 2012.","R&D expenses for the quarter were $28.4 million, an increase of 22% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, R&D expenses increased by 18%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 8.1%, compared to the year ago figure of 7.4%. Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses, as a percentage of revenue, to be in the range of 8% for the balance of fiscal year 2012, reflecting the strong Australian dollar and continued investment in our product pipeline.","As a result of previously announced acquisitions, amortization of acquired intangibles increased to $3.6 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $7.9 million. We also donated $1 million to the ResMed Foundation this quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.1%, compared to the prior year quarter effective tax rate of 24.9%. The lower tax rate reflects the benefit of lower effective tax rate in our Singapore and Australian operations.","Turning now to revenue in more detail.  Overall sales in the Americas were $189.9 million, an increase of 18% over the prior year quarter. Sales outside the Americas totaled $159.2 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas increased by 7% over the prior year quarter.","Breaking up revenue between product segments.  In the Americas, Flow Generator sales were $78.6 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter, reflecting strong growth in our APAP and bilevel devices. Masks and other sales were $111.3 million, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter underpinned by strong contributions from our nasal mask segment and continued growth in accessories. ","For revenue outside the Americas, Flow Generator sales were $105.5 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms, an increase of 7%. Masks and other sales were $53.7 million, an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, an increase of 8%. Globally in constant currency terms, Flow Generators sales increased by 10% while Masks and other increased by 16%. ","Cash flow from operations was $86 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $9.9 million, while depreciation and amortization for the March quarter totaled $20 million.","Our share buyback continues to play a major role in our capital management program. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.3 million shares, a consideration of $67 million. For the first 9 months of fiscal 2012, we have repurchased 10.8 million shares, a consideration of $302.2 million. The 10.8 million shares purchased year-to-date represents approximately 7.3% of our diluted shares outstanding. At the end of March, we had approximately 11.6 million shares remaining under our authorized buyback program.","Our balance sheet remains strong, net cash balances at the end of the quarter was $540 million. And of 31 March, total assets was the $2.1 billion and net equity was $1.6 billion. ","I will now hand the call back to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of David Low of Deutsche Bank.","David Low - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Let's see if we could start with the bilevel result. I mean, I'm trying to get a sense of whether after the difficulty you had a year ago, whether you think sales are back to normal? Or whether you think that will remain a driver for the next quarter or so?","Peter C. Farrell","Well, as you were aware, David, in the old S8 box, in fact, the adaptive servo-ventilator, the ACS products were in the S7 box, which is really outdated. So I think the switch to having the bilevels and all the auto setting products including the ASV products in the S9 platform, as I said, has just really attracted people. Now whether we're back to, you can always do better, we were very encouraged, obviously, by the fact that people did gravitate back to our bilevel products. I mean the algorithms were all pretty solid. Maybe I'll ask Geoff to comment on that but I -- and Don maybe, but I think we still got some more, we got some more runway ahead of us with bilevels. We'd like the whole market, but that's a bit unrealistic. But we're very satisfied with where we are. You want to add anything?","Unknown Executive","I think there's a bit of runway way ahead of us as well. But we're quite happy with where we are at the moment.","David Low - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's really important whether the dollars are sort of empowered where they were prior to the decline?","Peter C. Farrell","You mean in terms of percentages?","David Low - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Well, percentages or dollars. Just to add [indiscernible] or whether 75% back.","Peter C. Farrell","We'd be just giving qualitative -- we don't get to that sort of granularity, David. As I said, let's leave it. We still have some runway to go.","David Low - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. The other topic I wanted to touch on was the rest of world sales. We've now seen, for a few quarters this year, we've seen sales great in a bit of a single-digit. I'm just wondering, if you could comment on what you've seen. I'm sort of particularly interested in breaking between European sales and what you saw and Asia Pacific region?","Peter C. Farrell","Well, as we've always said, the Asia Pac area tends to be a bit lumpy. We saw actually quite encouraging growth in India and China but obviously that's from a small base. The big markets there are Australia and Japan, and Japan tends to be extremely lumpy and you see these swings in the quarter but you're only looking at to say in the vicinity of 10% -- 9%, 10% of our total revenues in Asia Pac. Europe as we said on the last call, and as we still believe, the market there is 6% to 8% looking at their constant currency growth that's exactly where it was right bang and smack in the middle, 7%. I had mentioned that Germany was encouraging and that the U.K. was encouraging. France was less encouraging and the reason is this is still, if you like the post headache from the reimbursement changes in last October, where there was a 6% reduction. We see France coming back into the fold and that was probably the major reason given that our biggest market, obviously, is the Americas, which is around 54% and then you've got the next 2 biggest markets are Germany and France. So a little bit of weakness in either of those is obviously going to impact the numbers. But I think actually, we were reasonably encouraged with the European figures, given that there is a bit of a -- as you know, a malaise in the world economy.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I wanted to just follow up -- a question for you and maybe a question for Brett, if I may. For you Peter, talk about your view on the durability of the mix dynamics? And I get the sense that a major contributor to your revenue growth but also supporting unit growth, particularly, the overall growth number. And how many quarters or years do you think we have as a tail from bilevel and a conversion to auto?","Peter C. Farrell","Well, it's sort of a gradual thing, Ben, although we're seeing an acceleration of AutoSets and that is driven, we think, primarily, by the HST push. And there's a lot of runway there if you like. And basically, what were talking about here is that it's faster, better and cheaper if you like. And I think the insurers are now tweaking to that fact. The sleep labs will continue in their role, I mean, there are 90 different sleep disorders but one of them shouldn't be plugging up the labs, particularly, since a 5-year-old child -- recently some 5-year-old child would be able to diagnose the disorder breathing given the HST products that are around, not just ours. And the patient that's given the HST device immediately goes home that night and within a day or so is on treatment, whereas with the sleep lab you've obviously you've got the delay, you've got to wait until you can get into the labs and it might be a couple of weeks up to a couple of months. And what we've seen is that our data have shown that -- all data that we've paid to collect have shown that roughly 30% of patients who have been given a script to go to a sleep lab don't show up. Whereas if the sleep lab offers both HST and PSG, it tends to be more like 2%. So it's even in the interest of sleep labs to offer HST independently the fact that the Aetnas and Uniteds and Humanas and so forth are now requesting pre-authorization. So it's kind of a long way to answer your question but we see that continuing, I said I think it'll be probably up -- it could be something like this time next year, something like 40% of all tests. And all going well, if we had our wishes it would be cardiologists, endocrinologists and anesthesiologists all doing sleep tests and referring only the tough ones to sleep labs or sleep physicians. I think we see that happening. It may not be the cardiologists and endocrinologists themselves doing it but maybe the nurses or nurse practitioners and it's certainly much better for the patients and given the prevalence in those spaces, that is in Type 2 diabetes and cardiology in general. In fact, I've heard from a cardiologist the other day that he said that 40% of his patients have sleep disorder breathing and I figured, the figure that we use is about 50% and these aren't patients with heart failure, these are just the regular patients with A-fib or whatever else is wrong with their heart.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Sure. And so I guess, Peter, coming back and that's a helpful description, but coming back to the durability on that mix dynamic, it sounds like it's not 4 quarters, this is in your mind  2 or 3 years plus. So that helps offset the weakness you're seeing obviously in the low-end as well as give you much better pricing power versus trying to compete at that low end against whatever else is going on out there. Is that a fair way to think about it?","Peter C. Farrell","Yes, I think that's a fair assessment. We see continual weakness in the low end. And as HST kicks in, you don't have the option of going to the sleep lab, so you would actually have to go to an APAP, [indiscernible] and AutoSet. And we see that continuing to happen. That doesn't mean -- I mean sleep labs are not going to go away, but you're right it's not -- this is not 2 or 3 quarters, this is 2 or 3 years of the switch occurring. But it might happen more quickly, I mean, maybe that people just tweak to it and say, \"You know what? We're going to push this.\" And it's not as though -- I mean for the IDTFs, for example, I mean, they're getting something like $20 for doing oxygen tests, I mean, the oxygen level of the patient, SpO2, and they get $200 to $250 for a sleep test. I mean that's pretty -- it's pretty attractive to the independent testing facilities.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then perhaps for you, you gave us a little bit of a directional help on gross margin, the effect of currency, can you kind of walk us through the P&L and how currency affected your top through the earnings and give us a sense of what was in the other line this quarter, because I know it does move a lot of fair bit. And then I just wanted -- I was hoping that you could give us where you think the effective share count will be for the fourth quarter?","Brett A. Sandercock","Yes. In terms of the overall P&L, on the top line year-on-year the impact on currency was around $4 million negative. If you work through all the currency through to the bottom line, it was an adverse impact of $0.02 for us this quarter, so that was on the currency front. On the share front, the weighted average share, I think, where we finished the quarter was probably around 146.5 probably a number that the south of that would be probably where we estimate Q4 at.","Operator","And gentlemen your next question will come from the line of Matthew Prior of Merrill Lynch.","Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a two-part question. Just, Peter, if I could, can I just check the U.S. industry growth rate is still that  6% to 8% that you've been talking the last couple of quarters. I know you mentioned that in the year but you just checking it with the U.S. and just in terms of the whole home sleep testing contribution to the industry growth and the doubling comment that you made. Are you saying that these sleep labs, traditional PSG guys, getting involved in the HST game at all?","Peter C. Farrell","Your first question, Matt, on the growth, we still think it's 6% to 8%. We're obviously extraordinary happy with the growth in the U.S. I mean 18% is not something that we would've predicted but we were coming off fairly weak comparables from Q3 of 2011. So that certainly explains a lot of the growth there. So 6% to 8%, yes, that's what we're still using as the expected growth in the U.S. market. As far as sleep labs are concerned, yes, we are seeing more adoption of HST and it's hard to know how fast that will go. I mean, if you're the sleep lab and you're getting $1,200, give or take, for a PSG versus $250, say, for the HST, obviously, there's an incentive financially to do as much of the PSG stuff as you can, but there will be continual pressures there, and I think if the lab realizes that they're actually missing out on patients because of the inconvenience. I mean, patients have to bring a duffel bag in, stay overnight and get all wired up,  et cetera,  et cetera, and generally  it's a few weeks before you can get into the lab and so on and so forth. And I think that there will be more and more of the labs adapting HST, at least offering one or the other. And how quickly that -- like anything, conservative labs who think it's bad practice or they just want to get involved then other labs who are more entrepreneurial. So you see the writing on the wall and it is on the wall. They will be the early adopters, the entrepreneurial ones. So we see that continuing.","Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So it doesn't sound, Peter, as if it's a main contributor to that 15% or even 20% in some cases, you think that the PSG guys are really yet to weigh in to this, which could be another factor to HST takeup ...","Peter C. Farrell","Well, I'll throw that to Mick, he's the president of Americas, but what would you say to that?","Michael J. Farrell","I'd say that 25% to 30% of sleep labs are actually now experimenting in home sleep testing. So of that trailing 12 months, where we're looking at 15% to 20% of the tests being home sleep test, a large portion of that will be the IDTFs and the entrepreneurial home sleep testing companies that are out there. But a growing portion of that is sleep labs that are starting to recognize, not only as we talk about that it can reduce the leakage rate when you offer the choice of home sleep testing versus PSG. But also that sleep labs are realizing that just under 20% of the covered lives in this country, now have pre-authorization requirements for PSG. And that is up from 15% just 90 days ago. So they're watching this trend and they're saying, I want to get involved in this and get ahead of this curve, so that I can appropriately and properly treat my patients. So they're definitely getting involved. But to your point, Matt, I do think there's runway ahead as they get more involved over the coming quarters and fiscal years.","Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. My second question was just in regards to round one of competitive bidding. We hear a lot of anecdotes around the impact of round one, not so much in terms of obviously the price reduction in the 34%, but more in regards to the slowdown in volumes that have occurred in those 9 MSAs. Can you just talk to whether or not you've seen that or give us any kind of anecdotals around the impact in round one on volumes?","Michael J. Farrell","Yes. So, Matt, it's a great question. So we're running a real-time experiment in those 9 Metropolitan Statistical Areas, those 9 MSAs. And we're just entering the fourth quarter of running and were able to compare the 3 quarters that we've seen of the 3-quarter  [indiscernible] in those 9 cities and we found that the growth rates within those 9 MSAs that we're into round one are equivalent to the general market growth rates across the U.S. market. So we have not seen a slowdown in revenue. We did see sort of split of 2 categories of customers within those, where you have the winners and the losers. The winners within those 9 cities, clearly, grew at a much faster rate and the losers started to decline in their purchases from us, which is logical. But the total volume, when you look at the mix between the winners and losers was a consistent revenue story. What you also saw is some of the winners were more sophisticated customers with larger economies of scale, larger abilities to go after install patient base and to market and sell replenishment programs to get patients who maybe, who are not as adherent and compliant to their device and regular use of masks and filters and tubing on a regular base. So you know, all in all, in those 9 cities, it's been a wash with some winners and some losers but we see good potential in partnering with the types of companies that have been winning in those areas.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, your next question will come from the line of Joanne Wuensch of BMO Capital Markets.","Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","One of my questions have been answered. Your long-term debt increased in the quarter, is that associated with share repurchases?","Peter C. Farrell","Primarily, yes. Brett, you do want to...","Brett A. Sandercock","Yes, that's exactly what I was going to say, Peter, yes. It will pretty much will be associated with the buyback, yes.","Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. CareFusion, how are they doing in the hospital environment which your new ventilator products?","Peter C. Farrell","It's still early on and the sales, obviously, selling to the hospital is a longer sales cycle. They're pitching the product to hospital customers and we're seeing some interest. They have a pipeline of interest that we've been reviewing with them but it's still too early to say.","Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","The conversation that we've been having about home sleep testing, is it the -- the shift appears to be not that is bringing more people into the pool but that it's a shift from Mr. Jones doesn't go to the lab, he goes into the home. Is that the right way to think about it?","Peter C. Farrell","Yes, I think so. It's too early to draw any other conclusions I think. However, I think we're going to see, as the word gets out to the primary care physicians and so forth, what we've seen over the years is if you go back, let's say 5 or more years, PCPs in general were bamboozled by sleep disorder breathing, they virtually weren't looking for it. Now they're aware of it and the big -- they're ignorant of the existence of it. Now the ignorance tends to be more along the lines of the signs and symptoms, like they didn't think of referring patients for sleep test as often as they should but some of that resistance, we believe, and we need more data on this, we believe is, \"Oh my God, if I send a patient to write a script for a sleep lab, it's going to be 1 to 2 months. And then, it's just I know they won't do it or blah, blah, blah. If they, themselves, either get involved in HST, which they easily can, and were trying to work out some strategies, whereby we make it easy for them to do this or hook them up with IDTFs or VirtuOx or IDS or Midmark or one of the others. But without -- I think we'll see some movement there and we'll see a pick up in, I think, diagnosis the use of HST beyond the sleep people themselves. And that will...","Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Is there an economic benefit to you of the home sleep testing? And can we quantify that?","Peter C. Farrell","Well, yes. I mean, the economic benefit is that the patients have to go on to an auto-setting device and that we get an uptick in revenue for that reason. In other words, you don't have the option of going to -- you don't do HST and then send the patient to a sleep lab to have the device pressure set. And the fact is, that there is now a substantial amount of literature showing that, in fact, if anything compliance is better with auto-setting products. It's certainly no worse, we can say that. And there are data that's coming from Europe, from Canada and from the U.S. which supports that. So I don't think physicians now are concerned about a compliance issue and, of course, it benefits us with a slight uptick in revenues.","Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","My final question is a lot of companies had an extra selling day in the month of February and they've been able to quantify the impact to revenue. Did you have that occur?","Brett A. Sandercock","Joanne, it's Brett. Yes, we did have that extra day on us. But if you average that out it'd be in the order of $5 million or something around that sort of number.","Peter C. Farrell","It might be more like $3 million to $4 million maybe, whatever.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question will come from the line of David Clair from Piper Jaffray.","David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I'm just wondering, can you talk about the Medicare prepayment reviews that are going out for CPAP? And do you expect those to have any kind of an impact on your business?","Peter C. Farrell","Well, I'll turn that to Mick.","Michael J. Farrell","So there are always Medicaid getting involved with select customers and one of the biggest issues with our customers right at the moment for Medicare is the number of audits going through from -- versus just the prepayment is just another issue they deal with. We think that there are many opportunities in the growth area within the market for customers within their Medicare as well as their private pay customers. Medicare constitutes just around 20% to 30% of the market and for some customers it sort of 5% to 10%. So there are challenges with Medicare as a payor, but they're also a big chunk of the payor market, so there's some opportunities there as well.","David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay, great. And then I appreciate the color on HumiCare, that we should see that in fiscal 2013. Anything else in the pipeline you'd like to highlight?","Peter C. Farrell","I'll refer that to Geoff. Do you want to comment there?","Geoff Neilson","Well, obviously we're doing a controlled product launch of HumiCare in Europe, we expect to be launching in fiscal '13. We're currently putting together the 510(k)submission, which will go in shortly. So we could expect to launch that when that comes through with the FDA approval. We obviously have a pipeline that we're working with Grundler on in terms of humidification portfolio. But obviously, what we're looking at now is doing a proper job at launching this first product to homecare and then to the hospital.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Saul Hudassin with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Saul Hadassin - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A quick question, you mentioned some further plans for the ventilation business. I'm just wondering if you could elaborate a bit on what that might entail?","Peter C. Farrell","Well, we've just, well, not just, at the end of the calendar year, released the Stellar 150 with iVAPS and basically we have a commitment to this space now, I mean Geoff has been building up the strategic business unit in respiratory care and we're going to continue with product evolution and we think in one case we might have -- it's probably not, you wouldn't describe it as a revolution, but we're working on some interesting future products. Put it that way.","Saul Hadassin - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe a question for Brett. The constant currency growth in R&D since it picked up in the last 3 quarters, is that kind of a new run rate that we should be thinking about? And is that tied into increased investment on the ventilation side of the business?","Brett A. Sandercock","There's probably, I mean, the acquisitions we undertook earlier in the year would probably, that would tick that up a little, by a couple of percent Saul as well. So probably our run rate would be a little low, probably sort of mid-teen type run rate. We've, I mean, at the end of the day, we really wanted to put our R&D dollars into the products we want to deliver into the markets. So that sort of drives the R&D spend. Through the course of this year, it's gone a little higher but it doesn't mean to say, necessarily trend down a little bit as we go through fiscal 2013 for example. So it's really dependent on where we're driving in terms of product development and what stage we're at on some of the projects.","Peter C. Farrell","Yes, and to add a bit more there, there was an uptick with the health informatics, of course. We got, I mean, Don Darkin and his team did a terrific job getting EasyCare Online out and that was a monster challenge. And we have to do it. So a lot of resources were put into that and there were newer resources. And of course, as Brett says, the acquisitions.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen your next question will come from the line of David Stanton of Nomura.","David Stanton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Look, just 2 things, firstly, Peter, perhaps you give us a bit of an update on the timeline for the results of the SERVE-HF trial. And for Brett, lower-than-expected tax rate than were expecting, should we be thinking that kind of tax rate ongoing?","Peter C. Farrell","David, on the survey, I mentioned that we hit 1,000 patients. The plan is 1,260 this is not something that's going to be over quickly.  And, however, what we are doing is we're doing a little side studies. I mean, the end points here are mortality and morbidity and they're pretty hard-nosed end points. But what we're also funding, some out of the ResMed Foundation and some direct from the company, are smaller studies where we're looking at ejection fraction, echocardiography and so on so forth. There should be some quick -- quicker results out of that. But I think to move the needle, it will be the survey and we're talking a couple of years more before we have anything that we can really talk about, sadly. It's expensive but that's just what you got to do.","Brett A. Sandercock","David, on the tax front. I'm comfortable with that 20%, 23% level at the moment in shorter-term. Basically, as we sort of ramp-up or increase production in Singapore, there's probably some opportunity there, the tax rate may adjust a little lower than that into the future. But at this point in time, I'm comfortable around that level.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Steve Wheen with JP Morgan.","Steven D. Wheen - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a question with regards to pricing. You've obviously mentioned in previous quarters that ASP declined is sort of [indiscernible]. So I just wonder if you're seeing the same sort of of dynamic at the moment, particularly when some channels we speak to are highlighting that on the APAP side, there has been some price increases off from you guys?","Peter C. Farrell","Put it this way, that's news to me and I think to people around the table. Gee, it's a lovely thought. But I think we're seeing something like a 2% to 3% to 5%, 5% is thankfully at the high end of what we're seeing. I mean, I had to predict that I mean, obviously, any time the DMEs and the HMEs  have an opportunity to bring in some bad news, which they have all result in price reductions, they will do so. So this is not a new game. This is a very, very old game. But we're not seeing anything untoward with ASPs and we're certainly not seeing any increases with our devices. We think they're worth more but it's hard to get people to pay for what they're really worth.","Steven D. Wheen - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Given the dynamic that's going on, in APAP could you see that particular category remains -- pricing remains flat and that it was not subject to price decline?","Peter C. Farrell","Well, let Mick take a shot at that.","Michael J. Farrell","Yes, Steve. Maybe what you're seeing is the blended ASP. There's some effects where it could be neutral, but certainly within a category, we're seeing that and I think on previous calls we've said a 5% to 7% per annum price reduction is what we see, we're saying in this call it's around 5%, which is about where we're at, but if you move from a CPAP to an APAP category and you move your mix in that, your blended ASP can appear neutral for a customer. But within the category of order set, there has been no increase in process and in this macroeconomic environment, I don't see going forward either and that sort of 5% go forward ASP reduction and we have to get off of it now, cost reductions and supply chain improvements, and to keep that gross margins really are is sort of where we're at.","Peter C. Farrell","I mean, obviously, internally, if we see much slower growth in the low-end and higher growth in the higher-end, well our ASP is going to go up as an average.","Steven D. Wheen - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, okay. And then just finally with regards to masks and your accessories in the U.S., you previously indicated that the DMEs haven't been, well, historically, have been refreshing the masks for their customers as regularly. Is that sort of -- are people trending now to replace masks in line with their reimbursement programs, now? Is that what's underpinning that growth?","Peter C. Farrell","Well, there's a lot of potential runway there. Clearly, when we look at the average number of masks sold per device per annum, we just see it is a huge opportunity for both us in the DMEs in HMEs. I don't know, Don, whether you want to add anything to that, but this is an area which -- when you've got millions of patients that are out there now and it's close to 6 million in the U.S. and we see it's less than 50% of what the revenues could be in that space. Less than 50%.","Donald Darkin","Yes. I think, as we are trying to push on this adherence compliance process, we're seeing more people coming on board with these programs. And, again, there's quite a bit of room here for us to adjust in a positive sense.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ben Haynor with Belt & Company.","Ben C. Haynor - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division","Just as a reminder, how much of the manufacturing is currently or has currently moved to Singapore?","Peter C. Farrell","Rob, you can take that? We're getting close to 50%.","Robert Douglas","Continual incremental and  there has been quite a shift from the last year of additional increments and yet it's not quite 50% but it's getting there on product mix basis.","Ben C. Haynor - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division","And is 50% kind of a goal? Or would you go beyond that?","Robert Douglas","Well sort of in terms of the longer-term strategy, we'll be looking now at other sites and we actually have a facility in Malaysia as well that started up out of some of the headgear stuff that we've done and we'll be looking at that and other options to where we go in the future.","Peter C. Farrell","But the Singaporean environment is, they have well trained people and they're willing to work with you on the tax front and quality people with reasonable charges is attractive.","Robert Douglas","And capacity utilization, obviously, one of the other key factors in keeping it efficient, so we like Singapore.","Ben C. Haynor - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division","Sure. And if I could follow up with one more. Last quarter, you talked about initiative to notify long-time CPAP patients with the benefits of newer devices. Could you just comment on what how's that coming along?","Peter C. Farrell","Yes, well the warranty on devices. So in our manuals, it's a 5-year life, if you like. I mean, we get patients that have been using our devices happily for over 10 years and when you pull them apart, you sometimes get a bit of a surprise. But we are sort of trying to get the word out to people, particularly, since over the years, the algorithms have improved significantly, the noise levels have come down, the performance overall is just so much better. We think the patients will be better off by switching their units out and we do have a program to do that. And Rob maybe you can talk but -- more specifically we're trying to, if you like, focus on the S8, the previous line of products, and switch them out, S8 and even the S7, I guess. And there a lot of those still out there and the S7s are well and truly over the 5-year mark. And the S8s have now I think we're probably, I would imagine earlier a few hundred thousand now that are not at the 5-year mark. So we see that as an opportunity and we're sort of trying to make a full-court press to make it attractive for patients to upgrade. Rob, do you want to add?","Robert Douglas","I think that we just think the S9 is going to be providing better therapy and it makes good sense for people to move onto it.","Peter C. Farrell","And we recommend that at the end of the 5 years that you have a maintenance anyway. And why spend the money on maintenance if we have an attractive price for an upgrade like a trade-in as opposed to maintenance. And we are recommending that after 5 years, you really do need to have your device looked at. So instead of spending money out of your pocket on an old device, why not upgrade. That's the pitch.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Michael Matson with Mizuho Securities U.S.A.","Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","I guess I just wanted to follow-up on what Mick was saying about the analysis that you guys had done on the 9 MSAs. I understand that those are comments on volume but I guess I'm just wondering what you saw with regard to pricing especially given the bifurcation you mentioned between the winners and losers, it seems like some of those winners would end up buying CPAPs in larger quantities, so would they then be getting better prices on this units, the masks and flow generators that their buying or not. So did you see any impact on your pricing in those cities?","Michael J. Farrell","Yes, Mike, good question. My comments we're actually about revenue. So saw that the winners that their revenue and, obviously, their volumes but their revenue grew and that the losers -- that they're revenue decline with us but on wash on a revenue basis it was a neutral element for us. So we were actually able to see that across those 9 cities we were revenue neutral. So my comments were around revenue not just volume.","Steven D. Wheen - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Got it. That's helpful. I guess, there has been some interest in the potential requirement of truckers getting tested for sleep apnea. And I guess there were sort of a league of the federal motor safety. -- Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration proposal this week or maybe it was last week. And I'm just wondering if that kind of was consistent with what you expected it to be, I think there were seeing a BMI over 35 they have to be tested. And then I'm just wondering what percentage of the population you think what kind of fall into that range.","Peter C. Farrell","Yes. Well, none of that was a surprise. It was a surprise to us that it was the directive was issued and then later that day, it was retracted, and that was last week. It was sort of bizarre. I mean the Secretary LaHood comes in and says, it was a clerical error and it shouldn't have gone out. I mean we don't see any changes to that. We think it's going to come down from 35 to 30 BMI. And as I indicated in my remarks, BMI is a very loose way to decide on who needs a sleep test because 50% of people, in fact, with SDB, I will say, are not obese and it's due to other problems like retrognathia and Marfan syndrome and a whole bunch of other things. Obesity obviously impacts. There are 9 million commercial drivers in this country. We see it as a big opportunity. And frankly, we are just puzzled. We've been heavily involved in working with the National Transportion Safety Board and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. In fact, our people have been, as I say, the staff really in terms of drawing the issue to peoples' attentions, we work with, as you know, Schneider trucking. We're also facilitating some publication of a study which was done with J.B. Hunt commercial drivers as well and that'll be coming out in the next few months. Again, suggesting that it's a very wise thing to have these people tested for sleep disorder breathing. As far as the prevalence, there's a wide range but the data that we think is pretty robust it's roughly 30% of all drivers have it at a level which is significant enough that they really do need to be sleep tested and treated. So it's big. And if you translate 30% of all those commercial drivers, I mean, it's 2.5 million to 3 million drivers and it could even be higher. I mean, as the data come in. The more we dig in these areas, the bigger the numbers or the bigger the prevalence tends to be. So yes, we think it is an incredibly exciting area and it's exciting because it's preventive of accidents, improves quality of life and reduces the cost for the carriers because there's less turnover by the drivers, they feel better, they work better, and we've got all the data, it's like the Holy Grail, if you prevent accidents, you improve peoples' quality of life and you save the company's money. And we think the FMCSA is being a little too prescriptive. But sending out that, publishing that they're going to do it and then the same day, retracting it, just is bizarre but maybe it's not a surprise, it is the government.","Steven D.

My name is Mariama, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Agnes, you may begin.","Agnes Lee - ResMed, Inc.","Thank you, Mariama. And thank you for attending ResMed's live webcast. Joining me on the call today are Mick Farrell, our CEO, and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release, it can be found on our website, at investor.resmed.com.","I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company, corporate strategy, integration of acquisitions and performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in filings made by ResMed with the SEC.","I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks, Agnes. And thank you to all of our shareholders joining us today as we review financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017. We achieved solid double-digit global revenue growth again this quarter, led by sales from Software-as-a-Service businesses as well as our new mask products. For the call today, I will review top-level financial results. I will then outline regional highlights from the business and discuss a few key announcements this quarter. Finally, I will hand the call over to Brett, who will walk you through our financial results in more detail.","Let me start out with some timely news. Earlier this week, we announced the much anticipated launch of the world's smallest CPAP, the ResMed AirMini. The AirMini is a CPAP solution that is literally small enough to fit inside your pocket. This innovation opens up new channels of cash payment for our homecare provider customers and delivers amazing, compact, quiet, therapeutic comfort to patients.","As a CPAP user myself, I have been using a ResMed AirMini prototype in AutoSet mode for the last year or so and it has changed my quality of life as I travel throughout many of the hundred countries where we sell our products and services. I can't wait for this technology to become available to millions of sleep apnea sufferers around the world as we launch the world's smallest CPAP. I'll talk more about this amazing solution later in the call.","On the connected care and digital health front, we launched a number of ongoing upgrades of our Brightree and AirView software solutions. Our Software-as-a-Service revenue continues to grow rapidly. Throughout Q3, we have had strong demand for our new range of AirFit masks, including the AirFit N20 in the nasal category and the AirFit F20 in the full face mask category. We have ramped up manufacturing for these products throughout the quarter. And despite continued strong demand, we remain on track to have supply ahead of demand during our current quarter, fiscal Q4.","At the bottom line in terms of non-GAAP net operating profit, we grew at 13% on a year-on-year basis. Our diluted EPS was $0.71 on a non-GAAP basis. We continue to balance revenue growth and gross margin improvements as well as ensuring appropriate investments in research and development as well as SG&A so that we can maximize the success of multiple product launches across global markets.","Now let me drill down on some regional highlights. The Americas region produced double-digit revenue growth. These results were fueled by SaaS revenue from Brightree as well as solid growth in masks. Device revenue growth this quarter was consistent with the market, and overall patient volume growth is steady. The mask and accessories category grew 8% in the quarter in the Americas. This is up sequentially from Q2, reflecting a strong demand for our new N20 and F20 products. The 97% to 99% fit range and the comfort of the InfinitySeal of the N20 and F20 are being well received. There's a long way to go on the ramp of these mask products in the quarter and throughout fiscal year 2018.","Growth in devices in the Americas was in line with the market, at 3%. That was up against a large year-over-year comparable of 15%. We are maintaining the share we gained during the last 18 to 24 months due to our great devices as well as ongoing homecare provider adoption of AirView solutions and our fast-growing patient engagement app, called myAir. We now have over 3 million patients monitored with 100% cloud-connected medical devices in their homes. We also have more than 5 million patients in AirView and over 45 million patient accounts in Brightree.","We are liberating data and unlocking value for physicians, providers, patients on a daily basis. We are proud to lead the digital health revolution in sleep apnea and COPD, but we are even more excited by the value that our customers see and how we are reducing costs for therapy setup and enhancing adherence rates for patients, leading to better outcomes.","Brightree continues to grow strongly and in line with our acquisition model. This quarter, we launched enhanced features integrating document management capabilities between Brightree and AirView. We have a robust pipeline of software-enhancement projects that will add even more features to help make our customers' workflows more automated and efficient, freeing up cash flow for even better patient care. We also achieved very good growth of our respiratory care device platforms, led by the cloud-connected life-support ventilator called Astral.","Let's spend a few minutes now reviewing our EMEA and APAC regions. Mask and accessories sales for the combined EMEA and APAC regions were up a very strong 12% this quarter, driven by the launch of our N20 and F20 products. We continued to received positive feedback in Europe and Asia from patients, physicians, home care providers regarding both the broad fit range as well as the enhanced comfort of the N20 and F20.","This quarter, we also achieved solid growth in our AirSense 10 range of devices, as well as our non-invasive ventilators and Adaptive-Servo Ventilation range in Europe and Asia. Adoption of AirView by home care providers and myAir by patients is increasing in Europe as well. We achieved solid growth of our dental mandibular repositioning device called Narval. Our philosophy is however you seek treatment for your sleep apnea, ResMed should be there for you.","Let me now take a few minutes to update you on progress against each of the three horizons in our 2020 Growth Strategy, and then I'll hand the call over to Brett. In the first horizon of growth, which focuses on our core sleep apnea business, we are making significant advances with the smallest, quietest and most comfortable products, enhanced by digital health and connected care solutions. We launched our new F20 and N20 in the U.S., Europe and many other major markets around the world in the second quarter. We continue to see exceptionally strong demand for these products that led to demand continuing to outpace supply for some of the SKUs in Q3. Consistent with what we predicted 90 days ago on this call, we expect our supply to catch up with and get ahead of demand during the current quarter, fiscal Q4 2017.","As I briefly discussed earlier, we announced the launch of the ResMed AirMini this week. The ResMed AirMini, once again, is the world's smallest CPAP. And, yes, it's also an APAP, with availability of our proprietary AutoSet algorithm. And, yes, it also has built-in humidification with no water that needs to be added each night.","In addition, there is an AirMini app that can be used with your iOS or Android smartphone so that patients can continue to stay engaged with their therapy even when they are on the road. You can check out details in our newsroom, at newsroom.resmed.com. The key summary statement is we have created the world's smallest and most portable CPAP that literally fits in your coat pocket.","One of the biggest requests for portable CPAP devices is the need for humidification. We have created humidification technology that's integrated into the mask tubing that we call HumidX. This amazing innovation requires no water to be added and provides patients with the humidification and comfort they have learned to expect from ResMed. Our well-established AirSense 10 device range is still the best device for at-home use. Our brand new AirMini just adds to that as the best device for use on the road.","We have been conducting controlled product launches in select countries and the feedback from patients and providers on the AirMini has been excellent. We also showed the ResMed AirMini to physicians at the Sleep and Breathing Conference in Marseille, France. The doctors that saw the product there are very excited to add this to their portfolio of sleep apnea solutions for their patients. We will provide more details as we launch the ResMed AirMini over the coming quarter and throughout fiscal year 2018.","We continue to lead in the field of connected care, one of the key foundations of our Growth Strategy. In February, the European research firm, Berg Insight, released their annual Mobile Health, or mHealth and Home Monitoring Report. This report named ResMed as a key global leader in remote patient monitoring, with over 2 million devices connected. We just announced that we are actually well beyond 3 million devices that are 100% cloud connected. As the world's leading tech-driven medical device company, we now have more than 1 billion nights of sleep data.","Our digital health apps have been clinically proven to improve patient adherence and our software has demonstrated that it lowers the cost of therapy setup. We are developing and enhancing advanced cloud-based algorithms literally every day to convert big data into actionable information. The goal is clear; we want to lower costs of the health care system and provide better care and better outcome for patients. We are looking at partnerships with other players in digital health to enhance value across disease states, from sleep apnea and COPD to other important chronic diseases. Watch this space.","On the clinical front, ResMed sponsored a research study that was presented at the Sleep and Breathing Conference that I mentioned in Marseille. This new study showed that switching patients with treatment-emergent central sleep apnea from CPAP to ResMed's Adaptive-Servo Ventilation, or ASV technology, significantly improves adherence. This is the largest analysis of patients with treatment-emergent central sleep apnea. The de-identified aggregated data included over 200,000 patients and leveraged our connected care and digital health platforms to run the analyses.","In short, the study showed that adherence rates were increased, with a relative improvement in adherence of 22%. These patients also used their ASV therapy longer and had significantly fewer apneas during sleep compared to the control group. This study highlights the need to continuously monitor central sleep apnea and to consider therapeutic options, like ASV, based on each patient's disease severity.","Moving to the second horizon of the ResMed 2020 Growth Strategy. We are in the early stages of driving our connected care strategy in COPD, and we are making good progress. We have a spectrum of cloud-connected respiratory care products across our portfolio, including cloud-connected non-invasive ventilators in the AirCurve range, cloud-connected life support ventilators, such as Astral. We also have projects on the books for cloud-connected portable oxygen concentrators.","With over 200 million patients suffering from COPD and with the disease state being the number-three cause of death and the number-two cause for re-hospitalization in the Western world, we are intently focused on testing and driving models that both lower cost and improve outcomes for COPD, neuromuscular disease, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and beyond.","Our third horizon of growth encompasses a portfolio of opportunities, including sleep health and wellness, chronic disease management as well as clinical adjacencies, including heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. This quarter, the CAT-HF Study was published in the Journal of American (sic) [Journal of the American] (15:15) College of Cardiology. This is the first study to show that addressing sleep apnea with ResMed's ASV therapy may improve cardiovascular outcomes for people with preserved ejection fraction heart failure. The overall CAT-HF Study results were neutral, with a pre-specified subgroup analysis showing a statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint for patients with preserved ejection fraction heart failure who also have sleep apnea.","Currently, there are no level of evidence 1A guideline recommended therapies specific for patients with preserved ejection fraction heart failure, which accounts for half of all people living with chronic heart failure. We believe that having the CAT-HF Study published in a major cardiovascular clinical journal is the start of a journey that may prove that ASV therapy can help patients with preserved ejection fraction heart failure.","Another key area of Horizon 3 growth is our work in chronic disease management algorithms, including population health models, care coordination and Software-as-a-Service models for home health, home nursing and hospice. This is an exciting area for us as we look for ongoing growth of our SaaS portfolio offerings.","Let me close with this. We are incredibly excited about the ongoing launch of our new N20 and F20 mask technologies and our pipeline of products in 2017, including, of course, the new ResMed AirMini. We continue to pioneer connected care with enhanced solutions that lower costs for providers and improve outcomes for patients.","We are leading the industry, driving consumer awareness of sleep apnea and COPD so that undiagnosed consumers go to see their doctors and health care providers. We continue to bring our strategy into action for the benefit of physicians, providers, payers and, most importantly, to improve the lives of tens of millions of sleep apnea and COPD patients around the world.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brett for his remarks and then we will go to Q&A. Over to you, Brett.","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today I'll provide an overview of our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017. As Mick noted, we had a solid quarter. Group revenue for the March quarter was $514.2 million, an increase of 13% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 14%. Excluding acquisitions and in constant currency terms, organic revenue increased by 6% over the prior-year quarter.","Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Brightree acquisition, our sales in the Americas were $297.1 million, an increase of 5% of the prior-year quarter. Sales in combined EMEA and Asia-Pacific totaled $182.1 million, an increase of 6% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales in combined EMEA and Asia-Pacific increased 9% over the prior-year quarter.","Breaking out revenue between product segments, Americas device sales were $158.4 million, an increase of 3% over the prior-year quarter. Masks and other sales were $138.7 million, an increase of 8% over the prior-year quarter. Revenue in combined EMEA and Asia-Pacific device sales were $122.7 million, an increase of 5% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 8%.","Masks and other sales were $59.4 million, an increase of 8% over the prior-year quarter, or again in constant currency terms, an increase of 12%. Globally in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 5% while masks and other increased by 9% over the prior-year quarter. Brightree revenue for the third quarter was $35 million, with growth on a prior-year comparable basis continuing to track in the low-double digits.","During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles and restructuring expenses. It the prior-year comparables, they exclude amortization of acquired intangibles and acquisition-related expenses. We've provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our third quarter earnings press release.","Our gross margin for the March quarter was 58.3%. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin increased by 100 basis points, reflecting manufacturing and procurement efficiencies and the favorable impact from our Brightree acquisition, partially offset by typical declines in average selling prices and unfavorable currency movements. Assuming current exchange rates and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margin in Q4 to be broadly consistent with our Q3 gross margin,","Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $137.9 million, an increase of 16% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses also increased by 16%. Excluding the impact from acquisitions and in constant currency terms, our SG&A expenses increased by 9%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 26.8% compared to the 26.3% that we reported last year.","Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we've updated our guidance on SG&A as a percentage of revenue and expect it to be in the range of 26% to 27% for Q4 FY 2017. R&D expenses for the quarter was $35.1 million, an increase of 25% over the prior-year quarter, or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 21%. This largely reflects the impact of our recent acquisitions and incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. Excluding the impact from acquisitions, our R&D expenses in constant currency terms increased by 5% over the prior year. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.8% compared to the year-ago figure of 6.2%.","Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% for Q4 FY 2017. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $11.4 million for the quarter, an increase of $6.8 million over the prior year, reflecting the additional amortization associated with our recent acquisitions. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $11.5 million.","Non-GAAP operating profits for the quarter was $126.7 million, an increase of 13% over the prior-year quarter, while non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $100.7 million, an increase of 3% over the prior-year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.71, an increase of 3% over the prior-year quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.62. Note that our prior-year earnings per share comparable was restated as a result of our adoption of Accounting Standard (23:04) whereby we recorded a tax benefit of $2.3 million in Q3 FY 2016. In the current quarter under the standard, we recorded a tax benefit of $1.4 million.","Additionally, foreign exchange movements negatively impacted third quarter earnings by $0.01 per share, reflecting an unfavorable impact from the weaker euro and stronger Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.9%. And, looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for Q4 FY 2017 will be in the range of 21% to 22%.","During the quarter, we recognized restructuring expenses of $7.9 million associated with the closure of our Paris manufacturing facility. Cash flow from operations was $67.6 million for the quarter. This reflects strong underlying earnings offset to some extent by an increase in net working capital balances during the quarter, in particular an increase in accounts receivable and a reduction in accounts payable associated with the timing of creditor payments this quarter. It also included the payment of contingent consideration associated with our Curative acquisition and the payment of the BMC\/3B litigation settlement. Note these items were accrued in our previous Q2 results.","Capital expenditure for the quarter was $14.6 million while depreciation and amortization for the March quarter totaled $28.5 million. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.33 per share, an increase of 10% over our prior-year quarterly dividend. As previously announced, we have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to recent acquisitions. At present, we're still expecting to recommence the buyback sometime in fiscal year 2018.","At March 31, we had $1.17 billion in gross debt and $341 million in net debt. Our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels. At March 31, total assets were $3.4 billion and net equity was $1.85 billion.","And with that, I will hand the call back to Agnes.","Agnes Lee - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A. And we ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question only. If you have additional questions after that, please get back in the queue. Mariama, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets is on line with a question.","Matthew Henriksson - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yes. Hi. This is Matt Henriksson in for Joanne. Our first question is with regards to the current environment for the CPAP treatment adherence, is there any commentary that you could give on the overall market, both at a patient level and just general trends?","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks for the question, Matt. With regards to adherence of patients on therapy, there's been many changes over the years. Traditionally in the peer-reviewed published press in the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s, adherence rates in the 50% to 60% were published in the literature. Particularly with our connected care and digital health solutions, particularly AirView and, most recently, myAir patient engagement apps, we have now peer-reviewed and published clinical data showing up to 87% adherence when patients are using some of our digitally-enhanced cloud-connected devices and engagement apps, such as myAir.","So, there's really a revolution in patient adherence happening through connected care and digital health to get to those 80%, close to 90%, adherence rates. And it changes the game. It's better for patients, it's better for their doctors, it's better for the health care system because the patients who use therapy are less frequent fliers into hospitals. So we think it's good for the overall system.","Matthew Henriksson - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. That's great. And then just kind of general trends in the market. How are you seeing the market growth rates?","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","So, Matt, we see the global respiratory medical industry growing in the mid to high-single digits with masks growing at the high end of that and devices growing at the low end of that. And that's where we see it broadly globally. And maybe slightly ahead of that in the U.S. or slightly behind that in Europe, depending on some seasonal and economic factors, but those are the general growth rates, in the sort of mid to high-single digits.","Matthew Henriksson - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks for the questions, Matt.","Operator","Steve Wheen from Evans & Partners is online with a question.","Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.","Yes. Good morning. I was wondering if you could comment, Brett, just on the gross margin and the various components that are contributing to that. I guess I'm a little surprised with the guidance for fourth quarter that it is going to be stable on third just because you are getting the benefit of that mix shift. So, what you were anticipating might be coming through to dilute some of that.","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah, Steve. As Mick said, we expect it to be back orders or (29:10) basically supply running ahead of demand and we've got pack (29:15) capacity there. So that comes through in Q4. But then I think there'll be some ramp up by then (29:20) within the market.","The other thing I think in the Q4 we'll still be facing some headwinds in things like air freight and so on where we've sort of scrambled to catch up and fill the chain a bit. But that trend moderated a bit into Q4 as well. So just some of those factors are I think that we said looking at short term, we're kind of comfortable where we are.","Clearly, we look at mask trajectory. To the extent you get outperformance in mask growth in a relative sense, then certainly that would support improvement in gross margins. So, taking more of a short-term view on the current guidance on that, given a couple of the headwinds around things such as air freight that we'll have to deal with I think through the quarter. But then expect that \u2013 we see that mask growth in there certainly that'll be supportive of the gross margin going forward.","Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.","Yes. So the air freight cost is going to be enough to offset even in today's quarter result, the mix shift should've been more favorable, I guess. So, are there any other costs other than air freight?","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah, just think through it a little bit. Certainly, we've seen a big stabilization in product mix compared to what we've seen. But some of the big mix shifts before previously, don't forget, we had device growth which was huge, so we might have had spreads in those growth rates of 20% or 30%. So that really did exaggerate the impact on product mix. So you'll certainly see some benefits with product mix. But you'd need to see quite differentiated growth rates to see sort of massive movements I guess in that product mix.","So it will certainly be positive. But you just \u2013 we have to look at the relative growth rates that we get through FY 2018 as we kind of ramp through the new product range and then form a better view after we see true trajectory I think on the new masks.","Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Andrew Goodsall with UBS is on the line with a question.","Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.","Thanks very much for taking my question. I just want to clarify that you are in fact backorder into the fourth quarter. And just another question on the masks. Just when we might expect to see a 20 Series Nasal Pillow?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks for the question, Andrew. Yes, we were on backorder in a number of the SKUs throughout Q3. As we predicted 90 days ago, we said we would be throughout Q3 and would getting supply ahead of demand in Q4. And we're reiterating that model. We still were on backorder on some of the SKUs at the end of Q3, but we are well on track with the factories ramping up their manufacturing to get supply ahead of demand in this current quarter we are in, Q4.","As Brett said, that comes with a cost of some air freight. But we think getting patients this technology needs to happen and we're willing to invest in the temporary air freight to make sure that happens and we can get off the backorder this quarter and get ahead, get our supply ahead and get the supply chain catching up and look for the benefits from that throughout 2018.","To your second question with regards to future products. We don't talk about products that are not yet released nor the timing of those. I'm very happy to talk about the product we released or talked about launching this week, the ResMed AirMini. But we won't talk about product pipeline, products that are not yet released.","Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.","Sure. And just to my quick follow-up, just on the U.S. tax reform announcements, just any thoughts around repatriation capital?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Well, I might have a first answer to that and hand over to Brett. We think it's good for business if we design a product in Sydney, Australia and manufacture it in Singapore and sell it in France, we don't think we should have extra tax on that money if we want to reinvest it in the United States. And so, we think some of the opportunities to allow companies to invest some of their cash in the U.S. is a good policy potentially.","And, obviously, you've got to see that it can get through Congress and actually become law. But if there are some areas of tax relief for us to reinvest funds into, say, our Atlanta manufacturing facility or our Los Angeles, California motor design and manufacturing facilities, and beyond that, our software engineering capabilities in San Diego and Atlanta, Halifax, we would absolutely consider bringing more funds into the U.S. and North America.","Brett, anything to add on that?","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","No. I think that's a good summary, Mick. I'd just say that I think, that in principle we'd be pretty happy with a repatriation tax. But I think the key would be what sort of rate they attach to that repatriation tax, which would probably be a lot of negotiations, seeing what they come up with. But I think, in principle, we think it's good. It could be an opportunity for us. But, of course, we just have to wait for the detail before I get too excited I think at this stage.","Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.","No problem. Thank you very much.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","Margaret Kaczor from William Blair is online with a question.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Maybe the first one for Mick, please. Can you talk through the drivers of overall domestic device market growth or demand, how that might vary from quarter to quarter based on product launches? And maybe as you look out, what can ResMed do to bring that domestic device market growth into the mid or high-single digits and over what timeframe that can happen?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks, Margaret. Yes, as you saw in the quarter, our Americas device growth was 3%. Masks was stronger at 8%-plus. And overall growth excluding Brightree was at 5%. So well in that sort of mid to high-single digits in the overall category.","Look, one of the catalysts for moving those numbers up, there's many. We're doing a lot of sleep wellness and sleep awareness work with Pegasus Capital and Dr. Oz. You're going to see a number of sleep awareness promotions through our SleepScore Labs' investment with those folks. And a lot of getting out to the 40 million people who are suffering every night and snoring and not getting diagnosed as opposed to the much smaller than that, 5 million, 6 million, 7 million, 8 million who are already on therapy in the U.S. And we'll not just be doing that in this country; we'll be doing it globally on sleep awareness and sleep wellness.","The other way that we're looking to drive device growth is obviously by moving our non-invasive ventilators and life support ventilators. The whole connected care revolution that happened in sleep apnea will happen in COPD, a much more severe disease state. And that will allow us to bring some high-margin device growth in life support vents and non-invasive vents. So, there's some upside in both of those areas.","And the third and final area I'd say is taking this idea of this travel CPAP niche and making it a little more mainstream. I think bringing ResMed's technology to something that's the size of the water bottle in front of me. And you can have a look at the videos. We've now released the size of this product. It's about five inches by three inches by two inches. I think having the world's smallest travel CPAP with ResMed's technology and no water added for humidification and ResMed's AutoSet capability will grow that relatively small niche now to be significantly larger and allow ResMed to really drive that category.","So those three things are potential catalysts for us to drive up that device number. And I've got to tell you, we plan to do it.","Agnes Lee - ResMed, Inc.","And in terms of the timeframe I think was the tail end of the question.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yes. So, look, all those things are going on in parallel and have different time frames. The sleep awareness is an ongoing one that we're planning over a long-term period. The connected care into COPD, again, is a long-term, you know we call it Horizon 2, Horizon 3 Strategy, but it's incredibly strong on benefits. Reasonably quickly we'll start to see how well the travel CPAP niche grows. And we're starting from a very low base of what's out there already, but we're really excited to play in all three of those.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","And just as a follow-up maybe to the overall company growth. Can you give us an idea of what the organic Brightree growth was in this quarter? And maybe provide some context about what maybe you've been surprised by about Brightree in the last few months in terms of leverage points, owning the business and really its ability to drive stronger overall company revenue growth into that high-single digit range? Thanks.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yes. Sure. Brett, do you want to break out the numbers for the U.S. with and without Brightree and what Brightree's growth was? And then I'll go into some of the more strategic elements of how we're leveraging that.","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Sure. Yes, as we mentioned on, I think it was really on the Brightree revenue on the third quarter revenue for Brightree was $35 million, tracking quite nicely. And that's tracking low-double digit growth for the Brightree business this quarter.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","In that took, in essence, our Americas growth without Brightree at 5% to Americas growth with Brightree in the double digits really strong 18% top-line growth there in the Americas with Brightree.","How are we looking at that strategically? I mean, obviously, we have full separation of the commercial teams on go-to-market on the sales teams on Brightree versus ResMed. But as we look at the broader market, having a SaaS capability to map workflows, reduce the costs of document management, inventory management, physician and prescription management and helping even with revenue cycle management for our customers, has really been an advantage for ResMed, an advantage for the customers, the homecare customers that have partnered with us in allowing efficiencies and freeing up cash flow so they can invest in better patient care.","And then tying it to the digital side on the back end where we run AirView and myAir and are able to drive adherence rates from 50%, 60% to 80%, 90%, there's just huge upside in terms of the quality that that homecare provider provides to their customer, the doctor and their customer, insurance company in terms of keeping those patients out of hospital and happy for the doctors and the payers. And also for the patients themselves. And so it's kind of like altruism is linked to the profit motive when you're able to drive adherence up. And we're really excited to be able to do that with our connected care solutions.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks, Margaret.","Operator","Chris Kallos from Morningstar is online with a question.","Chris Kallos - Morningstar Australasia Pty Ltd.","Thanks for taking my questions. I just had a question about cardiology. You mentioned the CAT-HF Study and some promising results in the subgroup analysis. What are the next steps in this area? And what can we expect on the clinical trial fronts?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah, so we're really excited about the CAT-HF analysis on heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Obviously, that study was across both HFrEF and HFpEF. But on the HFpEF side, the heart failure with preserved ejection fraction side, having a statistically significant improvement was very strong. And getting published in JACC we think is a major accomplishment. But it's the start of a longer-term journey, as you know, in this space.","We have a number of follow-on clinical analyses that we are going to work on there. Professor Chris O'Connor who was working with Duke and now with Inova Heart Institute in the Washington D.C., Delaware area is absolutely \u2013 and all the \u2013 not just the primary investigators, but all the investigators that are working on CAT-HF are really excited about follow-on work. We're looking at other studies in Western Europe where there's some very similar results, where ASV can have a very good impact on heart failure with preserved ejection fraction patients.","But these are long-term investments. They're not this quarter, next quarter. But over the next year, two, three, we think that that group, which is about half of all heart failure patients, that there's some really good upside in terms of keeping these patients out of hospital with no other pharmacological or device Class 1A guideline therapies. We think that's just an opportunity that we have to pursue, so we're going to be pursuing that over time. And we'll give updates on a periodic basis.","Chris Kallos - Morningstar Australasia Pty Ltd.","Great. And perhaps could you give it breakdown of where ASV now stands in the mix?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Sure. Well, ASV, we don't break out the category specifically, but I will say, as a general trend, it has absolutely turned around from the nadir, if you like, from SERVE-HF a quarter or two or three ago to strong growth and in line with and ahead of some of the growth of the other categories, particularly in Europe. We've seen the European team really double down on ASV for treatment-emergent central sleep apnea.","That study that we did on over 200,000 patients \u2013 think of that, 200,000 patients in a clinical study using the digital health and connected care. That brings two things to bear; not only the use of digital health and connected care for clinical studies that can get published, but also a much larger population base that can show ASV can be better than CPAP for treatment of those types of patients in terms of adherence. So watch this space. There's more to come on combining digital health and clinical studies and looking at therapies like ASV, life support vent and non-invasive vents.","Chris Kallos - Morningstar Australasia Pty Ltd.","Great. That's it for me. Thank you.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Will Dunlop from Merrill Lynch is online with a question.","William Dunlop - Merrill Lynch Equities (Australia) Ltd.","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just on cash flow. Your data (44:17) and inventory days both jumped up this quarter sequentially. I'm just wondering if that's a bit of a blip and you expect that to normalize at the end of 4Q?","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. Hi, Will. It's Brett. Yeah, if I look, December was probably compared to our normal quarters, we were in a pretty good position on receivables. If I go back year-on-year and look at it last year, it was pretty consistent on DSOs, for example, on receivables. So I think it's more of December being particularly good rather than March being particularly bad. So I think it's okay there. I think that'll normalize into Q4.","And there's just a few other one-time payments were being made through the quarters which pushed our cash flow down a bit lower in March than what you'd typically see. But I do expect that to normalize into Q4.","William Dunlop - Merrill Lynch Equities (Australia) Ltd.","Okay. Thanks. And just on the U.S. flow gen growth rate of 3%, do you think you lost market share in the quarter? And, if so, were there any one-offs or any reasons, any contracts perhaps as a result that led to that?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks for the question, Will. Actually, we think we held share. In fact, the incredible growth of share that we've achieved over the last 18 to 24 months since the launch of AirSense 10 and also Air Solutions and the AirView platform. We took very strong share with strong double-digit growth. But we think the market growth is mid to high-single digits for the whole industry. But flow generator growth is below that mid to high-singles and mask growth is at the high end of it.","So we think we held the really strong share that we gained these last four to six quarters. But I'll hand it to Jim Hollingshead, who's our President of the Americas. Any further detail with regard to share and holding and growing that?","James Hollingshead - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks, Mick. No, I think Mick summed it up really well. Our market data shows that we held our very strong share position in the market in flow gen, which means that in the quarter we grew about in line with market.","William Dunlop - Merrill Lynch Equities (Australia) Ltd.","Thank you.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks, Will.","Operator","Matt Taylor from Barclays is on line with a question.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on that flow gen thought. You called out a tougher comp, but you had a much tougher comp last quarter, still grew over that with the flow gen. Was there something new in the market that would have taken that growth rate down? I think you still have the best solution, but just curious why we saw that change in the growth rate.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Thanks, Matt. Yes, it's really a return to market growth rate there. Which, again, ResMed we don't accept market growth rates; we like to drive ahead of that. Having six to eight quarters of outpacing the market to have a quarter where you're at pace with the market I think is acceptable for a 90-day run. But we don't want to have the adjusted market growth rate forever.","And I answered a little earlier with Margaret's question of three areas that we're looking to through getting more patients into the funnel through driving device growth in COPD, neuromuscular disease and Duchenne muscular dystrophy for our non-invasive vents and life support vents and POCs. But then also launching the world's smallest CPAP to drive really a cash business through our homecare providers, where we have a retail business from our homecare providers to patients to grow a really exciting niche.","65% of sleep apnea sufferers travel more than four to five times a year in the U.S. And right at the moment, half of them don't take their device because it's too big. I think that whole area is a really exciting one for us to grow. So, look, we don't want to sit back and just accept market growth rates of 3% to 5% or 5% to 7% or 7% to 9% on the various categories. We want to drive well ahead of that. And we have a lot of strategies to do that.","We've had a great six to eight quarter run of incredible growth based upon our price strategy of changing the basis of competition from smaller, quieter and more comfortable to smaller, quieter, more comfortable and more connected. And we're not done with that. And that growth and that share we gained as you saw in the quarter is very sustainable because we're able to have customers get very involved in the workflows of AirView and really want to keep it as part of their business. So we think there's a lot of opportunities to come. And as I said earlier, watch this space as we continue to grow this market.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you for that. And then just one follow up on the P&L. I was just hoping maybe Brett could clarify what is in the other income there? You have $3.5 million. Can you just parse that out?","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah, that predominantly FX, Matt, or FX gains there basically our hedging contracts and so on. So that rolled through other income.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Matt O'Brien from Piper Jaffray is online with a question.","J. P. McKim - Piper Jaffray & Co.","J. P. in for Matt. Thanks for taking the question. I want to dig into a comment that Brett made earlier about on the pricing side of it. It seems like maybe the pressure there has picked up a bit and I just wanted to dig into it. Is it more the mask or the generator side? And is this from competition picking up on pricing, or is it just the DME customers maybe feeling a little more of the competitive bidding squeeze rolling out through this year? Thank you.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks for the question, J. P. I know I got to tell you, competitive bidding has been in play for seven years now, 28 quarters. And there was no new news in the last 90 days. So we've seen relatively stable pricing within the U.S. geography, and frankly. Also in the other 99 countries we do business in. We haven't seen any major changes to pricing.","I'll hand to Jim. Any further color within the U.S. market with regard to pricing effects of CB?","James Hollingshead - ResMed, Inc.","Well, competitive bidding and the reimbursement environment has been an ongoing challenge for our customers now for several quarters, as I think everybody knows. But there was nothing unusual in the quarter related to pricing. We see about the same annual downward pressure on pricing as we've seen in the category for a long time.","J. P. McKim - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Sure. Thank you. And one more for Brett, if I could. Just on operating cash flows, if you look at it year-to-date, I guess for you guys for the last nine months, it's down probably 32% from where you were last year. It looks like you got more eaten up in inventory and AR. I'm just trying to figure out why that is, especially now that you have Brightree involved.","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Sure, yeah. Last year's cash flow was, if you compare that to the year before, it was very strong cash flows. And we're working through getting some good improvements in working capital balances.","So this year I think on the receivable side, we've seen good revenue growth. So that's been driving on the receivables. And working capital \u2013 working balances around inventories and so on just looking to really rebuild through with a lot of new product launches and so on has been happening. So, yeah, I think it's sort of a little bit of a building in working capital level what was a pretty low base I guess the year before.","So not too much there. The underlying earnings are pretty strong. It's just a matter of keeping on top of working capital balances really. If we do that, we'll draw some good cash flow. So good cash flow, but acknowledge it's a little bit lower than where we were last year where we had very strong cash flows.","J. P. McKim - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks, J. P.","Operator","Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley is online with a question.","Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.","Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Just two quick ones. I'm wondering if you could give us some granularity on your oxygen business in the U.S. and how you're progressing towards the capture of the COPD opportunity. Thanks.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks, Sean. I'll hand to Jim Hollingshead to walk through the market development for our POCs in the U.S. market. And maybe we can talk a little later about where we're going in Europe with that. But I think for this quarter let's focus on the U.S.","James Hollingshead - ResMed, Inc.","We think the POC business is off to a solid start in our hands. We've made some solid improvements to that product line. There's an ongoing shift away from canister oxygen to other delivery methods, including especially portable methods, like POCs. So the demand in the market remains strong. And we think that there's tremendous upside in that market as we continue to develop the product, make it a resonant product and bring connectivity to it. So we're very bullish on the outlook for that business.","Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.","Okay. Thank you. And on the COPD and vents, any commentary there, Mick?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah, look, clearly, COPD is a huge market development opportunity for us globally. 200 million patients worldwide, many of them in some of our high-growth markets. As we start to grow particularly our China and India business, COPD will be a major play for that. I think in those fast-growing markets to avoid some of the sick care system where COPD patients get really sick and then appear at the hospital on a regular basis within many Western European countries that we're working on keeping them out of hospital with our cloud-connected devices. We can reestablish models of out-of-hospital care for those patients.","So in developing markets or fast-growing markets, like China and India, about setting up systems that avoid the current sick care hospital care system in some of the Western world. But then within the Western world, it's about looking at things differently, trying to find ways to use connected care to predict when patients may have exacerbations and have through chronic disease management physician or nurse practitioner contact with a patient to prevent a hospitalization. We think that's a huge opportunity in the long term and something that we're absolutely focused on.","And in the short to medium term, we have home health, hospice and home nursing capabilities within Brightree and beyond in the ecosystem which we think can be leveraged to help keep those patients out of the hospital, too. So almost three phases of COPD growth. One in the fast-growing areas of China, India, Eastern Europe developing new models. Two, doubling down on our chronic disease management and connected care play for COPD. And three, some longer-term models to leverage our out-of-hospital Software-as-a-Service capabilities.","Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.","Great. Thank you, Mick. That's all I have.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks, Sean.","Operator","David Low from JPMorgan is online with a question.","David A. Low - JPMorgan","Thanks very much. Mick, if I could start with the travel CPAP. Clearly, it's just being launched in the coming quarter. But could you talk about how big you think that opportunity could be?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks for the question, David. I'll start with this and I'll maybe hand off to Jim because the primary first marketed launch will be in the United States, where there's strong demand for this. ResMed's been in business for 28 years next month. And I've worked at the company for 17 years. And almost every time I've talked to a patient, they've asked me, when is ResMed coming up with a travel CPAP solution? I've seen the stuff out there, but it's not what I want. I want ResMed quality. And we spent a long time making sure we could miniaturize this right and that we could get humidification technology miniaturized and able to be used on the go and we could link it to the world's best masks and housings (56:32). And we got there.","And I've been personally using this ResMed AirMini for 12 months and it's totally changed my travel life, whether I'm on a plane, in a hotel. Wherever I am, I get AutoSet, I get humidification and I get my Nasal Pillows, my P10 with me. And so right at the moment, to your question around sizing, it's a small niche. It's sub-1% of the device market niche. We think we can grow it very significant multiples of where it is now. And we think ResMed can have a very strong share in that with the smallest, quietest, most comfortable, best connected, best humidified product in the category.","Having said all that, we're in controlled product launch. I'm obviously very excited about the opportunity as a patient and a user. But I'm also excited as a business manager for where this could go.","Jim, any further thoughts about AirMini and how it can grow the category?","James Hollingshead - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Mick. I think it's actually difficult to predict how big the market can be based upon the current market. We think that the market is underserved. We know there's pent-up demand. And Mick referred to this earlier; there are millions of patients who are on CPAP therapy. The average CPAP patient, according to our research, takes four trips a year. So there's millions of people who are traveling. Half of them tell us they don't take their CPAP with them because it's too inconvenient. And so that's millions of potential patients who are looking for a solution. But what they're waiting for is a solution that's a ResMed quality solution.","And we feel very confident in the AirMini offering. It's not only a terrific, small, in-your-pocket AutoSet, it comes with our best and latest masks with inline waterless humidification, so when you're traveling you don't have to mess around with water. You don't have to worry about finding distilled water and those things that patients have to do. And it's managed. It has a simple on\/off button, so it can be managed without anything but an on\/off for the patient. But it's also managed and reports out data to an app that is based on our very successful myAir app. And so the patient can look at their own data, can manage their own therapy, et cetera, in that app.","So it is a completely next-generation offer from a travel PAP point of view. And as Mick said, one of the most frequent questions I'm asked is, when are you guys coming out with a travel PAP? So we think there's big demand. It's hard to predict, but we're excited about it.","David A. Low - JPMorgan","Great. Thanks very much. And just my other question just on the masks. The 9% growth was a good outcome, given some of the feedback we had about them and the commentary from yourselves that the products were in backorder. Do you have any sense as to what those numbers could have been if you hadn't been on backorder? How big of a drag was the back order on the growth rate?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","It's really difficult to predict exactly what that 9% number could have been if we had had no backorder. I know it would have been above 9%. So it's 10%-plus. Hard to predict exactly what it was because we weren't able to ship those products. I do think it's a huge opportunity for us as we go into Q4 to get supply ahead of demand. You never want to be behind. But of all of the problems to have, it's probably one of the better ones.","But we don't even want to have that problem, so we're going to eliminate that here in Q4. And then as we go throughout 2018, we'll be completely supply unconstrained and be able to meet every piece of demand for the N20 and F20. And as I said earlier, we're really excited about the technology InfinitySeal and broad fit range and its capability to get to patients there.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","I think we are now at the 60-minute mark, so I'll probably hand back to Agnes. Oh, okay. I'll just close up. All right. Thanks. So, in closing, I want to thank the more than 5,000 strong ResMed team as they've been diligently driving execution of the N20 and F20 launches and the exciting launch of the ResMed AirMini, as well as our future pipeline of innovative products. Our team continues to demonstrate unwavering commitment to changing the lives of millions of patients. We remain focused on our long-term goal of improving 20 million lives by 2020.","I want to thank the global ResMed team.

For the call today, I will review top-level financial results. I will then cover some business highlights and discuss some key announcements this quarter. Then I will hand the call over to Brett Sandercock, who will walk you through our financial results in more detail.","We are very grateful to our global team for a very strong performance this quarter. We achieved double-digits global revenue growth led by sales of our software solutions, our mask systems and our sleep apnea devices. At the bottom line, we grew operating profit 12% and our diluted earnings per share was $0.66 on a non-GAAP basis. We are proud of this solid top and bottom line performance from our global ResMed team.","Brightree\u2019s growth continues to be strong at 15% year-on-year inclusive of tuck-in acquisitions. We are making great progress as we expand our connected care offerings for all of our customers creating efficiencies and improving patient outcomes.","Now let me cover some geographic business highlights. The U.S., Canada and Latin America teams achieved solid revenue growth at 11%. These results were fueled by strong growth in devices and masks as well continued double-digit software sales growth. Sleep apnea patient volume continues to grow steadily.","Growth in devices in these countries was 8% for the quarter. It has been over three years since we launched AirSense 10 and Air Solutions cloud-based software and we continue to grow our device market share as homecare providers and physicians find ongoing sustainable value from our connected care solutions. The masks and accessories category grew 13% in the U.S., Canada and Latin America countries this quarter. We've seen good demand across all mask categories.","The AirFit N20 and the AirFit F20 masks are performing well and we are able to fully supply the fast growing demand for these products. Our brand new AirTouch F20 is in its very early days and has high patients comfort ratings right out of the gate. Device sales in the combined European and Asian countries were up a very strong 9% this quarter on a constant currency basis.","ResMed France achieved very strong device growth catalyzed by the announcement of increased reimbursement for telemonitored sleep devices relative to non-cloud connected devices. We expect to continue our connected care value creation for our customers across Europe and Asia Pacific as we expand digital help and connected care globally.","Across Europe and Asia, our teams achieved strong mask growth of 15% this quarter. We expect ongoing growth based on continued adoption of our recent mask technology and positive customer feedback across the spectrum: patients, physicians and homecare providers.","I\u2019ll now take a few minutes to update you on our three horizons 2020 growth strategy and then I will hand the call over to Brett. In the first horizon of growth, which focuses on our sleep apnea business, we are making significant advances with the smallest, quietest and most comfortable products enhanced by digital health and connected care.","We now have over six million patients monitored with AirView software and over four million patients monitored with 100% cloud connected medical devices on their bedside tables. In addition, we have seen over 1,300 new patients\u2019 signup for the myAir patient engagement app every single day. It turns out consumers love seeing their own data.","We are expanding globally with our connected care solutions translating the value creation that we have brought to our customers in the U.S. over to France and across Europe and beyond. In September, we featured our recently launched travel CPAP solutions, the ResMed AirMini at the European Respiratory Society Conference in Milan.","There continues to be the demand and interest for a category of small travel-friendly second-use CPAP devices that patients are willing to buy with their own cash. We are focused on growing this category all around the world with particular success in existing cash pay markets such as Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Canada and the UK.","This quarter ResMed and Brightree launched another integration solution. Together, we provide a seamless solution for all homecare providers through automated resupply enrollment for patients managed by both Brightree Connect and AirView software. With this enhancement, AirView automatically alerts Brightree Connect once the patient has achieved compliance criteria.","So that the patients can be automatically enrolled into the Brightree Connect resupply program. This feature helps our homecare customers to ensure that every sleep apnea patient is getting the supplies that they need in order to have the best possible therapy experience while saving the customer labor costs through software automation. This enhancement is the latest in a growing list of time saving features for our customers that maximize both the patient benefits as well as homecare provider benefits.","Brightree also launched ConnectPRO at the Medtrade Industry Conference just earlier this week. ConnectPRO is a comprehensive solution that combines all technology services and data analytics that are necessary for our homecare customers to efficiently manage resupply workflows and to improve patients' resupply engagement.","Our connected care strategy is also having a positive impact on the clinical front with ongoing publication of studies. The American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine known more simply as The Blue Journal published a study run jointly by ResMed and Kaiser Permanente, which reported that remote monitoring improve the patient adherence to sleep apnea therapy.","The key takeaway from the study was that telemonitoring of sleep apnea patients with ResMed's algorithms resulted in an increase of therapy adherence of 22% to 37%. This is statistically significant and also clinically significant data. We look forward to more publications using ResMed's database of the identified aggregated data. We are transforming big data of more than 1 billion nights of sleep metrics into actionable information that can improve clinical outcomes.","Moving to the second horizon of the ResMed 2020 growth strategy. Our cloud connected non-invasive ventilators and light support ventilators continue to grow globally and we are building our connected care strategy for COPD. We relaunched our portable oxygen concentrator called Activox with improved quality and performance at our U.S., Canada and Latin America Sales Conference during the quarter.","We expect steady growth of Activox throughout the year and beyond. Watch this space for future enhancements of our connected COPD offering. We are driving awareness of key clinical studies that have shown improvements in COPD mortality and reductions in COPD hospitalizations such as our home oxygen therapy, home mechanical ventilation study called HOT-HMV.","Our market access teams are working to change the standard of care for COPD in key countries around the world to drive future growth in non-invasive ventilation, portable oxygen concentrator usage and life support ventilation businesses to serve COPD patients.","Our third horizon of growth encompasses a portfolio of opportunities including sleep health and wellness, chronic disease management models and out-of-hospital software businesses. This quarter Brightree announced the appointment of Robert Dean as General Manager of our home health and hospice business within Brightree. This continues to be a very exciting area for us with lots of long term growth potential.","We are expanding out-of-hospital software offerings as we continue to grow and acquire software-as-a-service businesses for home health, home nursing and other alternative care settings. We\u2019ve had a tremendous start to the fiscal year and we are well positioned to grow revenue throughout fiscal year 2018 and beyond.","We are encouraged by the success of our new product launches with the AirFit N20, the AirFit F20, the AirTouch F20 and the ResMed AirMini. We continue to work on a pipeline of new products and enhanced connected care solutions for sleep apnea, COPD and other critical chronic diseases.","We have positioned the company for long-term top and bottom line growth for 2020 as we continue to execute our strategy and action, drive operating excellence and pioneer market leading connected care solutions. We have improved our 12 million lives over the last 12 months and we continue to pursue the holy grail of health care improving patients\u2019 quality of life, slowing chronic disease progression and reducing overall health care system costs.","With that I will now turn the call over to Brett, our CFO, for his remarks and then we will go to Q&A. Over to you, Brett.","Brett Sandercock","Great, thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the first quarter 2018. As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the September quarter was $523.7 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 11%.","Taking a closer look at geographic distribution excluding revenue for Brightree, our sales in the Americas were $296.6 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter. Sales in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific totaled $189 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific increased by 11% over the prior year quarter.","Breaking out revenue between product segments. Americas device sales were $157.9 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $138.7 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. The revenue in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific, device sales were $128.3 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter or, in constant currency terms, an increase of 9%.","Masks and other sales were $60.7 million, an increase of 19% over the prior year quarter or, in constant currency terms, an increase of 15%. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 8%, while masks and other increased by 14% over the prior year quarter.","Brightree revenue for the first quarter was $38.1 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter. The Brightree results include two small acquisitions we made in our fourth quarter of FY 2017. On an organic basis, Brightree revenue for the quarter grew by 13%.","During the rest of my commentary today, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles. And in the prior year comparable, they exclude amortization of acquired intangibles, and the Astral battery field safety notification expenses. We have provided a full reconciliation of our non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our first quarter earnings press release.","Now, I\u2019ll turn to rest of the P&L. Our gross margin for the September quarter was 58.4%, lowering our prior year non-GAAP margin predominantly due to ASP declines. On a sequential basis, we saw an increase in gross margin reflecting favorable foreign currency movements and improved product mix from stronger masks sales.","Assuming current exchange rates and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margin for fiscal year 2018 to be broadly consistent with our Q1 FY 2018 gross margin. Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $143.9 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 10%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 27.5% compared to the 27.7% that we reported last year.","Looking forward, and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A growth rates to moderate over the course of fiscal year 2018. As a result, we continue to expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to progressively improve and to be approximately 26% of revenue by the end of the fiscal year.","R&D expenses for the quarter were $37.4 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter or, on a constant currency basis, an increase of 6%. This increase reflects incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7.1% compared to 7.4% in the prior year quarter. Looking forward, and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% for the balance of fiscal year 2018.","Moving further down the P&L. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $11.8 million for the quarter, consistent with the prior year quarter. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $11.9 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $124.3 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter, while non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $94.1 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year quarter.","Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.66, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.60. Additionally, foreign exchange movements positively impacted first quarter earnings by $0.01 per share, reflecting the favorable impacts from the stronger euro largely offset by the stronger Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.","On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.7%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 will be in the range of 22%. Cash flow from operations was $94 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and a modest increase in working capital balances. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $16 million. Depreciation and amortization for the September quarter totaled $29.6 million.","During the quarter we paid dividends of $49.7 million and repaid $60 million of our outstanding debt. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share. And as previously announced we expect to recommence our share buyback in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018.","As a minimum, the aim of the buyback will be to offset the dilution impact from employee equity grants. This is estimated to be in the range of 1 million to 1.5 million shares annually. At September 30, we have $1 billion in gross debt and $208 million in net debt. Our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels. At September 30, total assets were $3.5 billion, and net equity was $2 billion.","And with that, I will hand the call back to Agnes.","Agnes Lee","Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A and we ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow up question. If you have additional questions after that, please get back into the queue. Mariama, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Joanne Wuensch, BMO Capital Markets is online with a question.","Joanne Wuensch","Hi. Good afternoon. Can you hear me okay?","Mick Farrell","Got you loud and clear, Joanne.","Joanne Wuensch","Excellent, very nice quarter. I have two questions. The first one has to do with adoption of the ResMed AirMini. You are talking about adoption in certain geographies that are more comfortable paying out-of-pocket and I noticed the United States wasn't on the list. Can you discuss how \u2013 which regions are more willing to get into [indiscernible] with wonderful product and why not United States?","Mick Farrell","Sure, Joanne. I\u2019ll start and have a go then I might hand to Jim Hollingshead, the Present of our Sleep Business to talk about how we're expanding our AirMini business. Firstly, I'm a personal user of the ResMed AirMini and have been for many months. And I traveled all around the world with it and just in love with it as my new travel companion; literally anywhere I go around the planet it follows me. So that I get my great sleep apnea kit without having to get distilled water at Tokyo at 2\u2019o clock in the morning when I land from the direct flight from San Diego.","The adoption of AirMini in countries like Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Singapore and the U.K. where we have established cash pay channels has been very strong in fact far above our early expectations. Patients are really loving paying out-of-pocket for something that has provided such great care. But I\u2019d say in our business to business to consumer markets like the U.S. where we sell to our homecare providers and then they sell cash to patients.","It's been a slower ramp up as those customers start to ramp up their cash businesses with all the changes of competitive bidding in the U.S. landscape change, our homecare providers in the U.S. are loving to build their cash businesses and it's something they've been working on strategically for a number of years. And we think the ResMed AirMini along with portable oxygen concentrators is a great opportunity for them and we\u2019re supporting them in both of that. But with that introduction to it, Jim anything further to add for the U.S. or beyond?","Jim Hollingshead","Yeah, thanks, Mick. I would just add that sales of the AirMini in the U.S. are actually going very well. I think that the comparison intended to Mick\u2019s comments is about on a sort of per patient basis you know where the relative volume of AirMini against the AirSense 10 platform. So the U.S. market, AirMini is performing as expected. We think it's launching well \u2013 really well. It will ramp. We\u2019re in a B2B2C model in the U.S. because we're selling it through our channel partners as Mick just spelled out and we see those volumes growing very nicely. It's in the markets where patients are having to pay cash for an AirSense 10 or they choose an AirMini where we're seeing on a proportional basis AirMini is being purchased more frequently.","Joanne Wuensch","And as my follow up question, you spoke about patient volumes for sleep apnea patients being somewhat strong, which is quite the opposite of what we're seeing in other pockets of med tech utilization. Can you give us an idea of what you're seeing in patient volumes and how you\u2019re measuring that? Thank you.","Mick Farrell","Thanks for your follow up, Joanne. We don\u2019t go into the details of patient volume growth within geographies. What I can say and the difference maybe between us and other parts of med tech is \u2013 this is a very personal experience of suffocation before therapy and then the experience of getting that gift the breath and the life change that can happen with sleep apnea. And taking the U.S. geography with somewhere between 40 million to 60 million Americans suffocating every night and maybe we have six or seven million so far diagnosed and on treatment.","We still have 85, 80 plus \u2013 85% plus of the opportunity in front of us. So I think that a large pool of undiagnosed patients provides a regular flow into the sleep labs and into the homecare providers that allows for that sort of steady growth of patients into the channel. We've got a long way to go on that journey. And if you go to other geographies around the world, Western Europe, 85%, 90% of the opportunities still in front in terms of sufferers and getting them through the system.","And in our Asia growth markets, the opportunity is above 95%, 98%, 99% in some of the geographies. So we think we\u2019re in mile one of a marathon here and we're really excited about that, patient volume growth continuing to grow steadily not just in this quarter, but throughout the fiscal year that we expect ahead and beyond.","Operator","Thank you. David Stanton from CLSA is online with a question.","David Stanton","Thanks very much and thank you for taking my question. I had a question about replenishment of mask. And I know that you\u2019ve rolled out a new replenishment systems through Brightree. Can you give us some kind of idea about what kind of replenishment growth rates particularly in the U.S. that would be greatly appreciated? Thank you. ","Mick Farrell","Yeah, thanks, Dave. That's a good question. Clearly through ResMed Resupply which is part of the AirView software solutions package and part of Brightree Connect as we talked about linking on the backend with AirView. We are really working very closely with our homecare providers to make sure that every patient, who wants the mask and is qualified for a mask has the opportunity to get one. As I\u2019m saying earlier I am a personal user of this therapy and you need to change this mask. It's a piece of plastic that touches your face every day and stays on it hopefully for seven hours of sleep every night and even with regular washing and regular drawing the mask needs replacement.","And we think there's a lot of opportunity. We know there's a lot of opportunity to work with patients and empower them with the information that they have to be able to access the supplies that they need. So without going specifically into numbers, we can tell you that qualitatively the pool of installed base of customers, patients who are using masks and want to resupply them is increasing quite strongly. And it's a large part of our mask and accessories category.","David Stanton","Thank you. And then I guess my follow-up would be, would it be fair to say that replenishment masks are growing as strong or less strong than new masks?","Mick Farrell","So, David, we probably don't want to go into the specifics of each category of masks, the installed base and new patient flow and how quickly they\u2019re growing. But if you think about it from sort of a mathematics point of view as the installed base grows larger and larger and we work on replenishment protocols with patients and expand them, there's some linear opportunities with new patient setup and some exponential opportunities with replenishment as you engage the patients throughout the world in all sorts of different models.","David Stanton","Okay, understood. Thank you.","Operator","Steve Wheen from JPMorgan is online with a question. I apologize Steve Wheen is from Evans and Partners.","Steve Wheen","Yes, hello. Can you hear me?","Mick Farrell","Got you loud and clear, Steve. And I am glad we\u2019ve got your company right too.","Steve Wheen","No, no, that other one. Anyway I just had a question just on the revenue for mask. Obviously, a very nice step-up in mask growth and it follows the fourth quarter where there was a bit of hiatus just because of capacity. Is this an unusual growth rate that we\u2019re seeing in this quarter in terms of catch up and therefore it might moderate going forward? Or how do you see the appetite for these new masks, now that there is no restrictions oversupply.","Mick Farrell","Yeah, Steve, as we have talked about 90 days ago, we did 90 days ago still have some supply constraints that we were just leaving at the end of Q4 throughout Q1 we were supply unconstrained. And we were able to meet and beat the very fast demand as you saw for masks throughout the world. And if you look at the masks and accessories category, it grew at 13% on a constant currency basis in the U.S., Canada and Latin America and it grew at 15% on a constant currency basis in Europe and Asian countries.","Look, we think that that we can continue to grow masks all the way throughout the fiscal year. There were all sorts of different changes that happen in terms of comparables from quarter X and quarter Y as you go through out of fiscal year. But as you think about the next twelve months and twenty four months, we think the runway of the F20, the AirFit F20, the AirFit N20, so the full phase and the nasal components are very strong.","And we're just out of the gate with the AirTouch F20, which is our brand new technology which incorporates both the LSR, or liquid silicon rubber, but also foam technology. And it's early days, but patients are really loving that opportunity. And so we're working with our channel partners on the business side of it. But in terms of patient acceptance, we\u2019re seeing some really good patient acceptance.","So having said all that, I think we've got a really good runway ahead for growth throughout fiscal 2018 for our masks. I don't think it's a catch up. I think it's the start of a steady growth pattern that we should see throughout fiscal 2018, 2019 and beyond.","Steve Wheen","Great. And then just on life follow up question. On the SG&A side, I wonder if Brett you might be able to give us some color as to the major drivers of that tailing off as a percentage of revenue by the end of the year. What's driving that? Is it legal costs related? Yes, if you could just give us some color as to what the major \u2013 what\u2019s underpinning that?","Brett Sandercock","Okay, sure, Steve. You will have a head spin if you look at the last several quarters. We have \u2013 obviously, we\u2019ve been \u2013 if you like, we are being elevated in terms of things such as litigation costs. But also we launched a lot of new products in terms of marketing promotion and so on, that\u2019s probably running a little more elevated as well. And we probably \u2013 you still see some of that manifest in Q1, but as we work through the quarters, and then obviously we\u2019ll work with a team on this as well. We expect those growth rates to moderate \u2013 sort of more normalized I guess in what we\u2019ve seen over the last 12 months and bringing us confidence that we can trend that down.","Steve Wheen","So there would be specifically a reduction in legal costs within that number.","Brett Sandercock","I not let that, I mean, you can\u2019t \u2013 that\u2019s a difficult one to predict. I wouldn\u2019t say that I\u2019d say you kind of \u2013 it builds more, let\u2019s say builds more into the run rate so to speak.","Steve Wheen","Yeah, sure. Thank you.","Operator","David Low from JPMorgan is online with a question.","David Low","Thanks very much. Could I just start with Brett your comment with when you talk on gross margins about some ASP pressure, let\u2019s see if you could talk a little bit anything in particular that showing up in this quarter that [indiscernible] different from what we\u2019ve seen in the past.","Brett Sandercock","I mean not particularly, David, we \u2013 you see every year in and year out. You see ASP the content impacting your gross margin. So I guess it\u2019s just to call out of the main impact on gross margin year-on-year. If I look at it sequentially, it looked actually pretty good and we\u2019re quite pleased with that uptick there on the margin. So, no, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s adjusting unusually met and it\u2019s kind of more typical with what we experienced in terms of SSP declines.","David Low","Okay, great, thanks. And if I could just touch on the oxygen concentrator, the Activox, could you talk a little bit about where you think that product is positioned versus the competition? It\u2019s been a fast growing space. You see something that now becomes a material contributor quite quickly or is that something that\u2019s slightly to grow gradually over time?","Mick Farrell","Look, yeah, David, as I said in the prepared remarks, we just relaunched with the quality and new capability in systems around our Activox system as we\u2019ve now incorporated that acquisition of Inova into our business and relaunched it really with our sales team this quarter. I will hand to Rob Douglas, our COO, to maybe provide some further detail on our POC business.","Rob Douglas","Sure, David. We described some of the quality improvements that\u2019s really under the hood quality improvement. So, we\u2019re very happy with those quality improvements and how they\u2019re going and our customers let\u2019s say use the product will start to experience those improvements. The product positioned us very portable. It's got the longest battery life. It\u2019s very light weight. It\u2019s a good performer. And we see steady take up of it. And we\u2019re patient with this product and we're going to make sure it has really the ResMed quality, and provides really good treatment to patients and we\u2019ll build on that.","David Low","Thanks.","Operator","Margaret Kaczor from William Blair is on the line with a question.","Margaret Kaczor","Good morning Brett. Good afternoon everyone else. First question for me is on the generator growth this quarter, which remained quite strong in the Americas. So maybe you guys can give us a little bit more detail around what's driving the strength. You've been keeping in this high single-digit range. Is it existing accounts increasing their mix of the resonate platform, given all of the new software offerings, just underlying patient volume? Any additional color would be great. Thanks.","Brett Sandercock","Thanks for the question Margaret. And yes, we did see strong growth in Q1. If you take the U.S., Canada Latin America countries combined we saw 8% constant currency growth in Q1, and across the Europe and Asia countries, we saw 9% constant currency growth. Look, we think the total market is growing in that mid-to-high single digits across the sleep market with devices sort of more towards the mid-single digits and masks toward the high-single digits. Implying in Q1 that we did take share within the device and mask categories, and we believe that to be true. Of course, we don't go into detail around that. But some of the reasons behind that are certainly all boats are floating on the strong patient growth that we talked about earlier, but we are taking share.","And I think the share is as you've seen now, it's 36 months since we launched AirSense 10 and Air Solutions platform. And it's really a solution when you combine it together. We've published data now in the peer-reviewed press that shows that we can reduce labor costs for our home care provider customers by up to 59%. So when you have a system that can lower labor cost for your customers by 59%, it can really help them to start to say not only will I try this device and try this software, but I'll double down on it, and I\u2019ll continue to invest in it. And we're seeing a lot of customers garner a lot of profit growth for themselves that they didn't take that cash and reinvest in the business for better patient care.","So we think this is really a win for ResMed. Obviously, as you see in these numbers. It's a win for our home care customers that use ResMed, and it's a win for the patients because they get better care. They engage daily sometimes with their myAir app and check out their myAir score and their adherence rates move from 50%, 60% historically in this industry up to 87% in one of our published studies and beyond that in some of our unpublished work.","So we think it is sustainable, strong value proposition with our customers that's driving it, Margaret.","Margaret Kaczor","Great. And then on the breakthrough side as a follow-up. That one is chugging along as well, you\u2019ve got this low to mid-teens, and I know some of that is the acquisitions, but how should we think about acquisitions being off for the rest of the Brightree installed base? Can those be material to your growth? And then just as you think about that underlying growth, is it new accounts? Or again those existing accounts just choosing and selecting more new offerings that you have? Thanks.","Mick Farrell","Yes. So another good question, Margaret. Yes, as you saw in the quarter, our Brightree growth was 13% constant currency if you didn't include any of the tuck-in acquisitions, and it's 15% constant currency, including the modest tuck-in acquisitions that we did throughout the year AllCall and so on into Brightree.","Look, yes, solid, low to mid-teen growth in our software-as-a-service business. We think that some of that is new accounts. Our sales team at Brightree is excellent. [Audio Gap] and I and a bunch of the team, Raj went out there to Atlanta to spend time with the team and in a leadership program and looking at those top not just sales but development leaders and how they're teaming up and really adapting the ResMed culture but keeping a strong Brightree software-as-a-service culture and driving a really strong commercial performance.","And so we think that's sustainable, taking into account share but also growing users within existing accounts. We find that the HME providers who partnered with Brightree grow, and as they grow, they get more users. And software-as-a-service system users is paid on a per basis. So you can grow by getting new accounts. You can also grow by helping new customers grow.","So we're doing both.","Margaret Kaczor","Great thanks.","Operator","Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley is online with a question. ","Sean Laaman","Good morning. And thank you for taking my question. Just back on Activox, Mick. I'm just wondering if you can give us a bit more granularity on sort of specifically the relaunch and what you might have changed from what you're doing before to what you're doing with the relaunch, that would be really good.","Mick Farrell","Yes I\u2019ll hand it over to Rob.","Rob Douglas","Yes, Sean. As I said before, we \u2013 ResMed's position in the markets are very high-tech, high-quality value and innovation. As we got our early experience with the Activox, we saw a number of improvements that we wanted to make, and we made those improvements. I described them earlier as improvements under the hood. So they're really \u2013 they're not features, but they're improving the delivery of the existing features. And as I say we progressively incremented them in a sequential basis, and then we really looking to the absolute measure, which is our customers' response to those to see how we go \u2013 to see to really put the metrics around the quality improvements and what extra value that adds.","And I can't really get granular on the exact next steps of improvements that we're coming up simply because we don't forecast our R&D programs for competitive reasons, but I would say we've got a very strong team working on it. We've got some great ideas. We still got the feature that we have talked about, about adding some of our connected care capability into the system, which we believe will further improve the quality of delivery of oxygen treatment of patients but also improve the ability of our HME customers to manage those patients and those fleets of devices that they need to. And that's all work in progress.","Sean Laaman","Thanks Rob, thanks Mick. And may be just a quick follow-up for Bret. Are you able to give us a sense of what currency you might be thinking going forward for the euro and the Aussie?","Brett Sandercock","[Indiscernible] this morning they changed for me already, but when I was looking at that we're sort of \u2013 we were being forecasting around that sort of $0.78 to $0.79 of the U.S. and around $1.18 on the euro, euro U.S. they're moving around quite a bit of volatility. So yes, on that one, Sean, but that's sort of what we're using as being current rates at the time we looked at it a few days ago.","Sean Laaman","Great. That\u2019s all I had. Thank you everybody.","Operator","Saul Hadassin from Credit Suisse is online with a question.","Saul Hadassin","Thanks. Good morning guys. Brett, can I start with a quick question on gross margin just to clarify or confirm your comments regarding the outlook for gross margin of the remainder of fiscal 2018. Did you say it should be consistent with 1Q 2018 as a result? ","Brett Sandercock","Yes, I said broadly consistent.","Saul Hadassin","And I just wonder if you can give us some of the contributing points to that considering the mix seems to be improving on the mask side and just cognitive of what currency is doing. But is there anything else presumably, you've got some efficiencies coming through manufacturing so what's maybe offsetting the incremental improvement in gross margin over the fiscal year?","Brett Sandercock","Sure. We saw \u2013 well, and I'll just we did see some incremental improvement from Q4 and Q1. And we did see certainly you can see some improvement in product mix, and that's been a turnaround for us. And the expectation is that will be more a tailwind for us as opposed to a headwind over the last few years that\u2019s positive on that. And there's number of factors playing out on ASP decline, FX, manufacturing procurement efficiencies, and so on, which we do expect to get over the course of the year. But the product mix and how we're looking, I guess, the portfolio a little more diversified now as well.","So that plays into looking at predict on gross margin as well. So I think all in the mix. I guess the other thing I would say is that stronger Aussie on a sequential basis kind of hurt us going into Q2 and essentially a factor that in as well. So that would be headwind for us going sequentially selects inclusive of that. So some of the other underlying trends I think are there in a positive but there could be few going against us, particularly on the FX next quarter. But broadly consistent, I guess, what we're saying is we're comfortable with that margin around where it's at, and we're seeing good growth across both devices and mask, which I think is really showing the strength of the business and a good diversified portfolio.","So I think it's going to \u2013 with that sales growth and good gross profit dollars, and I think that's in good shape for us going forward.","Saul Hadassin","Thanks Brett. That\u2019s all I had.","Operator","Andrew Goodsall from UBS is online with a question.","Andrew Goodsall","Thanks for taking my questions. Just in the U.S. instant card consolidation with DMEs over the last few years. Just try and give us a sense of what you seem pressure on prices, I guess, the business under the hands of larger buyers.","Mick Farrell","Thanks for the question Andrew. Clearly, over the last three, to five years, there has been some consolidation in our U.S. home care provider base, still around 5000-plus home medical equipment providers in the U.S. So quite a large and diverse group of local mom-and-pop, regionals as well as national players, and we partner with people across that spectrum. As I look at the market, I think we see a relative sampling of changes in reimbursement, some of those big step changes that happen in the early phases of the U.S. government CMS program to get in line with our private payers and now we have a sort of steady program going forward.","And I think a pretty broad view at CMS that actually investing in sleep apnea care reduces long-term costs for the government, and we're certainly as I said on the AdvaMed Board of Directors, we definitely spend time in Washington letting Washington know that medical devices as an industry is able to lower long-term costs by keeping patients, particularly in sleep apnea and in COPD, out of hospital and under better care.","So we're seeing a pretty steady reimbursement environment. It does have reductions, but they're reasonably steady. So I think we're able to weather that and work with our home care providers to make sure that they use Brightree and they use AirView, and they can lower their labor cost by 50%, 60%, and that's the way to free up cash to reinvest in marketing to primary care doctors and going after the 40 million, 50 million, 60 million people who are suffocating. And as yet haven't had a chance to get diagnosed, get treated and get a better quality of life.","Andrew Goodsall","And Rob may be just to you as my follow-up question. I guess just in terms of your proposition, which is, I guess, potentially higher price mask relative to some of the competition, but I guess a bit of a longer-term recurring revenue line. I\u2019m just trying to understand how that's going with the better sales propositions going with the DMEs in terms of them taking through the benefits of that program versus perhaps just going for margin or sorry, low pricing to increase margin initially.","Mick Farrell","Yes thanks Andrew. I\u2019ll handle that follow-up to Jim Hollingshead, our President of Global Sleep business.","Jim Hollingshead","Andrew I think on your first question we still see consolidation in the market, but it's nothing of out trend right. I mean, there's been no unusual change in consolidation in the U.S. market as Mick said remains very fragments where you get right down to it, right? 5,500 roughly providers of sleep. What we're seeing is that HME customers more and more are realizing how important it is to them and their business to resupply patients. And so we have seen the scheme up a little bit earlier the call. We have an on ongoing increase in adoption of resupply platforms. And our offerings, especially through Brightree, have made that a lot easier for our customers. And so as they adopt those more automated approaches to resupply, they're able to grow that side of their business.","Andrew Goodsall","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Matt Taylor from Barclays is on line with a question.","Matt Taylor","Hi thanks for taking the question. Can you hear that?","Brett Sandercock","Got you loud and clear Matt.","Matt Taylor","Great. So Brett, I did have one follow-up on the gross margin. You had talked in the past about mix being the biggest factor. So I was still a little bit surprised that we didn't see more of a lift this quarter. Can you just talk about the rest of the year, what you're expecting from effect on gross margin? And is it mainly the Aussie dollar that's holding it back from being better with this better mix?","Brett Sandercock","Sure, Matt. I mean, I guess, you should have asked that back a little while, I guess you've got to put a little bit of context a few years ago when we're seeing what you are experiencing like huge growth rates in devices. So we're talking 30%, 40%, almost 50%. So the differential between the device growth and mask growth was very substantial back then. So that did have a bit of impact on product mix. So we're still seeing that impact, but obviously, can be more modest when differential is perhaps more like 5%.","So I mean, part of it is, if you like, the resilience and the strength of the device that we're seeing, which is a very good thing. So therefore, the thing. So therefore, the product mix, I guess, is more modest than what you might have seen two years ago, which makes sense. And the other thing I'd add to that is if you looked at you go back to FY\u201914, masks were probably something like, matching other categories something like 46% of our revenue. You fast-forward to today is about 38%.","So there has kind of been that kind of overall change in our mix as well. So that plays into it as well. But \u2013 so it's still there the trends there the improved product mix is there, but it's on a more modest scale than what you might have seen when devices were growing really strongly back in FY\u201915.","Matt Taylor","Thanks. And your continued device growth a couple of years after the AirSense launch has been impressive. And I guess, I was wondering if you thought you continue to grow at kind of above-market rates with just the base AirSense. And if you could comment on how material you think of oxygen concentrators and the Mini can be.","Brett Sandercock","Yes that\u2019s a great question Matt. I\u2019ll turn try with that. Look, if you think about it, the portfolio of devices we have is a lot broader now. Brett's talking about the change of connected care and our sort of leadership in connected care, not only within our vertical, sleep apnea, COPD, but across the med tech sector has launched us to the No. 1 position in devices in flow generators, and that's a large ballast in the boat to Brett's point much higher percentage of our portfolio. So GM percentage lines move less strongly although gross profit dollars and net operating profit as you saw this quarter growing at 12% year-on-year in OP is really solid growth and that's free cash flow. And we invest free cash flow cash back into our business. We don't invest percentages back into our business, and so we manage on the growth of that.","But our continued device growth will expand, and I think you can add on sort of strong, steady maintenance and growth of share. But more importantly growth of patients into the funnel to keep device growth strong and steady. And as you said, there's upside as you add on to ResMed AirMini, which is brand-new category. It's cash pay. It's a second use, it's travel path, and it's sold direct in some markets. It's sold through our great home care provider customers in the U.S. and many European countries, and we think that's good addition. As you said, there's portable oxygen concentrators, and there's also our growing COPD play in noninvasive ventilation and life-support ventilation, and we have now cloud connected both of those, the NIV.","So our AirCurve 10 range and our Astral devices both now have cloud connectivity. We're in the early days of driving our connected COPD strategy, but that's a very high-cost disease state. It\u2019s The number three killer in the world, COPD. And it's the number two cause for rehospitalization. So we think as we look forward to 2020 and beyond, there's a lot of opportunity to have steady and growing device growth as we look forward to the longer term","Matt Taylor","Thanks.","Operator","Victor Windeyer from Citi is on line with a question.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes hi, it\u2019s [indiscernible]. I just wanted to ask a bit more about the COPD and also as it relates to the device growth overall. So just as we look forward, do you think RSA itself can continue to grow mid-single digits? And then the COPD part of them, if you like, is on top of device growth given we're relatively early in the journey there? Or how does that sort of play out long term? And then all also perhaps you could talk to where do you think we are in terms of capturing the value out of the noninvasive vent side, you talked about Europe side.","Mick Farrell","Yes. Thanks, Victor [ph]. The answer is yes. I mean, I think the sleep apnea market as we said earlier is growing in mid-to-high single digits with the devices more in that mid-single-digit range. I think we can continue to hold and grow share in the device side that will allow us to grow the sleep apnea business and that mid-single digits in the device category. And in addition to the ResMed AirMini, which is on top of that as a cash pay and the POCs, which is on top of that, there are the noninvasive ventilator devices. Where we're at on that is the early stages.","There are 400 million, 500 million patients worldwide who suffer from chronic obstructive preliminary disease or lung disease. Many of them remain undiagnosed or undertreated. Many of them need to get first initial drug therapy, and they need oxygen therapy and then they need non-invasive ventilation therapy. And then as their disease progresses towards more chronic care, they need life-support ventilation therapy. And so ResMed plans to be walking with those COPD patients along that channel.","So this is a longer-term development. It's sort of part of our 2020 and even our 2020 strategies. We're starting to put that together and developing our connected COPD strategy, and we'll be doing that with partners across med tech and pharma and beyond. And so watch this space for longer-term growth there, but we're really excited about the growth in our core business of sleep apnea and our second Horizon of growth in COPD and our third Horizon of growth in out-of-hospital software. And if you put them all together, I think you've got a very strong and dynamic portfolio.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. And then just a follow-up on the cash pay at kind of CPAP side that it seems that\u2019s going better in the market ofAustralia in stage? Is that cannibalizing mainly in cash pay market with us cannibalizing sales? Or how much is there [indiscernible]?","Mick Farrell","Yes I\u2019ll hand that to Rob.","Rob Douglas","So our view of the market whole new segment, and so it's contributing to growth. And when a person buys an AirMini to travel in addition to their home sleep app, that's really good for them and to sell that we otherwise wouldn\u2019t have had. So we see a very strongly contributing to growth. As Jim said earlier in some of the cash pay markets, there are some people will say actually I will not use that, it\u2019s my premium one. We\u2019re okay with that either way. But really on as a whole in most of the markets AirMini is really a strong contributor.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Anthony Petrone from Jefferies is online with a question.","Anthony Petrone","Good afternoon good morning thank you for taking the question. Maybe make a little bit on rising tide carrying all boats here Philips put up a pretty good print as well high single digit growth. So many a little bit more on is it a reimbursement thing that that benefiting everyone in the marketplace? Is it another dynamic that whether it's in a DME channel or again you also mentioned reimbursement coverage in France. Just trying to get maybe why this quarter's a little bit different from an underlying funnel\/volume perspective.","Mick Farrell","Thanks for the question, Anthony. Yes, look, I think there is some rising tide there, and that's a global mid-single digits to high-single digits market growth. And so other players are going in that mid- to high single digit range as well. As I said earlier, I do think we're taking share with connected care. You mentioned France. There is four levels of reimbursement for sleep apnea therapy that starts from January 1 in France. And the highest is telemonitored patients with adherence over 4 hours and telemonitored patients with two to four hours and then below that non-telemonitored patients, and so on. And ResMed's been leading in connected care not just in the U.S. but globally, and we've been preparing for this type of a change, and we're really excited that the government of France has recognized that they get a return on investment by telemonitoring patients, increasing adherence and taking those patients out of hospital.","So we think this market is great and growing and good for all players, but we think it's particularly good for people who are looking at ways to take cost out of that channel and partner with their customers, which include the home care providers but also the patients like giving them their own data every day patients use their devices more. I mean, adherence rates of 87% is unheard of in our industry, and we're publishing that and getting it in the peer-reviewed press in the Blue Journal, Jama, Lancet and you're going to see more from us on that. We have one billion nights of sleep data in the identified aggregated data, and we're going to be putting clinical studies out there to show this therapy, sleep apnea therapy is very beneficial, and we'll be doing the same in COPD as we move forward.","Anthony Petrone","Great and then just a follow-up would be just a bit on working capital once again, just on year-over-year basis. AARs ticked up quite a bit as inventory. I'm just wondering is there reason to hold more inventory? Is there an elongated sales cycle in the same on the credit sales? And is there an elongated cycle there as well? Thanks.","Mick Farrell","So I\u2019ll handle the question to Brett.","Brett Sandercock","Thanks Mick. Thanks Anthony Petrone. On the data side, [indiscernible] I think is still within kind of our range that we would expect and fairly typically historically, and it's probably still may be allow us maybe 12 months ago but still comfortable with where we are on that. On the inventory front, you're right. We're up a little on the inventory, but it's been pretty well documented. We're a little bit supply constrained on masks and so on. So some of that is kind of a rebuild into getting that right. So you see that's kind of manifested in the inventory a little bit as well. That's all the way through the supply chain.","So we're now in much better shape, but I guess that's reflected in some inventory build. And then going forward, I'd expect not necessarily come down, but I'd expect sort of the growth with moderate as we kind of balance a bit better now.","Anthony Petrone","Thanks.","Operator","We are now at the one hour mark. So I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.","Mick Farrell","Thanks, Mariama. In closing, I want to thank the more than 6,000-strong ResMed team for their execution on our new product launches. This quarter, that hard work has translated into market share gains, revenue growth and double-digit 12% net operating profit growth. Our team remains focused on our future pipeline of products and software solutions that change patients' lives and benefit all of our customers, including patients, physicians, payers and providers.

We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference.

Dr. Farrell, please go ahead sir.","Peter Farrell","Thanks Stacy, and thanks everyone for joining us. I\u2019ll begin as usual with a short summary and then pass the call over to Brett Sandercock, ResMed\u2019s CFO and then we\u2019ll go into a Q&A.","So first, the financials. We finished with a very solid quarter. Global revenues in the second quarter of 2012 grew 9% to $333 million, which was also up 9% on a constant currency basis. Revenues in the Americas grew by an encouraging 12% to $182.5 million and ROW revenue increased by 5% at the headline and also in constant currency terms to $150.2 million.","GAAP EPS increased 14% to $0.42 for the quarter and I believe consensus was $0.38 which we comfortably beat and if we exclude the amortization of acquired intangibles, EPS was a record $0.44which we would suggest represents effective management and operational excellence and efficiency.","With the respect to product performance, masks continued to perform well across the globe and we continue to take market share. The three masks, new masks in the FX trilogy that is the Quattro FX, the Mirage FX and the Swift FX as well as the four versions of these masks continue to do extremely well and with the success of the Mirage, we are gaining additional share in nasal masks category which recently had been a week spot for us.","And we just launched the Swift FX [Bella] mask giving female patients the choice of how they wear the masks since it offers hair management solutions in brief and we expect this to also improve patient compliance and in brief the mask has a loop which wraps around the ears without any straps on the forehead or head itself.","And as we recently been highlighting, there is a further reason we continue to see strong growth in the mask category other than the introduction of the new products is that there is excellent business in the resupply or replenishment of masks to the existing patient base. And in this context we are working with our DME and HME customers to help them leverage this business opportunity.","Global growth in flow generators this quarter was primarily driven by ventilation and bilevel devices including significant contribution from our Adaptive Servo-Ventilation line, the VPAP Adapt and the S9 AutoSet CS, but in addition also the Stellar products. And we can provide more granularity on that if people wish. In the Americas, bilevels are regaining share as they prove to be a strong value proposition for HMEs and physicians who we believe are scripting them.","Growth in the basic flow generator market is still somewhat problematic. It continues to be a challenging environment and actually proved to be a bit more so this quarter in Europe due to difficult macroeconomics or the macroeconomic environment there which people don\u2019t need very much explanation on.","The European climate is a little bit cautious and perhaps nervous and the market has slowed somewhat, looking more like growth levels in the US, that is around the 6% to 8% mark. But because we don\u2019t have any material business in those countries or in the countries under severe distress, we\u2019re somewhat isolated from the potential basket cases if you like, the so called PIIGS.","Ventilation sales of the Stellar 100 and the 150 continue to grow progressively in Europe and parts of Asia. The 150 Stellar was launched in Europe at the end of the calendar year and both products have received regulatory approval in Japan and will launched there soon.","These vents will rollout progressively over the next few quarters. Of note, the Stellar 150 includes iVAPS which is an automated bilevel mode. The success of the Stellar is another positive indication of our continued progress in product development and there will be more offerings in this space over time. Sales of Stellar 100 in the US are ramping to expectations with the CareFusion sales team. They\u2019re also now selling our masks along with the ventilators.","The new Greundler humidification product, HumiCare D900 started controlled product launch in Germany and we\u2019re doing further CPLs a little later on in France and Sweden. We are also working on FDA approval and we have to launch the 900 in the US in early 2013 or if not before pending FDA approval.","On the HST or the Home sleep testing front in the Americas, commercial payers continue to see toward HST with the requirement of prior authorization for attended PSG sleep test while encouraging the use of HST. At this point Aetna, United and Humana have pre-authorization initiatives from PSG to see patients to HST. In 2011 we estimate approximately 15% of all the test or all the sleep test where HST and we expect to see continuing adoption of HST during 2012.","It\u2019s difficult to look into the crystal ball and know exactly what that growth will be. I think it is going to double others within ResMed a more conservative, but we will see what it turns out to be. To some extent, this takes the pressure of low level CPAPs because as people would understand with HST, there is no setting of pressure in the sleep lab which means that physician DMEs, HMEs have to point towards APAP or our autosetting devices.","So that\u2019s all good from our point of view. On the clinical front, the flow of data substantiating the connection between sleep disorder breathing and chronic diseases continues to materialize a study conducted recently in Spain with over a thousand women, just published in the annals of Internal Medicine demonstrated the severe obstructive sleep apnea was associated with a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular death in women and that adequate sleep as treatment has been shown to reduce that risk. Also in a recent study published in the British Journal of Psychiatry researchers have suggested that schizophrenic patients have an improved quality of life if their sleep disorders are treated.","And finally in the area of occupational health and safety, advisors to the FMCSA the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration at a meeting last December recommended that the agency toughen up its approach to evaluation and treatment for sleep disorder breathing. The Motor Carrier Safety Advisory Committee and the Medical Review Board have formed a joint subcommittee charged with producing recommendations for an eventual rule that will set standards for sleep apnea screening, evaluation and treatment. They plan to present this strategy next April.","Now let me turn the call over to Brett. Brett?","Brett Sandercock","Thanks Peter. I will just run through the Q2 results. Revenue for the December quarter was $332.7 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms revenue also increased 9%. Income from operations for the quarter was $67.3 million, a decrease of 4% over the prior year quarter reflecting the impact of unfavorable currency movements.","Net income for the quarter was $62.9 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.42, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter. Gross margin for the December quarter was 59.7% up sequentially from Q1 FY12. On a sequential basis our gross margin benefited from favorable product mix, improvement in manufacturing and logistics costs. Sequentially currency movements had a minimal impact on our gross margin this quarter.","Looking-forward for the balance of FY12, we expect to have gross margins to be in the range of 58% to 60%, assuming current exchange rates. We continue to execute on initiatives targeted at reducing product cost through supply chain efficiencies, product design, and manufacturing improvements.","SG&A expenses for the quarter were $100.6 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 9%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue was 30.2% compared to the year ago figure of 29.9%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 30% for fiscal year 2012.","R&D expenses for the quarter were $27.2 million, an increase of 24% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, R&D expenses increased by 21%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 8.3% compared to the year ago figure of 7.3%. Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 8% for fiscal year 2012, reflecting the strong Australian dollar and continued investment in our product pipeline.","As a result of previously announced acquisitions, amortization of acquired intangibles increased to $3.7 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $7.4 million.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.2% compared to the prior year quarter effective tax rate of 25.9%. The lower tax rate reflects the benefit of lower effective tax rates in our Singapore and Australian operations. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2012 will also be in the vicinity of 24%.","Turning now to revenue in more detail, overall sales in the Americas were $182.5 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter. Sales outside the Americas totaled $150.2 million, an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas also increased by 5% over the prior year quarter.","Breaking out revenue between product segments, in the Americas, flow generator sales were $80.5 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $102 million, an increase of 19% over the prior year quarter, underpinned by strong contributions across our portfolio of masks and continued growth in accessories.","For revenue outside the Americas, flow generator sales were $100.1 million, an increase of 2% over the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms, also an increase of 2%. Masks and other sales were $50.1 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 11%. Globally, in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 3% while masks and others increased by 16%.","Cash flow from operations was a record $110.6 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $12.3 million. Depreciation and amortization for the December quarter totaled $22.9 million.","Our share buyback continues to play a major role in our capital management program. During the quarter we repurchased 4.1 million shares for the consideration of $110.5 million. For the first half of fiscal 2012, we have repurchased 8.5 million shares for consideration of $235.2 million. The 8.5 million shares purchased year-to-date represents approximately 5.7% of our diluted shares outstanding. At the end of December, we had approximately 14 million shares remaining under our authorized buyback program.","On January 25, we increased our syndicated bank credit facility from 300 million to 400 million, providing the group with additional funding flexibility. Our balance sheet remains strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were 497 million. At December 31, total assets stood at 2 billion and net equity was 1.6 billion.","I\u2019ll now hand the call back to your operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair. Please proceed.","Ben Andrew - William Blair","So, Peter, can you talk a little bit more about two things please, for my question. First is international volumes with a kind of steady through the quarter or getting worse or you really  looking at maybe a more difficult environment than you saw in fourth quarter for the balance of fiscal \u201912 and then ended a balance of the year, and then second, on the product mix side, that was a pretty impressive performance on gross margin. Is that something that was unusual in terms of the mix this quarter because that gives us a pretty broad range for the year. So maybe talk to the mix and the dynamics there please?","Peter Farrell","Let me just address the gross margin first Benefit. Obviously getting close to 60% was pretty encouraging. But I think the main thing is and I will let Rob chime in here particularly regarding Europe and maybe for the first question back to Robert. You will note that we had really encouraging growth, as you know the Adaptive Servo-Ventilator products are now in the S9 box and we saw a very good growth there and of course there is also the Stellar and the new Bi-Levels in the S9 box. So higher margin products for sure and that is pretty encouraging. I think we are kind of delighted that we made 60% gross margin.","With respect to what is happening in Europe, I mentioned in my remarks that we were relatively insulated from the Greece, Spain and so forth. We did have some relevant business in Italy and however that was the quite good and obviously the big ones of Germany and France,. The 5% figure down a little bit from perhaps what we have observed in previous quarters and there was nothing that came to me in terms of changes during the quarter.","One thing we do know is that I think we mentioned this before we haven\u2019t but there was a 6% reduction in France in reimbursement and that kicked in and also there was a reduction in reimbursement in Germany for PSG. But that only affected the private market which is roughly a third of the markets. The two thirds being the government-based hospitals where there was no drop in reimbursement. But maybe, Rob you can add some more flavor, if you wish?","Rob Douglas","Sure. I think there is no evidence of hitting a cliff in Europe at all. We would say the market growth in Europe is probably slow more around where the US has been over the past few years. The uncertainty is not helping, but the business is traveling along quite nicely and that\u2019s pretty steady as you go.","Ben Andrew - William Blair","And I guess my follow-up would be, maybe Brett can you give us a sense on hedge gains; in the quarter it looks like the other line was a little bit bigger and where might that be over the balance of this year if rates stay where they are? Thanks.","Brett Sandercock","So, if you say that where hedge gains recorded; they are through other income in the P&L which was $8.5 million this quarter which is predominantly FX guidance there. That you will see from operating income really we were hurt by currency however we had pretty significant hedging gains this quarter really due to all the strengthening both against the US, but in particular against the Euro over there sort of quarter-to-quarter it was about a 9% increase; so its quite significant and marking those to market goals those hedging gains.","If you look at all up for the quarter, the FX was positive on the EPS by about a penny, so it\u2019s pretty much a wash with those gains. Looking forward, if rates stay exactly where they are or where they were at the end of December then you would get more gains through other income, we\u2019re on the hedging because we do mark-to-market. But at the moment, they are even up a little from where they were so there will probably be some minor gains coming through, but it would be largely benign unless we get significant movements in currencies again.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Matson with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed.","Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities","So I guess just back to the commentary on gross margin. So Peter, do you think that the gross margin then is sustainable at closer to 60% or do you think if there is some reason that leaves you to believe that it could fallback down to more of the middle of that range this 58% to 60%?","Peter Farrell","Well Michael, we don\u2019t have a crystal ball to be able to laser beam you know on what gross margins going to be; as you realized it\u2019s a function of geographic mix and Europe was bad a bit relative to the US. That doesn\u2019t help; but on the other hand you know the higher margin products showed the biggest growth. If that continues we\u2019ll be you know the sales and the Bi-Levels in the adaptive servo-ventilator obviously master a pretty good and remain good and that\u2019s been true to the past several quarters.","So assuming the mass hold up and assuming the growth holds up in the Bi-Levels, the vents and also the order setting products will be close up to 60; if that doesn\u2019t hold up we might drop a little bit, but I think Brett said you know we\u2019re comfortable with 59 to 60 and that\u2019s a better and as precise as we want to be.","Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities","Can you give us any timing around new platform launches on the flow generator side; I guess S92 or S10?","Peter Farrell","We\u2019re working on those; I don\u2019t know; I\u2019ll throw that to Don Darkin. Normally, we don\u2019t, you know we\u2019ll let you know when we\u2019re launching. So making predictions there is not what we\u2019re normally into, just like we don\u2019t make too many predictions.","Don Darkin","I do but most of the others don\u2019t.","Peter Farrell","Don, do you want to say anything?","Don Darkin","The platform is well underway, but at this point assume that\u2019s where we\u2019re at. You know particularly, the step-up in expenditure on R&D and that\u2019s obviously reflective of a greater push in certain areas. But just like we don\u2019t give guidance, we are not going to tell you when the product is going to launch.","Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities","Yeah I mean, that actually read into my next question, just because we\u2019ve seen R&D even on a constant currency basis we\u2019ve seen some pretty dramatic increases there and I am just wondering kind of where you are spending all the money. I understand, look you are launching new products at a regular intervals etcetera, but the number of new products I guess from an outsider simply doesn\u2019t really seem like its gone up all that dramatically. But yet your R&D is going up a lot. Is there something related to that big study, the SERVE-HF study that you\u2019re running or something else going on there behind the scenes?","Peter Farrell","The SERVE-HF study is sort of a fixed spent. So there has been no acceleration in that. We\u2019re up to around 900 patients out of the total 1260 planned. So that hasn\u2019t been reflected in the increase. It\u2019s mostly ventilation products, that are cheap to produce and also we\u2019ve been making a push on the health informatics and those two areas are really the main geeks; really ventilation and health informatics.","Brett Sandercock","Just as we\u2019ll pay much that the recent acquisitions, BiancaMed, Gruendler etcetera where they\u2019ve got some nice products and so on. We\u2019re continuing our R&D efforts there as well. So that increases as well and that\u2019s effectively R&D that we\u2019ve acquired but that we certainly you know, very excited about and we\u2019re absolutely funding those as well.","Peter Farrell","Yeah, good point.","Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities","And then just one more quick question, did I hear correctly that the currency impact on your EPS was positive a penny, positive $0.01 this quarter?","Brett Sandercock","Correct. The bottom-line that would\u2019ve been 41, but it came in at 42. So, you know, not really immaterial.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets","Did you call up the Bella Mask, B-E-L-L-A as in Beautiful or the Twilight Movie?","Peter Farrell","Yeah, hi Bella.","Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets","Okay, just checking. Peter, not that I want to move you along, but can you talk about CEO succession planning right now?","Peter Farrell","Well, I think, we sort of talked about that last, maybe it was last call, I can\u2019t recall. But we\u2019re using an outside recruiter because we like their template. But there is not, it\u2019s not something that we\u2019re rushing along. You know, I made some comment there about my hope in sort of rather, it wasn\u2019t bland; things are going well and we\u2019re going through a very sort of circumspect evaluation and we have got 3,500 roughly give or take employees. We think a few of those people are qualified to run the organization and we are just going through 360s if you like and looking at peoples\u2019 strengths and where they maybe need their improvement.","We are using the outside recruiter to help us with that evaluation; we\u2019ve also have another consultant, McKinsey Partner and we\u2019ve worked with Clem Doherty; I don\u2019t want to give advertisement for Clem\u2019s like minded individual\u2019s consultancy, but he is a good guy and he knows us very, very well, we have been working with him since 2004 and he knows all the senior people. And so we\u2019ve got if you like a person who knows us really, really well and recruiters that are beginning to digging down, getting some granularity and we will get reports back from those guys over the next couple of months then we will look at those reports and we will decide where we go from there. But there is no even an announcement Joanne.","Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets","I am sorry, may be it was in Australian newspapers or somebody picked up that Nick was in queue for this; my am I reading or am I remembering something wrong?","Peter Farrell","I think there was a women from I think it was Australian Financial Review which is one of, I don\u2019t know if there is anybody from the AFR on the line but, they indulge in gross exaggeration where there is always takeout of bids where you know somebody is taking us over and there is a big flurry that goes up into the marketplace and we get calls from bankers wanting to help us out with our settle.","Again, that\u2019s just a beat up; there is nothing to that as I told you, we\u2019re going through a proper circumspect evaluation and we will make an announcement sometime in the future. I don't think it will be, it will not be the near future.","Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets","Alright on a more financial note, you have if I remember correctly, a $400 million cash on the balance sheet, you just expanded your credit agreement, what are we doing with all this cash.","Peter Farrell","Well, we as you saw Brett indicated that we've been doing a very aggressive buyback, 4.1 million shares for over a 110 million last quarter, the quarter before that I think if Brett can correct me, 125 million about the same number of shares, 4.5 million. We think that from what we can see we think the stock is incredibly undervalued. You can see with our current results we like this area. We continue to be excited about the future. We are in an area which is, it\u2019s preventative medicine, it improves patients\u2019 quality of life and also reduces healthcare costs.","So we are in a, if you like a sweet spot regardless of what happens in the crazy world of sick care, also known as healthcare. So we are in a very good space and we believe that the best value at the moment, we increase the borrowing so we have the flexibility. There's another 14 million shares approved for buyback. We believe that the stock is cheap and we are putting our money where our mouth is.","Regarding the balance sheet, our total debt including current and non current together is around $225 million and we have net cash of around $0.5 billion, but most of that's offshore. We are not going to bring it back here at the ridiculous tax rate sort of existing in this country and so we will however make investments leveraging the balance sheet in areas like we did or like we\u2019ve done with say BiancaMed and so. But we\u2019re making some private investments where we think we can, we\u2019re not trying to make money on equity plays, I mean you know invest $3 million and you get 10X and you get $30 million back and you put it on our balance sheet with net cash of nearly half a billion, it\u2019s kind of like so what.","So we are doing this in the marketplace to put people in a direction which we think makes sense or we are investing in technology that we think in the future will make sense. So that\u2019s where we are putting out our resources, the buyback and minor investments in people that we think can choose straight and will help us expand the market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord. Please proceed.","Jason Mills - Canaccord","Hi, Brett first question is for you. I am certainly not a foreign currency expert. I just wanted to see if I can get a little bit more granularity there because you did a nice job of giving us some color around the constant currency growth in both SG&A and R&D and saying that revenue and gross margins were not affected by currency. So just looking at the SG&A and R&D based on constant  currency growth using your percentage as, it looks like it added about a million and half bucks currency did to the cost. And then you said other income 8.5 million was predominately FX. So I am getting into a higher impact from currency just using what we\u2019ve heard so far in the call. So could you just help me out in getting me to understand a little bit better?","Brett Sandercock","The big one there would have been the (inaudible) impact year-on-year judgment, so as you know a lot of ware that we have is basically a quarterly lag with the cogs until we ultimately sell that inventory. So if you step back and look at that lag impact, the Aussie dollar actually appreciated quite a lot over that period and that\u2019s what hurt us through the margin. And year-on-year certainly was quite a big impact, it would have been probably a little over 200 basis points on the margin. That\u2019s where we are getting hurt at the operating income line. And of course we had offsetting hedges coming through this quarter which more than offset that. So we ended up with having that one penny benefit coming through.","Jason Mills - Canaccord","Okay, so kind of leads to my next question on gross margin, sort of what the constant currency gross margin would have been, you said initially that you saw minimal impact from FX, but now you are seeing, it seems like you had actually a significant impact. Are you saying pro forma, we are looking at margins, it would have been on last year\u2019s currency levels around 61.5%?","Brett Sandercock","That certainly would have been high. So two things on this, Jason, the first one is my comments were generally on sequential movements in the gross margin which people tend to focus on given how volatile currencies are and so on. So that\u2019s one aspect. The other aspect is the year-on-year margin which if you looked at it kind of down I think was 60.8% last year, 59.7% this quarter. So that\u2019s definitely come down and the big driver of that is basically currency on that. So if you basically, you strip that out on constant currency basis, it is suffice to say that margins would have been higher than they are, than they were last year even. Fortunately we are live in the world where it is kind of really volatile at the moment. So we get a lot of these movements happening. You can see the weaker euro even now is going to play a part as well and end up being a bit of a headwind for us. So, there is a whole bunch of factors playing it on that margin, making it pretty difficult to predict.","Jason Mills - Canaccord","Is it possible that you have the mirror reversed in the currency markets happen at some point in time?","Brett Sandercock","In terms of potentially weakening Aussie and so on.","Jason Mills - Canaccord","Yeah, and then you would have gross margins that show up in the 200 basis points lower and is a negative impact. Is that possible or do you feel like?","Peter Farrell","It could. If you look trending over the last two or three years, where the Aussie has been basically on the rise almost inevitably and remotely. If that turned around for some reason, then there is a lot of headwinds we\u2019ve had over the last two or three years would end up reversing and we would see the benefit of that. And it overly stems from the large part of our cost base is here in Australia. So denominated Aussie dollars.","Jason Mills - Canaccord","Okay, and Peter, on the product mix of flow versus mask, you have consistently proven your mask growth is sustainably strong, what can you do to couple overtime your flow generator growth with that strong mask growth, I presume you don\u2019t have any inclination of that coupling with mask growth coming down. So, I presume that you\u2019re gearing up for flow generators to come up and exist at a higher level, sort of similar to your mask. I am just wondering what sort of initiatives or plan strategy you have in place for that?","Peter Farrell","Well, the one possibility that we\u2019re looking at, given the replenishment area and given the growth in masks, as you pointed out, it\u2019s been strong, traditionally strong. We\u2019ve seen a weakening in the flow generator space and now with HST coming in, I have mentioned that the positive impact on APAP or our autosetting products and also the growth in application of the Adaptive Servo-ventilation.","In the last call, I mentioned some of the good things that were happening in Japan where Adaptive Servo-ventilation was being used on heart failure patients even though they didn\u2019t have frank sleep disorder breathing. The cardiologists there and we are involved in a continuing study there. The cardiologists there believe that because of the impact on fluid in the lungs and fluid in the pleura that Adaptive Servo-ventilation should be used for all heart failure patients.","That\u2019s pretty encouraging and we\u2019d like to see that spread, but one thing we are looking at and Don can talk to this if he wants to add some flavor to it, but the replenishment area is showing very, very encouraging growth and we have been saying to ourselves, Gee you know what, what about flow generators in that space.","So it\u2019s a huge number of very old flow generators. It is kind of like the old Volvo ads. We have been driving this thing for years and years and years. Well guess what, horsepower has changed, acceleration has changed in the newer ones, wouldn\u2019t you like to buy a new one and hey why don\u2019t you trade in your old one.","So we seen and quiet frequently patients that will come in with a flow generator and a CPAP device that is over ten years old. With hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours on it. Well Gee you know things like noise, impedance, the algorithms I mean everything has evolved and obviously we make pretty good products because they last a long time, but they have been significant improvements particularly in people that have, and we sort of suggest a lifetime of five years. So there's a lot of devices that are out there that are well over five years old and like I can\u2019t give you the numbers but its in the millions of devices that are out there, how many are older than five years, we can provide some estimates, that looks like half of them. So there's no reason why we could alert people to the fact that they might benefit from a newer device with better compliance and certainly we would think better quality of life. So that's something we are looking at.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Prior with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Matthew Prior - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I will just have a rather quick one in regards to the European mix of flow gen business. Can you talk about whether the European mix is similar to the US in terms of flow in CPAP orders that's been viable given that the current level in CPAP what you see in the future?","Peter Farrell","That's quite a different mix. Generally Europe is much more a higher mix on the CPAP. Typically the older sets are a lot stronger and the US has a model where patients who don't live well with the CPAP end up on a Bi-Level device and that's not immobile in most European countries. So the mix is very different.","Matthew Prior - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then just one follow-up question, Peter you talked about obviously home sleep testing and we've still got this issue of PSG labs not yet participating in HST. When do you see that coming, is it now that we've got pre authorization that you will get that potential transferences of PSG labs participating in HST and ultimately what\u2019s the conservative argument, you mentioned that some in ResMed are more conservative than yourself, I am just curious if you can flush out and any other kind of things for us.","Peter Farrell","Okay. Matt let me take your last question there. You can say that I am optimistic but in looking at the terrain, I think we\u2019re going to see a doubling in HST, which means the potential doubling in the America\u2019s in AutoSetting setting devices. So that just my hunch. We\u2019re seeing there is some anecdotal evidence coming back from the marketplace that the payers are getting a little more AMC there, they are saying material expenditure on PSG and they are not -- this authorization is building up a whole ahead of steam. Why? Because it\u2019s going to save them money and you are looking at rough figures 1200 bucks plus for PSG versus 250 for HST. But they are other dynamics that are playing here as well and we\u2019re trying to inform the sleep labs and they\u2019ll pass it over and make in a second and need for him to make a comment.","But the sleep labs, we did a survey and found out that 30% of patients have a script written to attend the sleep lab for PSG, 30% of the patients time show out. So if your 30% are no shows that\u2019s big number. And we\u2019ve also found that if the sleep lab also offers HST and if you think about HST versus PSG. PSG you get on a six to eight week wait list and you got to bring a duffle bag with all your gear and then they wire you up. And this is for something that a five-year-old child can diagnose. I mean this is something that is very, very simply to do, particularly if you have a history and a physical by a physician who knows what he or she is doing.","So you could almost argue, you could go straight from a history and physical. In a lot of cases straight to autosetting treatment because only autosetting will tell you whether you need treatment or not. But that means obviously buying a device. But physicians would have been in this game for while, now 80% of the time which patient needs treatment and will benefit from it. Anyway stepping back from that so you have got labs. Now if they offer both, then it\u2019s a 2% no show which is quite different. Now, if you think of HST, it is a medium. You take the HST, the apnea link in our case home with you. You bring it back the next morning. In two minutes you get a full diagnosis and you immediately satisfied with the CPAP rather than waiting six to eight weeks, perhaps ten weeks before you\u2019re put on treatment.","It\u2019s very inefficient to PSG. It\u2019s very expensive by comparison with HST and much, much, much more inconvenient. So you are going to see consumer move there, you are seeing the payers pushing people in that direction. And I think that the labs that don\u2019t offer HST are actually dinosaurs. The fact is that the whole market is moving in that direction. There is no stopping it and those that resisted. I can loose them. So, and I think given the fact that most of them don\u2019t want to end up on the dole or accepting welfare payments. I think they will move and how quickly that will happen, I am saying it\u2019s doubling. It could even get a higher. I don\u2019t think it is going to be any worse than 30% of all sleep testing and HST. Others conservatively within ResMed, the same more like 25%. But that\u2019s still pretty significant 80% growth versus 100%.","Brett Sandercock","But Matthew, to your question there about sleep labs are not participating in HST. They\u2019re actually already are. And they\u2019re participating at the double-digit percentage rate and it varies by geography around the Americas. But if you look in the Northeast and the Southeast particularly where there is very high density of sleep labs, you\u2019re talking 20% to 40% of them all ready sleep centers participating in home sleep testing and some of them actively offering it because they\u2019re saying that the no-show rate for just PSG is about 30% and the no-show rate when you offer both PSG and HST give people choice. Its down to 5%, could be in that 2% to 3% range in some early data. So that no-show rate goes way down. They\u2019re seeing that and the forward-looking sleep centers are already doing this. Even the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, which is the sort of group that helps govern this group has put together an accreditation program for Home sleep testing. So, it\u2019s now sort of sanction within the sleep center community and they\u2019re all talking about how do we tie in to patient centered medical homes to accountable care organizations. And all this evolution of the payer environment within the US market and how do we make sure sleep changes upon utilization management at those payers to care management or disease management. So that we show that there is an ROI to the insurance company of diagnosing and treating and managing the patients on CPAP, APAP and VPAP products. So that message is there and both across sleep centers and across the sleep medical communities as well as the HMEs and manufacturers like ResMed, we\u2019re partnering up to put that story together and drive home sleep testing as part of that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Clair with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.","David Clair - Piper Jaffray","Any comments you can give us on the launch of Stellar 100 and then Peter you mentioned we have some more ventilation products in the pipeline. How should we think about ventilation going forward for you guys?","Peter Farrell","I think Jeff Nelson, if he is still awake, he is in Europe and Geoff you are the guy on the ground there. Stellar has been released in Europe as a 100 mm on 50 would you like to comment on that please Jeff?","Geoff Neilson","Can you hear me?","Peter Farrell","I can hear.","Geoff Neilson","Okay so Stellar 150 has been in the market now for a while. It\u2019s launched throughout Europe and we have also got that with CareFusion distributing into hospitals in US and they have launched that towards the end of last quarter. And Stellar 150 we launched in Europe and that has our automatic therapy called IPAP switches being well received so far.","And Stellar 100 and 150 are approved in Japan and we look forward to launching that in the next quarter and the growth rate is to our expectation and CareFusion has been lot of sampling and their sales force is excited and we are getting some interest from the hospitals and they are showing that, but obviously the sales cycle in the hospital is a bit longer than at home care.","And that is story with the Stellar 100 and 150 and looking forward we are investing in new platforms to replace our existing platforms that are available in Europe and the timing of that we wouldn't say at the moment, but we are actively investing in that and you can see that by some of our R&D expenditure.","And then we are also looking at humidification with Gruendler and we are doing a CPL or controlled product launch in Europe at the moment and we would be looking forward to launching their new humidifier over in about a quarter\u2019s time and before the end of the financial year.","So we are excited about what we are doing and the business is growing; it\u2019s growing quickly in the US with some of the HST products and obviously we are looking forward to new products as they come online.","David Clair - Piper Jaffray","Then a quick one here for Brett, you know how should we think about the medical device tax impact in 2013?","Brett Sandercock","Yeah, I mean it\u2019s probably going to be interesting one for all medical companies there on that tax that comes through. At the moment, I mean we have a, we got a team together at the moment that's looking at it on the assumption that its going to come through and who knows what might happen. But at the moment, with sort of planning that\u2019s going to come through, what \u2013 that Peter and guys might have some color on whether it gets there or not, but at least that\u2019s what we are planning for. And then it\u2019s just a question of who is, how you do that, who you pace with, or who does that kind of thing, I think all that's got to be worked through.","Peter Farrell","I mean, we are expecting the worst on that, but hoping for the best, I mean there is a lot of water to flow under the bridge David, and hopefully it ends up being positive for the whole of the medical device industry.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Hurren with UBS. Please proceed.","Dan Hurren - UBS","Well, good morning everyone. Just wanted to ask Peter your comments at the last quarterly result in relation to stopping discounts for the low end CPAPs in the US became such as huge issue after the quarter. Could you just give an update on that?","Peter Farrell","I never mentioned it Dan, if I had known it was going to create such havoc.","Dan Hurren - UBS","Well, Peter could you perhaps just, I mean at the time you\u2019re talking about some of that volume might come back would have fallen in the next quarter; you didn\u2019t know how many of the price sensitive or how many of the buys were price sensitive; can you just talk about how that\u2019s played out over the second quarter?","Peter Farrell","Well, I think you know I was talking about that we were doing a bit of market segmentation etcetera, but look I am going to tell that to make my comment, but basically we had a period where there was a sort of hockey stick thing going on when I mean I am going back a few years now, we decided that we wanted to have a more you know saying in a way of satisfying customers more of you know; if you can get to further, further, further, I mean that\u2019s kind of dreaming a little bit, but you don\u2019t want to have 60% of your sales in the last month.","I am just trying to pulling that figure out of the air; I am not saying that that\u2019s a real number. But too much of the business was being pushed towards the end of the quarter. And it creates logistical issues and if you start offering better prices you know appearing as you are desperate at the end of the quarter to make sales. Then that\u2019s going to push everything in the direction of a hockey stick at the end of the quarter and we decided that we did want to, we did want to offer bag and base process and we didn\u2019t want to have this logistical nightmare towards at the end of the quarter and we\u2019ve taken steps to get around it, so Mick, why don\u2019t you, do you have anything to add to that?","Michael Farrell","Well, I mean the only thing I would say that Dan is that, we haven\u2019t changed really anything in how we operate from Q1 to Q2. We operate our business for the long term, looking at long term efficiency and supply chain management for us; our manufacturing facilities, our inventory facilities and for our customer\u2019s inventory facilities and delivery to their patients.","What changed from Q1 where we were minus 2% in America\u2019s flow generators to Q2 where we were plus 4% in America\u2019s flow generators wasn\u2019t any fundamental shift and how we did that. We are doing the same thing as we did in Q1 and Q2. What happened was that we have seen a positive impact overtime going out talking to sleep physician by sleep physician, sleep lab by sleep lab, HME by HME, about the benefits of the S9 Bi-Levels to benefits of the VPAP adapt which is now in the S9 platform, the benefit of the VPAP ST and driving the value of those products and leveraging the positive mix shift from S9 Skype up to S9 auto-setting that is linked with HST which is titled to the question.","So that is probably mix-shifts have resulted in that six point turnaround from minus two to plus four. It\u2019s nothing to do with any sort of change in long-term. By the way we got the same of operational efficiency in tying with our large customers that we have before and we plan to stick with that going forward.","Dan Hurren - UBS","So I just, I guess in a word, you are saying that the segmentation is progressing as planned and is proven to be successful?","Michael Farrell","Correct. We are doing the Wayne Gretzky skate to where the tuck will be, not where it was and that\u2019s what we have been doing and it seemed to work here in Q2 and we plan to continue to do that.","Peter Farrell","Have you understand the Wayne Gretzky?","Michael Farrell","All the rugby ball\u2026","Peter Farrell","Yeah, where do you think the ball is going to end up basically; if you\u2019re not an ice hockey fan, than we can send you a bit more detail, but we\u2019ll take it offline.","Dan Hurren - UBS","I will check it out on YouTube. Thank you, gents.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Low with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","David Low - Deutsche Bank","If we could just turn back to the same sort of topics, the Stella sales during the period, I mean, Mick you just commented that you had to turnaround the 6% turnaround. Just how much was ventilation sales contributed to that?","Brett Sandercock","Well, we don\u2019t give granularity on that, David. You know, because once you start, it\u2019s going to be every quarter getting down to granularity and we don\u2019t think makes a heck a lot of sense. I think Geoff put it correctly we were very satisfied with where we are in the sales, both with CareFusion and with our Asia-Pac and European sales. So a good growth and we expect to see that continue.","David Low - Deutsche Bank","And just again on the Bi-Levels and I guess that was an issue going back a few quarters. If you could talk, I mean, Mick you mentioned the marketing of those products and then now in the S9 platform, just can you talk about where sales of Bi-Level devices are now. This is where they were in 12 months ago, given we went through that deep with the product launch?","Michael Farrell","No, David. We\u2019re not going to go, like we\u2019re not going to split out the category between details of VPAP ST versus Stella. We\u2019re not going to go in to the detail split between CPAP, APAP and Bi-Level, other than to say that it was positive material impact of the S9 Bi-Levels, particularly of VPAP adapt and the ST, which is now there sort of high margin, high value for the customer, high value for the insurance provider products and we\u2019re focusing our attention, and marketing and our sales people have their feet on the street with selling the value proposition of ResMed\u2019s high end flow generators and ventilators as well as our algorithm and how essential as part of HST so a combination of many factors have contributed to that sort of positive mix shift that you saw in flow generators in that period.","David Low - Deutsche Bank","Sure. Look I am not expecting you to break it out, I just wanted to get a sense as to whether we were sort of back to the same run rate or whether the Bi-Levels is a category offering the same opportunity that they were 12 or 24 months ago?","Michael Farrell","Look I think we have a good opportunity to take share overtime in the Bi-Level category and in the ventilation category and Geoff can talk more about the global ventilation opportunity, but within the Americas in Bi-Levels we got a lot of run rate and we are going to move at it and keep the value proposition selling on a ongoing basis.","Geoff Neilson","And having said that I think last quarter and certainly the quarter before we talked about the non-complaint OSA so if you like the lower margin Bi-Levels VS products we are seeing that the S9 order set has such a good algorithm, you know one sleep physician who is switched exclusively using the S9 order set and he said he has gone from the low 20s in terms of non-complaint OSA going on to Bi-Level down to more like 5%. So that\u2019s at the low end and we don\u2019t see any big changes there; in other words it\u2019s going to go from the 20% down to perhaps the 5% non-complaint OSA going on to Bi-Level S.","David Low - Deutsche Bank","And just one follow up, the pricing environment I guess it\u2019s a pretty standard question on these quarterly calls, but could you talk about what you've seen with your ASP and perhaps touch on what the competitive environment been as well?","Geoff Neilson","You know we happily we've seen no unexpected, put it that way, unexpected changes in ASP which is a good thing. But it seems that the other guys are you know not doing anything silly and we certainly have no plans to do anything silly.

My name is Ellen, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Agnes, you may begin.","Agnes Lee","Thank you, Ellen, and thank you everyone for attending ResMed's live webcast. Joining me on the call today are Mick Farrell, our CEO; and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release, it can be found on our website at investor.resmed.com.","I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company, corporate strategy and performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in filings made by ResMed with the SEC.","I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell.","Michael Farrell","Thanks, Agnes, and thank you to our shareholders, who are joining us on today's investor call, as we provide an overview of our Q2 fiscal 2015 results. I'm pleased to report that we achieved very strong sales growth this quarter with excellent progress from new product launches in our core market of sleep disordered breathing, as well as our cardio and respiratory care markets.","In the introductory remarks, I'll discuss our sales achievements; I'll also provide an update on our product launches; and finally, I'll cover progress against our longer-term three horizons growth strategy. Then, I'll turn the call over to Brett, our CFO, to walk you through our financial results in greater detail.","As you saw in our press release, our global business achieved double-digit revenue growth in Q2 or 14% on a constant currency basis. Including currency headwinds, our global growth was 10% year-on-year.","We saw strength across all geographic regions, with robust double-digit growth in the Americas as well as double-digit growth in our combined European and Asia-Pac regions on a constant currency basis. These results were fueled by the success of new product launches in our sleep apnea and respiratory care markets, including both COPD and neuromuscular disease.","We delivered gross margin of 62.2%, which was just above the middle of our guidance range for the quarter. At the same time, we continue to invest SG&A to promote our global product launches. As a percentage of sales, SG&A remained roughly in line on a year-over-year basis at 29% of sales.","We also continued to invest in research and development, as we continue to innovate to build long-term, sustainable, competitive advantage in the marketplace. R&D represented about 7% of revenues, which is slightly down from prior quarters, primarily as a result of currency movements, particularly in the Australian dollar.","Looking at the bottomline, our GAAP diluted earnings per share grew 7% to $0.64. On a non-GAAP basis, diluted EPS was a $0.01 higher at $0.65. Zooming in on our combined European and Asia-Pac businesses, we grew at 16% on a constant currency basis in the second quarter. Including currency headwinds, we achieved 8% headline growth for our combined European and Asia-Pac business units.","This robust sales performance came from the balance of flow generator growth, associated with our new product launches, as well as strong growth in masks and accessories in the region. With long multi-year product lifecycles for new device platforms, our flow generator launches are still in their early days.","We see upside in Europe and Asia-Pac for both the AirSense 10 and the Astral platforms, as we look forward. We have seen strong early interest in our Air Solutions platform in Europe, and we will continue to invest and grow that opportunity overtime. It is important to note that the digitization of medicine in the respiratory space is becoming a truly global trend. And it's a trend that ResMed is leading.","Zooming out to a higher level, we believe that noninvasive homecare ventilation solutions combined with robust healthcare informatics solutions will be critical to improving patient outcomes and lowering costs for COPD and heart failure patients within global healthcare systems. This is an important macro trend and we will continue to partner with patients, physicians, hospitals, homecare providers, payers and governments to help solve the chronic disease problem. We see a significant unmet medical need and a huge opportunity.","We are rapidly growing the European respiratory care market. Our established channels in Western European countries have helped us to build good momentum over the last eight months with the launch of our new life support ventilator, the Astral platform in the region.","In addition, during the second quarter, we continue to invest for longer-term growth in Asia-Pacific. We are investing in both respiratory care and sleep apnea channel development to help create and lead both sleep apnea and home ventilation markets in Asia-Pac, with a focus on the significant growth opportunity potential in both China and India.","Moving on to Americas results, we had a strong performance in Q2 from the region, with the Americas sales team driving 12% year-on-year growth. We have both good momentum and high morale within the team, as our innovative solutions meet and beat customer needs.","We are particularly pleased with initial progress of our U.S. flow generator product launches with 25% year-on-year growth for that category in the Americas region. Let me drill into the U.S. flow generator category in some detail and talk about three key product launches, the AirSense 10, the AirCurve 10, and then our new respiratory care platform, the Astral.","When talking about the AirSense 10, we have to discuss the Air Solutions Healthcare Informatics ecosystem that surrounds it. One of the key reasons the AirSense 10 product has exceeded our expectations is the value provided by Air Solutions. We continue to hear positive feedback from customers about this end-to-end solution, including its quantifiable benefit for patients, providers, physicians and even payers and hospitals.","We are still in early days for Air Solutions and we will continue to enhance its offerings, but all indicators point to the fact that we have a winning value proposition. We are providing an opportunity to drive more efficiency, to increase adherence and to improve patient care, all by liberating data and empowering all players in the value chain. AirView, U-Sleep and myAir are just some of the key components of the Air Solutions ecosystem.","As you may remember, we ended last quarter with a backlog on the AirSense 10. This quarter, I am happy to report that our operational excellence went into play, and we've been able to swiftly ramp up our supply chain and manufacturing system to make demand. We are still working through each detail production combination to get ahead of demand and build out appropriate levels of safety stock. But it is important to note that any remaining product backlogs are immaterial to the business.","The second U.S. flow generator subcategory I want to discuss is the AirCurve 10, which is the bilevel group. As expected, we launched the AirCurve 10 in the U.S. in December, the final month of the quarter. And we are receiving good early customer feedback. The AirCurve 10 devices are an integral part of the Air Solutions platform that I mentioned earlier.","So this, the AirCurve 10, is a cloud connected bilevel system that leverages the same end-to-end workforce solution that we provide with the AirSense 10 device range. We have introduced the AirCurve 10 less than four months after introducing the AirSense 10. That is a significant improvement for us over the launches of our two previous generations, the S9 and the S8. With just less than a month of sales in Q2 and with its launch limited to just the U.S. market geography, the AirCurve 10 is in its very early days of launch.","Looking at the masks and accessories category in the Americas, our AirFit range of masks had solid volume growth in the quarter. We continue gain share on a sequential basis. Customer feedback on the P10, N10 and F10 remain excellent. On a sequential basis, volumes were up and prices were relatively stable.","On a year-over-year basis, we are starting to see stability in pricing, as we are seeing more steady markets this year than last year. As a reminder, we are expecting pricing in the U.S. to be an easier comparable for year-on-year revenue numbers, after the end of our next quarter ending March 2015.","It is important to note that the price adjustments that we started 12 months ago were phased in from January to June 2014 on a product-by-product and a customer-by-customer basis. The facts are that the masks and accessories category continues to be competitive and we are continuing to drive the business in a dynamic market and in a dynamic method.","Moving to the respiratory care market, we continue to receive good feedback on our Astral platform, as we launch it to key opinion leader physicians, HMA customers and hospitals across the United Sates. We look forward to growing our U.S. life-support ventilation presence with Astral. With our VPAP COPD device and our Astral platform, as a combined offering in this space, we are uniquely positioned to provide doctors and patients the right treatment, at the right price, at the right time.","Now, I'd like to take a broader longer-term global view and spend some time talking about the progress against our three horizons growth strategy. In our first horizon of growth, which includes our core sleep apnea market, we are driving Healthcare Informatics solutions and software engineering innovation, with the launch of our Air Solutions ecosystem and our AirSense 10 platform, as I mentioned earlier.","With the launch of the AirCurve 10 platform, we are positioned to drive the efficiency, adherence and the outcomes value proposition even deeper within global markets. The AirCurve 10 range spans from basic bilevel functionality, all the way up to noninvasive ventilation as well as Adaptive-Servo Ventilation technology.","To sharpen our focus on informatics solutions, this quarter Rob and I established a new global business unit for Healthcare Informatics here at ResMed. This global team will be led by Raj Sodhi. Raj was the CEO and Co-Founder of Umbian, which is a software-as-a-service company that you recall we bought in 2012.","Raj has deep experience in running, growing and scaling, both secure and fast moving transactional data systems. And he has had a big impact in the time he's been here at ResMed. He's made the move from Halifax to San Diego, and we welcome him onboard.","Healthcare Informatics is now a core competence for our company. It is also a major area for investment that we are using to drive, count and future, customer value. We are leading the digitalization of medicine in the respiratory space, and we are just getting started.","On the legal front, in December, we won a patent infringement case against a Chinese-based competitor in the U.S. International Trade Commission, when the commission ruled that their masks infringe our patents. At ResMed, we are committed to protecting our world-leading respiratory medical innovation and defending our over 5,000 patents and designs, so that we can continue to innovate and continue to change millions more lives as we go forward.","We will continue to take action to enforce our intellectual property and to defend the significant investment, which is approximately 7% of our revenue this quarter in research and development, with a focus on pioneering clinical research and world leading by medical engineering.","We are making solid progress within our second horizon of growth, which includes both our respiratory care market as well as new emerging market growth opportunities. We continue to see solid growth in our European respiratory care business, where we have had a leading presence in homecare ventilation for a number of years.","We continue to build our respiratory care channels and strength in the U.S. geography. We have 18 million patients suffering from COPD in the word and 5% to 10 of them being candidates for noninvasive ventilation; we have a lot of runway in front of us.","We start adding opportunities from neuromuscular disease like ALS, we are adding muscular dystrophy; we can help millions of patients and also save hundreds of millions of dollars for healthcare systems, by taking care of these patients at home rather than in the hospital. Patients want that, physician want that, payers want that.","With accountable care organizations, integrated delivering networks and growing payer-provider models in the U.S. as well as the mostly government-run healthcare systems in Europe and Asia-Pac, we can now say that hospital systems and hospital CEO's are starting to drive towards that same goal.","On the geographic expansion component of horizon two, we continue to make progress in our emerging markets with strong double-digit growth this quarter. We have established long-term investment plans for China, India, Brazil and Eastern Europe to ensure that we help establish good protocols for hospital to home as well as the right care models, so that patients and physicians can remain connected.","With increasing healthcare investments in emerging markets, we look forward to working with government, so that they can know that they are improving patient outcomes and also being efficient with limited healthcare funds using objective, quantifiable outcomes data.","Our third and final horizon of growth focuses on cardiorespiratory conditions, with an emphasis on central sleep apnea and Cheyne-Stokes respiration in heart failure patients. Our SERVE-HF trial is on track and going well. We are now expecting presentation and publication of the SERVE-HF data by the primary investigators some time in light calendar year 2015 or early calendar year 2016. We continue to see excitement in the heart failure and sleep apnea space, and we are facilitating strong partnerships between cardiologists and pulmonary physicians as well as homecare providers.","For our CAT-HF clinical trial in the U.S., we continue to enroll patients every week, and we expect that CAT-HF results will be available during calendar year 2017. As a reminder, SERVE-HF is powered to show changes in mortality and morbidity in heart failure patients with CSA, while CAT-HF is powered to show improvements in cardiovascular outcomes and to help lead a change in standard of care for heart failure patients.","It is important to note that both studies use ResMed's proprietary PaceWave, Adaptive-Servo Ventilation technology. We will continue to provide updates, as significant milestones are reached in both of these important, global, pioneering clinical trials.","We remain active on the capital management front, including share buybacks and dividends. You'll hear more about these actions in Q2 from Brett in a few moments.","Additionally, we continue to look at M&A opportunities that are aligned with our long-term three horizons growth strategy and assets that we can leverage to enhance long-term shareholder value. We have opportunities on our radar screen of all sizes. We have over $400 million in net cash on our balance sheet and significant borrowing capacity. So we have the dry powder that we need to acquire the right assets at the right time and at the right price.","Let me close with this, we are excited about our long-term outlook and our three horizons growth strategy. We are executing well to that plan. We continue to lead the market with innovative products, services and solutions that achieve three important end goals that we call, the Holy Grail. Goal one, improve patient quality of life; goal two, halt the progression of important key chronic diseases; and point three, lower the costs of highly-stressed healthcare systems around the world.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brett for a more detailed review of our Q2 financials. Brett?","Brett Sandercock","Great. Thanks, Mick. As Mick has noted, revenue for the December quarter was $423 million, an increase of 10% over the prior-year quarter, and in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 14%. Movements in exchange rates, predominantly a weaker euro relative to the U.S. dollar, negatively impacted revenue by approximately $13.8 million in the second quarter.","At a geographic level, overall sales in the Americas were $231 million, an increase of 12% over the prior-year quarter. Sales in combined Europe and Asia-Pacific totaled $192 million, an increase of 8% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales in combined Europe and Asia-Pacific increased by 16% over the prior-year quarter.","Breaking out revenue between product segments. Americas flow generator sales were $111 million, an increase of 25% over the prior-year quarter. Masks and other sales were $120 million, an increase of 2% over the prior-year quarter. For revenue in combined Europe and Asia-Pacific, flow generator sales were $129 million, an increase of 9% over the prior-year quarter or in constant currency terms an increase of 17%.","Masks and other sales were $63 million, an increase of 6% over the prior-year quarter or in constant currency terms an increase of 14%. Globally, in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 20%, while masks and other increased by 6% over the prior-year quarter.","Gross margins for the December quarter were 62.2%. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin contracted by 250 basis points, reflecting declines in average selling prices and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by manufacturing and supply chain improvements.","With respect to currency impacts on gross margin going forward, on a sequential basis and assuming current exchange rates, we now expect to see only a very minor positive impact on gross margin, as the impact from a weaker Australian dollar will be largely offset by the weaker euro.","Looking forward in the second half of fiscal year 2015, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 60% to 62%, given likely trends in geographic and product mix. As always, we continue to focus on initiatives targeted at improving our global manufacturing, supply chain and logistics cost structures.","Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $122.5 million, an increase of 10% over the prior-year quarter or in constant currency terms, an increase of 15%, primarily due to higher marketing costs associated with recent product releases, higher variable employee compensation, some impacts on the recent acquisitions and the release of contingent consideration in the prior-year quarter.","SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 29% compared to the year ago figure of 29.1%. And looking forward, subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range 29% for the second half of fiscal year 2015.","R&D expenses for the quarter were $29.3 million, a decrease of 1% over the prior-year quarter, but on a constant currency basis an increase of 7%, reflecting incremental investment in areas of Healthcare Informatics and cardiology. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.9% compared to the year ago figure of 7.7%.","Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for the second half of fiscal year 2015. This reflects our ongoing commitment to investing in our diverse product pipeline, informatics solutions and clinical trials, but also benefit of the weaker Australian dollar, in which the majority our R&D is denominated.","Amortization of acquired intangibles is $2.3 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $11.7 million. Our effective tax rate for quarter was 21.1%, and we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2015 will in fact be in the vicinity of 21%.","Net income for the quarter was $91.2 million, an increase of 5% over the prior-year quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.64, an increase of 7% over the prior-year quarter. Foreign exchange movements did negatively impact second quarter earnings per share, but this impact was less than $0.01 year-over-year. The impact from the weaker euro was essentially offset by the weaker Australian dollar.","Cash flow from operations was $106 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and a modest increase in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $19 million, while depreciation and amortization for the December quarter totaled $18.9 million.","We have continued to be active on the capital management front. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share, and during the quarter we repurchased 667,000 shares for consideration of $33.5 million. At the end of December, we had approximately 16.8 million shares remaining under our authorized share repurchase program.","To date, in fiscal year 2015, we have returned 101% of free cash flow to our shareholders via dividends and repurchases, and over the last five years, we have returned 97% of free cash flow to our shareholders via dividends and repurchases.","Our balance sheet remains very strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $431 million and at December 31 total assets stood at $2.3 billion and net equity was $1.6 billion.","And with that, I will hand the call back to Agnes.","Agnes Lee","Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to the Q&A session of the call. We ask that everyone limit themselves to one question and one follow-up. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue. Ellen, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair.","Margaret Kaczor","Mick, can you maybe give us some more color in terms of components of that strong U.S. slower growth. You had mentioned that backlog was immaterial going forward, but how much of an impact did that have this quarter versus next towards auto and bilevels and vents?","Michael Farrell","So the backlog was pretty modest, Margaret, last quarter. We brought it up, because we thought it was important to just be fully transparent about that. That was in a couple of different stock keeping units, the particular one was the AutoSet for Her stocking keeping unit, which was a brand new algorithm, the first ever introduced to the global market of an algorithm for female breathing patterns. And it was taken up much faster by physicians and homecare providers in the U.S. channel than we had thought.","And there were a couple of other varieties, where the ClimateLine air tube goes in or not in the device and some bundling SKUs that were also in backorder. And so what we did in the 90 days is ensure that we got the supply chain up to speed and we're able to deliver that.","So as you looked at the 25% year-on-year growth in Americas flow generators, a very small portion of that was to sort of catch up on the backlog. And as we look forward, as I said in the prepared remarks, there is immaterial backlog left. There's still a couple of ones that we are working through, but it's not going to affect the ongoing business, Margaret.","Margaret Kaczor","And then in terms of international, I mean again very strong growth out there. What were the country-by-country breakdown, was it Japan, Germany? And then maybe give us more clarity as to why?","Michael Farrell","I'll hand to Rob, our COO, present to answer that question.","Robert Douglas","Yes, Margaret. We are pretty strong on most of the countries. You would call out France and Japan, but a lot of the other European countries are very strong. We don't give detailed breakdown of all of that, and so we won't be doing that. But really underlying it, patient flows remain strong in all those markets.","They haven't all got AirSense 10 yet, but in the markets where they do have it, which is most of them, it's had a very good reception. And as Mick was saying earlier, the Air Solutions is very positive part of the value proposition.","And then, of course, Astral was also in the market in Europe. And also, as we said earlier, we've been selling successfully our life support ventilation and it has a strong market position there, and the Astral is building on that and already generating good momentum.","Operator","The next question is from Andrew Goodsall with UBS.","Andrew Goodsall","I just want to talk about gross margin, just to understand where you are in the cycle. Previously, when you've launched a new product, you've been able to extract some costs, I guess, from manufacturers. So just trying to understand a little bit more where you are in that, and I guess, in particular, with the manufacturing mainly in Australia or Singapore at this stage?","Michael Farrell","So I'll answer the first part and then maybe handover to Brett to address the second part. I mean with regard to gross margin, in general, when we are successful in growing very well in our flow generators, it's very good in driving the topline, but it has some negative implications on gross margin, so you get the positives of the revenue and the implications on the gross margin.","And as we are more successful in growing in the Americas, again, it's very good in driving the topline, but can have an impact on the gross margin. So this quarter you saw very strong growth in flow generators globally and you saw very strong growth in the Americas, and so there was some impact on the gross margin.","But, Brett, do you want to provide a little bit more color and detail for Andrew into gross margin, and maybe the guidance of 60% to 62% going forward.","Brett Sandercock","Yes. Sure, Mick. And so we just brought it down a little bit really on those factors that I spoke about. With the AirSense and Air Solutions as a whole platform, if you recall, we did elect to put the built-in comms and reinvest some sort of typical savings that we make on platforms back into the platform. I think that's really created quite -- along with whole ecosystem, I think very compelling value prop in the marketplace.","So we've done that and we do obviously run cost-out programs and so on, but just in the short-term we've really been focused on ratcheting up supplies to really make demand. So this probably puts a little bit further back in terms of some of these cost-out programs, which will certainly run. But that might be quite short-term, until we catch up with demand properly, and then we can start running those, and start optimizing the factory on efficiencies and so on, rather than just supply. So I think in the longer-term, I'm talking a lot, but after a few quarters, I think we've got some good opportunities to drive some of the cost out the platform, as we did for S9.","Operator","The next question is from Sean Laaman with Morgan Stanley.","Sean Laaman","Just a question on mask in U.S., could you give us a bit of sense, please, Mick, on volume against price?","Michael Farrell","Yes, Sean, so actually I'm going to hand that question to Jim Hollingshead, who runs our Americas business. Volumes and price for masks.","Jim Hollingshead","Thanks, Mick. Sean, we're seeing good volume growth in masks. And as Mick said in prepared comments, the AirFit line is doing very well. It's being very well received across all three categories, and sequentially we continue to take share in all three categories.","I know we've talked about a change in pricing strategy that we had several months ago, and what we're going to see I think is we're against the tougher pricing comp right now, probably through our March quarter than we have been. So I think what we'll see is, with the volume growth we'll also see some improved results, as the pricing sort of cascade through.","I think its worth noting that there wasn't a cliff event in that. So what we did, when we changed our pricing strategy in the category, was we empowered our sales representatives to negotiate pricing on a customer-by-customer basis. And so I think we'll see that comparable in terms of ASP feather-in over the course of the second half of the year.","Operator","The next question is from David Low with Deutsche Bank.","David Low","Just sticking with that mask issue, I have worried for a while now that the mask re-supply business might slow down, as the number of masks to patients doesn't match needs. I'm just wondering whether you get any sense, as to what market growth has been like in the last quarter and even the last year across the mask end of all categories?","Michael Farrell","The line was quite soft. So for those who didn't hear the question, it was about mask re-supply and questions of volume really going over versus the sort of price, year-on-year price elements that Jim was talking about. Well, yes, as I said in the introductory remarks and as Jim just commented right now, actually our volume growth both on a year-on-year basis and on a sequential basis is pretty solid in masks.","And we actually have pretty good market share data, which we won't share here publicly, David, with regard to each of those categories nasal, pillows, full face, right. So with the N10, the P10 and the F10, we believe we talk incremental sequential volume share from Q1 to Q2, and the products are doing very well out in the market.","And to your broader question that the market segment of mask replenishment, it's actually growing quite well, not just within the U.S. market, which I think your question was related to, but also globally. And you saw that in our numbers.","One thing that we are working very carefully on is ensuring patients get access to great care. When they get great care, so the informatics systems are there to allow the doctors to interface with them through the Air Solutions platform, when they're engaging with their own therapy through myAir, which is a personalized app for patients, we find that adherence goes up.","The U-Sleep program we have running there drives adherence up by up to 10 percentage points, and that drives ongoing adherence and use. So we feel quite confident going forward that volume mask growth will be there. And as we get into more stable pricing environments that you'll start to see that come in through the revenue numbers. That's our long-term goal and that's what we're executing to.","David Low","And just one quick follow-up. Market growth rates, I mean clearly we've went through competitive bidding. I presume things have stabilized. Do you have any sense as to whether or do you have a view as to where the market growth has picked up in the last quarter or two?","Michael Farrell","I think when you look at a global level, we've got pretty good set of mid-single digit market growth. Our goal is not to accept market growth, but to drive market growth. As you saw our numbers this quarter, we are ahead of that global market growth and that comes from our investments.","Brett talked about some of the investments in putting a CDMA chip in every device. That's an investment in driving a value proposition that is now allowing us to achieve very strong flow generator growth in our CPAP and APAP category. That's then going to happen in our bilevel category.","We make investments, as we talked about in China and India, by partnering with local governments and partnering to developed infrastructure and education of physicians to facilitate the growth of both sleep apnea and respiratory care opportunity. So we think that those market growth rates are not only sustainable, but we are expanding beyond them with our cardiorespiratory care, our SERVE-HF investment and others.","Operator","The next question is from Steve Wheen with JPMorgan.","Steve Wheen","Just a question for Brett, just on the gross margin guidance, there is obviously a few moving parts there. I wonder if you could just separate out what the currency-related effect on that gross margin shift down that you are expecting for the remainder of this calendar year?","Brett Sandercock","Going forward, Steve, if you look at currency impacts and it's so volatile at a moment, I'm kind of bit reticent than say anything. But if you looked at it right here now, whilst we're expecting a reasonable benefit maybe a quarter or two ago, that's really down, I think probably a positive benefit as little as 10 basis points going into Q3. And it will be a little better in Q4 and get a bit more of the Aussie coming through, because of that lag impact.","But the fairly small now, given how weak the euro has been. I mean we're still in pretty reasonable position, because the Aussie is essentially offsetting that weakness in the euro. But we are not getting as a pronounced benefit as we might have seen, if we were talking about this 36 months ago.","Steve Wheen","So the major driver of you downgrading, I guess, your expectations around gross margin, what would be the major driver there?","Michael Farrell","Look, the trends around geographic around product mix, I think if you looked at likely trends there, I think that's just enough that we feel that the margin might trend down a little, and we wanted to just bring that guidance down a little to account for that.","Operator","The next question is from David Clair with Piper Jaffray.","David Clair","My first question is on the flow generator number in the U.S. I'm just wondering if you can give us some more detail behind what drove the strength there. I mean are we seeing, is that Astral getting traction or it's just the new product launches in general? And then, you face another pretty easy comp next quarter, so should we think that I guess a result in this ballpark is achievable again next quarter?","Michael Farrell","Well, thanks, David. I'll take the first half of the question, and hand the second half to Rob. With the first half of where the growth came from in the quarter for the flow generators in the Americas, we launched both the AirSense 10 and the Astral to our U.S. sales force at the same time. It was at the Americas Sales Meeting in August, here in San Diego, and then the teams had to get out there and talk to their customers around the traps and get them up to speed.","For the AirSense 10, the value proposition was built-in. And as I talked about, it's not about the AirSense 10, it's about the Air Solutions Healthcare Informatics ecosystem. And it sounds like a whole bunch of buzz was, but when you drill it down, what it does is it save costs and it saves time, and it saves money for our homecare provider customers. And so patients gets more engaged in their therapy and physicians allows them to do management by exception and manage a whole portfolio of patients.","And so when you nail value propositions for three of your key constituents and they get it, you get a really quick ramp up. And now our U.S. sleep and respiratory distribution system is very good, second to none in the U.S. market. And so I think that's what drove the vast majority of the very successful sort of 25% year-on-year growth for the Americas in flow gens for the quarter.","Your question was, is it Astral? Astral, we are just developing the U.S. respiratory channel for life support ventilation. It's the first FDA 510(k) clearance we've had of a life support ventilator. And we've got a very strong Respiratory Account Manager or RAM team out there around the United States driving the message. But it will take some time for the homecare providers to test the product and get to like it and for the doctors to get used to, how it works, doing the settings at the RT, the respiratory therapist level and driving it.","So it's a much longer and deeper S-curve, but its impact in that first quarter was much less than the AirSense 10 and the Air Solutions platform. So that's the first half about the products. It's mostly AirSense 10 and much less Astral. Rob, do you want to take the thoughts for next quarter?","Robert Douglas","Yes, obviously, when I get specific about what's coming up on the quarters, but what we play is it the value proposition behind the AirSense 10 and the Air Solutions platform is quite solid. We're not resting on our laurels around that and our team is doing everything to promote it and convert our customers to it. Also, our in-house teams are still continually developing it, and we've got a lot of improvements, but again it come through in that system in the near-term future.","So our view is that this value proposition should keep being seen by the customer, and the results will then speak for themselves. Similarly, with Astral, it's still early days in that product, and we believe that it's performing very well and getting a great response and we think that should continue. So over the long-term those products are really going to keep contributing for us.","David Clair","And then any updates, where we are in terms of home sleep testing?","Michael Farrell","David, home sleep testing, are you talking globally or U.S. geography?","David Clair","U.S.?","Michael Farrell","U.S. So within the U.S. market, we have sort of two models. We have our own ResMed model and then we have a retrospective data analysis, where we look at both public data and some private data. The proprietary data that we get access to and those models provide a range, and so we based on those two models believe that anywhere 35% to 45%. When you take a trialing 12 months anywhere between 35% to 45% of the sleep diagnostic tests in the U.S. were done using home sleep testing. But it's growing everyday, it's growing every quarter.","And as broken out by geography and healthcare system type, if you take, I don't know, the northeast maybe Massachusetts and look at an area where you have a specialty benefits manager driving with a payer, a model, you can get areas where it's up to 75% or 80%-plus home sleep testing within that type of a system. And then you can get states in this out like Alabama, where there is a very strong push from the local physicians groups and it's only 5% of the tests within that geography.","And so you've got a big range and it's very hard to put a precise number on it. So the range is 35% to 45%. But we expect it to go up every quarter, because the payers are driving it in and pushing that forward. Our challenge in making it all happen is ensuring that we provide the right systems to both ways of getting diagnosis done.","So we have the ApneaLink Air platform, which is a cloud-connected home sleep testing system. That after the device is finished, the data go to the cloud, and you can see the doctor that day, and they have access to the information you got from that previous night. And we think that sort of efficiency in taking care of patients and helping doctors and helping the system work is very important for us.","We also have partner with sleep labs, and we have the VPAP TX titration system, which is basically a box that has all of our algorithms in one box. And the respiratory PSG technicians, the RPSGTs and the sleep physicians can operate and prescribe Adaptive-Servo Ventilation or bilevel ST or APAP out of that.","What we're seeing with that trend, as the home sleep testing of 35% to 45% increases to 40% to 50% and 45% to 55% overtime is that you get a mix shift in the devices that come out on the backend, so that you get more of a mix shifts from CPAP to APAP. So in our case, from our basic CPAPs up to our AutoSet type product.","Operator","The next question is from Saul Hadassin with Credit Suisse.","Saul Hadassin","Mick, just following up on that commentary around that mix shift. I'm just wondering, if you're able to give us a sense of how far you guys are progressed in moving to APAP versus fixed pressure and how much runway you see in terms of uplift to that number?","Michael Farrell","So, Saul, as you know we don't provide the details of the sort of split by product category code, but we do talk about trends. And so as you see that 35% to 45% go to 40% to 50% and 45% to 55%, you can think that the sort of a baseline of a minimum of one-to-one of what you get out of APAPs from that for new patient setups.","And then there is a halo effect, as physicians see the benefits of AutoSet that AutoSet has not only intra-night variability that it monitors breath-by-breath what's going on, it has inter-night variability that people might have more alcohol on a Friday or Saturday night or during flu season might have a high pressure needed to overcome apnea with inflamed upper airway or whatever. And so we are seeing a trend that's ahead of those numbers that you see in the home sleep testing one. But we are not going to break it exactly down for competitive reasons. But it's a positive trend, it has been and it will continue to be for quite a while in the future.","Saul Hadassin","And just to follow-up on the COPD space in U.S., can you give us some color around any easing of restrictions for patients accessing the VPAP for COPD? And just what you're seeing with demand and patient accessibility to that specific device?","Michael Farrell","I'll hand that question to Dave Pendarvis.","David Pendarvis","Yes, Saul, there has been a lot of talk about trying to ease the restrictions for device like a VPAP COPD, so that you can get it to the patients who really need it and it can be just as easy to prescribe as other devices. At the moment, those efforts haven't yielded fruit yet, but it's still an effort that we see that is underway and we'd be optimistic that that device will be more available in the future.","Obviously, it plays a good positioning in the marketplace and we've got our life support ventilation device in the U.S. that can fit other codes as well. So we feel like we're pretty well-positioned with an offering in each reimbursement category. And so that if those category shift one way or the other, we are positioned with the right device for the patients, gives them the right care, but we'll also fit the reimbursement category as the payers drive.","Operator","The next question is from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies.","Anthony Petrone","Maybe just to begin on the AirSense 10 and to drive into that a little bit. Can you give us a sense first on pricing and how the series compares to prior generations of flow generators, say, the S9? And then, Mick, you shared quite a bit on just the benefits for DME customers and driving essentially savings and efficiency for their businesses. Can you maybe elaborate a little bit and maybe quantify how an AirSense 10 is benefiting above and beyond, say, an S9?","Michael Farrell","Yes. I'll hand that question to Jim, who runs our Americas. I might follow-up after.","Jim Hollingshead","So in terms of AirSense 10 and pricing, we're seeing that AirSense 10 pricing is actually holding up very well. The bulk of our growth in the quarter was with AirSense 10, and we think the value proposition is strong and the pricing has held up pretty strongly. In terms of efficiencies -- well, if I just say, the AirSense 10 as a flow gen, just as a product is an outstanding product.","When you layer on top of that what we called the health informatics ecosystem and then set a solution that ride on that platform, you're adding extra to just the decision on flow generate that's already a winning flow gen. The way it drives efficiencies for our customers is, as Mick was saying, it takes our cost.","For example, somebody has an AirSense 10 and they're using our U-Sleep platform, they are able to manage patients by exception, so they are managing patients based upon their compliance. They are automating to some extent, coaching for compliance. So that's both a revenue generator and a cost cutter.","And we published a study, it was actually a randomized control trial a few months ago, that showed that for one of our customers who actually ran an RCT in this space, they were able to increase compliance by 10 points off of the very high standard of care compliance rate from 70 to 80, but they were able to cut their labor cost to 59%.","And that's just one of the features in the solution and that's just the solution that's out now. There is a roadmap for solutions that are coming. So in addition to continue to provide just an outstanding product that's comfortable, quiet, easy to fit, easy to set up, we're providing solutions on top of that that are going to increase revenue and save cost for our customers.","Michael Farrell","The only thing I'd add on to that, Anthony, to what Jim said, which is really good comment, is as an addition for the ability to do remote assist, and so our HMEs can remotely, HME customers can remotely access their patients' devices over the web. So they can be on Air Solutions, on AirView specifically and interrogate the capability of a flow generator.","So if a patient says, look, I've got a problem and the humidifier is not working, they are able to go online and say, well, actually, look I just did an interrogation on machine and it looks like it is working, but I see the setting is at 70 degrees Fahrenheit. What's your thermostat set on at home? And they can say real-time, well, it's set of 72, and they can say, well, you know what, it's not going to heat if it's set at 70 and the thermostat is 72. Why don't I change that up to 74, and it will heat up tonight.","And that conversation, which is two minutes could have been a device driven into an HME. So the patient is upset. The DME sending it back to ResMed's tech service center, our team analyzing and saying no fault found, shipping it back, and then getting it back to the patient. All that inefficiency of the FedEx, the patient time, the RT time, our technician's time, it's all tax, it's all waste. We can eliminate that.","It's good for us, as ResMed, allows us to be more efficient. It's good for our customers, our HME providers be more efficient. And most important of all, it's good for the patient, who gets the care, they can stick to the care and they're not without it and they are not upset about it. So those two examples of taking labor cost out and reducing inefficiency in the supply chain are just some of the benefits, the early benefits we're seeing with Air Solutions.","Anthony Petrone","And real quick, just on buyback. Just an update there, where the program is and will you accelerate that, given where the gross margin outlook kind of is at this point and some of the FX headwinds?","Michael Farrell","Brett, you want to take that?","Brett Sandercock","I mean we've been reasonably consistent I think on the buyback, in some years we've buyback more than others. The baseline we look at is certainly to buyback enough to offset the dilution from any issues to employees in terms of equity. That's sort of probably around between 1 million and 1.5 million shares as a baseline. And then, typically we do a little more than that.","So we did 667,000 shares this quarter. We will certainly continue to buyback stock and it will just depend on kind of what's happening, and we'll have a baseline that we'll buyback and then kind of somewhat opportunistically a little bit after that, I guess.","Operator","And the next question is from Ian Abbott with Goldman Sachs.","Ian Abbott","My first question is just around competitive bidding around three. Just wondering if you could perhaps give your view on how big an event it is for the industry relative to see V2?","Michael Farrell","I will hand that question to Dave Pendarvis.","David Pendarvis","From our perspective in the sleep space and the respiratory space, so sort of excluding oxygen importantly, it's about 30% or so of the Medicare patients who are remaining. So you size the thing on an overall basis, think of the U.S. being 50% of our business and think of Medicare patients who are in the U.S. being roughly 20% to 25% of that.","And then you've got of that Medicare population roughly 30% or so remaining in CV3. I think some of the estimates that are out there have broader product offerings from DMEs, including oxygen and other things would be greater than 30%, but from our patient perspective that's how we would size it up.","Obviously, the rules that are out there are showing that it's going to phase-in in January 2016 with sort of a blend of half-and-half of the existing rates and half of the average rates from the other regions, and then that phases into a full average once you get to July 1, 2016. So that's where we see it going. There's not a lot of mystery about that.","At this point, obviously we work with our customers and our customers have discussions with CMS all the time about, whether they can improve on that and do more in the rural areas, et cetera, for the few details that are left. But from a sizing perspective, it's relatively small size of our overall global business.","Ian Abbott","If I could ask Brett a question, just I'm not sure if I might have missed it, but just touching on the contingent consideration write-back, can you perhaps expand on that?","Brett Sandercock","Yes, sure. That was in our SG&A, and that was release that we did 12 months ago and that was just impacting the comparable for this year. Something we did at this time last year.","Operator","The next question is from Craig Collie with Macquarie.","Craig Collie","A couple of questions from me. The first on the strong flow gen numbers. So any chance of, I guess, splitting that out between what you think are new patients to I guess sleep therapy, and what the remaining portion, in terms of existing patients, upgrading the old flow generators?","Michael Farrell","Good question, Craig. I'm going to hand that to Jim Hollingshead.","JimHollingshead","It's a great question, Craig. We're not going to guide on that. If we had the data -- we don't have clear data on that to begin with, but if we did we probably wouldn't guide on it.","Craig Collie","Second question on bundling, any updates on whether the pilot started and I guess any detail around that?","David Pendarvis","We don't have a lot of details yet on what that pilot would include other than it's suppose to be six markets on sort of the control arm, if you will, and six markets on the bundled arm. But CMS hasn't come out with the details on that. They were suppose to be able to start anywhere in 2015, and there has been no start and no announcement of when it will start.","Obviously, they can delay it or start it whenever they like, but you'd expect them to give the market a good notice. So we're waiting to get the details on what that might look like, but we're prepared to support our customers anyway we might need to.","Craig Collie","And you remain relatively relaxed about that, I guess, given that the fact it's going to be appearing to be no minimum supply requirements?","David Pendarvis","Actually, Craig, we don't know that. We don't know if there will be no requirements or if required two masks a year or one mask a year or how many filters and how many tubing. We actually know nothing about. They haven't given any details. As you know, Craig, we operate in a 100 countries and we operate in many different environments, including where there bundle payments and whether or not.","And we sell in some markets through pharmacies, in some markets we work with otherwise to get direct to patients. And what we've found is that in the markets, where bundling has happened we partner with our homecare providers and we've been able to ensure that not only are the homecare provider is taken care of, but really importantly that the patients are able to get access to masks and accessories.","And the person that really wants this new mask is a person that's putting it on every night. And if it's difficult in the reimbursement environment to get it, particularly in the U.S., with increasing high deductible health plans and health savings accounts, we're finding a lot of people who are going online to get those types of devices. And so we think that a lot of HME providers, they are establishing those sort of online networks, and we are partnering with them in many different countries in the world.","And the good news about the government is it will take a while. They will have to do the pilots and they'll have to get feedback from their constituents, because these are the Medicare beneficiaries, and it will take some time for them to ramp up. It will give us time and Jim's team time to partner with the U.S. homecare providers.","And what we'll do is get global earning from Germany and France and many other countries, where we operate in that environment, and make sure that the homecare providers, the patients and the healthcare system is properly taken care of. And we think that can be done quite efficiently.","Operator","The next question is from Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.","Joanne Wuensch","Well, I have a couple of questions. You sounded more optimistic on M&A on this call than you have at any other stage. Is there something that has changed for you?","Michael Farrell","No, Joanne. I just think that as you talk about capital management, you have to talk about the three arms of it. One arm is making sure that we continue the share buyback, as Brett talked about, it's opportunistic, but it's steady. The second arm is obviously our dividends, which we've established a number of years ago and have increased most years, and we announced another $0.28 today from the board.","And the third arm is M&A. And I just wanted to make it clear that with $400 million of net cash and access to over $700 million through a syndicate loan facility that we declared recently, we have the dry powder to do that. There is nothing eminent on the radar screen that we can talk about or that's there right now that we should talk about.","Joanne Wuensch","And one of the things that you said, if I heard you correctly, was that there was some M&A or some acquisition revenue in the quarter. I don't remember seeing a press release regarding that. Could you remind me what it was? And what that revenue might've been in terms of dollars?","Michael Farrell","Yes. Thanks Joanne. They are pretty small, and I'll hand that to Rob Douglas to talk about any M&A in the last six to 12 months.","Robert Douglas","Yes, sure. So Joanne, we had previously talked about some small acquisitions of some Australian distributors that we've made over the last few quarters and it also included a small one in New Zealand. But what's happening in those markets is they are unique different markets. And it's quite unusual particularly in Australia, where there is strong reimbursement for getting diagnosed with sleep apnea, but little contribution from government or any public systems even towards any of the treatment.","And so it's a unique market, quite differently structured, and we thought that we could help really develop the market there and drive awareness, if we're a little bit closer to some of their customers and patients. So we're just really trying a marketing experiment in those countries and we'll let you know the results, as they become relevant.","Joanne Wuensch","The emails that I am getting so far are questions and you can hear it throughout this whole call about your flow generators. And it's going in two directions. One, wow, can they do 20-something percent next quarter? And two, doesn't masks and accessories follow a strong flow placement? So how would you respond to that?","Michael Farrell","Well, Joanne, as you know, we don't give guidance on a revenue basis and we don't give guidance on the category basis around flow generators. So look, we do think it was an excellent performance clearly from both our Americas team and our Europe and our Asia-Pacific team on the flow generator category, but that's the result of three to five years of amazing product development work from engineering teams in Munich, Singapore, Sydney, San Diego and Halifax. And so that great level of biomedical engineering, software engineering has created a value proposition that the marketplace is finding compelling.","And we were surprised at how successful it was in that first quarter, because we thought it would take some time to walk through. Some of these savings take time for the provider and take time for the patient to get, it did come out of the gate strong, and we do think there is a long runway. The value propositions that payback over many, many, not just quarters, but years for our customers and our patients and our homecare providers and suppliers. So we think it goes pretty well along that front. I don't know, if anyone else has got anything to add to that. Jim?","Jim Hollingshead","I think it's actually pretty simple, which is, we are taking share in masks sequentially, we're taking share in flow gen faster, even faster.","Operator","We are now at the one hour mark. So I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.","End of Q&A","Michael Farrell","Great. Thanks, Ellen. In closing, I'd like to thank the more than 4,000 strong ResMed team from around the world for their contribution to our recent product launches and for their continued commitment to our long-term goals. We remain focused on changing the lives of literally millions of patients with every breath, and we remain inspired by our long-term aspiration of changing 20 million lives by 2020. Thanks for you time today. And we'll talk to you again in 90 days.","Agnes Lee","This concludes our second quarter earnings live webcast.

My name is Tim, and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to David Pendarvis, Chief Administration Officer and Global General Counsel. David, you may begin.","David Pendarvis - ResMed, Inc.","Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon and good morning. Thank you for attending ResMed's earnings call for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 ending March 31st. Joining us on the call today are Mick Farrell, our CEO; and Brett Sandercock, our CFO; Rob Douglas, our President and Chief Operating Officer will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call.","In addition to the financial information presented on today's call, we encourage investors to review our earnings presentation, our earnings press release and our Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2018. These documents will be available on our Investor Relations website at investor.resmed.com (sic) [investors.resmed.com] (00:01:07). A replay and a transcript of today's call will also be made available at that location shortly after this call.","Now on today's call, we'll discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. The descriptions and reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures are available in our earnings release and will also be in our SEC filings. Our discussion today may also include forward-looking statements, such as expectations for ResMed's future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions but of course actual results may differ materially. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in our SEC filings.","I'll now hand the call over to Mick Farrell.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks, Dave, and thank you to all of our shareholders who are joining us today as we review the financial results for the third quarter of our fiscal year 2018. For the call today, I'll review top level financial results, business highlights and key announcements this quarter. Then I'll hand the call over to Brett Sandercock who'll walk you through our financial results in more detail.","So first, our top level financial results. I'm really grateful to our global team for another quarter of very strong performance. We achieved double-digit revenue growth, 15% headline growth and 10% constant currency growth, led by sales in Europe and Asia; and then those combined regions we grew at 16%, 1-6, 16% in constant currency. Revenue in the U.S., Canada, and Latin America grew 7% overall in line with market growth.","At the bottom line, we are continuing to drive operating leverage as we did in Q2. Adjusted net operating profit in Q3 grew 25% year-over-year which was an excellent result and the outcome of our global teams' hard work and operating excellence. This translated to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.92. We are proud of this strong top line and bottom line performance from our global ResMed team.","Now some business highlights, and let's start with Brightree. Growth in our Brightree software-as-a-service business continues to be strong at 14% year-on-year. The Brightree team has been part of the ResMed Group for two full years and there's a stable record of success. To show Brightree's scale, here is an interesting metric. In the last 12 months, Brightree systems handled more than 8.2 billion digital requests. By quickly and accurately responding to these cloud-based requests, Brightree helps its users reach more patients more efficiently, more effectively and more economically.","In terms of next steps, Brightree is beta-testing with select customers an exciting, new analytics platform using data from algorithms that will generate actionable insights for customers to improve their business effectiveness and their patient care. We look forward to Brightree bringing value to customers with this new data analytics offering in the very near future.","For the longer term, we are very pleased to continue to have Raj Sodhi, the President of our Software-as-a-Service business focus not only on Brightree but also on new growth opportunities in the global out-of-hospital software market. Raj and his team are working to enable an ecosystem of connected software and human services to create a frictionless network for data and information to move across the healthcare value chain, so that as people progress through their personal healthcare journey, their medical data can seamlessly follow them.","Brightree solutions were featured in the interoperability showcase at HIMSS that stands for the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society Conference. Brightree's participation in these demonstrations at HIMSS with over 7,000 visitors touring the interoperability showcase is just one example of our ResMed and Brightree commitment to connecting the post-acute care industry and patients to the rest of their care settings across that digital healthcare ecosystem. The response from current customers, prospects, and industry stakeholders at HIMSS has been very positive. We will continue to showcase the power of an interconnected out-of-hospital software platform to the rest of the industry.","Turning to our core sleep apnea and COPD businesses. We continue to pioneer new horizons in those core businesses with digital health. We passed some very significant milestones during the quarter that I think were worth noting. Our cloud-based patient management system called AirView now supports over 5 million 100% cloud-connected medical devices across the globe. More than 7 million patients are included in the AirView system for their AirSense 10, AirCurve 10, AirMini, S9, Lumis, Stellar and Astral device platforms.","We are proud of the extent to which this market-leading system has been adopted around the world but we want to be clear that we recognize that this is just mile one of our digital healthcare marathon. All these digital health nodes connecting every day have produced an incredible resource. We now have over two billion nights of medical sleep and COPD therapy data in the cloud. I'll talk a little later about how we are turning this big data or big clinical data into actionable information for our customers and the ultimate customer, the patient.","Our connected health strategy received another boost this quarter when Japan announced a revised reimbursement system that allows physicians to be paid for remote telemonitoring of CPAP patients. Japanese guidelines already require that doctors meet at least once every 90 days with CPAP uses. The new guidelines, effective April 1, have allowed remote telemonitoring to substitute for face-to-face meetings up to two times per quarter. This new system will allow busy physicians and patients as their patient pool grows to continue to receive excellent patient care without having to meet as frequently in person.","In anticipation of increasing demand for telemonitoring capability, our Japanese customers have stepped up their adoption of the AirView platform and AirSense 10 devices, our 100% cloud-connected sleep apnea therapeutic devices. This was a factor in some of our very strong sales in Japan during Q3. We are confident that in the future, this will make it easier for patients who are not treated today to begin and remain on CPAP therapy, happy and healthy at home.","Today, now, three of our largest sleep apnea therapy geographies, the U.S., France and now Japan all have systems that incentivize the adoption of our market-leading connected health solutions that includes AirSense 10, AirCurve 10, AirView and myAir. During Q3, the French market continued to benefit from its own telemonitoring reimbursement incentives where there's a differential between telemonitored and non-telemonitored sleep apnea therapeutic devices. France and Japan, combined with good execution in a number of other countries worldwide, have contributed to very strong growth of device revenue across Europe and Asia during Q3. This category grew 18% year-over-year in constant currency across those regions.","Our U.S., Canada, and Latin America device business was in line with market growth this quarter, growing at 6% year-over-year. We continue to see very good adoption of our connected healthcare solutions in these markets by customers and patients and we continue to improve our offerings. We just announced that our patient engagement app called myAir, and that's for all of our Air 10 devices, is now available on Android-based phones. We're happy to now offer the same high quality in-app experience to all patients with myAir whether they use iOS from Apple or Android from Google, they can all use in-app care now, not the web-based care. The most important differentiator here at ResMed from our competitors is our people. Our passion, our skills and our dedication to changing lives with every breath. We were thrilled this quarter to announce the appointment of Bobby Ghoshal as our new Chief Technology Officer. This appointment enhances our management bench strength as we continue to build our leadership in connected health.","Bobby has over 25 years of experience as a Technology Engineer and a Technology Executive at Wipro, Motorola, Freescale and most recently at Brightree. He has both the technical expertise as well as the cultural fit with ResMed to help us take our healthcare informatics leadership and data analytics solutions along with Dana DiFernandino (sic) [Dana DiFerdinando] and her team to the next level. We will continue to work with payers across the globe on a number of initiatives in this space and also regarding reimbursement and market access.","Two recent wins are worth noting. First, France announced that beginning April 1, reimbursement for mandibular repositioning devices, so the dental devices that we sell to treat sleep apnea, would increase by 35%. Our product, the Narval MRD is a device that leads the market in France, and we will continue to drive MRD sales in France and other geographies where that category can be just as successful. Second, South Korea will soon begin reimbursing diagnosis and therapeutic treatment for sleep apnea. This is a great opportunity for us to help the many, many millions of South Koreans who need our solutions.","On the masks and accessories side of our business in Q3, we saw solid global constant currency growth of 9%. This was led by Europe and Asia markets, which grew 13% in constant currency in the masks categories. We are seeing good traction with our AirFit F20 and our AirFit N20 products in these regions. We're also encouraged by the success of our AirFit N20 Classic. The N20 Classic combines the comfort and seal of our InfinitySeal cushion used across our AirFit series with an adaptive forehead support for stability and to adjust the mask tension to movement. The N20 Classic is performing well in the very specific countries we are targeting and validates our approach to find unique solutions for different geographies around the world in over 120 countries that we do business in.","The U.S., Canada, and Latin America teams achieved solid revenue growth of 8% in our masks and accessories category, which is in line with market growth. We saw a continued preference for the AirFit F20 and the AirFit N20 masks by patients, physicians and our channel partners. To help catalyze even better growth as we look forward, we are excited to be launching excited to be launching a technology upgrade onto the F20 and to the N20 platforms. At Medtrade, we demonstrated the new ResMed QuietAir diffuser technology, which results in masks that are 89% quieter and that have 70% more diffused airflow.","What does this mean? Well, with this technology, our full face masks noise level are down to 21 dBA, which is well below ambient noise in the bedroom. With ResMed's new QuietAir technology, we are providing patients and their bed partners with a peace and quiet they deserve for better sleep. We think patients particularly, as well as providers and physicians, will adopt QuietAir technology very rapidly, so watch this space.","Now for some business highlights of our operating excellence initiatives across ResMed. We are pleased this quarter to be able to continue to show our delivery in operating leverage to improve our bottom line. We grew non-GAAP income from operations by 25% in the quarter. We combined solid revenue growth and stable margins with disciplined growth in SG&A which grew at just 3% in constant currency and research and development which grew at just 4% in constant currency.","I want to emphasize that our operating excellence initiatives are about the long term and they're about working more efficiently. They're about being more focused on eliminating waste and they're about working smarter.","Let's look at a quick case study here of our medical affairs team and their operating excellence initiatives here at ResMed. The medical affairs team led by Dr. Carlos Nunez, our Chief Medical Officer, has adjusted its balance between traditional, randomized placebo-controlled trials and new big data, clinical data-based trials, analyzing real world digital databases. Carlos has assembled a global team of key opinion leaders within ResMed and beyond to ask tough clinical questions and investigate them, leveraging the 2 billion nights of medical sleep and COPD data in their view. These efforts are starting bear fruit. Our medical affairs team is pending less money, reducing the time to complete the studies and increasing the number of top-quality clinical studies that they are completing and pushing through the publication. The peer review process and top medical journals have accepted that these data-driven studies are important and worthy of publication. In short, ResMed is not only a pioneer in digital health, we are now pioneers in digital health research, all with the cause of better patient outcomes.","In one example, in this space, in the last 12 months, our team prepared a study looking at over 128,000 patient records. The analytical process took a few months and produced positive results and was accepted into a top-tier industry journal, The Journal of Sleep Medicine and the results were impressive, showing our patient engagement tools drive adherence to our CPAP therapy, significantly higher than typical adherence to a pharmaceutical pill.","We continue to do other big data studies and we are excited that several abstracts have been accepted for presentation in just next month, a couple of weeks actually, at the upcoming annual meeting of the American Thoracic Society right here in San Diego, California. You'll hear more about these studies when they are presented, so watch this space.","Finally, some business highlights from our product development teams. Our amazing product development teams continue to deliver meaningful product innovation. As I mentioned earlier, we are launching brand new QuietAir technology to our AirFit range, starting with the F20 full face mask, and our mask pipeline after that is full.","As we speak, we are in the process of commencing a controlled product launch of Mobi, our first ResMed branded portable oxygen concentrator. Mobi helps people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD and others who require oxygen therapy to live life with fewer restrictions. Mobi's great balance of battery life, weight, and oxygen delivery provides patients with the freedom to continue therapy while being mobile and active which is what their doctors want, whether it's just around the neighborhood or across the country or across the globe. This control product launch is the start of our ResMed branded journey in the portable oxygen concentrator market.","In the U.S., only around 8% of those people who are eligible to receive a portable oxygen concentrator have such a device. We think that's wrong and it's an unmet need and ResMed can help fulfill it. It's also part of our long-term mission to change lives in COPD. There are hundreds of millions of people around the world with this debilitating disease. Our goal is to give them better quality of life to reduce the cost of care and to help them keep happy and well at home and on the go.","Finally, we are in the process of launching a new smartphone app-based sleep apnea screening technology in China. We call this technology sleep cue (00:19:56). Sleep cue (00:19:59) uses a very inexpensive lightweight tube combined with smartphone software technology to detect sleep disturbances that suggest a person may be at risk for sleep apnea. This very affordable and very easy to use solution will give our China team another tool to reach the many, many tens of maybe hundreds of millions of undiagnosed sleep apnea sufferers in China. We will continue to keep you updated as this technology is launched by our ResMed and Curative teams across Greater China.","Three quarters now through our fiscal year, we have achieved solid revenue growth and stronger operating profit growth. Our connected health strategy continues to play out across multiple markets with our digital health ecosystem now including over 2 billion nights of medical sleep apnea and COPD data. We have seen success with new and upgraded masks and devices and software solutions including the N20, the F20, AirTouch, the AirMini and upgraded myAir. We look forward to early results from our first ResMed branded portable oxygen concentrator, the Mobi, as we move forward in the coming quarters and fiscal years. We have a robust pipeline of innovation for the future as well. Most importantly, we have a talented and motivated ResMed team serving patients in over 120 countries.","We are positioning the company for long-term top and bottom-line growth for 2020 and beyond as we execute our strategy and lead the med tech field to create value with digital health solutions.","We continue to be laser focused on our goals of slowing chronic disease progression reducing overall healthcare system costs and most importantly improving outcomes and quality of life for our ultimate customers, patients.","With that, I will turn the call over to Brett for his remarks and then we'll go over to Q&A. Brett?","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I'll provide an overview of our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018. As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the March quarter was $591.6 million, an increase of 15% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 10%.","Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Brightree Software-as-a-Service business, our sales in U.S., Canada, and Latin American countries were $317.5 million, an increase of 7% over the prior-year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $234.2 million, an increase of 29% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales in combined Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 16% over the prior-year quarter.","Breaking out revenue between product segments, U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $168.1 million, an increase of 6% over the prior-year quarter. Masks and other sales were $149.4 million, an increase 8% over the prior-year quarter. For revenue in Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales were $160.1 million, an increase of 31% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 18%.","Mask and other sales were $74.1 million, an increase of 25% over the prior-year quarter or in constant currency terms, a 13% increase. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 11%, while masks and other increased by 9% over the prior-year quarter. Brightree revenue for the third quarter was $39.9 million, an increase of 14% over of the prior-year quarter.","During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles, restructuring expenses and tax-related charges associated with the recently enacted U.S. tax reform. In the prior year comparable, they exclude amortization of acquired intangibles and restructuring expenses.","We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our third quarter earnings press release.","Our gross margin for the March quarter was 58.2% compared to 58.3% during the same quarter in the prior year. Our margin was essentially consistent with the prior year and reflects typical declines in average selling prices largely offset by manufacturing and procurement efficiencies. Assuming current exchange rates and likely change in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margin for Q4 to be broadly consistent with our Q3 FY 2018 gross margin.","Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $147.9 million, an increase of 7% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 3%. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of revenue, improved to 25% compared to the 26.8% we reported in Q3 last year. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A, as a percentage of revenue, to be in the vicinity of 25% for Q4.","R&D expenses for the quarter were $37.4 million, an increase of 7% over the prior-year quarter, or in a constant currency basis, an increase of 4%. This increase reflects incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.3% compared with 6.8% in the prior-year. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses, as a percentage of revenue, to be in the range of 6% to 7% for Q4.","Amortization of acquired intangibles was $11.7 million for the quarter, an increase of 3% over the prior-year quarter. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $12 million.","Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $159 million, an increase of 25% over the prior-year quarter, while non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $132.5 million, an increase of 32% over the prior-year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.92, an increase of 30% of over the prior-year quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.76. Foreign exchange movements positively impacted third quarter earnings by approximately $0.04 per share, reflecting the favorable impacts from the stronger euro relative to the U.S. dollar, which were partially offset by the stronger Australian dollar.","During the quarter, we recognized restructure expenses of $10.9 million associated with the strategic global workforce planning review. Associated with this review, we also expect to record an additional restructuring charge of approximately $7 million during Q4 FY 2018. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the March quarter was 15.4%.","As discussed during the previous quarter, we had recorded additional income tax expense of $126.6 million relating to the newly enacted U.S. tax laws as submitted under the SEC guidance if calculation is provisional until December 22, 2018 a year after the enactment of the rule. Based on recent IRS guidance on the new law, we continue to refine our calculations which resulted in additional income tax expense of $5.6 million being recorded in our third quarter results. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the one-time charge I just discussed, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 13.2%. We estimate that our non-GAAP effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 will be in the range of 13% to 15%.","Turning to fiscal year 2019, we continue to estimate that our fiscal year 2019 effective tax rate will be in the range of 21% to 23%. As we discussed last quarter, this rate reflects both the anticipated unfavorable impact of prospective Australian tax legislation and the favorable impact of the recent U.S. tax law changes.","Now, I would like to update you on the Australian Taxation Office order that is described in our Q3 press release and our previous SEC filings. At the end of the quarter, we received notices of amended assessments from the Australian Taxation Office for the years 2009 to 2013. Based on these assessments, the ATO is asserting that ResMed owes a total $151.7 million in additional income tax and $38.4 million in accrued interest. Essentially, this is a transfer pricing dispute around the jurisdictional split of certain activities and the tax on related income.","We do not agree with the ATO's decision on the issues raised in the audit. We intend to pursue administrative and legal steps to defend our position and we continue to believe we will be successful in defending our position. As a normal convention, we have agreed with the ATO to pay 50% of the Amended Tax Assessments, pending resolution of the dispute. We have recorded this is a liability in the current quarter. However, we have also recognized an offsetting asset relating to these amounts and have not recognized any additional tax expense in relation to these assessments.","It is important to note that irrespective of the outcome of the tax dispute, we do not expect it to materially change our underlying effective tax rate guidance for fiscal year 2019 and beyond. Ultimately, if we do not prevail in this dispute, there would be a significant one-time tax expense and interest charge recorded at that time.","Finally, on tax-related matters, I am pleased to advise, earlier this month, we agreed with the Singapore Economic Development Board to extend our investment and tax incentive programs through to the year 2030. While actual incentives are confidential but broadly consistent with our original agreement which was due to expire in 2020.","Moving on from tax-related matters. Cash flow from operations during the third quarter was $149.1 million, reflecting strong underlying earnings and improved working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $13 million. Depreciation and amortization for the March quarter totaled $29.3 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $50 million.","Our board of directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share. We also continued to have share buyback during the quarter and repurchased 200,000 shares for consideration of $19.4 million. Subsequent to quarter end, we entered into a new syndicated debt facility that provides for an $800 million five-year revolving facility with an uncommitted option to increase the facility for an additional $300 million. Furthermore, we also entered into a $200 million five-year term loan. The term loan funds were used to repay a portion of the outstanding balance of the credit facility.","We continue to progressively repatriate cash back to the U.S. enabling us to more effectively utilize our strong global cash flows. At March 31, we had $800 million gross debt and $106 million in net debt. Our balance sheet remained strong with relatively modest debt levels. At March 31, total assets were $3.5 billion and net equity was $2.1 billion.","And with that, I'll hand the call back to David.","David Pendarvis - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks, Brett. We'll now turn to Q&A. We ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions after that, please get back in the queue. Tim, we're now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets is on the line with a question.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good afternoon (00:33:08), everybody. How are you?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Well, Joanne. How are you?","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","We are doing A-okay here in New York. Finally, sunny. When I take a look at your devices and your masks and accessories, your international growth is particularly strong. Is there anything that you can comment on as it relates to that?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. Joanne, by the way, it's sunny in San Diego as well. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we did have some items that were extraordinary, the change in reimbursement in Japan of giving physicians the opportunity to get reimbursed for telemonitoring visits, which they frankly need as they're getting overloaded with the in-person visits every 90 days with larger and larger growing sleep apnea patient populations meant that there was physician demand for telemonitoring capabilities which meant that our customers, the large home care companies in Japan, have certainly, in the last quarter and will continue to, upgraded their fleets to be even more cloud-connected. And so that meant, if they're using S9s in their pool, they needed to move to AirSense10, 100% cloud connected medical devices. So there's some extraordinary growth there in Japan.","And as we also said last quarter and it continued this quarter, the reimbursement changes in France where there's a significant differential between the cloud-connected sleep apnea therapeutic device and a non-cloud connected sleep apnea therapeutic device in terms of reimbursement because the French government has seen that they get higher adherence through the coaching and techniques like AirView on the cloud-connected devices, they have a differential reimbursement.","So I think those impacts in France and Japan are together moving beyond. And as you've been watching us the last two, three fiscal years, since we launched our AirView solution in the United States, we've seen some significant growth of that over the last two, three years and now in line growth in the U.S. So I think those are some of the factors that contributed to that, Joanne.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","That's very helpful. One of the things that Brightree brought to you was a very good platform in the United States. But my memory is that it was not as strong internationally. Can you discuss where that might be going and what your plans are there?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. So certainly, Brightree is \u2013 although globally resourced, you know, we have software teams in various countries around the world that support Brightree, that it's focused on a customer base which is home medical equipment, HME companies in the United States and that's still the core focus of Brightree. However, Raj Sodhi, who is the President of that global software-as-a-service business team is looking and growing both organically and potential inorganically that business over the period between now and 2020, the period between now and 2025 as we look forward in our strategy.","So, if you look back at a trailing 12 months, you've got 6%, 7% or so of our global revenues coming from software-as-a-service, the vast majority of that is Brightree, but we do have some other mask replenishment and other software-as-a-service revenue in there as well that will continue to grow and I think ahead of the ResMed Group within that software-as-a-service part into other geographies over time.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Terrific. Thank you so much.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks, Joanne.","Operator","David Low is on the line with JPMorgan.","David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.","Thanks very much. If we could just start with the restructuring charges, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more insight into what those charges relate to and what the expected benefit will be and I presume that we won't be seeing any more of that going into the new financial year.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. Look ...","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","You know, the...","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","...I'll give you the high level sort of strategic rationale and then hand to Brett for some of the details, David. The strategic rationale was, we're changing to a more and more, as I just related to Joanne's question, a more and more software-driven medical device company. And I'd say with $5 million, 100% cloud-connected medical devices, the world's leading cloud-connected and remote-monitoring med tech company. And so, we're changing our go-to-market model to be more software-driven, more software sales and changing our approach to that. And so that there's some structural changes and others associated with that. It's really around Q3 and Q4 as Brett talked to. But Brett, why don't I hand to you for any further detail on that?","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Sure. Thanks, Mick. Yeah. So, I mean, it very much was a strategic view and just looking at where we needed to invest in terms of our talent and growth areas. So we've looked long and hard at that, and the restructure is probably focused between 200 employees and 250 employees impacted through that restructure or reorganization. We've got -we took some charge in Q3 and we do on the U.S. GAAP, we'll take the kind of balance of that through into Q4, but our expectation is that we wouldn't see any sort of significant restructures into FY 2019.","David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.","Okay. Great. Now, that's helpful. Thank you. Look, the other question I had is the operating leverage has been phenomenal. The SG&A growth, R&D to a lesser degree growing much more slowly than the top line. Is that sustainable? I mean, should we be assuming that SG&A in particular will grow in the low-single digits and through that the operating leverage will continue on out into FY 2019 and beyond?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. David, I'd parse that out into two categories. I think in the SG&A side, we'd like to see that grow well less than half our revenue growth. You saw a 10% constant currency revenue growth in the quarter. We want to keep our SG&A growth below that, well below that.","On the R&D front, there's different investments that we make in different parts of the business, the software side and in the device side. And I would probably say that we're going to look to keep our R&D as a percentage of revenue in the vicinity of that sort of 6% to 7% range. And sort of \u2013 so therefore, it might grow closer to \u2013 if we're keeping at 7%, let's say, of our revenues then it's going to grow closer to our revenue line. So operating leverage I think in SG&A and keeping that growth under control. And actually, we're just working smarter as I said in the prep remarks and finding systems and capabilities to solve problems and thinking more digitally and scalably about how our team approaches problems. Rather than just looking to hire more people, we can look to hire smarter systems and engage smarter systems so that our team can be more engaged on more strategic issues. That's sort of how we're looking at it, David.","David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.","All right. That's very helpful. Thanks very much.","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks, David.","Operator","Margaret Kaczor with William Blair is on the line with the question.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. First one from me is, just a little bit more clarity on France and Japan in terms of penetration of cloud-connected devices, and really a sense of can this be a multiyear benefit, certainly in these two countries and then beyond that, where you guys can continue to grow at this double-digit range above the market internationally.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. Look, I think, I'll have a first go of that and then hand it over to Rob to look at it. But, look, these are big changes, Margaret, that have happened and they didn't happen overnight. Our market access team has been working in France with the French ministry for health for the last 5 years to 10 years to talk about telemonitoring and certainly showing the benefits that we've seen in the U.S. And with our Japanese team, similarly, market access teams working with customers in the Japanese ministry for health to show these benefits. So, these have been multiyear campaigns of working on market access to demonstrate that cloud-connected devices have better adherence, they are better for the healthcare system, they save costs for hospitalizations. So there will be multiyear benefits.","But Rob, do you want to provide some more detail as to sort of that S curve, if you like, of penetration of the actual devices that Margaret is sort of asking about?","Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.","Sure. Thanks, Mick. We're very impressed with the rate at which our U.S. customers understood the value proposition of connected care. And as Mick said, we've had multiyear campaigns to make those value propositions in other markets. We believe the value proposition actually is there in every market that we're in and then what the reimbursement structure is and how that works, but it does take time to run these programs and develop it. The French one, as Mick said, it's been the result of many, many years of work and really changing the trajectory of connected care and how it works. Now, the value of the connected care, as our data have shown, is that more people stay on treatment.","And so long-term, there's a greater pool of patients in the environment that need to stay \u2013 cared for, they need to stay on mask, and that really is building on benefit that lasts long term in these markets. And we have seen that in the U.S. as well and we'd expect to see that benefit of making this treatment of sleep apnea in the home a much more accountable and transparent treatment to everyone involved in the system, keeps more patients on treatment and we'll keep growing it.","We've got a long list of other markets that we're focusing on and we look forward to reporting our changes in reimbursement programs or major progress as it happens in the future.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got it. Very helpful. And then as a follow-up to the top line growth, you guys really mentioned multiple new product initiatives and a very full product pipeline whether that's on the mask side, Brightree otherwise. Is there a cadence of product launches that you guys look at per year, is it a couple, is it more than that? And what kind of makes you guys pull the trigger on one product versus another? Thanks.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. Margaret, that's a great question. Yeah. We have a very full pipeline and our goal is to bring a cadence of very innovative products and appropriate timing that the customers want them, not faster than patients need the next generation and not slower than customers need them. And I don't know, if you talk to any sleep apnea patient worldwide and say, would you like your product smaller, quieter, more comfortable, more connected. They always say yes. So we know there's demand there and we really are trying to make sure that that cadence is regular and strong and not too fast because patients aren't ready necessarily to switch masks or to switch software technologies too fast, but it's fast enough to make sure that the innovation is there and can have, for the company, good, sustainable long-term growth, but for the patients ensure that we're making it smaller, quieter and more comfortable and more connected every time.","A good example is the N20 Classic for this quarter. A product that's not quite as sexy maybe as myAir, but a needed product for some of those markets in Europe and in Asia and we brought that product to market for those categories in that basic nasal category mask and it's been very successful.","On the other end of the spectrum, we got our first ResMed branded portable oxygen concentrator on controlled product launch here in the U.S. and we're really excited to see how those business models go as we partner with home medical equipment companies to reach the 92% of people who should have an oxygen concentrator in this country and don't. And then when we get it right, we'll scale that to the other 119 countries we do business in.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","All right. Thanks, guys.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks, Margaret.","Operator","Sean Laaman with Morgan Stanley is on the line with a question.","Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.","Thank you. Good morning, Mick. I have a couple of questions on Brightree, is it \u2013 another good number. I don't know if you could help us frame perhaps the contribution from subscription pricing and maybe throw some comments on adoption rates for Brightree?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. Look, Brightree has been part of our group for two years and has grown pretty well in double-digit range during that time and there are many, many HMEs across the country who use Brightree and there are many who don't yet use Brightree and that we need to get on the Brightree platform. It provides such efficiency in prescription management, in inventory management, in delivery of product and monitoring of patients and resupply of patients that we think the value proposition is there for the large chunk of the market that doesn't yet have Brightree.","We do have the lead in software-as-a-service in the home medical equipment side and we plan to continue that. So I'd say there's a lot of road ahead but some steady growth. I mean, look, there is consolidation in the home medical equipment space. If you go back prior to competitive bidding, there were maybe 6,000, 7,000 home medical equipment companies, maybe now there are 3,500 or 3,000 or so. But Brightree works on a per user per month approach and we think that it has some good growth ahead. And we'll continue to invest to make sure that our software-as-a-service value proposition not only meets and beats the competition but looks around corners to see where those customers will need their next innovation from. And in addition to that, we're looking to add on capabilities, as I said, in other geographies around the world where out-of-hospital software is not limited to the U.S. geography.","Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.","Sure, sure. Thanks, Mick. And the other thing we're trying to understand about Brightree, it's not just about CPAP. But I wonder if this is going to help, Brightree will assist the rollout of the Mobi, for example, I don't know if you can give us your thoughts on that.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Well. The rollout of the Mobi is going to be dependent upon the go-to-market strategy and the value proposition of that product within the space. So, look, as I said in the prep remarks, it's got a really good balance of that oxygen output, the battery life and the weight of the device versus the competition, so I think in the product side, it's going to do really well. And in the go-to-market models, we're really looking at partnering with our channel to make sure we can reach those patients, who need it and drive it forward. So, I would say it's more our relationships with our home medical equipment companies across the spectrum both the products we sell and CPAP, APAP, all the masks, bilevels and ventilators as much as our software platform.","So, it will add to our knowledge and capability in partnership with our channel. But I'd say it's more our partnership and the other portfolio of products is going to help us with Mobi.","Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.","Got it. Thank you, Mick. That's all I have.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks, Sean.","Operator","Craig Wong Pan is online with Deutsche Bank has a question.","Craig Wong Pan - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia)","I just want to touch on the U.S. market. I mean, fairly good growth there you said in line with markets, but I did note that it has slowed from the second quarter. So, from down from 12% down 6% to 8% now, could you just talk to the \u2013 put some growth there?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. Sure. The U.S. market \u2013 well, the global market, we say, is growing in that sort of mid to high-single digits. So, we definitely held share and in some categories, we took some share and some others we held or maybe lost a little in some of the masks. But basically, in in-line sales, I mean, if you think about our U.S. geography for the last 12 quarters, we've been ahead of market growth and you don't stay ahead of market growth forever and there are product cycles. But I think that we did very well in the U.S. market with the comparables and how we performed in the last 12 quarters to grow at 7% in the U.S., Canada, Latin America geographies.","And I've got to tell you, we think it's a sustainable growth. And as you add on technologies like QuietAir, which makes those masks 89% quieter and the customers don't have to add any more SKUs, it will roll into the same F20 and N20 SKUs they have and so the administration, the channels all up and running within N20, F20 with a huge patient benefit improvement and therefore lower return rates, higher adherence, better for the payer, better for the patient, better for the healthcare provider. I think that you're going to see some very sustainable and increased growth in the U.S. geography. But look, we've got a 29-year track record of doing pretty well in the U.S. geography and I think we will continue to do that as I look forward through not just Q4 but all of FY 2019.","Craig Wong Pan - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia)","Okay. And then just my follow-up question on QuietAir, I missed whether you talked about the timing release of that and then is that the main reason for sort of your expectation of 2019 being higher than the market growth?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. So we launched QuietAir technology at Medtrade, so that was during this last quarter and in Q3 at the trade show. But look, yeah, as you said, it's an S curve, a penetration as that technology rolls out in Q4 and throughout the fiscal year. And so we will see that start to roll through the customers in this quarter and I think when those demonstrations start to happen with the RTs, with the respiratory therapists and the people who do the setups and they get the demo where this thing is lower than 21 dBA, I mean that's quieter than the air conditioning in your office right now, it's quieter than however quiet you get to your home, it's quieter than that, that ambient noise. And so it's basically getting down to stretching the envelope of new silence. So we're really excited about the technology and I think we will watch and see how it goes, certainly the initial patient trials and the control product releases with this have been successful and the trials and let's see how it goes in the real world. We are very confident that this will be a successful technology for the channel for patients and for physicians wanting to prescribe it.","Craig Wong Pan - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Andrew Goodsall with MST is online with a question.","Andrew Goodsall - MST Marquee","Thanks very much for taking my call. Perhaps if I could just ask you the pricing environment in the U.S., and I guess just thinking ahead to the next round of competitive bidding in the positive reforms there, just your expectations where pricing will even out to?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. Andrew, look pricing environment is very stable in the U.S. and we don't go into details of what that is, but it's stable, there's no big step changes within the U.S. pricing market right at the moment. As far as details with regard to competitive bidding and where we're at in that sort of seven-year process with the U.S. government and CMS, Dave, you want to provide some color for Andrew on that?","David Pendarvis - ResMed, Inc.","Sure. Thanks, Mick. Andrew, it's hard to say that the next round of competitive bidding is scheduled for January 1 of 2019. We've got no guidance from CMS as to how that process is going to be conducted and time is getting a little short. So it's not clear what the timing is going to be.","However, there have been two significant changes to the process that came in legislatively, one, is that bids have to be binding this time and which means that you should eliminate the sort of lowball bidders who are maybe bidding low on one category to get another or otherwise you're taking to flyer.","And the second change is that there will be no limit on the bid ceiling, you can bid higher if you like. So just those two factors alone we think will lead to more rational bidding. We've gotten some good signals from CMS that there should be some other reform coming. We'll wait to see when those signals actually turn into reality.","But there's some good strong indications that you could see a better bidding process this time and certainly what we would support and we've been working with our partners and with CMS to try to make that happen. So time will tell, but we're encouraged.","Andrew Goodsall - MST Marquee","Thank you. And just my follow-up, you've called out Korea, France, Japan is positive jurisdictions I guess, is there any other countries that we should be sort of focusing on where you think there's also a bit of positive momentum?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. Look, Andrew, I mean France and Japan had that big change with telemonitoring. So I think there's a long runway of future growth there. I mean, you don't have to go far around the OECD countries to see where other telemonitoring capabilities and connected care, connected health capabilities might be growing. South Korea is kind of unique, where it's gone from no reimbursement to reimbursement. So that's a really sort of positive sign for a really long-term play of growth and access to \u2013 many, many millions of South Koreans can now get access to reimburse care, not just the people who could afford to pay out of pocket. So I think that's a really good development there.","Other geographies to watch, well, we talked about the Sleep cue (00:51:54), this very low cost screening technology that just runs off a smartphone that's going to launch and 1.3 billion person market there in China. We're incredibly excited about the potential of that. But look, I don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We're just launching the technology. There's a lot of technologies that go into a country like China and such adoption of smartphone-based buying and selling of everything. I was in our office in Suzhou and you can't buy a cup of coffee without using a smartpay from your smartphone system. No, you couldn't use cash, credit card only a smartpay system, so the technology adoption in China is just incredibly quick and so who knows if we can get above that technology noise and make it go. But I think that's another geography to watch there, Andrew.","Andrew Goodsall - MST Marquee","Terrific. Thank you.","Operator","David Stanton with CLSA is on line with a question.","David Stanton - CLSA Australia Pty Ltd.","Thanks very much for taking my questions. First one just a follow-up perhaps on Andrew's previous question. What are we hearing from the government around bundling and bundling trials, any updates on that please?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Dave, why don't you take that?","David Pendarvis - ResMed, Inc.","David, there's been no word on bundling as part of the CMS competitive bidding process. When that came out some time ago it was going to be a trial that would start in 2019. As I indicated, time is getting very short to even put out the basic rules for competitive bidding much less, some trial and non-bid markets. But the bottom line is we've heard nothing about it. We continue to have supporters that we talk to both in the customers and in the legislature in CMS who made it clear that we think that's a bad idea. We're hopeful it won't go forward, but we've heard nothing.","David Stanton - CLSA Australia Pty Ltd.","Right. Thank you. And my follow-up is can you explain a little bit more, give us some more color around how Brightree helps you with your replenishment of mask growth? Thanks very much","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, David. So we have two offerings for our U.S. customers with regard to replenishment of mask offerings for patients who want them. We have a technology solution called ResMed ReSupply, which we offer to customers that run on any digital backend system for their homecare company and so it's available to all customers across the U.S. And then we also have a technology called Brightree Connect, which is specifically for resupply of masks and accessories for customers, not just ResMed, but for any masks and accessories they provide. And so we have two technologies that we have out there in the market and they've got different capabilities and appeal to different sort of segments, if you like, of the market there, David.","David Stanton - CLSA Australia Pty Ltd.","Great. Thanks very much.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question for the day will be from Gretel Janu with Credit Suisse is on the line.","Gretel Janu - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd.","Thanks very much. So I just wanted to go back to international and really work out some of the trends, say, in the other rest of world markets particularly Germany, because you haven't really called out Germany at all this time.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yes, Gretel. Look, our German healthcare team, which is led by our CEO there, Katrin Pucknat, and I just had a conversation with her this morning. We've seen some really good growth of our German healthcare business over the last couple of fiscal years. And Katrin is really changing the approach and the service mentality of our go-to-market teams there in Germany. There was no brand new news in the last 90 days. So I wasn't neglecting one of our top five countries. I also didn't talk about ANZ, which is another strong growth area. We had really good growth in many sales in that sort of consumer pay segment in Australia and New Zealand and Catherine Delamare who leads that business is doing a great job.","But look, within Germany, it's as steady as she goes growth there. And I think that as we look all the technologies that I talked about that we provide to our customers globally, we are providing to ourselves there too within our Germany healthcare business. And so, I see strong steady growth within Germany. But no changes yet to telemonitoring versus non-telemonitoring from reimbursement providers like in France. But if I was at the German ministry for health and looking at the success of France in driving increased adherence, low hospitalization costs and better outcomes for their patients and for the social security healthcare system within France. If I was next door in Germany, I'd be looking at that and saying why don't we keep up with the times and try to get ahead of them in digital health.","Operator","Thank you. We are now at the one hour mark. So I'll turn the call back over to Mick Ferrell.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Well, thanks, everybody. And in closing, I want to thank the 6,000 strong ResMed team for their dedication, focus and commitment to our operating excellence initiatives. This quarter, they have helped us deliver strong revenue growth and increasing operating leverage. Our team remains focused on our future pipeline of products and software solutions that change patients' lives and benefit our customers: patients, physicians, payers and providers.","Thank you for your time and we will talk to you again after the end of our fiscal year in about 90 days plus or minus.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Constance Bienfait, Director of Investor Relations at ResMed. Constance, you may begin.","Constance C. Bienfait","Thank you, Trish, and thank you all for joining us today.","The company has asked me to address certain matters. First, ResMed does not authorize the recording of any portion of this conference call for any purpose.","Second, during the conference call, ResMed may make forward-looking statements such as projections of future revenue or earnings, new product development, new product launches or new markets for the company's products.

There are also other members of the management team present that will be available to answer questions.","I would now like to turn the call over to Peter Farrell. Peter, please go ahead.","Peter C. Farrell","Okay. Thank you, Connie, and thanks to everyone for joining us. After this call, I'll turn over responsibility for the handling of future quarterly earnings calls to Mick, who the board appointed as CEO, which most of you would have come across last month.","And as an aside, let me point out that we had a 2-year search, which the board conducted under the auspices of Spencer Stuart, and we examined both internal and external candidates. And the decision was made, as I said, last month. So I'll review the quarter, and then Mick, who's currently in London, will join the call and make some brief remarks before we hand over the call to Brett Sandercock to go through the numbers in more detail.","So first, the financial summary. As you would have seen from the press release, we finished another solid quarter. This represents the 73rd consecutive quarter in which we've grown the top line and obviously, we're extremely pleased about that. Global revenue in the third quarter grew 10%, both actual and constant currency numbers to $334 million. Revenue in the Americas grew 13% year-over-year to $215 million, and ROW revenue increased 6% compared to the year-ago quarter. And that also was in both actual and constant currency terms, and that was to $168 million.","We believe that these results were from as a result of both superior product quality and full solution offerings. And these 2 aspects continue to drive our growth.","Net income for the quarter increased 31% to $85 million while GAAP EPS increased 32% to $0.58 per share for the quarter. Excluding amortization of acquired intangibles, EPS was a record $0.59, which showed excellent operating performance.","The global growth in Flow Generators this quarter was primarily driven by our high-end devices with strong sales of AutoSet, bilevels and adaptive servo-ventilation, as well as in Respiratory Care with the Stellar. We believe we continue to take share in the AutoSet space, and we are also gaining share back in bilevels. In short, our respiratory products are being well-received.","And there is plenty of room for us to continue to grow in all these areas. For example, in the Americas, where Flow Generator sales were particularly strong this quarter, we had the S9 AutoSet, bilevels and VPAP Adapt, which of course is our adaptive servo-ventilator in the U.S., all did particularly well. And we attribute a lot of the share gains and mix shift to both the positive responses to EasyCare Online and to increases in home sleep testing, which I will discuss in a little more detail.","Turning to the rest of the world. There is still a lot of uncertainty in Europe. However, we were gratified with the results in both the U.K. and Germany. So despite the challenging economic climate throughout Europe, as well as fiscal constraints, the focus is still on treatment that keeps patients out of hospital and healthy. AutoSet CS, again our ASV offering in Europe, VPAP ST and Stellar products did well again this quarter in most parts of Europe.","The Asia-Pacific region also had a solid quarter, with strong sales in Japan and India, although as we've explained on a number of occasions, Japan sales are inconsistent from quarter-to-quarter. And in this particular quarter, Japan was a little soft though, but not unexpected. Japan ended this fiscal year end, and these distractions that is Teijin, ended their fiscal year on March 31. And those distractions tend to affect their sales during this quarter. And as I said, they're a little softer but not unexpected.","As I mentioned, EasyCare Online, the compliance management system, continues to be well-received. And we are seeing solid uptake from both existing, as well as new accounts. And the EasyCare Online, I should point out, is also now available for bilevels.","In this challenging environment, where there are changes in government reimbursement, coupled with mandates to bring down the cost of health care, products and programs, which provide superior therapy and better compliance, what bring the most value across the board to patients, customers and payers.","Now with respect to interfaces, masks, our growth moderated due to -- and I think a number of you referred to this new entrance into the marketplace. However, Mask parts and accessories did very well in all geographies. But complete Mask systems sales were, in fact, a little softer. Both Philips and F&P have 2 new masks, as most people are aware. And as expected, they are being trialed by various customers. This is not a new experience for us. But as you know, we've been experiencing particularly good performance and market share gains in all of our Mask categories for quite some time. So things do tend to change.","But more recently, the new competitive offerings, as I've already mentioned, are being tried by some of our customers. We are of a view, however, that these new entrants are not nearly as good as ours, but they are gaining traction as HMEs are willing to, as I said, try them.","But perhaps equally importantly, or arguably more importantly, we faced a tough comparison to last year's third quarter's -- last year's third quarter, where growth in the Mask category in the Americas was 21%, and globally, it was 16%. So in short, a pretty big mountain to climb.","However, as always, we plan to stay ahead of the game by constantly innovating. We provide -- we are going to provide, in the very near future, mask products that are smaller, quieter and more comfortable, and which we believe will keep us well ahead of the game.","Our product pipeline is actually quite full, and we are releasing 2 considerably improved mask products this quarter with more to come during the remainder of fiscal 2014. In fact, we are extremely optimistic about these new interface innovations.","Now coming back to home sleep testing. The number of commercially covered adult lives requiring pre-authorization for PSG continues to roll out, steering providers and patients towards HST. It is now well over 50% of covered lives and heading north. We estimate that at the -- or we estimate that at the end of calendar 2012, approximately 25% of all tests were HST, and we believe -- or our numbers are showing that this will be around about 40% at the end of our fiscal year June 30.","We continue to see a steady increase in the number of sleep labs involved in HST, averaging approximately 38% during the last 12 months, with a rise to around 47% in January in response, again, to pre-authorization. We are also participating in primary care physician awareness initiatives as HST continues to advance. In fact, PCPs are becoming more involved with the diagnosis and management of the sleep apnea patient and are also starting to drive momentum in the whole of the sleep business.","So sleep market is not just about selling equipment to treat sleep-disordered breathing, it is very much about forming partnerships with both customers and payers. A combination of our range of high-quality Flow Generators, the most comfortable and effective masks and accessories and easy to access robust data through the EasyCare Online, makes us an excellent value proposition.","Not only do we have a robust pipeline of new masks, we have future technology innovations planned for both sleep and Respiratory Care. In short, we are at the forefront as leaders in innovation in the sleep space, and we have every intention to continue to bring to market the best possible solutions for sleep-disordered breathing.","Finally, as I have said before, given recent data, which suggest that SDB, sleep-disordered breathing, affects approximately 25% of the adult population at some level and that the treatment -- the diagnosis and treatment of SDB, firstly, improves quality of life; secondly, slows co-morbid disease progression; and finally, reduces health care costs. It is, as I have said before, the holy grail of health care delivery.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mick. Are you ready to make some comments, Mick?","Michael J. Farrell","I am. And thank you, and hello from London. This is a really exciting time for our team here at ResMed and not just because we had a Q3 revenue of $384 million, which represented 10% top line growth and 31% net income growth. However, with the fast growth of the global health care spend and its growing share of the GDP burdening many major global economies, both governments, as well as private payers are looking for answers to reduce the cost of the health care and to improve patient outcomes.","We believe that at ResMed, we have the answer to these questions in the fields of sleep-disordered breathing, as well as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease or COPD and in other cardiorespiratory areas, particularly heart failure. I'd like to take just a couple of minutes to discuss 3 major growth horizons that we see in our future here at ResMed.","The first growth horizon for ResMed is in our core SDB business. In the last 12 months alone, we have impacted many millions of lives in this space, resulting in around $1.5 billion in revenue. We will continue to grow the number of lives we impact each year along with our revenue. We are the global SDB market leader. We've talked before about SDB as a solid growing market and one that is incredibly underpenetrated.","At most, it's 5% to 15% penetrated, meaning that 85% to 95% of the opportunity in our core business is still in front of us. As the global SDB market leader, we're in a great position to drive new market penetration and new market growth, geographically and to other co-morbidities, as you just heard.","We've said it before. Our biggest competitor is not one of the other SDB manufacturers. It's a lack of education and awareness of the signs and symptoms of SDB, as well as the ability for physicians, particularly PCPs, to have practical medical action pathways. We're investing in changing that and ensuring that we have sustained, strong growth in our core SDB market.","The second growth horizon for ResMed is our Respiratory Care business. This fast-growing business includes diseases such as COPD, as I mentioned before; neuromuscular diseases, such as ALS also called Lou Gehrig's disease.","This Respiratory Care opportunity includes hospital and homecare ventilation, as well as hospital and homecare humidification. We have a leadership position in Western Europe with homecare ventilation. However, in the U.S. market, we have significant room for share growth. Combining Respiratory Care opportunities in the U.S. with those significant ones in Asia-Pacific, as well as Latin America, we have revenue growth potential in the multiple hundreds of millions of dollars. And there are many, many millions of patients with COPD and neuromuscular disease whose lives can be significantly changed with innovative ResMed technology.","In that vein, we've just announced today, as you saw another press release in these last 24 hours, that we are launching the first and only bilevel device cleared by the FDA specifically for the treatment of COPD, one of the top 5 killers in the Western world. COPD sufferers now have a weapon in their fight to stay out of hospital. One of the biggest challenges for COPD patients, as well as their payers and physicians and for the health care providers that we serve, is to keep these patients from returning to the hospital after a COPD exacerbation event.","More than 1 in 5 COPD patients are rehospitalized within 30 days. VPAP COPD has all the features of our higher-end noninvasive ventilation devices, including access to our cloud-based software system, EasyCare Online. EasyCare gives physicians, payers and HMEs the opportunity to monitor COPD patients, as well as our core SDB patients, it's the same platform, and intervene if there's a problem and potentially reduce cost and reduce rehospitalizations.","Our third growth horizon is in the field of cardiorespiratory disease, but specifically cardiology and even more specifically, heart failure. As many of you know, we're running a large multinational randomized controlled trial or RCT in the heart failure space called SERVE-HF. SERVE as in a tennis serve and HF for heart failure. SERVE-HF is evaluating approximately 1,300 patients and is wrapping up enrollment over the coming weeks and months.","In this 2-year follow-up study, we are looking at 2 primary outcomes: mortality and morbidity. We're cautiously optimistic that the data from SERVE-HF are going to show that ResMed's proprietary technology can save both lives and money, so to reduce the mortality and to reduce the morbidity. This is an enormous opportunity in the market space where heart failure and SDB intersect.","At ResMed, we believe we have the best products, the best team and the winning strategy. We care about the health and the quality of life of our patients. We care about disease prevention. We care about improving outcomes, and we care about improving the economics of our somewhat broken health care systems. We are more excited than we have ever been that despite the challenges of current health care market dynamics, we at ResMed have the capabilities and the product pipeline to really make a difference.","You'll hear me echoing many of the same things you've heard from Peter Farrell over the last couple of decades: our belief in ResMed's people, our world-leading product quality, our laser-like focus on innovation as well as solid science and clinical validation. Most important though is our shared vision for these 3 growth markets. We are proud to be leaders in SDB. And as you heard earlier, there is still so much room for growth in that space.","I'm really looking forward to partnering in the office of the CEO with Rob Douglas, our COO, and with the rest of our CEO operations team, as well as with the almost 4,000 strong ResMed global team as we continue to drive increased value for our shareholders.","The bottom line is that we have defined business plans, specific identified investments and key ResMed business leaders who are accountable for driving success in these 3 growth horizons I've talked about: SDB, Respiratory Care and cardiology.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Brett, who's in Sydney, to review Q3 in more detail. Brett?","Brett A. Sandercock","All right. Thanks, Mick. As we mentioned, revenue for the March quarter was $383.6 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter and also 10% in constant currency terms. Income from operations for the quarter was $96.1 million, an increase of 26% over the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter was $84.9 million, an increase of 31% over the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.58, an increase of 32% over the prior year quarter.","Gross margin for the March quarter was 62.4%, up sequentially from Q2 FY '13. On a sequential basis, our gross margin benefited from a favorable product and geographic mix and manufacturing and logistics improvements. Looking forward, we expect our gross margin for the balance of fiscal year 2013 to be in the range of 61% to 63% assuming current exchange rates.","We continue to execute on initiatives targeted at improving our global manufacturing supply chain and logistics cost structures. SG&A expenses for the quarter were $109.6 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses also increased by 8%, and SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 28.6% compared to the year ago figure of 29.2%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 28% to 29% for the balance of fiscal year 2013.","R&D expenses for the quarter was $31.2 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, R&D expenses increased by 11%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 8.1%, consistent with the prior year quarter. Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenues to be around 8% for the balance of fiscal year 2013, reflecting ongoing investment in our product pipeline.","Amortization of acquired intangibles was $2.5 million for the quarter while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $10.2 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.4% compared to the prior year quarter effective tax rate of 23.1%. The lower tax rate reflects the benefit of lower effective tax rates in our Singapore and Australian operations. We currently estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2013 will be in the vicinity of 21%.","Turning now to revenue in more detail. Overall, sales in the Americas were $215.2 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. Sales outside the Americas totaled $168.4 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas also increased by 6% over the prior year quarter.","Breaking our revenue between product segments. In the Americas, Flow Generator sales were $95.4 million, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter, reflecting strong growth in our APAP and bilevel devices. Masks and other sales were $119.8 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter.","For revenue outside the Americas, Flow Generator sales were $114.6 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter, and in constant currency terms, also an increase of 9%. Masks and other sales were $53.8 million, consistent with the prior year quarter.","Globally in constant currency terms, Flow Generator sales increased by 14% while masks and other increased by 5%. Cash flow from operations was $107 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditures for the quarter was $19.9 million while depreciation and amortization for the March quarter totaled $20.7 million.","Our share buyback continues to play a major role in our capital management program. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for consideration of $67.3 million. For the first 9 months of fiscal year 2013, we repurchased 2.8 million shares for consideration of $115.3 million. At the end of March, we had approximately 6.1 million shares remaining under our authorized buyback program.","During the final quarter of fiscal year 2013, we intend to purchase at least 1 million shares under our share buyback program. In addition to our share buyback, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share, consistent with our previously advised dividend policy.","Our balance sheet remains very strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $672 million. And at March 31, total assets stood at $2.4 billion, and net equity was $1.8 billion.","I'll now hand the call back to our operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from David Clair from Piper Jaffray.","David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I guess first one for me just on competitive bidding. Just wondering if you can give us some color on conversations you've had with BMEs following the rate announcements?","Michael J. Farrell","Yes, David. That's a great question, and I'll probably hand over to Jim Hollingshead, the president of our Americas group to talk in more detail about the conversations as he took over the Americas during the last quarter. But to lead out on it, competitive bidding conversations have been ongoing with our customers over the last 2 years through round one that we're 2 years into and ended the conversations on, and into round 2, which as you said, the announcements came about around the -- with an apples-to-apples number, low 40% reduction versus sort of expectations in the 30s. We've had lots of conversations with our customers over these last 90 days as we have over the last 2 years, and the conversations really aren't any different than they were before, which is how do we work together, how do we find ways to get efficiencies out of the system that we can link up together to take cost out of the system, to link with our electronic data interfaces, our EDI, to get drop-ship to inventory sites, to work together to understand how we can help Medicare understand the return on investment from treating -- diagnosing and treating sleep-disordered breathing patients. And of course, the topic of price comes up, but that comes up in every discussion with our partners. To frame this, as we always do on this call, and many of the analysts who are listening to this call around the mathematics on this, and we're talking about 20% to 25% of our Americas payers are included in competitive bidding. So I guess somewhere between 10% and 12% of our global revenue could potentially be impacted by this. So there's a lot of other elements that go into the price discussion for the other 80% to 90% of the business. But Jim, do you have any further detail that you might want to share with David with regard to conversations about competitive bidding round 2?","James Hollingshead","Sure, Mick. Thanks very much for the question, David. I don't have a lot to add to what Mick said. We were obviously talking to our customers about the issue of competitive bidding round 2 frequently, and nobody's happy with the extent to which reimbursements have been cut. And it does represent a cut in reimbursement portion of their business, but I do think it's fair to say that the more sophisticated HMEs out in the market understand that -- understand a couple of things. The first thing they understand is that there's a volume opportunity if they want contracts. The second thing they understand is what they need to do is drive efficiencies into their business. And so that tends to be the kind of conversation we're having with customers, is how we can help them. As Mick alluded to, how we can help them by providing solutions and services so that they can run more efficiently.","David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then just a quick one on the new Mask launches that you've talked about briefly on the call. Do you think that these -- do these address the Philips and Fisher & Paykel products that took a little bit of share in the quarter? And any additional details on -- are they nasal pillow, nasal, fullface, anything you want to share there?","Michael J. Farrell","So, David, that's a great question and one that the Philips and F&P and other competitors who are listening to this conference call would love to hear lots of details on. I don't think we're going give a lot of detail on that. I think we've said a lot in that our pipeline is very solid. We plan to launch 2 masks in this quarter, and there's a lot more in the pipeline to come. I'll hand over to Don Darkin maybe to give a little bit of color as to how our FX Series is holding up: Our Mirage FX, Quattro FX. These masks -- and Swift FX, have had incredible success for a sustained period of time, and we know that the market is sampling some of the competitive masks from our 2 major competitors. And we think that's a healthy competitive environment to have in the market. We're very proud of our #1 patient-preferred market position in the mask space, and we plan to defend it by innovating further and getting further ahead of where we were, which was in the lead. But, Don, any further color that you might want to provide David on the masks?","Donald Darkin","Thanks, Mick. David, we're pretty confident that what's coming out in the next few months is going to be more than adequate to cover what we need. I think more importantly, the actual pipeline itself over the next months, you're going to see pretty much what we've been planning on for some time now. And I think the competitive position for us will be more than adequate as we go forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Andrew from William Blair.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Two questions, if I might. First, on the COPD opportunity, how should we think about that in terms of revenue generation, for you all, in terms of magnitude and time frame?","Michael J. Farrell","Yes. Great question, Ben. And we have a large focus on COPD, and I'm going to hand this question for further detail on to Geoff Neilson, who's the President of our Respiratory Care group. But just to lead out there, the COPD market opportunity is huge. It's the top 5 killer in the Western world. It actually I think just jumped up to #3, ahead of stroke, which dropped down to #4 in terms of how many people it kills in the Western world. But apart from that, it also costs the system a heck of a lot of money. And that rehospitalization, as many of you know, particularly in the U.S. market, there are serious penalties to hospitals for within 30-day rehospitalization events. We think we can help the hospitals, but also really help the patients and physicians who have trouble with these exacerbated events with our VPAP COPD product. And the market opportunity is in the triple digits, but I will hand over to Geoff to provide some more color for you there, Ben.","Geoff Neilson","Ben, thanks for the question. I think if you look at the number of COPD exacerbations, which are hospitalized every year, there is getting close to 100 million -- sorry, 1 million patients every year hospitalized for COPD. Around 400,000 of these are hypercapnia COPD patients, which means that they'd be suitable for NIV treatment post discharge. Unfortunately, because of the qualification criteria here in the U.S., not all of them can be qualified for NIV therapy. So we were estimating the market given the current qualification criteria in reimbursement to be in the order of $100 million annually in the U.S. So that's -- and this product, it is really focused at what the requirement is in the U.S. As far as the time frame goes, obviously, we've got to change some practices in terms of discharge, prescribing behavior. These patients can qualify direct from the hospital rather than going to the sleep lab, and so that's not a short-term activity and we do have a sales force in the ground that we're building up who's calling on the hospitals and the discharge planners with the discharge guidelines and education material to try and change that. But it's going to be a multi-year activity to build up our fair share of that $100 million market.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And so from a revenue per patient opportunity, is it a typical pricing for the VPAP plus kind of a mass replenishment model or is there a different reimbursement model that allows different pricing?","Geoff Neilson","No. So this is going to be reimbursed under EO 470, which is a standard bilevel without a backup rate pricing. So this device is specifically designed to meet the FDA criteria for respiratory insufficiency device, which as the device has indicated, for COPD. But for the first time, it's possible to prescribe on label bilevel device for respiratory insufficiency and do that straight from the hospital. So it's going to be a premium to your existing bilevel devices, but it's not going to be priced at a ventilator-type pricing.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And last question as I have other track I want to go on but how high is the bar for another company to get a similar indication?","Geoff Neilson","I think we could expect to get our fair market share of this. Clearly, it's possible for other companies to get these indications, and we've optimized our product specifically around treatment for COPD. But it's not impossible for others to do the same thing in time.","Michael J. Farrell","What I'd add on to that, Ben, is that there's some level of sustained competitive advantage from the VPAP COPD not necessarily just in the device, but also in -- as you saw in the press release and you heard in the remarks we just made, it's linked to EasyCare Online. Having a cloud-based compliance and adherence in management system that already has its market share growing in the core SDB space linking the VPAP COPD, not only with the whole S9 platforms. So all the humidifiers, tubing connectivity but also the cloud-based connectivity is there. We think that can provide some level of sustained competitive advantage. And as Geoff said, we expect to get more than our fair share of this large opportunity in COPD.","Geoff Neilson","If I can just add to what Mick said. So many of these patients are on oxygen with our new ClimateLine Oxy tubing, and we allow oxygen to be fed in there. That means we're optimizing humidification and therefore, comfort for these patients, which means that we enhance compliance. And that also means that we're reducing exacerbations and reducing rehospitalizations.","Peter C. Farrell","And maybe you can add a little bit more, Geoff, in the sense that we've also altered some of the characteristics for inhaling and exhaling. We won't go into details there, but we've really optimized the way the unit functions.","Geoff Neilson","Yes. So we've optimize the parameters and so on in the device, specifically for COPD, to make it easy to set it up because we want this to be set up directly from the hospital and not have to go through the sleep lab.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got you. Okay, and then briefly the other topic, I guess, is back to competitive bidding. Without getting too specific relative to fiscal '14, you've talked in the past about structural pricing being kind of the 3% to 4%. And then last couple of years maybe it was -- went to 6% to 8%. Is that sort of the level of expectation we should be looking at as this shakes out or is there a likelihood of a step function type of dynamic as we go through the resetting of some of these contracts ala 2007 that we can think about as people try to model both what pricing and then ultimately mix will do under competitive bidding?","Michael J. Farrell","Well, that's a good question, Ben, and I think you somehow got 3 questions in there by asking some sub questions around COPD. But the third question, competitive bidding yes, look, absolutely there -- are potential impacts on pricing. I think what we've said in past calls and at conferences and so on is that there's been sort of traditional 3% to 5% annual reduction, like-for-like reduction on products within the market. Could this push it to the high end of that range or even a little bit beyond it? Yes, certainly. I mean, that 5% year-on-year reduction in prices is something that we would present, expect and predict and plan for. Our job and this is something that our team has worked incredibly well on is to take more than that 5% or 5% to 6% out of COGS supply chain delivery. And we talk about the supply chain, meaning all the way from our factory to the delivered patient. So looking at the efficiency of the HME as well. So there could be some increased significant pressure, but it's not -- nothing different to what we've seen before and nothing that we weren't expecting and weren't planning for and have been executing on, I think, quite well through these first rounds of competitive bidding. So we see -- we think there'll be reasonably steady sailing through it, but we're ready for alternate weather reports.","Peter C. Farrell","And, Ben, just to add a little bit to that, maybe I've been smoking too much dope, but I don't recall any discussion of 6% to 8%, maybe somebody else has talked about that but there's no way ever talked about 6% to 8%. In terms of price reductions, yes.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Michael Matson from Mizuho Securities.","Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","So I guess I have heard some rumblings of some price or I guess reimbursement cuts in Germany from a couple of insurance companies over there, and I guess they were sort of doing tenders or something sort of similar to competitive bidding here in the U.S. So just wondered if you could comment on whether or not you've seen that and whether or not you've won any of those tenders.","Michael J. Farrell","Mike, thanks for the question, and I'll hand over to Rob Douglas, our President and COO, to add more color. He and I have been spending a lot of time over here in Europe with our European operations team. Just as sort of a prequel to that, tendering or competitive bidding in different European countries happens on an ongoing basis. So we have tenders in places like Norway and the Nordic region that we participate in on an ongoing basis, and there has been some tendering in Germany. I wouldn't sort of put it as akin to competitive bidding, I'd put it akin to the other tendering processes that we've been managing and executing on for many years in Europe. But, Rob, do you want to provide some more detail on the specific question around tendering in Germany?","Robert Douglas","Sure, Mick. Okay, Mike, the German insurance industry is pretty fragmented. There's about 130 insurers. Even though they have been consolidating, that's still quite a lot. Recently, councils have put out request for tender, and they went through.  Our competitors won those tenders, and they won them at pretty low prices that don't seem to include requirements for compliance monitoring or good patient service. We actually don't think that's very good care of the patient, and we don't think it's going to be a major trend in Germany. So we're keeping a careful eye on it, but we don't think it's the main thing for Germany for us.","Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then as the market in the U.S. moves more toward home testing and the primary care physicians get increasingly involved with those tests and writing prescriptions for CPAP, is there a risk that that's going to sort of erode the portion of these prescriptions that are branded and maybe give the HMEs a little more flexibility in determining what products they use on these patients?","Michael J. Farrell","Yes, that's a good question, Mike. Certainly, with home sleep testing going from 25% of the tests to we think starting to approach 40% in the coming quarters and through the calendar year, there will be an increased influence, if you like, on the process of primary care physicians. Often, our specialist physicians still does read the study and often may make a recommendation on therapies. So the impact that specialists have in this field will not go away, but it will increase for the primary care physicians. This isn't something that is new to us, and we have been interacting with primary care physicians regarding sleep-disordered breathing for many years. We have actually some very specific programs, and I don't want to go into too much detail on this call. I don't know, Jim, if you want to provide some highlights of that, but we are working with primary care physician groups to make them aware not only of the disease state of sleep-disordered breathing, but also of the very important factor that if you're going to go from home sleep testing to positive airway pressure therapy, you're going to need to choose an algorithm that you can trust to deliver all night, every night for the rest of that patient's life. And you want to put your bet on an algorithm that has a lot of clinical validation, a lot of science and technology behind it because if you're saving money for the health care system by getting them to something that's going to keep them out of hospital, you actually want to keep them out of hospital. And the right technology is able to do that, and part of that technology is not only the algorithm, but also the data that can be taken from that algorithm, the information that we've taken to the cloud that can be used to manage that patient. And I think that's an area in terms of what I'm talking about specifically is our AutoSet algorithm and our EasyCare Online or health care informatics infrastructure. I think both of those are incredibly important factors that will weigh into the specialist but also the primary care physicians decision, and it's our job to educate them about the availability of both of those. Jim, did you have any further input or thoughts on the primary care physicians and our work with them going forward?","James Hollingshead","I just -- only a couple of things to add to that, Mick. I think that there will be a number of different models as different insurers shift to PSG to HST in different geographies and with independent physician groups, et cetera. So it's a complicated landscape. I don't think there's going to be a world where a primary care physician was utterly ignorant of sleep apnea is writing scripts for sleep apnea, right? There will always be some sort of influence model in there whether it's coming from an insurer or from a specialist who's read the study and is recommending the therapy and so on. And as Mick says, we have a number of programs underway right now, and I would say that some of them are early stage and we're experimenting. We have a number programs underway right now to drive awareness and brand awareness into the PCP space, but I don't think there's a huge risk associated with PCPs ending up as sort of arbiters in the space without knowing anything. It's really our job to educate the PCPs.","Michael J. Farrell","I'd say it's lesser risk and really an opportunity, Mike, and something that we've not only planned for but are starting to execute on, as Jim said.","Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just -- sorry to go back to the Germany question, but I just -- one quick follow-up on that. So is this -- you mentioned that there's been tendering in other countries in Europe. Have you -- is this the first time that there's been tendering in Germany or has that been -- have you seen that happen over the past?","Michael J. Farrell","Yes, I think this is a first. Rob, you want to address it?","Robert Douglas","Sure, Mick, thanks. It has been going on in the past for quite a while quite. And as I've said, it's quite a fragmented insurance industry and while they are practically a common set of top-level rules, they have different practices in different companies and there has been tenders over the years there, and we've seen then come and go in the past as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Prior from Bank of America.","Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just first question regards to, I guess, U.S. Flow Generators strength in the backdrop for the bidding. We've seen commentary out of Philips. In their first quarter results, they talked of a pretty tough U.S. landscape. You guys have done quite well. Can you talk about share gains, where they've been driven off the back of the informatics that you're pushing through and is that's obviously feeding into, obviously, the backdrop of competitive bidding? If I can just ask one subquestion to competitive bidding. Do you think you'll take your medicine upfront in terms of the private payers in terms of national accounts looking to negotiate now or do you truly see it staggered in line with the phasing of competitive bidding in both a CMS and the private payer sense?","Michael J. Farrell","Well, great, Matthew. So you gave me 2 questions all upfront. So we'll address them in order. So firstly, the Flow Generators share gains and then we'll get to the competitive bidding and upfront or staggered. So Flow Generators share gains. Again, I think Don Darkin might want to add some color after this, but just to start off, I think there are 3 major factors that are influencing our Flow Generators share growth. The first is home sleep testing is driving growth of the APAP category. ResMed has a leadership position in the APAP category with the S9 AutoSet device. So we're growing share in a growing category. That's point one. Point two, our S9 bilevels are now available across the board. And as you've heard from Geoff Neilson in his press release, in the last 24 hours, we added another S9 bilevel, and they're available all across the same platform. We think that we've had very strong growth across the high-end bilevels because the efficiencies that generates for our distributors, our customers and frankly, the value it delivers to the patient in terms of quiet, comfortable and efficacious therapy. And that's helped us on the VPAP ST, the VPAP Adapt, the AutoSet CS, the VPAP STA, and we believe it will help us on the VPAP COPD. The third point, as you alluded to, Matthew, is the health care informatics side. EasyCare Online and the cloud-based software that links into the VPAP COPD. We think that EasyCare Online in our core sleep disorder breathing market is driving added value for our customers that is leading to a preference for ResMed devices. And an important point on that is that is a sustainable competitive advantage, and it takes a long time to build up the capability and once you're ahead, you can continue to lead from the front. Don, any further thoughts or ideas on the Flow Gen share gains?","Donald Darkin","No, I think you covered it, Mick.","Michael J. Farrell","Okay. So the second question was around competitive bidding, and this I won't answer upfront, and I'll let Jim get to whether it's going to be upfront or staggered. I think there will be negotiations that happen on a daily basis with accounts with regard to pricing as the numbers came out over 30 days ago, we've already had many discussions with customers about -- for those who are winners, which those data only came out the number of weeks ago. So that's all public now. We know who the winners are. We can sit down and talk to them. We can bring out the playbook that we did in competitive bidding round one where we worked with winners, we helped them grow and we partnered with them on driving their ability to deliver with economies of scale. Jim, any thoughts on the question there with regard to medicine, upfront or staggered, Matthew's question on competitive bidding?","James Hollingshead","Yes, I think it's a good question, and I actually think it's a very difficult question to answer. As you say, Mick, negotiations are happening daily and the bid rates when they came out, they obviously create a ripple through the market and all of our customers' concern about reimbursement from CMS, and we're negotiating. One thing that I think works very strongly in our favor is that our products drive better compliance, and that's still a very important thing for the business model of all of our customers. And so we're going to continue to negotiate and work with our customers, both on pricing than on other things that we can do for the business. And we'll have to see how it plays out. I think we're very strongly positioned, and I think our customers recognize the value that our products bring to them, as well as our solutions like ECO. And we'll manage it as we can and we'll see how it goes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ian Abbott from Goldman Sachs.","Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs & Partners Australia Pty Ltd, Research Division","I was wondering -- I had a follow-up question on EasyCare Online. I'm just wondering how much of a direct revenue driver is that or is it more you actually almost give it away and then it drives the uptake in APAP and CPAP as you've talked about?","Michael J. Farrell","Yes, Ian, that's a good question and, Don, I'll hand this over to you before going too far. EasyCare Online is a software provision that gives customers chances for efficiencies, the ability to remotely manage adherence in a way that is kind of unique and certainly serious value-add. I do think there is a very strong indirect influence on their choice of a Flow Generator because of that, and so that indirect strength is there. There are some direct revenues associated with the overtime AFEs and so on that we put through there but we're really focused on the innovation part that ResMed brings to the game, which is in the medical device field. But, Don, maybe want to talk to some of the other areas like our Umbian acquisition and the opportunities that we have with U-Sleep as well.","Donald Darkin","Thanks, Mick. Yes, it is a difficult one to try and understand whether there is actual revenue directly as we add people in ECO. Clearly, it has many functions that enable us to keep those customers in a position when we need them. With Umbian, it's a slightly different situation where we are, in fact, getting revenue from the use of Umbian. And as that software package grows, there will be other opportunities for us to see and measure. But at this point, it's a very difficult one to sort of track if that's answering your question.","Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs & Partners Australia Pty Ltd, Research Division","Yes, I was just trying to get a sense of whether -- you've had a very strong Flow Gen number this year, for this quarter in the U.S. I was just trying to get a sense of whether the EasyCare or the Umbian was a contributor there or is more just the underlying Flow Gen?","Donald Darkin","Yes. It certainly seems that way. But to actually put an exact track number on it's quite difficult at this point. And I think longer term, it will be easier to make a call on it. But for this stage, difficult.","Michael J. Farrell","So directionally, it's having influence, which is hard to quantify it, and I think is the short answer.","Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs & Partners Australia Pty Ltd, Research Division","All right. And my second question is around gross margin. I just wondering if we can get an update on how much of your production is now in Singapore and also if you could perhaps break out or give some idea of the gross margin improvement during the quarter, how much was product mix and how much was, say, manufacturing mix?","Michael J. Farrell","I'll hand over to Rob, and then he may hand over to Brett to give more details on gross margin contribution for the quarter.","Robert Douglas","Thanks, Mick. Yes, Ian, we continue to work on product cost, both on the incremental improvements and operating costs through the manufacturing system. The shift to Singapore continues to help. Our Malaysian factory producing headgear is working well. And of course, the product design teams really have a big impact on the cost of the products through as well. In terms of the exact mix of margins effects, I'll hand that over to Brett.","Brett A. Sandercock","Yes. Thanks, Rob. So if you look at -- if you kind of look at that year-on-year in both product mix and the manufacturing logistics improvements were both significant contributors. So we kind of don't break that down blow-by-blow, but both of them were meaningful contributors to that gross margin expansion this time.","Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs & Partners Australia Pty Ltd, Research Division","And the mix of -- and how significant is Singapore now, is that getting up to 2\/3 or 70%?","Michael J. Farrell","It's on a blended basis, it'd be approaching 60%.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony Petrone from Jefferies Group.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","One on EasyCare Online. I'm wondering how penetrated EasyCare Online is among the installed base. Is that only S9, and is there a way to transition S8 users into EasyCare Online?","Peter C. Farrell","Somebody want to take that?","Robert Douglas","Yes, I'll have a crack at it.","Peter C. Farrell","Go on.","Robert Douglas","It's a difficult one to actually answer in a sense of what penetration we have today. We've got several hundred thousand patients in the system. But when it comes to reverting back to S8, we don't intend to do that. Going forward, obviously, we'll be covering all of our new products as they come out. But I guess it's just a tough, tough question to answer that in this period. Again, as we go forward, it's going to become clearer where we're at. But today, it's quite a difficult one to answer.","Peter C. Farrell","But there are no plans to go back to S8s and...","Robert Douglas","No, no.","Peter C. Farrell","There's no need. EasyCare Online is about the present and the future. And of course -- I was just going to say, and, of course, some governments such as in France are starting to mandate that you need to have compliance there and even CMS with this 90-day rule where you've got to show 30 days continuous usage. That's also part of the influence EasyCare Online is meeting or is addressing. And the S8 is -- I mean, it's being phased out, if you like, or almost has been phased out.","Operator","Anthony's line dropped out of the queue, so we're just going to move on to our next question from Jason Mills from Canaccord.","Jeffrey Chu","This is Jeff Chu filling in for Jason. I wanted to focus on your operating margins for a moment. With regard to operating margin leverage, what is the company's medium-term target for operating margins on an organic basis? And do you see M&A as a viable driver of operating margin expansion for the next 2 to 3 years?","Peter C. Farrell","It looks like Mick's dropped off in London. So, Rob, do you want to?","Robert Douglas","Yes, I think the operating margin leverage question, we'll hand over to Brett because...","Peter C. Farrell","Okay. There's a bit of a ping-pong here. So, Brett, you're being thrown under the bus.","Brett A. Sandercock","Yes. A lot -- those operating mix and targets and so on that we have is not something that we sort of publicly go out there with. But I would say -- I mean, clearly, we will look for operating leverage over time. You're certainly seeing that with, for example, SG&A spend, and you're seeing some margin expansion coming through as well. So they've really been driving out operating ratios and so on, which are in very good shape, and we will continue to do that. R&D, a little bit different. We'll absolutely invest in the product pipeline, and we'll invest on merits really from the ground up in terms of where we see gaps in the market and opportunities. So that one we look at it much more differently, if you like. But certainly, we're absolutely committed for initiative that are going to drive those operating ratios, but we're not out there on public records sort of disclosing what they are.","Jeffrey Chu","Okay, great. I have one last question. Did you pay the med tech tax during the quarter? And what are your expectations for the tax burden going forward?","Brett A. Sandercock","Yes. Jeff, we're paying a small amount, but really I think I mentioned a quarter or 2 ago really that number if you look at it annually, it would be less than $1 million. Most of our products don't fall into the device tax.","Peter C. Farrell","Basically, it's a hospital issue and some of our products that don't sell directly to hospitals will fall under the medical device tax of 2.3% on revenues, but it's happily, it's not material for us.","Operator","We're at the 1 hour mark, so now I'll turn the call back over to Dr. Peter Farrell for his final remarks.","Peter C. Farrell","Thank you very much. I'd just like to thank the team for their efforts, and once again, we have some first-class employees backed up by some first-class products, and we are very optimistic about the future. And so thank you for joining us today, and I'll leave you in very good hands with Mick and Rob operating within the office of the CEO. We have an extremely strong productive and excellent team across the globe. And so thanks to all for their efforts. And that completes the call, and we look forward to keeping you posted on our progress. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference.

Farrell","Thanks, Agnes, and thank you to our shareholders who are joining us on today\u2019s investor call as we provide an overview of our first quarter fiscal year 2015 results.","I\u2019ll provide an update on our new product launches, some key sales highlights and our progress against our Three Horizons strategy. Then I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brett, our CFO, to walk you through our financial results in greater detail.","As we promised during our investor call last quarter, the ResMed team has been focused on executing on our strategy of launching new products, new services and new solutions that provide exceptional value to all key players in our value chain. That includes physicians, providers, payers and most importantly patients.","We have delivered exciting offerings that begin to fulfill the promise in our core sleep apnea market with the launch of the Air Solutions ecosystem and its key enabling component, the AirSense 10 platform.","We are very pleased with our strong first quarter growth and our overall results. We saw strength across our Europe and Asia-Pacific regions, as well as solid growth in the Americas. These results are primarily due to the success of our new product launches in both the sleep disorder breathing and our respiratory care markets, which includes COPD as well as neuromuscular diseases.","On a constant currency basis, we grew 6% year-over-year for our global business in Q1. We delivered gross margins of 62.4%, which is right near the middle of our guidance range. We have continued to invest SG&A to promote our new product launches. As you\u2019ve seen from our recent press releases, we have launched products across our portfolio, including sleep apnea, sleep wellness and respiratory care.","Our GAAP diluted earnings per share grew 4% to $0.58. On a non-GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share was a $0.01 higher at $0.59. In the first quarter, we grew at 11% on a constant currency basis across our combined Europe and Asia-Pacific regions.","Sales growth came from flow generators associated with our new product launches, as well as masks and accessories. With the launch of the AirSense 10 platform in its early days, we see upside in Europe and Asia-Pac as both the AirSense 10 and our new Astral platforms continue to ramp.","In the respiratory care market, our leadership positions and our established channel in Western European countries have allowed us to rapidly grow our business and build good momentum with the launch of our new life-support ventilator, the Astral platform.","We expect this momentum to continue solidly in Europe over the coming quarters and fiscal years. Additionally, we are continuing to invest in Asia-Pacific. This quarter we took advantage of opportunities to realign our distribution channels in several Asia-Pac markets, and we have started investing in a dedicated Asia growth initiative with a focus on China and India. We are planning for strong growth from China and India, as well as emerging markets, including Brazil and Eastern Europe during fiscal 2015.","Moving on to Americas results, we had a very solid performance this quarter from the region. With the America sales team achieving a 10 percentage point growth turnaround from Q4 to Q1, resulting in 3% growth for the region in Q1 on a year-on-year basis.","We are seeing U.S. patient volumes growing in both flow generators and mask categories. We are very pleased with the initial progress of our U.S. flow generator product launches. I\u2019ll talk first about our sleep apnea category product platform, the AirSense 10, and then I\u2019ll talk about our new respiratory care platform, the Astral.","We have received very positive feedback from our customers for AirSense 10, and although it is still early days, our sales are ramping up quickly, exceeding our original expectations.","As a result of this excess demand, we ended the quarter with a modest backlog for some categories of AirSense 10 devices in the Americas. We are swiftly accelerating our manufacturing and supply chain, and we believe that we will catch our supply curve up to that growing demand curve during this fiscal quarter Q2.","In September, we also announced the launch of our new life-support ventilation platform, the Astral, into our U.S. market. The Astral platform has some of the most advanced engineering that ResMed has produced, delivering key advantages for customers such as lower total cost of ownership for HME providers and increased battery life, which means up to 24 hours of freedom for patients.","We have received good feedback from our HME customers and our key opinion leader physicians on the Astral product, and we look forward to growing our U.S. life-support ventilation presence with Astral.","Moving back to the sleep apnea market, the ongoing product mix shift from CPAP to APAP continues steadily as home sleep testing continues to grow. We estimate that approximately 40% to 45% of diagnoses in the last 12 months in the U.S. were through home sleep testing.","Almost every player in the industry from sleep physicians to HME providers expect that private insurance companies will continue to drive this trend above 50% in the near future and beyond.","Looking at the masks and accessories categories, our AirFit range of masks had solid volume growth in the quarter. We gained share on a sequential basis. Customer feedback on the P10, N10 and F10 has continued to be excellent.","On a sequential basis, volumes were up, and prices were relatively stable in masks. On a year-over-year basis, we\u2019re still annualizing price changes from earlier this calendar year. As a reminder, we are still expecting price to be a negative factor for year-on-year revenue numbers until the quarter ended March 2015. The anniversary of price adjustments that we made earlier this calendar year.","Now, I\u2019d like to take a broader longer-term view and spend some time talking about progress against our Three Horizons strategy. In our first horizon of growth, we\u2019re driving engineering and innovation with the launch of our Air Solutions ecosystem and its key component, our AirSense 10 platform.","We expect our bilevel range of devices, which we will call the AirCurve 10 platform, to launch in the U.S. by the end of this calendar year and then into other key markets globally thereafter. We\u2019re expanding our digital informatics offerings by increasing the connectivity from our Air Solutions ecosystem to the informatics ecosystems of our customers.","In September, we announced the integration of Air Solutions with Fairview Health Services and their Epic electronic health record system. This is just one example of ResMed looking to eliminate non-reimbursed costs from the value chain and to provide increased efficiency and profitability for our customers.","We continue to look for opportunities to link our technology to streamline healthcare processes and to drive efficiencies for our partners in the channel. Earlier this week, we announced the availability of the ResMed Data Exchange program, enabling even more customers to integrate sleep and respiratory data into their own software systems.","We want to liberate the data. Watch this space for further expansion of our healthcare informatics offerings for our partners, including HME providers, physician practices, hospital systems and beyond.","At the Medtrade conference in Atlanta earlier this week, we demonstrated a new personalized therapy management tool, which we call myAir. myAir is delivered through web-based applications that can run on both Apple\u2019s iOS and Android platforms. myAir allows sleep apnea patients to see data about their positive airway pressure therapy and to improve their engagement in their own health care.","This patient engagement tool could reduce or potentially eliminate non-reimbursed costs for our HME provider partners and could ultimately support better outcomes for their patients. myAir will be commercially available in the U.S. market next week, and then we will release it to other key markets in the future.","We continue to believe that ignorance of the impacts of untrained sleep apnea is our major competitor in our first horizon of growth. So we are focusing even more are focusing even more attention on the importance of sleep quality for good health.","In this vein, earlier this month, we launched two important sleep awareness initiatives. First, we launched an education- and product-focused campaign called Better Sleep for Women. As part of this campaign, we created a new website that educates women on how to achieve a better night sleep and to provide a forum for women to discuss their sleep issues.","Women are 40% of the patients presenting for sleep diagnostics, and they are well over 50% of the decision-makers in the healthcare space for themselves and their families. This is true across healthcare and particularly in the sleep space.","Our new AirSense 10 AutoSet for Her product with its unique patented algorithm designed for female SDB respiratory patterns is a key part of this offering. This is not just great marketing. It is also solid science. This product has been very well received in its early weeks on the market.","The second initiative we launched is the world\u2019s first non-contact digital help device, which tracks both sleep quality, including light sleep, deep sleep and REM sleep, and the bedroom sleeping environment, including temperature and light levels. The product is called the S+ by ResMed.","The S+ by ResMed is a combination of a sleep wellness product and a sleep coaching service that delivers personalized sleep strategies to individuals. The S+ has a patented non-contact sleep sensor technology, as well as sophisticated cloud-based algorithms that are backed by solid sleep science.","The data can be reviewed on a dedicated ResMed app, which runs on both Apple\u2019s iOS and Android compatible devices. The app itself is a free download from the cloud. The S+ by ResMed sleep wellness device is priced at $149.","We\u2019ve made the S+ plus available in the U.S. market in the future at select Apple stores, as well as Bed Bath and Beyond stores, as well as online for U.S. customers at both Amazon and a dedicated site mysplus.com. That is all one word.","The S+ has already been reviewed favorably in the Wall Street Journal, in Time magazine and on Fox television. We believe this tool can help engage some of the hundreds of millions of consumers around the world who have sleep issues and who want a sleep wellness tool to help them sleep better. We believe that it will create meaningful conversations about sleep between consumers and their caregivers and loved ones, as well as with expert clinicians and physicians.","On the legal front in the first quarter, we reached a settlement with a small Taiwanese manufacturer called APEX. The agreement met our goals to protect our world-leading respiratory medical innovation and showed ResMed\u2019s strong defense of its intellectual property.","We will continue to take actions to enforce our intellectual property and to defend the significant investment of approximately 8% of our revenues that we make into science and engineering within our global R&D team.","We are also making progress within our second horizon of growth, which includes both our respiratory care market and new geographic market expansion. We have continued to see solid growth in our European respiratory care business where we have had a leading presence in home care ventilation for a number of years.","We expect to grow Astral, and it will build on its momentum from Q4 in Europe as government insurers continue to see the value of moving patients from costly hospitals to economic and more patient-friendly treatment in the home. In September, we launched the Astral life support ventilator platform in the U.S. As I outlined before, we have received good initial feedback from customers.","Combining our existing VPAP COPD noninvasive ventilation device and our new Astral life support ventilation device, we now offer our HME provider and pulmonary physician customers the opportunity to provide the right treatment at the right time for both COPD, as well as neuromuscular disease patients.","On the geographic expansion component of horizon two, we continue to make progress in our emerging markets with double-digit growth this quarter. I traveled to our India national sales team meeting this month, and I\u2019ve got to tell you the energy level was palpable.","Our country leader there, [Jito] (ph), and our entire India leadership team have an incredible outlook. Their commitment to real-time expanding the future growth targets during a sales meeting is something that I have not seen in over 14 years at ResMed and 20 years in the healthcare and technology industries.","We intend to remain focused on geographic diversification with an emphasis on China and India, as well as emerging markets beyond Asia, including Brazil and Eastern Europe. So that in the future these markets become a material contributor for ResMed\u2019s global growth.","Our third horizon of growth focuses on cardiorespiratory disease and other new market opportunities. In terms of current contribution, our cardiology products grew strongly in Europe this quarter. Even though it is now 18 months since enrollment was completed on SERVE-HF, we\u2019re still seeing excitement in this space and good partnerships in patient care between cardiology and pulmonary physicians.","In terms of other ongoing clinical trials in heart failure, we are currently enrolling patients for our CAT-HF trial at sites across the United States. We expect to complete CAT-HF soon after the SERVE-HF trial data is first published, which we expect to happen during calendar year 2016.","CAT-HF is powered to show improvements in cardiovascular outcomes, whereas SERVE-HF is powered to show changes in mortality and morbidity with both studies using ResMed\u2019s proprietary, adaptive servo-ventilation technology. We\u2019ll continue to provide updates as significant milestones are reached for both of these important clinical trials.","It is worth noting that there continues to be clinical interest in positive airway pressure technology as a tool to help reduce the cost of care for cardiac patients. Dr. Richard Schwab and his colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center published a study last week in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine showing a reduction in hospital readmission rates for cardiac disease patients with adherence sleep apnea treatment.","Reduction of hospital readmission rates costs \u2013 helps reduce costs and can help mitigate the reimbursement penalties that hospitals face when Medicare patients are readmitted within 30 days of a discharge.","I talked to a lot of hospital CEOs and CFOs, and they are looking at heart failure and they are looking at COPD patient readmission rates very closely. We know we can help them with technology that includes positive airway pressure and also technology that goes way beyond their future.","Finally, on the capital management front, we continue to generate strong cash flow during the quarter, and we have maintained our commitment to return cash to you, our shareholders. We have just declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share, which is a 12% increase from our previous dividend.","And during the quarter, we repurchased 835,000 shares at a cost of approximately $43 million. We plan to continue with a very strong capital management strategy throughout fiscal year 2015.","Let me close with this. The next 12 months will be very exciting for our global ResMed team as we continue to ramp up the launches of the new products that we discussed here as well as others and new services and new solutions across our Three Horizons of growth.","We continue to focus on improving patient quality of life, halting the progression of severe chronic diseases and lowering the costs of highly stressed healthcare systems around the world.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brett for a more detailed review of our Q1 financials and then to Q&A. Brett?","Brett A. Sandercock","Great. Thanks, Mick. As Mick has noted, revenue for the September quarter was $380.4 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter, and in constant currency terms, revenue also increased by 6%.","At a more detailed level, overall sales in the Americas were $207.2 million, an increase of 3% over the prior year quarter. Sales outside the Americas totaled $173.2 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas also increased by 11% over the prior year quarter.","Breaking out revenue between product segments. Americas flow generator sales were $95.3 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $111.9 million, a decrease of 1% over the prior year quarter. For revenue outside the Americas, flow generator sales were $119 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter, and in constant currency terms also an increase of 15%.","Masks and other sales were $54.2 million, an increase of 2% over the prior quarter and in constant currency terms a gain in increase of 2%. Globally in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 12%, while masks and other were flat compared to the prior.","Gross margins for the September were 62.4%. On a year -over-year basis, our gross margin contracted by 130 basis points, reflecting declines in average selling prices and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by manufacturing and supply chain improvements. Looking forward for the full fiscal year 2015, we expect our gross margin to be in 61% to 63% assuming current exchange rates.","With respect to currency impacts on gross margin going forward, on a sequential basis and assuming current exchange rates, we expect to see a minor negative impact on gross margin as the impact from a weaker euro will be largely offset by the weaker Australian dollar. Finally, we continue to focus on initiatives targeted at improving our global manufacturing, supply chain and logistics cost structures.","Moving on to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $110.5 million, an increase of 9% over the quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses also increased by 9%, primarily due to higher marketing costs associated with recent product releases, additional headcount to support commercial activities and an increase in variable, employee compensation. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 29.1% compared to the year ago figure of28.3%.","Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range 29% for fiscal year 2015. R&D expenses for the quarter were $30 million, an increase of 10% over prior quarter and 9% on a constant currency basis, reflecting incremental investment in the areas of healthcare informatics and cardiology. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 7.9% compared to the year ago figure of 7.7%.","Looking forward and subject to currency movements we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to continue to be in the range of 7% to 8% particularly in 2015. This reflects our ongoing commitment to investing in our diverse product pipeline, informatics solutions and clinical trials consistent with our strategy.","Amortization of acquired intangibles is $2.1 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $11.4 million. Our effective tax rate for quarter was 18.3%. The lower tax rate this quarter reflects a net tax a net tax benefit of $3.2 million, arising from the favorable conclusion of long-running German tax audit. Excluding the impact of this one-time benefit, our effective tax was 21.5%.","We estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2015, excluding the one time tax benefit will be in the range of 21% to 22%. Net income for the quarter was $83.3 million, an increase of 3% over the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.58, an increase of 4% over the prior quarter. Excluding the benefit of the one-time tax item noted previously, diluted earnings per share would have been $0.56 consistent with the prior year quarter.","Cash flow from operations was %86.5 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and a modest increase in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $20.7 million and depreciation and amortization for the September quarter totaled $18.6 million.","You will have seen we began including the cash flow statement with our earnings release this quarter. Many of you have mentioned it would be helpful to have that with the release, and we plan to continue to include that going forward. Our share repurchases continue to play a significant role in our capital management program. During the quarter, we repurchased $835,000 shares for consideration of $42.9 million. At the end of September, we had approximately $17.4 million shares remaining under our authorized share repurchase program. We do expect to maintain an active share repurchase program during fiscal year 2015.","In addition to our share repurchases, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share, our balance sheet remains very strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $506 million and at September 30 total assets were $2.3 billion and net equity was $1.7billion. And with that, I\u2019ll hand the call back to Agnes.","Agnes Lee","Thanks, Brett. We will now turn the call over to Q&A, and we ask that everyone remember to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question please. If you have additional questions after that, please get back into the queue. Larissa, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) our first question comes from Andrew Goodsall from UBS. Andrew, your line is now unmuted.","Our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair.","Margaret Kaczor \u2013 William Blair","Good afternoon, guys. So first for us, can you talk a little bit about how quickly the DMEs are responding to the new product features of the AirSense and that connectivity capability? Is it making the sales cycle longer? A little bit more detail there.","Michael J. Farrell","Thanks, Margaret. You know, as we said, the AirSense 10 launch is going very well. It\u2019s exceeding our expectations. We\u2019ve received very positive feedback from our customers. To your question, the discussion around healthcare informatics and its use within the business of the homecare provider is a more detailed conversation and takes a little longer to have that discussion, but we also think it\u2019 that it provides a lo it provides a lot of value to the HME provider.","Some of the value to the HME provider can be the fact that with the inbuilt modem, you no longer have to manage a set of SKUs of modems and connect them and manage a fleet of modems all the a fleet of modems all the way through to dealing with customers who have their customers \u2013 the patients who have may have problems with devices that can be instantly checked that the humidifier is working, say, from the HME provider to save that cost of $75 to $100 of driving out to see the patient or the customer tax that comes with the customer coming in.","So there are just some of the simple ones. They are obviously a lot more advantages as we look at Air Solutions and the value we can provide with the end to end solution and providing value across the value chain. But even those initial discussions with HME providers do provide a great opportunity to get beyond features and benefits and start talking about end to end solutions.","I\u2019ll hand to Jim Hollingshead, President of the Americas. Do you have any further detail on the first months of AirSense 10?","James Hollingshead","Yeah, sure I would you say a couple of things, Margaret. It\u2019s not cycle devices are doing very, very well. The device is a fantastic device. It\u2019s small. It\u2019s quiet. It\u2019s very easy to set up, etcetera. But there is a sales cycle associated with then using the wide and growing range of solutions from a business process flow point of view for our customers. So the device is selling extremely well and we\u2019re in more and more conversations about how they can take our software solutions and embed those into their business process.","Margaret Kaczor \u2013 William Blair","Okay. So maybe they are a little bit longer and so that can start to accelerate and take more shares as we go on throughout the year. But the (indiscernible) go ahead, sorry.","James Hollingshead","I just clarified. It\u2019s not taking longer. The devices are selling very well. What then is happening is when then is we are engaged in deeper conversations about using the device to its full effect along with our solutions. So there is some kind associated with that some kind associated with that conversation, and it is almost a solutions consultant conversation that comes on the backend. So the device sales have not slowed down at all. It\u2019s how they apply the solutions into their business that can take some time for them to embed and that part of it is what makes this so sticky.","Margaret Kaczor \u2013 William Blair","Got it. And then how much of the growth this quarter beyond the AirSense launch do you think was actually kind of the delayed sales from the man previous quarter that maybe got pushed into this quarter? Thank you.","Michael J. Farrell","Yeah, I don\u2019t think, we have a material breakdown of that. There were some S9 that we sold obviously during quarter, a significant component of the sales S9 devices. The AirSense 10 had a rapid ramp faster than we had expected, and a couple of the SKUs, the categories were on backorder at the end of the quarter. I\u2019m not sure, Brett, if we have a breakdown of any material change from Q4 to Q1 then. Brett, do you want to make any comments there?","Brett A. Sandercock","No, I think that\u2019s right, Mick. It would be hard to really know, if there was an impact what that impact would be. Certainly though when you look at AirSense and how it\u2019s gone the first two months, it\u2019s gone very well. But yes, I don\u2019t think we have tease out that impact.","Michael J. Farrell","Thanks, Margaret.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Goodsall from UBS.","Andrew Goodsall \u2013 UBS","Thanks very much for taking the question. I\u2019m sorry my phone had dropped out \u2013 maybe a bit repetitive. But actually I thought I might ask you quickly just on the launch of the bi-level range, just where you\u2019re at with that. Does that appear in the inventory build and whether you have had any effect in the quarter by not having that product out there?","Michael J. Farrell","Thanks, Andrew, and good that your phone is working now. The bi-level products which we which we are calling the are calling the AirCurve 10, we did show at the Medtrade conference earlier this week in our U.S. market, and we will launch the AirCurve 10 before the end of the calendar year.","So they are out there in the public environment. Given the competitive environment, we are not going to give the date or the level of inventory that we have or do not have of AirCurve 10 within our factories or our distribution warehouse. So it just doesn\u2019t make sense to go into that level of detail.","But I can tell you, I\u2019ll stand behind what we showed at the conference and what we said at the AirCurve 10 will provide fantastic value. It will be part of the Air Solutions ecosystem, and we look forward to launching it in our U.S. market before the end of the calendar year.","Andrew Goodsall \u2013 UBS","And I guess last time with the launch with the delays, obviously it was a prolonged delay last time. Don\u2019t you think there\u2019s any small levels of deferral that you\u2019ll experience between now and then?","Michael J. Farrell","You know, Andrew, given that we will be launching the AirCurve 10 within three months of the AirSense 10, we don\u2019t expect any dramatic holdovers on the bi-levels like we had from the S8 to S9 or the S9 to S9 bi-level timings. As you remember, those were more of the order of 24 months and 36 months respectively.","So, we are talking three months. Any impact may have happened in Q1 where we had the Airsense 10 products and the CPAPs and APAPs but not the bi-levels. The bi-levels were still on the S9 platform. But we think it\u2019s relatively de-minimums, and we think going forward that the full value proposition we will have by the end of Q2 will be in the market, and we shouldn\u2019t be materially affected by that.","Andrew Goodsall \u2013 UBS","Okay. That\u2019s terrific. Thanks very much, and I\u2019ll get back in queue.","Michael J. Farrell","Thanks, Andrew.","Andrew Goodsall \u2013 UBS","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you and your next question comes from Steve Wheen from JPMorgan.","Steve Wheen \u2013 JPMorgan","I just had a quick question for Brett on the currency effect on the gross margin for the current quarter. At the last quarter, you highlighted that there might be a small headwind. Are you able to quantify it? And then just talk to what sort of benefit we may have seen from the weakening of dollar and going into subsequent quarters. I take your point about the euro, but just if we could provide (inaudible) on that, relativity (inaudible) that would be useful.","Brett A. Sandercock","Yes, sure, Steve. Yes, if you look at our margin sequentially through Q4 to Q1, there was a currency headwind. It was around 50 basis points. So that certainly did impact our gross margin when you looked at it sequentially. If you look forward Q1 to Q2, we certainly have a headwind from the weaker euro, which is impacting revenues and then margin.","If you look at that \u2013 I think, we that, we get a small headwind, it will probably I suspect be around the 40 basis point marks for that. As you know, the only dollar benefit tends to lag by a quarter or so. So more of that benefit would then flow through into Q3, we are infecting Q3; I think on a sequential basis, we get some more upside from currency because of the weaker Aussie. So that sort of plays out like that","Steve Wheen \u2013 JPMorgan","Yeah, that\u2019s very useful. And then just separately a quick question on Japan. Been waiting for some \u2013 it has obviously been a market that has been a little bit disruptive over recent quarters. Could you just give some update as to what might be happening there?","Brett A. Sandercock","Rob, our President and Chief Operating Officer will answer that.","Robert Douglas","Yes, thanks, Steve. So the fundamentals of the Japan market haven\u2019t changed dramatically. We still have a good patient flow. We still got a really good business with our cardiology product, and we\u2019re seeing strong product flow there. Because of the structure of the way we go to market, these are lumpy businesses it reflects in our sales. And this quarter we had a positive result from that lumpiness. But we will continue to see that lumpiness through there and we will have positive strong quarters, and that\u2019ll be offset periodically. It\u2019s pretty well going pretty well.","Steve Wheen \u2013 JPMorgan","Right, thanks very much.","Brett A. Sandercock","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Low from Deutsche Bank","David Low \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thanks very much. I was wondering if we could just touch on mask sales. So the numbers or the growth rate is relatively weak there and particularly in light of the fact that there\u2019s a number of new products being launched. Could you talk to what\u2019s causing the weakness with that new product range being out?","Michael J. Farrell","Thanks, David. Yeah I will mention three things and then maybe hand Don Darkin, President of our SDB business, to talk after that. First point, we saw volume growth in the quarter sequentially increase, and we expect that to continue as we ramp up. So we saw a sequential increase in volume from Q4 to Q1. Masks were down.","Second quarter masks were down in Q1 on a year-on-year basis due to the lower prices that were washing through from the sort of January to March 2014 quarter that will happen January to March 2015 quarter. And so we are still expecting that to wash through on that time horizon.","But the third point is we have seen really good traction of the AirFit range from the P10, which I personally wear and have been for a number of months, the N10 and the F10 and the growing share sequentially and the anecdotal feedback from customers is they really like those masks. So I think that augers well for us as we look to future volume growth and then future revenue growth as we look to our end of Q3 and Q4.","David Low \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thanks. So you would classify that as \u2013 not off on share. It is more around price than it is share loss.","Michael J. Farrell","I\u2019d actually say we took share, David, from Q4 to Q1 on a sequential basis and that the year-on-year numbers you are looking at obviously we are watching through the price changes that have happened there. So that\u2019s how I\u2019d nuance that.","David Low \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thanks, Mick, and just maybe one for you, Brett, just on gross margins. You talked about there being a negative mix effect in there. Could you just touch on that whether you\u2019re talking geographic or products, please?","Brett A. Sandercock","Yes, that would be on the product side, Dave, and it\u2019s really that as you saw the kind of flow generator growth relative to the mask growth was the big driver there.","David Low \u2013 Deutsche Bank","So would it not be right to say that geographically there was a positive mix effect?","Brett A. Sandercock","Yeah, if you look at year on year, yes, correct. But fairly \u2013 pretty small, pretty small.","David Low \u2013 Deutsche Bank","All right. That\u2019s all I had. Thanks very much.","Michael J. Farrell","Thanks, David.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Saul Hadassin from Credit Suisse.","Saul Hadassin \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks, good morning. First question maybe just for Brett. Brett, operating cash flow was actually down on the PCP. Earnings were up slightly. Can you just talk to what the drivers of that was? Is it receivable days that have increased on a PCP basis?","Brett A. Sandercock","Yeah, that would be. Yes, these are around some modest increases in working capital on a relative basis. The receivables DSOs is little higher, and probably the other driver there would be some inventory build as well. So they are playing out with a modest increase in working capital, which has lowered cash flow a little bit. Having said that, I still think the $86.5 million is still pretty strong cash.","Saul Hadassin \u2013 Credit Suisse","Sure. Okay and just a separate question for Mick. Mick, October saw the introduction of the CMS penalties to hospitals with readmission rates, one of them being COPD. Are you starting to have any increased dialogue where engagement with those hospitals with regards to use of bi-levels in particular for management of COPD in the home?","Michael J. Farrell","Saul, that\u2019s a great question and actually leads into something I had in the prepared remarks, but COPD and heart failure together are two of the top readmission disease states for hospitals CEOs and CFOs as they look at this in the U.S. And yes, currently it\u2019s around a 30-day readmission cycle. And the penalties are significant and they go across the whole Medicare CMS reimbursement for that hospital. So this is real money that you\u2019re looking at. You have to be above the million, above the 50% mark for hospitals across the United States to not get a penalty. So it\u2019s a competitive game that gets more competitive as everyone gets better.","We are certainly partnering with our hospital customers and our DME providers to make sure there is a strong hospital to home transition for those patients with COPD. The opportunity is twofold. It goes beyond just bilevel. The opportunity is our VPAP COPD, which is the bilevel noninvasive ventilation device and it\u2019s also for the Astral for the Astral, which is a life support ventilation device that can be used for both COPD and neuromuscular disease patients.","So there\u2019s a right solution for the right patient at the right time that the hospital and the HME provider can get. And so we are partnering with discharge planners and hospital systems across the country. And frankly in the new world of ACOs, accountable care organizations, where hospitals and primary care now share per member per month budgets, we think the time is right to move we think the time is right to move on this, and we should see progress on this over the coming quarters and fiscal year because this is a long development cycle but again has stickiness as you look to that long term.","Saul Hadassin \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the David Clair from Piper Jaffray.","David Clair \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Hi good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess the first one for me, you guys have been very active on the informatics development recently. Can you just remind us how are these initiatives going to translate into revenue for ResMed?","Michael J. Farrell","Well, that\u2019s a great question, David, and I will hand the second part of Don Darkin, the President of our SDB business. But the informatics investment is a major one for us. As you can see with Air Solutions, which comprises both AirView, which is the combination of our EasyCare online, well as U-Sleep, as well as now myAir. You\u2019ve variety of applications that are primarily cloud based and can interface with HME providers, hospitals and also with U-Sleep to coach patients.","These are major investments, and the way in which this connects through to revenue is that as for instance take one of the plays in the channel, an HME provider realizes they can save non-reimbursed costs by drive outs, pickups and no-fault balance with devices, they will want to adopt this new technology.","And as they see its capabilities on that front, they will realize the value that they value that they get is far above the price that we are charging them for access to data points. And for us, taking weight out of the system and providing investment to get some return from that is also a positive economic argument. So it works for us, and it works for our HME providers.","If you take another example the Epic hospital integrations with Fairview, not only is the HME providers that are involved there getting the benefit of reducing non-reimbursed costs, but the hospital system that is looking to manage say the COPD readmits or say their accountable care organization, total economic or total cost of ownership or total patient management approach, they can find both a clinical and economic value out of that And that should for us lead to more share and more stickiness with those hospitals, HME providers, patients throughout the value chain. Don, anything to add beyond that regarding our healthcare informatics investments and any connection to revenue.","Donald Darkin","Yes, David, the broader issue here would be to look at it, like a Kindle. If you think about how people will select the best conditions for whether they are a large HME or a small HME in running too many realizations of revenue from troubleshooting. You want to roll the truck to check if whether unit is working or not.","You will be looking at share shift on big customers to who want to get more units into that solution into end. The compliance programs will drive more usage, usage, better outcomes for the patient, better outcomes for the HME. This will also then drive programs for accessories, which will again increase better patient compliance and a better business for the HME.","So there\u2019s a multitude of areas here notwithstanding the actual costs coming out of the actual value chain and increasing profitability for the customers as well. And they are all on top of any sort of flat fees that may be paid for purely phone usage either way. So it\u2019s not going to be a one-size-fits-all solution. It will reflect itself in many, many ways, in many, many countries.","David Clair \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Thanks for the answer, guys. Just a quick one on emerging markets for my follow-up. I\u2019m just curious are you planning on selling the same products in emerging markets or you\u2019re going to be launching low cost, low wear cost alternatives?","Michael J. Farrell","David, great question. I\u2019ll hand that to Rob Douglas","Robert Douglas","Thanks, David. So the emerging markets have got quite lot of different dynamics in them. Each one of them is complex as any of the other markets. Some of them are actually high price markets and some of them are lower price markets. And then they\u2019ve got different medical reimbursement schemes and different system.","So it is less focused on compliance management than in developed countries. And so in some markets the value of proposition of the telecoms in the device will be different. And so, in a sense really what we\u2019re going to do is go market by market, and configure products that are appropriate for them and we\u2019ve got a platform solution that lets us do that very effectively.","David Clair \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Thank you.","Michael J. Farrell","Thanks for your questions David.","Operator","Thank you our next question comes from Bruce Du from CBA.","Bruce Du \u2013 CBA","Hi guys. Just two questions for me. Just to clarify, so in terms of the timing for SERVE-HF, I think you mentioned the initial results would be in calendar year 2016. Has that time table been pulled back a little bit?","Michael J. Farrell","No Bruce. We\u2019ve always say that the final patient the power around the study. It\u2019s an even driven trial so, we don\u2019t know the exact date but the based on the power analysis and the even rate, that we have predicted the formal patient should hit the two year mark from initial setup some time in 2015. Then the primary investigators have to collect the data, analyze the data, create a peer view publication, go through the peer view prices and then get published so that they can present it ACC or HFSA or AHA.","And so that process will result in a first publication and presentation sometime in calendar year 2016. I\u2019d like to make the point, that there will be multiple publications that come from this study. And this is just the first publication that we think it will be a seminal one. That\u2019ll come out during calendar year 2016.","Bruce Du \u2013 CBA","Okay. Great. Thanks. And just the second one was around the Astral in the US. Could you perhaps give us a bit of color in terms of the degree of I guess understanding and sophistication by DMEs around the product given it is a relatively new product for you? Does that imply a relatively slower ramp up?","Michael J. Farrell","So there will be a slower ramp up of the Astral product in the U.S. market. These of the our European market, because in Europe we played in home life support ventilation for the last seven years. Since our (inaudible) longer than eight years since our acquisition of Saime. In the U.S. market, we are developing our channel with our risk free account managers and interfaces between them in our territory mangers in through our U.S. channel. I can tell you, we\u2019ve been ramping up that team over the last 6 to 12 months.","We trained them very well at the America\u2019s sales meeting a couple of months ago and they will be and they will be and are talking to customers on a day-to-day basis already in the market. The customers have used a similar product from competing companies and so there are number of HME providers who are well versed in using home life support ventilation.","So the customer education is not the issue and the customer is actually would like other supplies based on our initial conversations and we think that the value we provide with the lower total cost of ownership, increased freedom for patients, increased ease-of-use and increased maintenance and capability of these devices for both the patient and the provider that there\u2019s a very good value proposition.","But if you like, there will be a faster ramp-up of the S-curve of penetration in western Europe versus for the United States. Use of the Americas. In Canada and Latin America, the ramp will be faster more home ventilation supported markets there where we\u2019ve been selling products already from our existing portfolio there.","David Clair \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Market.","Andrew Hanover \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Thanks for taking our questions. This is Andrew Hanover in for Joanne Wuensch. I had two questions for Brett, but I wanted to start off with the first more strategic one for Mick just as a follow-up to the last question as it relates to the sales force for Astral. And you know do you believe that you have the right size sales force right now, or are you expecting to increase or decrease it?","Michael J. Farrell","So I\u2019ll take the first take the first half of that question, Andrew, and then I\u2019ll hand the second half of it to Jim to talk about the readiness. Our sales teams globally are very ready for Astro and particularly in France, Germany, and the UK all of the Nordics in many countries in Asia, including Japan, are not limited to it.","The teams are very well versed in life support ventilation and home ventilation, and we have an existing number one or number two market share in home ventilation in most of western Europe. So I believe the skids are greased for those country markets. Similarly for Canada and Brazil within the Americas. Within the United States, we are ramping up that team as I discussed. Jim, do you want to add any further detail to that ramp-up to answer Andrew\u2019s question.","James Hollingshead","Yes, sure. We\u2019re not starting from scratch just right now. The team has been in place for a while, and we are adding incrementally to it. I think we have the right level of coverage, and I think we\u2019re fine.","Andrew Hanover \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Great. And for Brett, just two quick ones. How much was FX \u2013 how much did FX help or hurt EPS this quarter?","Brett A. Sandercock","Actually, Andrew, it was pretty much flat. No actual impact year on year this quarter.","Andrew Hanover \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Great. And then as it relates to flow generators, flow generators were up 12% quarter in the quarter and in the fourth quarter of last year, they were up 1%. I was just trying to understand how we think about demand for the remainder of the year, and thanks for taking our questions.","Michael J. Farrell","The demand for the rest of the year?","Andrew Hanover \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Trend for the rest of the year, just so we get a good understanding.","Brett A. Sandercock","Well, the trends on that on the flow gens are probably \u2013 probably like Mick talk about it, it is not something we give out in any sort of detailed guidance or anything.","Michael J. Farrell","Now, Brett, you\u2019re right. We\u2019re not going to go into detailed guidance on that. Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ian Abbott from Goldman Sachs.","Ian Abbott \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Firstly, about Asia. You mentioned you\u2019d in-sourced a number of distribution channels, including in Australia. Just wondering sort of outside Americas, how much do you now distribute directly, and how much is through distributors and where do you see the split moving?","Michael J. Farrell","Yes, Ian, we have different models in all the different countries we are in, and we adjust it based upon the needs within those countries. So we sell or distribute within 100 countries, and there are very different models in all of them.","For the vast majority of our revenues, we partner with home care providers and HME providers such as in the U.S. and France and in markets where there aren\u2019t government reimbursement. In others we have different models that apply.","Our goal in all this from a strategic perspective is to think about the best needs for the health care system and the best needs for the patient and the best needs for everyone in the value chain. And what we\u2019re finding is that the solutions that we can bring to the market have applicability in each of those different country areas.","And so I think Rob described it really well earlier that we customize our value prop from a platform that\u2019s flexible country by country, region by region, and frankly even within country reimbursement group by reimbursement group.","Ian Abbott \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great. And then if I could perhaps ask about the AirSense 10. Do you have sort of any \u2013 I know you\u2019re one step removed, but do you have any sense if it\u2019s driving any upgrades? Are you seeing existing patients actually coming in and asking for the new model, or is it mainly still new patients?","Michael J. Farrell","So, Ian, we don\u2019t have knowledge to that level of granularity to know at the patient level who is getting the new device set up. Certainly within our U.S. environment, the HME providers that have started to order and use the AirSense 10 have been very pleased and delighted with the product. Its ease of setup. It\u2019s small. It\u2019s quiet. It\u2019s all integrated. There\u2019s no SKUs to manage, so we\u2019re seeing great benefit from that.","On the patient side, there are a lot of patient benefits about being small and quiet and comfortable and having the ability to seamlessly have their data shared with their doctor so that they don\u2019t have to drive in for doctor visits. I think a particular aspect of patient engagement that\u2019s important is a product that may not have hit much on your radar, but it\u2019s called myAir.","It\u2019s a patient engagement solution that allows patients to directly interact with their data. We have a system called HALO, which is an acronym that stands for Hour After Last Off. So when the patient takes off the mask, let\u2019s say, it\u2019s 6:30 AM, by 7:30 AM their data is available in the cloud and then the HME provider, or the doctor, when they turn up at their office, can have those data in virtually real-time.","Similarly, if the HME provider and the patient think it makes sense, the patient can go on their own app on myAir and see their own data. And there can be coaching, there can be feedback, and taking away non-reimbursed costs for the HME provider and potentially improving outcomes and certainly reducing costs for the channel within that system.","So we think there are so many advantages of the Air Solutions platform for patients that it will be very engaging. But given we are only two months in, it\u2019s hard to really piece out what is channel demand from HME providers, channel demand from physicians who like features such as the AutoSet for Her, which is an algorithm specifically designed for women or features that, as you indicated, our patients may like myAir.","Ian Abbott \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great. Thanks.","Michael J. Farrell","Thanks, Ian.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Stanton from CLSA.","David Stanton \u2013 CLSA","Thanks very much for taking my questions and good afternoon. I wonder if you could give us some more color in terms of the numbers around whether the use of the AirSense 10 versus other products leads to a lower setup in maintenance costs for a U.S. DME and a patient. Thank you.","Michael J. Farrell","David, we have some data that we presented at the American Thoracic Society conference in May this year, and it\u2019s related to the AirSense 10\u2019s automated informatics capability. And it was a presentation about a technology called U-Sleep, which an HME provider can use, and it provides information via email, text or even interactive voice response. So direct voice to patients that coaches them through the sort of 3-, 7-, 14-, 30-day process and beyond to 365 days and beyond them.","And those data from that presentation showed that the costs for an HME can be reduced by up to 59%. That\u2019s 59%. And the adherence had a trend to improvement that went from 73% adherence to 83% adherence. And that may not sound like a whole lot, but 10 percentage points improvement of adherence for a payer system that\u2019s managing a portfolio of patients or an HME provider that\u2019s looking at costs in a tough P&L environment for them could be quite a material contributor to the savings of both those groups.","And more importantly for the patients themselves, it means they\u2019re going to stick to this therapy, which is going to help them improve their long-term outcomes. So we think in terms of color for the AirSense 10 that the improvements are quantifiable, and our customers will start to see them and quantify them in their own way with their own systems as it rolls out over the coming quarters and months and years.","David Stanton \u2013 CLSA","Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. And I wonder if you\u2019d make a comment in terms of period end discounting, how you characterize the market in recent periods compared to perhaps a year or so ago? Thank you.","Michael J. Farrell","David, thanks for the question. I\u2019ll hand that one to Jim, and I think it\u2019s the end of our Q&A after that.","James Hollingshead","Yeah. David, I would say we haven\u2019t seen anything unusual this quarter, and I think for a long time our sales have been \u2013 in the quarter have been sort of backend weighted. But we didn\u2019t see anything substantially different this quarter as we have over the past several periods.","Michael J. Farrell","Thanks for your questions, David.","David Stanton \u2013 CLSA","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We are now at the one-hour mark, so I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.","Michael J. Farrell","Thanks, Larissa. I\u2019d like to thank the more than 4,000 strong ResMed teams from around the world for their contribution to our recent product launches. Your innovative engineering solutions are changing the game for customers in over 100 countries, helping them improve patient quality of life, helping them reduce the cost burden of chronic disease and helping them improve the delivery of respiratory health care. We remain focused on changing the lives of millions of patients with every breath.

Earnings Conference Call. My name is Mariama, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Agnes, you may begin.","Agnes Lee - ResMed, Inc.","Thank you, Mariama, and thank you for attending ResMed's live webcast. Joining me on the call today are Mick Farrell, our CEO; and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release, it can be found on our website at investor.resmed.com.","I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company, corporate strategy, integration of acquisitions and performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are detailed in filings made by ResMed with the SEC.","I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks, Agnes, and thank you to all of our shareholders joining us today as we review financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. For the call today, I will review top level financial results. I will then review some geographic highlights and discuss a few key announcements this quarter. Finally, I will hand over to Brett who will walk you through our financial results in more detail.","We achieved solid high single-digit global revenue growth this quarter, led by sales of our sleep devices, respiratory care devices, mask systems and software solutions. At the bottom line, on a non-GAAP basis, our diluted earnings per share was $0.77.","We have passed the one-year mark since the closing of our Brightree acquisition. That acquisition has been a significant success for homecare customers, for patients and for shareholders. This quarter, we acquired new capabilities and technologies to add to our Brightree offering with two tuck-in acquisitions that I will go into further detail on later on in the call.","We're making great progress with Brightree as we expand our connected care offering for all of our customers, lowering costs and freeing up cash flow that can be reinvested for even better patient care. I'll discuss more details of our digital health and connected care strategy later in my remarks.","We have refined our operating model at ResMed to ensure a direct line from customer insights through upstream marketing through our product and solution development teams and also a direct line back down to the sales interface within each of our vertical businesses.","You can think of this as a merging of what were regional sales structures into global business units. We now have a global sleep business vertical, a global respiratory care business vertical and a global Software-as-a-Service business vertical. We have also maintained a direct line from Rob and me to our Asia growth markets business and our Germany healthcare business due to the unique go-to-market models of these two businesses.","With this refined operating model, we will not only improve our innovation generation capability, we will also be able to scale more efficiently and provide better SG&A leverage, as we grow towards our 2020 financial and strategic goals.","Now, for some geographic highlights of the business. The Americas sales teams achieved solid revenue growth at 8% year-on-year, or 6% excluding Brightree. These results were fueled by solid growth in devices as well as low double-digit software sales growth.","Sleep apnea patient volume is growing steadily. We launched the world's smallest CPAP, which is now my favorite business travel companion, called the AirMini. Since its launch around mid-May, the AirMini is achieving good early adoption in its product category of small, second-use, travel-friendly, cash-pay CPAP and APAP devices. I'll talk about AirMini in more detail a little later.","Growth in devices in the Americas geography was a solid 8% for the quarter. We continue to grow our device market share as homecare providers and physicians find value from AirView software and our fast-growing patient engagement app called myAir. We now have over 5 million patients in AirView and over 3 million patients monitored daily with 100% cloud-connected medical devices in their homes. We also achieved very good growth of our respiratory care device platforms in the U.S., led by the Astral cloud-connected life-support ventilator.","The masks and accessories category grew 4% in the Americas geography this quarter. As we noted on our call 90 days ago, we expected to have mask supply constraints throughout the first half of the quarter and to get our manufacturing sufficiently ramped up so that we would be ahead of demand and have supply ahead of demand by June. We did just that. However, we clearly missed out on some perishable mask sales of product in April and May, while the N20 and F20 were in limited availability.","Now, we have supply solidified and we can instill importantly full confidence in our sales force that when they make a sale, we can deliver the N20 and F20 products to fulfill that commitment.","We are now set to increase sales growth in masks for FY 2018, as we unleash our sales force with these excellent products and full supply. In terms of customer feedback on the N20 and F20, it remains very positive. The 97% plus fit range and the comfort of the InfinitySeal technology provide a very long runway of growth throughout fiscal year 2018 and beyond.","Let's spend a few minutes now reviewing our European and Asia geographies. Device sales in the combined EMEA and APAC regions were up a very strong 11% this quarter on a constant currency basis. Growth was particularly strong in France, the UK, Japan as well as Australia, New Zealand. It is worth noting that reimbursement for telemonitoring has been approved now in France. This has provided and will provide on an ongoing basis increased adoption of the Air Solutions ecosystem, including the AirSense 10 and the AirCurve 10 device platforms as well as AirView and myAir software platforms.","Digital health and connected care are going global, and ResMed is a catalyst for that. We have had excellent success with connected care value creation for our U.S. customers these last three-plus years, and we expect to continue that. But now we also expect to provide similar value creation from connected care for our customers in Europe and across Asia Pacific as we expand this offering. We also achieved solid growth in our dental business in Europe with the Narval mandibular repositioning device.","Masks and accessories grew at 4% this quarter in combined Europe and Asia geographies. Similar to the U.S. commentary, we expect this growth to expand in FY 2018 based on the positive feedback from patients, physicians and homecare providers. Customers in Europe and Asia are also excited by the broad fit range and enhanced comfort of the AirFit N20 and the AirFit F20.","Let me now take a few minutes to update you on progress against each of the three horizons in our 2020 growth strategy and then I'll hand the call over to Brett.","In the first horizon of growth, which focuses on our sleep apnea business, we're making significant advances with the smallest, the quietest and most comfortable products, enhanced by digital health and connected care. We launched our new AirTouch full face mask in the U.S. during the fourth quarter. The AirTouch UltraSoft memory foam cushion is a breakthrough in the treatment of sleep apnea.","AirTouch is the softest CPAP mask in ResMed's history. It is a significant innovation that is truly novel and very patient-friendly. This mask addresses the number one reason that patients quit CPAP therapy, which is comfort. The UltraSoft memory foam is permeable, allowing heat and moisture to escape without compromising therapy pressure. The AirTouch foam mask cushion also fits into the AirFit F20 frame, giving our homecare customers interchange and switch options as they fit patients and help patients better adhere to CPAP therapy.","As we discussed earlier, we started shipping the world's smallest CPAP midway through May. It is still very early days, but we have had excellent initial demand for the AirMini and we are expanding and leading in this new niche product category. There is solid demand for a category of small travel-friendly, second-use CPAP devices that patients are willing to buy with their own cash. You will hear more from us as we build this category and drive growth with AirMini.","We continue to lead in the field of connected care, one of the key foundations of our growth strategy. This quarter, we announced two tuck-in acquisitions within the Brightree product portfolio that enhance existing Brightree modules and address customer pain points for order intake and opportunities in resupply.","The first acquisition of a technology called Conduit Office is the technology behind a Brightree module called MyForms. This technology will allow us to enhance MyForms as a leading documentation and workflow management solution. MyForms provides automation to help improve the order intake process of our homecare customers. The net result is reduced claim denials and improved audit outcomes for our homecare customers.","The second tuck-in acquisition is a company called AllCall Connect. This acquisition provides a full-featured live call center for homecare customers who subscribed to Brightree Connect, one of our resupply offerings. It can be expensive and sometimes inefficient for homecare customers to develop their own in-house live calling resupply capability. However, we know from our research that regular CPAP mask and accessory replacement are critical to ensure ongoing patient comfort, fit and adherence to CPAP therapy. AllCall Connect allows us to provide this service to our customers.","On the big data to actionable information fronts, a new study was presented at the American Thoracic Society Conference in May. This ResMed-sponsored study of over 130,000 patients on PAP therapy showed that patients with treatment-emergent central sleep apnea, or CSA, are two times more likely to terminate therapy. This study highlights the importance of monitoring patients to support adherence.","Also, it shows that early diagnosis of CSA and use of therapy such as ResMed's ASV technology may minimize risk of therapy non-adherence. The de-identified aggregated propensity matched data in the study leverage the more than 1 billion nights of sleep data in our connected care digital health ecosystem.","With our new Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Carlos Nunez, partnering with global teams of researchers in digital health, we predict that the insights gained from studies like this and beyond will provide the opportunity for ResMed and our partners to advance the field of sleep medicine faster than ever before.","Moving to the second horizon of our ResMed 2020 growth strategy, our cloud-connected non-invasive ventilators and life-support ventilators continue to grow globally, and we continue to develop our connected care strategy within COPD. The Journal of Global Health estimates that there are over 380 million patients worldwide suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.","With COPD being the number three cause of death and the number two cause for re-hospitalization, we are focused on testing and driving models that lower costs and improve outcomes for COPD patients. This is an urgent need to address a growing public health crisis.","On the clinical front, a study using a combination of home oxygen therapy and home mechanical ventilation, a study known as HOT-HMV was published in the Journal of American Medical Association, or JAMA. This ResMed-sponsored study was presented at the American Thoracic Society in May was previously presented at ERS. The conclusion of the study is that patients who receive non-invasive ventilation at home, in addition to oxygen therapy at home, had a 51% decrease in the risk of re-hospitalization or death.","This major finding is now published in a peer-reviewed press and a top tier journal. This is an important milestone. HOT-HMV contributes to a growing body of evidence, supporting the broader use of non-invasive ventilation, such as ResMed's AirCurve 10 platform as an important treatment for patients with COPD.","We are excited that we now have our global respiratory care business vertical, including direct line of sight from management down to the sales interface. This augers well for better leverage of studies like HOT-HMV to drive the changes in standard of care and drive further growth of non-invasive ventilation, portable oxygen concentrator and life support ventilation businesses.","Our third horizon of growth includes a portfolio of opportunities, including sleep health and wellness, chronic disease management as well as out-of-hospital Software-as-a-Service business models. We are working with payers and providers to develop and enhance chronic disease management algorithms, including population health models, care coordination models as well as to acquire and grow Software-as-a-Service models for home health, home nursing and hospice verticals.","We made progress during the quarter in this area with Brightree's new offering for the home health and hospice market. Our solution called OASIS, which stands for Outcome and Assessment Information Set. This is an integrated software and service solution with Brightree's coding and billing service that helps home health and hospice agencies reduce errors, improve patient care and optimize reimbursement, saving time so that they can focus on patients. This continues to be an exciting area for us as we look for ongoing growth of our software offerings.","Let me close with this. We are incredibly excited about our new product launches this last fiscal year and during the quarter with the N20, the F20, AirTouch full face masks, and world's smallest CPAP, the ResMed AirMini. We are well positioned for fiscal year 2018 and we continue to work on a pipeline of new products and connected care solutions for sleep apnea, COPD, neuromuscular disease and other clinical adjacencies. We are positioning the company for long-term growth for 2020 and well beyond, as we refine our operating model, better enabling customer insights to power our product and service solutions teams developments and then drive even better sales execution. We continue to bring our strategy into action for the benefits of physicians, providers, payers and, most importantly, to improve the lives of tens of millions of sleep apnea and COPD patients around the world.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brett for his remarks, and we will go to Q&A after that. Over to you, Brett.","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I'll provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. As Mick noted, we had a solid quarter. Group revenue for the June quarter was $556.7 million, an increase of 7% over the prior-year quarter or in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 8%.","Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from Brightree, our sales in the Americas were $314 million, an increase of 6% over the prior-year quarter. Sales in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific totaled $206.5 million, an increase of 6% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, sales in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific increased by 9% over the prior-year quarter.","Breaking out revenue between product segments, Americas device sales were $174.4 million, an increase of 8% over the prior-year quarter. Masks and other sales were $139.6 million, an increase of 4% over the prior-year quarter. The revenue in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific device sales were $145.4 million, an increase of 9% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 11%.","Masks and other sales were $61.1 million, an increase of 1% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 4%. Globally in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 9% while masks and other increased by 4% over the prior-year quarter. Brightree revenue for the fourth quarter was $36.2 million, with growth on a prior-year comparable basis continuing to track in the low double-digits.","During the rest of my commentary today, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP numbers in the current quarter adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles. In the prior-year comparables, they exclude amortization of acquired intangibles, acquisition-related expenses, Brightree onetime deferred revenue fair value adjustment, SERVE-HF accrual release and the cumulative tax benefit associated with the adoption of Accounting Standard ASU 2016-09. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our fourth quarter earnings press release.","Our gross margin for the June quarter was 58.2%, consistent on a year-over-year basis. This reflects manufacturing and procurement efficiencies, offset by declines in average selling prices and changes in product mix. Assuming current exchange rates and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margin in fiscal year 2018 to be broadly consistent with our Q4 FY 2017 gross margin.","Moving on to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $147.9 million, an increase of 10% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 11%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 26.6% compared to the 25.8% that we reported last year.","Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect the SG&A growth rates to moderate over the course of fiscal year 2018. As a result, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to improve from around 27% at the beginning of the fiscal year to around 26% by the end of the fiscal year.","R&D expenses for the quarter were $36.7 million, an increase of 7% over the prior-year quarter, or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 6%. This increase reflects incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.6%, consistent with the prior year. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for fiscal year 2018. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $11.8 million for the quarter, a decrease of $900,000 over the prior year. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $11.7 million.","Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $139.1 million, an increase of 3% over the prior-year quarter, while non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $109.6 million, an increase of 5% over the prior-year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.77, an increase of 4% over the prior-year quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.71.","Additionally, foreign exchange movements negatively impacted fourth quarter earnings by $0.03 per share, reflecting the unfavorable impacts from the weaker euro and stronger Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.","On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.8% and for the fiscal year 2017, it was 20%.The current quarter effective tax rate was favorably impacted by a tax benefit of $2.2 million (23:03) share-based payment transactions recorded in accordance with Accounting Standard ASU 2016-09. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 will be in the vicinity of 22%.","Cash flow from operations was $140.3 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and only a modest increase in working capital balances. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $18.4 million while depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $28.2 million.","Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share, an increase of 6% over the previous quarterly dividend. As previously announced, we have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to recent acquisitions. However, we expect to recommence our share buyback in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. As a minimum, the aim of the buyback will be to offset the dilution impact from employee equity grants. This is estimated to be in the range of 1 million to 1.5 million shares annually.","At June 30, we have $1.1 billion in gross debt and $257 million in net debt. Our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels. At June 30, total assets were $3.5 billion and net equity was $2 billion.","And with that, I will hand the call back to Agnes.","Agnes Lee - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A and we ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions after that, please get back in the queue. Mariama, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Margaret Kaczor from William Blair is on the line with a question.","Scott R. Schaper - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. This is actually Scott on for Margaret. I wanted to start on the U.S. market growth for both devices and masks. Mick, should we look at device growth on a six-month basis or is underlying device growth accelerating in the U.S.? And then on masks, how do that underlying market growth compare to last quarter and Q4?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks for the question, Scott. In terms of market growth, look, I think it's always good to look at a 6-month or even 12-month trailing period because there's lots of sort of fluctuations that could happen on a quarterly basis, seasonally adjusted and aspects of how the market might turn. In general, we look at the market as mid to high single-digits growth for the market and devices are at the low end of that range and masks are at the high end of that range. At ResMed, we like to not just meet, but beat market growth rates and I'd say if you look at this quarter completely we beat market growth rates with our device growth, and we're a little behind it on our mask growth rate given some of the supply constraints in the first half of the quarter. But the market growth rate I think it is good to look at a 6 or 12-month trailing period to sort of get a better picture of what the market growth is.","Scott R. Schaper - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And then, Brett, I wanted to ask on gross margin in the quarter and then the puts and takes for that number in terms of currency and mix and pricing and you guys guided to a gross margin for the next fiscal year to be consistent with this quarter. The same kind of question in terms of headwinds and tailwinds concerning you guys have probably had a pretty strong mask growth rate throughout the year.","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. Well, as you said, Scott, lots of puts and takes on that. But, I guess, the margins if you look at our last few quarters is relatively stable in that sense and we're seeing certainly sort of moderation and that product mix impact is still there, a little bit negative. We had really strong device growth. So, obviously, if device is growing more strongly than mask, then you have a slightly negative impact on margins. But to the extent we see some improvement in that mask growth for FY 2018 then that would certainly be supportive of product mix and supportive of the gross margin.","Scott R. Schaper - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then lastly for Mick, kind of a bigger picture question on AirMini. Could this potentially be something you push as more of a mainstream product or something you would consider investing DTC advertising dollars towards or are you guys just going to rely on kind of your traditional customers to promote the product themselves? Thanks.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for the question, Scott. Look, the AirMini is a really exciting product and it's the world's smallest CPAP, but it is designed to be a second-use, cash-pay, travel-friendly device, and that's sort of the niche segment, category, if you like, that it's creating and growing and leading. We've seen great initial demand in the U.S. through our home care channel, as they get the opportunity to enhance their cash sales and in markets around the world where there are other go-to-market models, patients are willing to pay out of pocket. And I think there was some good pent-up demand for a travel-friendly CPAP like this and we look forward to expanding that niche category to a larger niche and continuing to lead it and the AirMini technology is doing a great job now.","Scott R. Schaper - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley is on line with a question.","Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.","Good morning, everybody, and thanks for taking my question. Just to re-ask the question, Brett, on gross margin. If the masks are as good as what the feedback suggests, I'm not really sure why we don't really see a meaningful tick up in mask growth and, therefore, why wouldn't we see some upward pressure on gross margin?","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Well, really, in that sense, we (29:30) and, I guess, what I'm saying at the moment, it's broadly consistent. We're still seeing some pretty good device growth. Again, we expect to see better growth in masks than what we saw this quarter. And to the extent we see that coming through then I'll update gross margin guidance in a dynamic way. So we'll still continue to update as we go and it's the same story. If we get, say, acceleration in mask then you will see some improvement in gross margin. But we're still doing pretty well in devices also. And year-on-year, we had a few \u2013 if you look at that with the FX and things like that year-on-year, it was a little bit of headwind for us as well. So, there's few things playing out on that but the thesis still hold. If we get good mask growth then you'll see an improvement in product mix and improvement in gross margin.","Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.","Sure. Great, Brett, and thanks for taking my question. That's all I have. Appreciate it.","Operator","As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. If you have further questions, feel free to re-enter the queue. David Low from JPMorgan is on line with a question.","David A. Low - JPMorgan","Thanks very much. If we could just touch on the device growth. As you say, there is a good strong results there. Just wondering if you could give us some sense as the what sort of contribution you saw from the non-invasive ventilation line, if it was that growing strongly and was the AirMini device much of a contributor to that line, please?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Hi, David. It's Mick here. As you know, we don't split out respiratory care device growth versus sleep device growth at this point. But, look, what I can say qualitatively is that the vast majority of that growth was the sleep apnea device growth powered by the AirView software solution and uptake of the great value for physicians and providers from AirView. But that is as we move connected care to our respiratory care platform, that is starting to get some momentum there.","I will say that AirMini coming out the gates was relatively minimal on its impact on the aggregate device growth because that niche is really just starting up, but there was some balance between sleep apnea and respiratory care growth, but heavily weighted towards sleep apnea device growth, particularly in the U.S. region in terms of the year-on-year growth rate.","David A. Low - JPMorgan","Great. Thanks. And sorry, just a related question. The French change, the telemonitoring, was that meaningful in this quarter or is that something that's likely to become more of a contributor going forward?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah, it's more of an ongoing contributor. It will have some influence on product selection by customers as they are looking to make purchases during those 90 days, but that changes \u2013 something that is actually changing the fundamental basis of competition, if you like, in the industry in France and it's an ongoing opportunity for us to drive AirSense, AirCurve, and really the whole Air Solutions ecosystem, particularly the software side of AirView and we're seeing the French physicians really embracing the technology and we're seeing French customers really liking the efficiencies that they can get from the technology. And we're looking forward to patients getting the ability in France to get access to myAir data and at the same levels that the patients throughout the U.S. have these last three or four years and we think the value across that whole ecosystem of customers will be strong. So the short answer is, it's an ongoing thing and it did impact a little bit in the quarter, but it'll be ongoing for FY 2018 and beyond.","David A. Low - JPMorgan","Great. Thanks very much.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks, David.","Operator","Saul Hadassin from Credit Suisse is on line with a question.","Saul Hadassin - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd.","Thanks. Good morning, guys. I would check regarding just the Brightree commentary in terms of growth. If I go back to the 4Q 2016 period and just look at the revenues there, it looks like the implied growth was about 25% this quarter. Can you just clarify whether that was the case and was there any contribution from some of those tuck-in acquisitions you made? Thanks.","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah, Saul, that's rightly said. It was a little bit complicated last year with the fair value adjustments that we had from Brightree around the acquisition and on revenue side. And I see it like it was a slightly shorter quarter. So what I've done in \u2013 what I said for that is really an underlying prudent comparable growth rate. If you look at like-for-like just on the numbers that we've got in our filings, for example, you're exactly right, it's around that 25%. But if you look at it on a pure comparable basis so I would try to (34:20) strip out some of those sort of adjustments then we're looking at that pretty solid low double-digit growth.","Saul Hadassin - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd.","Thanks, Brett. And can I just ask one additional question about the impact of currency for fiscal 2018 on gross margin in terms of the way currency stands at the moment, is there a net benefit coming through this fiscal year based on what the euro has done versus the USD, or is that effectively offset by the rise in the Aussie dollar on the COGS side? Thanks.","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah, you're right. If I have a look \u2013 just to give you a sense for it, if I look at \u2013 currencies are moving around a lot lately as you'd be aware. But if I look at it going into \u2013 sequentially going into Q1, then I think we get a benefit of some currency for that at the moment, I think we're looking to get a benefit of maybe sort of that 20 to 30 basis points. But then if I take it into Q2 where we then start to pick up some of the impact from the appreciating Aussie dollar, it basically reverses that, so basically roughly 40 basis point reversal. That's a little bit of a tailwind sequentially going in Q1 that then turns into a small headwind into Q2. And then going forward, that should then just sort of flatten out. But if you look at it sequentially that impact is better in Q1, but then a worse impact in Q2 for us. And that's really driven off that pretty sharp increase in the Aussie dollar, which just happened quite recently. And then we'll see where that heads. But at the moment, that's the impacts that we're looking at.","Saul Hadassin - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd.","That's great. Thanks very much, Brett.","Operator","Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets is on line with a question.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good evening. Can you hear me okay?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","We can hear you fine, Joanne.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Terrific. Two questions. The first one is it's great to hear that you're out of supply constraint on the masks and the accessories or the two new mask items. Can you give us an idea of where do you go from here with full supply? What kind of demand that you're seeing for those products?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. Look, I think the demand is high and physicians like it because of its broad fit range. Technicians like it because \u2013 most importantly, patients like it. And it has a good first-time fit ratio and a very broad fit range of 97%, one of them 99% on the other. And the InfinitySeal comfort technology just having very light levels of plastic around the bridge of the nose is very comfortable for patients. So, yeah, we missed some perishable sales in the first half of the quarter due to supply constraints. That goes away in Q1, right. As we look forward to FY 2018, our sales force confidence will really be there and I think that's a product that you shouldn't underestimate that when salespeople are in short supply, they don't sell that product line. And when they aren't short-supplied, they can sell that product line. So, as we look forward to FY 2018, we think there will be some very good success of the N20 and F20 and really happy to let that sales team do what they do best, which is provide (37:38) customers in a way that they can help give it to their customers or (37:41) the patients.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Is there a way to quantify those lost perishable sales?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","There are probably 20 different models that we have internally. But it's not something we talk about externally. It's certainly something that \u2013 as we said 90 days ago, we never like to be under supply constraints. With innovation, new technologies, new plastics, new ways of designing single cushion masks that revolutionize the market, we had some challenges with the technology there last quarter. But the good news is we are through that. As we look forward, we're looking to continue growth and particularly growth in masks.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Excellent. And then my second question really is, is operating margins. They compressed year-over-year on higher SG&A. Do you see sort of this new annual run rate as a steady state or should we start moving up from here with the higher mask margins?","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, on operating margins, Joanne, yeah, I mean, we've guided to be broadly consistent on the gross margin. We set (38:46) that around how do we get through FY 2018 improving that mask growth and so on, that's going to be supportive for gross margin.","Then on the operating margin side, we expect that we'll get some moderation in those SG&A growth rates. Things such as legal costs and so on have been hurting us through FY 2017. As we work through FY 2018, we're focused on driving some operating leverage and we expect to improve that over the course of FY 2018. And to the extent we do that then that will drop through to the bottom line.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","What I'd add to that I think is, as we look to drive operating leverage on a longer-term basis and moderate SG&A as a percentage of revenue, I think we can get more aggressive in how we scale our business. And as I said in the prepared remarks, Joanne, we've refined our operating model with business verticals that include the sales force and downstream marketing teams in region and in countries. And I think there's a lot of opportunity for us to grow revenue significantly faster than we grow our SG&A as we look forward to 2020 and well beyond. So, short term, I agree with Brett, we got some refinements and great capability to drive operating leverage, but longer term it could be even better.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Terrific. Thank you so much.","Operator","Will Dunlop from Bank of America is on line with a question.","William Dunlop - Bank Of America Merrill Lynch","Well, thanks very much. Just again wanted to ask about the gross margin and perhaps why you didn't provide a range for the guidance, that guidance seems quite specific even that there is probably quite a bit of variability in the product mix that could occur \u2013 a geographic mix that could occur throughout fiscal 2018.","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","You're right, Will. There's always going to be variabilities. There're a number of factors that play out. Obviously, we mentioned a few of them but you've got the interplay of ASP, procurement\/manufacturing improvements, FX, product mix, geographic mix, there's a bunch of factors that play out on that, so that is difficult to predict, I guess. But I think broadly consistent. That easily you can see that is being not \u2013 don't think of that as being like purely consistent. But I think you could argue that's a bit of a range anyway around where we're at. So it certainly can be \u2013 and we've talked about it already on improvement in mask and so on conveying that we can get some expansion in gross margin. So I didn't mean that to be a really precise measure of guidance. I think it could range around that 58.2% as well.","William Dunlop - Bank Of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Thanks. And secondly, just on the SG&A as a percentage of sales guided to be declining through fiscal 2018. Is that because you expect litigation costs to roll off? And if not, are they going to be a material component of SG&A for fiscal 2018?","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Well, we still have litigation costs and that will still be coming through FY 2018, but we didn't ramp up through FY 2017, I guess, and that was hurting our growth rate on SG&A. We do think \u2013 in terms of litigations, hard to predict exactly where that will end up, but I think it will be not sort of accelerating in terms of our growth from where we were in FY 2017. But we'll continue to be spending money on legal expenses around litigation. But it'll be \u2013 I think it's more broader than that in terms of moderating the SG&A growth rate, so it's not just about legal cost leveling out or going down or whatever that might be. It will be more broad-based than that.","And I should say that guidance as well is notwithstanding pretty sharp appreciation in the Australian dollar, which \u2013 we got a lot of operating costs in Australian dollars, so we're going to deal with that as well. So, obviously, that's going to be a little bit of a headwind through FY 2018, but we remain confident that we can moderate the SG&A growth through FY 2018 notwithstanding currency impacts.","William Dunlop - Bank Of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Andrew Goodsall from UBS is on line with a question.","Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.","Thanks very much for taking my call. I'm just coming back to (43:10) across the quarter particularly with masks, I know you've belabored this a little bit or were belabored a bit. Just trying to sort of understand when the back order came off and when we look at that mask number, we're sort of looking at really a sort of one-month effect of kind of full availability and, I guess, just trying to understand the exit rate to give us some confidence around 2018?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah, Andrew. So, as I said, we were supply constrained through well beyond halfway through the quarter. So you can sort of look at it as, yes, (43:38) four to five weeks of the supply constrains starting to go away SKU by SKU and us getting supply ahead of demand. I think the fact that I talked a little bit to earlier, Joanne's question with regard to sales force having full confidence that they're going to have supply, that's not binary. You don't just go Monday morning and say we got full supply and the sales force say it's fantastic, I'm going to go and sell a truckload of F20s. I think what it takes is some time and they make some small orders and make sure it comes through and then ramp up because intelligent sales people with very good relationships with their customers and they want to fulfill those relationships with when they make a sale that we can deliver the order.","I think what we've shown in the last four-plus weeks in the quarter is that we were able to deliver on all those sales. And so I think the exit rate from Q4 was very strong from our team in terms of what we're able to provide to customers for N20 and F20. And I expect that to continue very strongly in Q1 and throughout FY 2018, as we are completely supplying non-constrained and the sales force can be really out there driving the full bag of products that ResMed has for our customers, which is a really strong portfolio right now.","Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.","All right. That's great to hear that exit rate. Then I guess maybe without answering my own question, I guess, just obviously the UltraSoft does have a pretty intense replenishment schedule or monthly (45:05) I guess it's fair to say no real effect of that in this quarter, I mean, that sounds like it's sort of a next quarter event?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah, the AirTouch range with the foam masks does have a faster replacement cycle. It's incredibly comfortable. Heat and moisture can be removed, but air pressure stays high, but it does have a fast replacement cycle. Yeah, I mean, we've really started launching that mid-May and so you've got very little, if any, replacement cycles on the AirTouch. And that whole category of a foam mask with a different replacement cycle in terms of comfort is really a category that we're developing over time. I don't know, Jim, the Head of our Sleep business and running the Americas last quarter, you want to give any further insights to AirTouch?","James Hollingshead - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah, I think we're confident on all three masks. The F20 and the N20 are both on great trajectories and now that we're off supply constraint, we're very confident in forward growth and in Q1 and throughout the year. AirTouch would start later, launch later. It's getting fantastic reviews from both physicians and patients. And, again, you're absolutely right. We're not yet really into it didn't launch early enough for us to see any real impact of resupply on the cushions in the quarter.","Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.","That's great. Thank you very much.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","Steve Wheen from Evans & Partners is on line with a question.","Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.","Yeah. Hi. Just a question on Brightree. We haven't had an update in the gross margin of that business since you first acquired it and I just wonder how that might look today particularly in light of some of the acquisitions that you've made.","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Sure, Steve. It's Brett. Yeah, I mean, look, it's pretty consistent with those that we disclosed at the time we made the acquisition. So there's really no material difference on those margins. We got a couple \u2013 these are kind of like small tuck-in acquisitions, I guess. They're sort of not enough to move in any significant way the operating margins of Brightree so they've been pretty consistent through that period since acquisition.","Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.","Yeah. Okay. And then just with the R&D guidance, that looks like it's stepping up a bit in 2018. Is there anything you can talk to on the R&D front that might be driving that other than currency?","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. Well, currency is pretty big one. So, I mean, the two things is we'll continue to invest in R&D, so we're going to continue to do that. So we'll continue to grow our investment base. And the second one that's probably hurting us a bit on that, on the guidance or \u2013 basically I'm looking at 7% to 8% is really the uptick, I'm looking at this Aussie dollar, a lot of our R&D is still (48:06) in the Australian dollars. So that's (48:10) if I look at the forecast, that's hurt us a bit on the R&D \u2013 just in R&D in terms of the U.S. dollars. So those two factors have led us to guide around that 7% to 8% mark for FY 2018.","Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.","Yeah. Okay. And then just one other. Could you just give a bit more color around the effective tax rate? It's just even without the change around the Accounting Standard, it looks a lot lower than what I was expecting. Yeah, if you could just address that, that will be great.","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. Overall for the year, Steve \u2013 the quarter's a bit hard because anything you do in terms of the year-end calculation of tax, everything gets sort of trued up (48:55) gets concentrated into the last quarter. But if you look at full year, we're around 20%, and that was probably helped a little bit by the ASU 2016-09 Accounting Standard. So that sort of contributed a little bit there. Perhaps underlying it's more like 21% or something like that. So that's sort of where we landed at an underlying rate. If we look at it going forward, it's just I'd up-tick (49:18) that a little bit but just looking forward around the geographic distribution of taxable income is the fact our (49:26) stronger Australian dollar is going to be a factor on that, at least also contributing a little bit. And there're a few other things, such as the R&D tax concession in Australia, which is capped at $100 million, has reduced from 40% to 38.5%. So, a number of those factors that's sort of playing out on the tax rate and has led us to increase that just a little bit from where we were in FY 2017.","Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.","Great. Well, can I just ask one more? Just the other income line that reverses from a profit to a loss. Was that just hedging, or was there anything else in there?","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah, that's predominantly FX losses through hedging.","Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.","All right. Thank you.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Victor Windeyer from Citi is on line with a question.","Victor Windeyer - Citi Investment Research","Yeah. Thanks very much. Look, I just wanted to ask about the portable oxygen concentrator business. (50:28) is that hasn't sort of grown, been a little disappointing. But what's your take on where that business is going and how you can really drive growth there, little pockets of opportunity?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah, Vic, I'll hand that to Rob Douglas to talk about POCs.","Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Victor. Victor, we've continued to work hard on the Activox product and we've actually made a number of improvements under the hood, so to say, of the device. And we've seen a lot of improved performance. And we think our teams have done a great job on that improved performance, and now we're just getting that through to the customer base.","But we're not re-branding yet. We're still waiting for further improvements that we think and we're happy with the device as \u2013 when ResMed puts its brand on it. So today, we're still work in progress, we're making very good progress. The Activox unit remains a very good, very long battery life device, and our teams are promoting it appropriately to key customers. So we're in it for the long haul and we believe it's going to be a very good business.","Victor Windeyer - Citi Investment Research","Okay. And then do you think, in terms of a ResMed branded product, you're well down the path in terms of development of that, Rob, or is that something (51:54)?","Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.","Victor, one of the things we've learned over the years is we really can't forecast our R&D program, it's just too good for competitors and everyone like that, so we're really reluctant to give you a timeline and details on that.","Victor Windeyer - Citi Investment Research","Yeah. Okay. And does this form part of this new \u2013 it sounds like you're sort of doing a slight reorganization in terms of the operations with the new business verticals. Is this presumably this falls into the respiratory care part of that business, is that right?","Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. Victor, we've got a very strong respiratory care team that's able to focus on getting at and treating patients with respiratory insufficiency, the COPD is one of the main patient conditions that we're aiming to treat. We've got an improving and an emerging portfolio of treatment options there. We'll be building more of them. As Mick mentioned earlier, we've really generated lines of business where we've got much closer engagement between our sales organization and our customers back through to our R&D teams. We should, over time, see benefits on the R&D programs for that.","Victor Windeyer - Citi Investment Research","Yeah. Okay. All right. Thanks very much.","Operator","Matt Taylor from Barclays is on line with a question.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. First one I wanted to ask was just about the acquisitions and other tuck-ins, but could you help us understand whether there was any contribution in the quarter and what you're expecting from those in terms of contribution in the next fiscal year?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks for the question, Matt. No, there was de minimis contributions in Q4 from those tuck-in acquisitions. They were really about technologies that will enhance our ongoing future growth of the Brightree offering. So, to maintain and grow that double-digit growth of high-margin business in Software-as-a-Service, we're finding tuck-ins of some good technologies can really help enhance that growth and drive further value for our customers.","So, AllCall Connect, I met the team, they're actually with me up in Halifax with our Healthcare Informatics team, straight after the acquisition already engaged with our software development teams and really starting to say, well, how do we link this tuck-in technology with all the great offerings we currently have on Brightree and continue to provide that value as we go forward. So, the short answer is no contribution Q4 2017. We'll expect great contributions as that capability of AllCall and Conduit Office roll into the offerings from Brightree, some particular modules that will expand over FY 2018, FY 2019 and beyond.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And just a question on leverage. If I look at the guidance quite literally, it would imply slight negative leverage in fiscal 2018. I know you have a headwind from foreign exchange, but what are the other headwinds that you have that maybe we're not thinking about and how can you get more leverage out of the business as you continue to grow the top line?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah, Matt, look, it's a great question and clearly we are looking for operating leverage. And you can't control things like FX and those just have to be budgeted where they are now. Well, where they will be, who knows, but we will see as those move. But the things you can control, your SG&A growth, your R&D growth, your investments across your portfolio and how you go to market.","As I said in the prepared remarks, establishing these new business verticals, rolling sales into global businesses, we think there is a lot of efficiency we can gain here in how we grow revenues significantly faster than growing SG&A while providing the same or even better value to customers. So it's something that we are laser-focused on in terms of operating leverage, getting SG&A leverage and driving that growth.","We're not going to grind our R&D dollars and not invest in innovation, I mean, that's something we're going to continue to invest at a very strong rate. Brett put that sort of 7% plus guidance in there and FX might tick that up to 8%. But SG&A can come down from 27% to 26% and below, because there are great ways to scale marketing through social media and digital marketing. There are great ways to scale our sales force and how we go to market in different countries.","And so we've got a lot of very exciting plans for the next fiscal year and beyond, in terms of driving our go-to-market strategy that I very strongly believe will drive better operating and SG&A particularly leverage as we grow forward.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Anthony Petrone from Jefferies is on line with a question.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Two quick ones for me. Maybe just on masks, generally just an update on the pricing environment overall and as you get up to speed with some of the new offerings out of the supply issues, do you expect, perhaps, a little bit of premium pricing on the newer offerings?","And then maybe, just an update on inventory cycles, receivables, cash, it looks like inventories ticked up a bit as well and just trying to reconcile that with the supply constraints? Thanks, again.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah, thanks for the questions, Anthony. I'll hand the first part of the question to Jim Hollingshead to talk about pricing and the second part to Brett.","James Hollingshead - ResMed, Inc.","Hi. Thanks, Mick. Hey, Anthony, thanks for the question. What we're seeing is a pretty normal pricing environment relative to historical. And so, we're not seeing any unusual declines in pricing. We're seeing the same steady, moderate annual ASP declines that we generally see historically in the industry.","All of our mask offerings are priced at a premium. We're the market leader. We're the strongest provider in the industry and we have premium pricing. The new mask themselves also are at a premium to the, well, with the existing portfolio.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC","That's helpful.","Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. And then, Anthony, just on the inventory, some uptick there, but we definitely rebuilding through the supply chain to support the new product introductions and to get us into that good strong supply position. So an element of that is building for that and you see that reflected at June 30 in the inventory balances.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks for the questions, Anthony.","Operator","Suraj Kalia from Northland Securities is on line with a question.","Suraj Kalia - Northland Securities, Inc.","Good afternoon, everyone. So, Mick, two questions from my side, first on Brightree, can you quantify the OUS or ex-U.S. opportunity for us?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks for the question, Suraj. Yeah, Brightree has been laser-focused on the U.S. HME industry and has an emerging vertical that they're building in home health and hospice. And so, we think the value provided is incredible there. The skill sets, so none of the existing modules, if you like, from Brightree would be copied and pasted into our German business or to our French business. But the capabilities of running a Software-as-a-Service business, getting strong annually recurring revenue, monthly recurring revenue from customers, having them pay for the software per user per month is a very strong capability.","So, we think that out of hospital Software-as-a-Service capability is an incredible strength that ResMed now has, and we are looking to, as I said in the prepared remarks, expanding home nursing and expanding home health and expanding hospice within the U.S. environment.","We're also looking to expand our Software-as-a-Service offerings in France and Germany, and the UK, probably not with the direct copy and paste, it's more of a longer-term approach than that. Some things that we are looking to copy and paste and in fact have already started to do that are in the area of the Air Solutions ecosystem, including AirView and myAir.","So the AirView software for physicians and for homecare providers has already been set up with service based in Europe, according to European law or with European security protocols and in line with the needs of our European customers, so AirView is going there.","In addition, myAir, the patient app, that's universal, right. Humans are the same no matter where they are. And just translating it into French or into German or into Japanese is the pathway and making sure that we have all the right engagements around local law and security and so on. So, that's where the scale is in AirView and myAir and then the capability longer-term with regard to Brightree.","Suraj Kalia - Northland Securities, Inc.","Fair enough. And, Mick, one last question, this might be a na\u00efve question, Mick. So let's say I have to order a resupply or reorder a mask, whether a full face nasal or what may be and let's say that N20 and F20 is not available, what happens to that patient? I guess, I'm just trying to understand if there were supply issues, did those patients stick with their existing masks? Did they go to the N10 or F10 in the interim or if you can just help us reconcile because I'm looking at the 4% Americas mask number. Part of me is like, that the patients \u2013 are they waiting for these new masks to come online or did they switch to N10 and F10? Any color would be great. Thank you for taking my questions.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah, Suraj, that's a really good question and one thing that we talked about internally when we saw supply constraints was focusing to make sure that we had resupply for customers versus going after a new patient sale. And so, as I said, there were some perishable sales lost in the first half of the quarter of some new patients that we wouldn't have got on to a ResMed mask and the customer will make a choice whether they went to an N10 or F10 or to a competitor's mask, and losing six weeks or eight weeks of first (01:02:15) is a bad thing to do.","But what's worse is, to your point, not being able to resupply an existing customer. And so we've really worked with our homecare customers to make sure that any resupply needs from \u2013 and the mask had only been out there six to nine months and so it wasn't a huge population resupply but that the supply was focused on resupply of patients who had already loved the N20 and F20, so that we continue to have those patients. Really our homecare customers continue to have those patient supply with ResMed masks for their life and so that was a nuance during the quarter.","I'd see we're just past the bottom of the hour and so we should probably end the Q&A there, Mariama.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. We are now at the one-hour mark. So, I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Great. Thanks. And I guess, I could handle this myself. But thanks Mariama. In closing, I want to thank the now more than 6,000 strong ResMed team, here at ResMed (01:03:14) diligently driving execution of N20, F20, AirTouch and many new launches as well as the future pipeline, and even more innovative products and software solutions that we will launch as we move ahead.

My name is Adrean, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note this conference is being recorded.","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Constance Bienfait, Director of Investor Relations at ResMed. Constance, you may begin.","Constance Bienfait","Thank you, Adrean, and thank you all for joining us today. The company has asked me to address certain matters.

Peter, go ahead.","Peter C. Farrel","Thank you coming for that exciting introduction. Thank you again for joining us and I will begin with some summary remarks and then turn the call over to Bret Sandercock, CFO for more financial details. And then of course, as usual take questions.","So first, a brief financial summary, which as I said Bret will fill in the details a little bit more later. We finished with another extremely robust quarter, you might be well and truly tired of hearing this. But this now represents a 72 consecutive record quarter for 18 straight calendar years in which we have grown the top line.","Global revenue in the second quarter of 2013 grew 13% to $377 million, up 14% on a constant currency basis. Revenue in the Americas grew 16% to $212 million and ROW revenue increased 10%, or 12% in constant currency terms to $165 million. We believe that our continued market growth has been driven by, primarily by two factors.","First, the fact that more people are finally beginning to accept that untreated sleep-disordered breathing is in fact the major public health problem.","And secondly our superior product quality coupled with our full solution offerings, which I will come back to in a moment. Net income for the quarter increased 24% to $78 million, while GAAP EPS increased 26% to $0.53 for the quarter. If we exclude amortization of acquired intangibles, EPS was a record $0.54.","Our global growth in flow generators this quarter was primarily driven again by our high-end devices with strong sales of AutoSet, bilevels, and our Adaptive Servo-Ventilation products, the VPAP Adapt, as well as Stellar 100 and 150 products.","And as we had originally anticipated, having our PAP products configured on the smaller quarter and more appealing S9 platform has worked out quite successfully. We also believe we continue to take share in the AutoSet space, as well as continued to gain back share in bilevels, and there is still a plenty of room for us to continue to grow.","The new EasyCare Online Compliance Management system continues to be adopted broadly and we are seeing solid uptick from both existing as well as new accounts.","Products and programs which provide superior therapy and better compliance, bring value to patients, customers, and payors. It\u2019s all about driving outcomes for these constituencies and having the data to drive compliance and the hearings to improve lives and save healthcare costs is the right space to be.","With respect to Masks, all categories continued to do well. Mask Accessories also grew quite strongly, but large and small HMEs continue to see the benefits by themselves and patients and being able to be more systematic about supplying replenishment products to those patients who need them.","With the great success of our recent mask offerings, we are reaping the benefits of the great supply of these masks as patients remain happy to stay with what has been most comfortable and effective for them.","And I\u2019m proud to announce that on behalf of the ResMed team, ResMed has emerged as the most preferred mask brand based upon a statistically significant global study done in the timeframe, August to September last year by UK-based market research firm, DVL Smith. The sleep apnea patient survey with current PEP users and use their device for at least four nights per week and they were all using every mask top that is full face, nasal or pillows, and also that we are using all brands.","Now immediately, we initiated and paid to the cost of the study, but we had no input whatsoever to the studies conclusions, so we\u2019re very pleased about that. With that said, we are keeping a watchful eye on the recently released competitive masks. Also as an aside, we plan to launch our own suite of ResMed masks during the latter part of this year, or during this calendar year.","Turning to the rest of the world and despite the fact that there is still a lot of economic uncertainty in Europe, the UK, and Germany and France in particular. These territories, Germany, France, and the UK delivered solid quarterly results. And regardless of the challenging economic climate and covenant fiscal restraints, the market is still focused on treatment which keeps patients out of the hospital and keeps them healthy. Sleep-disordered breathing treatment does this in spades.","France has just initiated a new telemonitoring requirement to track complaints and we think this is an appropriate step and bodes well for us a period in the monitoring solutions. AutoSet CS, which is our Adaptive Servo-Ventilator product in Europe, and the Stellar products again did well in most parts of Europe. The Asia-Pacific region also had a solid quarter with robust sales in Japan, particularly with Stellar and also AutoSet CS, our ASP product as I said, as well as the Bi-Level product portfolio. There is also great focus on compliance in Japan with data capture hopefully lessening the need for so many physician visits, or at least shortening the time the patient needs to spend in the physicians\u2019 office.","With respect to Ventilation, the VPAP ST-A is making inroads in most geographies. And as I\u2019ve already mentioned sales of Stellar are quite robust, especially in Germany and Japan. In the U.S, we are in the process now of hiring respiratory care managers to go on referral points in hospitals. And we expect this to drive our home ventilation sales.","On the HST or Home sleep testing front, about 60% of commercially covered U.S adult lives are now under a pre-authorization requirement for attended PSG or Polysomnography in an effort by payers to steer providers and patients towards HST. This is anticipated together 75% of commercially covered loss by the spring.","We estimated the end of 2012 about 25% of all sleep tests for HST. And we expect this number to grow to 50% or over by the end of this calendar year. We continue to see a steady increase in the number of sleep labs involved in HST averaging about 35% in the last 12 months, which rose to 40% in November in response to pre-authorization enforcement. We are also involved in primary care physician awareness initiatives as HST continues to advance with PCP becoming increasingly more important in the diagnosis and management of the sleep apnea patient.","As flagged in the press release, we\u2019ve been pioneering a market dynamic for several years that is now starting to get traction. The sleep market is not just about selling equipment in order to treat SDB, but it is about forming relationships with our customers, the HMEs and the payors. The combination of our range of high quality flow generators, the best and most comfortable masks and accessories and easy to access robust data makes ResMed in our view, the best value proposition for all providers. In short, we provide for full integration.","The sleep market is one of the first healthcare markets to actually provide useful treatment data and has done so for about a decade. Good growth would account for using EasyCare Online is evidence of its value. We feel we are also getting traction with payors in making the case for CPAP therapy.","With more understanding of the prevalence and severity of sleep-disordered breathing and obviously it\u2019s association with chronic comorbidities such as heart failure, diabetes, good depression and so on, the case to reimburse SDB therapy and authorization and continues resupply makes more and more sense. And as evidenced by the shift to pre-authorization to PSG, payors understand that HST is making sleep testing easier and cheaper for everyone.","In addition, putting patients on Autoset rather than straight CPAP, even after in live sleep test is more efficient to the HME and in fact more effective for the patient.","As recognized time and again treating SDB has proven to be preventative from multitude of other more severe and costly care comorbidities certainly more costly than simply treating sleep-disordered breathing. In short, it is easy to make a compelling case for the payors. As we\u2019ve noted many times over the diagnosis and treatment of SDB is the holy grail of medical treatment for three reasons. It drastically improves patients\u2019 quality of life, it slows down and even improves concomitant kind of morbidities and additionally reduces in patient and out-patient costs.","Now, let me turn the call over to Brett for some additional financial detail, and then we\u2019ll take question. So over to you Brett?","Brett Sandercock","","Great, thanks, Peter. Revenue for the December quarter was $376.5 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. Unfavorable currency movements reduced our second quarter revenues by approximately $4.1 million. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 14%. Income from operations for the quarter was $92.1 million, an increase of 37% over the prior year quarter.","Net income for the quarter was $77.9 million, an increase of 24% over the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.53, an increase of 26% over the prior year quarter. Gross margin for the December quarter was 61.8%, up sequentially from Q1 FY13.","On a sequential basis our gross margin continue to benefit from a favorable product mix. Looking forward, we expect our gross margin for fiscal year 2013 to be in the range of 60% to 62%, assuming current exchange rates. We continue to execute on initiatives targeted at improving our global manufacturing supply chain and logistics cost structures.","SG&A expenses for the quarter were $107.8 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency term, SG&A expenses increased by 8%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 28.6% compared to the year ago figure of 30.2%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 28% to 29% for fiscal year 2013.","R&D expenses for the quarter were $30.3 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, R&D expenses also increased by 11%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 8.1% compared to the year ago figure of 8.2%.","Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 8% for fiscal year 2013, reflecting a continuing strong Australian dollar and also continued investment in our product pipeline.","Amortization of acquired intangibles was $2.5 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $9.5 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.8% compared to the prior year quarter effective tax rate of 24.2%. The lower tax rate reflects the benefit of lower effective tax rate in our Singapore and Australian operations. We currently estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2013 will be in the vicinity of 21% to 22%.","On December 7, 2012, the IRS released their final regulations for the medical devices excise tax. Following our valuation in the regulations, we believe a relatively small number of our products are subject to the medical device tax and as such estimate the annualized financial impact from the tax to be less than $1 million.","Turning now to revenue in more detail; overall sales in the Americas were $211.8 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter. Sales outside the Americas totaled $164.7 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas increased by 12% over the prior year quarter.","Breaking out revenue between product segments; in the Americas, flow generator sales were $93.7 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter, reflecting strong growth in our APAP and Bi-Level devices. Masks and other sales were $118.1 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter, underpinned by strong contributions across our masks product range and continued growth in accessories.","For revenue outside the Americas, flow generator sales were $108.9 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms, an increase of 11%. Masks and other sales were $55.9 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 16%. Globally, in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 13% while masks and others increased by 16%.","Cash flow from operations was $93.6 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $13.8 million, while depreciation and amortization for the December quarter totaled $19.3 million.","Our share buyback continues to play a major role in our capital management program. During the quarter, we repurchased 1 million shares for consideration of $40 million. For the first half of fiscal year 2013, we have repurchased 1.2 million shares for consideration of $48.1 million.","At the end of December, we had approximately 7.6 million shares remaining under our authorized buyback program. During fiscal year 2013, we intend to purchase at least 2 million shares under our share buyback program. In addition to our buyback program, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share consistent with our previously advised dividend policy.","Our balance sheet remains very strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $657 million. And at December 31, total assets stood at $2.3 billion and net equity was $1.8 billion.","I\u2019ll now hand the call back to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Thank you. We\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) And we have Dan Hurren from UBS online with the question. Please go ahead.","Dan Hurren \u2013 UBS","","Well, good morning, everyone, thanks for taking my question. I would just like to explore that a little bit about product launches and is there anymore detail on what product launches are required do you think to maintain growth as the comps gets tougher through the second half?","Peter C. Farrell","Well, Dan, as you are aware, we\u2019ve been on this kick for many years and then we typically come out with new mask offering, somewhere in the timeframe of nine to 12 months, and new devices tend to be more like 18 months to two years. So this was just continuing what we normally do, but the focus is on improving comfort, reducing noise, and also attending to reduce COGS. But maybe I will throw that question for more detail to Don Darkin, and Don, would you like to say a few words about product releases?","Don Darkin","This is Don. We\u2019ve currently had a fairly robust pipeline over the last three to five years. We are really just following that plan out. We\u2019ve got a number of offerings in all segments coming through this calendar. And it\u2019s just wisely relying about as planned previously. So as Peter mentioned, they are addressing the main high points of mainly in comfort and costs. But essentially they will be \u2013 we are fairly comfortable that they will be through this fiscal end calendar year launching.","Dan Hurren \u2013 UBS","Okay, thanks very much. And one just that is on a different track. Can you just remind us again on the potential new flow from the SERVE-HF study et cetera?","Peter C. Farrell","Right. At the end of January we\u2019ll be pretty much at the full complement of patients for the study. But and we\u2019ve got some studies ongoing which probably won\u2019t complete their patient requirements until the end of May. But we are looking at a \u2013 still a couple of years. We had a meeting on the cardiovascular space just this week. And people are feeling pretty comfortable with the compliances being addressed the way it should be addressed that the units mainly in Germany, but also Germany and France together with the bulk of all the clinical centers. We seem to be on track, and people are quite satisfied with where we are, but it\u2019s still early days in terms of any results. Perhaps I could also add we are planning a study which will be run in the U.S., not on IFU or an indications for use study, that is not an FDA approved study, but a study done with a prestigious university, well, let\u2019s say, I will give it out, Duke. And we are just dotting the Is and crossing Ts for Chris O'Connor, who is the Chair of Cardiology at Duke, not everything has been put to bed, but we are going to do a study which doesn\u2019t have mortality and morbidity as the endpoints, but rather six-minute walk quality of life, injection, fraction and so on, and we are actually quite excited by that, particularly based on some of the data that I\u2019ve referred to before coming out of Japan.","Dan Hurren \u2013 UBS","Okay. And we shouldn't expect any study this year?","Peter C. Farrell","And we think that\u2019s a study that, what you said Dan?","Dan Hurren \u2013 UBS","I'm sorry to interrupt. I just said that we shouldn't really expect any sort of incremental news this year from those studies.","Peter C. Farrell","No, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily. You will get a lot of \u2013 we expect a lot of good anecdotal reports, but nothing perspective, randomized controlled trial, peer review stuff if you like. But\u2026","Dan Hurren \u2013 UBS","All right.","Peter C. Farrell","But we will still be keeping you up to date with, met our analyses and smaller studies, if you like.","Dan Hurren \u2013 UBS","","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) And we have David Clair online with questions from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","David Clair \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. First one, just, Peter, real quick, where do you think we are in the mix shift that's kind of been benefiting the flow generators? I mean how much more room for shifts at the higher-end devices do you think we have here?","Peter C. Farrell","Well, I think there is a fair amount of runway there David. I mean, it's sort of sticking your finger in the air to try to guess at it. But all I can say is the momentum is clearly there and you\u2019re not going to see very much usage of sleep labs of pressure setting. And the fact is that there are now enough peer reviewed papers in the literature comparing our AutoSetting devices with fixed CPAP. And in fact, if you look carefully at the data, the data are more in favor of APAP than they are in favor of fixed CPAP in terms of compliance and compliance in terms of the number of hours patient spends on the device.","And it really makes no sense at all given those data and we\u2019ve sold \u2013 how many APAPs you think we've sold now? I know it's somewhere in the 2 million area. I mean it\u2019s not like we haven\u2019t got pretty of data on these devices. And it makes no sense to go to a sleep lab to have the pressure set.","I mean it\u2019s just you better off on an AutoSetting device, which is what we\u2019ve been saying for the last decade and the data are now there to prove it. And it\u2019s just an added inefficiency to go to a sleep lab to set a pressure. It\u2019s an added expense, it makes no sense to send the money and you\u2019re not getting any benefit, so we\u2019d say continuing. And particularly now with 75%, shortly 75% of commercially covered lives requiring pre-authorization, this horse has got plenty of puff.","Dan Hurren \u2013 UBS","Okay. And then, for Brett, the tax rate guidance you provided and the gross margin guidance, I mean this quarter we were at the low on the tax side, and this is the second quarter in a row where gross margin has been north of that 61% midpoint. I mean, is this conservativism, or should we be expecting something in the back half of the year?","Brett Sandercock","Dan, I think as you can see, we've been sort of tracking at the high end of that range, and I suppose what I'd say is we're comfortable with that 60% to 62%. If you look at some of the product mix trends and they probably got some time to play out, then you could make the case that would be sort of the higher end of that range I suppose. But I would say, look, we're very comfortable with the range we\u2019ve given. But as you can see that, trend-wise we\u2019ve been at the higher end of that range.","Dan Hurren \u2013 UBS","And the tax rate, Brett?","Brett Sandercock","Yeah, the tax is really sort of reflects \u2013 sort of full-year tax calculations around the 21% to 22%, I think way we will be for the fiscal around that area.","Dan Hurren \u2013 UBS","Okay. Thanks guys. Congrats on a great quarter.","Brett Sandercock","Thanks, David.","Operator","We have Saul Hadassin from Credit Suisse online with the question. Please go ahead.","Saul Hadassin \u2013 Credit Suisse","Good morning. Can you hear me?","Peter C. Farrel","Yes, Saul.","Saul Hadassin \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks. Peter, just picking you up on your comments about the data suggesting that CPAP, in fact, gives more compliance with the AutoSet training devices. Does that give you more confidence or any confidence that you might actually see a HCPCS code from Medicare for the APAP device?","Peter C. Farrel","Well, Saul, that's been in the hopper for so long, I mean it's almost since the birth of my first child. There've been so \u2013 CMS has just drawn a line in the sand on that. It would be nice if it were to happen. I just don\u2019t see it. I mean we went \u2013 in years past, we spent a lot of time providing data going back and explaining that this is a completely different animal because it gives roughly a 40% lull of pressure through the night. It tracks to what the patient actually needs in the upper airway. And therefore, QED it's a different animal. And they just haven\u2019t accepted the logic, so I don\u2019t expect that to change. It will be nice, but I just don\u2019t expect it to change.","Saul Hadassin \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. Thanks and just one last question is also for you, Peter. You had some good color on the adaptive fee or the AutoSet in Europe and Japan. I'm just wondering how is that adaptive fee going in the US, and is that a device where you really need to wait for that data from the SERVE-HF study trial to see meaningful sales there?","Peter C. Farrell","Well, Saul, we\u2019ve had data going back for almost a decade. And it's interesting when you look at the Japanese data and now it\u2019s not. If you are looking at the U.S. market, the Japanese data would be considered not tight enough, not near the protocols, not enough focus on randomized control trials and so forth. But we did sort of introduce the data from 25 centers in Japan to various people here. And I\u2019ve noted before that in Japan, cardiologists are actually doing the sleep studies themselves, I mean, it just so happens that the infrastructure there is conducive to that. But cardiologists are now putting patients onto adaptive servo ventilation treatment, the AutoSet CS without the patient having frank sleep disorder breathing.","And the reason is that they maintain, well first of all, there\u2019s been nothing new under the sun and in the treatment of Congestive Heart Failure for decades or at least a couple of decades. And they know that the drying out of the lungs, drying out of the pleura area around the heart and the patients are just doing much better.","So we believe that by getting the word out to people that this will have an impact on the sales. Also, the fact that the SERVE-HF trials what we\u2019ve seen particularly in Germany and France. What we\u2019ve seen is the fact that you have seen your heart failure specialists who are involved in the study and they are seeing positive results with the patients and so we\u2019re seeing an up tick in sales just by the fact that they are involving clinical trials.","So you\u2019re right, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re not sitting back, waiting for a couple of years for a study to be completed. We\u2019re out there marketing the products and we\u2019re doing whatever we can within the law and within the regulatory environment to draw people\u2019s attention to have valid, we believe these data are.","Saul Hadassin \u2013 Credit Suisse","All right, thanks a lot Peter.","Peter C. Farrel","Thank you, Saul.","Operator","And we have Ben Andrew from William Blair on line with the question. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Andrew \u2013 William Blair & Company","Good afternoon Peter.","Peter C. Farrel","Ben, how are you? ","Benjamin Andrew \u2013 William Blair & Company","I\u2019m well thanks. A question for you relative to mix as well as kind of customer behavior, what chunk of the time do you, number one, see people start out a patient on an auto and downgrade them eventually just to kind of switch out that cheaper device? I understand the clinical argument favored, but what percent of the time do you actually see that? And do you anticipate it getting a bit more difficult to make the economic arguments after we get implementation of Round 2?","Peter C. Farrell","Gosh, Ben, I just we have no visibility to those sort of data at all. But look \u2013 asking, I mean I am not aware of any large scale switching to \u2013 I mean, I know some of the hybrid DMEs will use AutoSetting and then switch the patients to cheaper device, but I'll throw that to Mick, do you have any comment?","Michael J. Farrell","Yeah, Ben, that model may have applied five to 10 years ago with the ratio of an AutoSet to CPAP device was three to one. Now, you are talking more like a 1.25 to 1 and the delta, the price difference between the two, given the whole price compression that's been happening that 3% to 5% we talked over these last years is a minimal delta and $75 at least to get somebody to go to the patient's home and change the device and then you\u2019ve got to ensure the settings are right, and you can have complications and return visits.","So the economic argument has driven to first time setup on APAC with all home sleep testing, but as we said in the preamble, some PSG testing is now looking at APAP applicator as well. And it\u2019s because it drives compliance, adherence, and keeps the patient on therapy and adapts the changing needs, breathing position, change in drug regimen, change in weight, many, many factors.","So the mix shift from CPAP to APAP is industry wide and we believe that plays to our strengths where the Autoset is superior to its competitors in that category, and they really are very few players, I would say, looking at a VPAP or APAP initial period and then moving a patient down to basic CPAP, because of the long-term complications that they see in the changer and long-term upside basically in iPad keeping the patient on therapy and keeping the patient out of hospital for payer and high quality life of the patient and for HME keeping them coming back to order replenishment masks and accessories.","Brett Sandercock","So I guess you can summarize it then most things the inconvenience in with the current build between what does it cost you for an AutoSet and what it cost for a regular CPAP. But I mean it\u2019s kind of like wide boarder?","Benjamin Andrew \u2013 William Blair & Company","Okay. And then, Peter, have you guys had conversations with any of the larger homecare dealers or even the GPOs that address some of those groups relative to their approach after Round 2? And again, we know the experience in Round 1. We've heard you guys answer that question quite a few times. But what sort of differential do you expect when you increase it by a factor of 10, and what sort of conversations are you having? Thank you.","Peter C. Farrel","Well, I haven\u2019t had conversations. We all through that to Dave, Dave has been thinking about Round 2 quite a bit and maybe making comment. But Dave do you want to go first on that.","David Pendarvis","Sure, Ben, with regard to this use of AutoSet in connection with home sleep testing. I think a lot of that\u2019s occurring more on the commercial side rather than the Medicare side. For example all of the pre-authorization requirements that have been a large part of driving the shift towards more at home diagnosis is on the commercial side, not on the Medicare. So I\u2019m not sure any reimbursement changes on the therapy on the Medicare side really going to have a significant impact on this mix shift to auto.","But certainly we have conversations with trade associations about what should we be doing as an industry together with converse or with CMS and others about affecting competitive bidding on the progress and how CMS is rolling it out and how the various bills that are in Congress are passing. So we\u2019re certainly talking with them about those types of issues. But I guess I would throw to make in terms of actual behavior. But I think our customers have gotten pretty comfortable overall with the idea that competitive bidding is coming in other MSAs that they didn't have it before. They don\u2019t expect any large change in terms of customer behavior either in terms of how they\u2019re guessing patient needs or equipment selection equipment selection or how they\u2019re focusing on the business generally.","Unidentified Company Representative","The only thing I add to Dave\u2019s comments, which is right on track is that, we\u2019re partnering with customers. We have discussions with them everyday about the processing environment Round 2 could not have been more publicized, probably, frankly more so in our investor and analyst community than it is with our commercial discussions that we have on a daily basis, because its part of the course. We know its happening. We know its going to hit July 1.","Obviously they like on saying what the results were as they work through those results. But we\u2019ve been having discussions with customers over the last two years on this. I know you asked not to use that expense in those nine cities for the 91, but as the business guy been involved in this, we have experienced that those discussions happen.","We partnered with the winners. So what we plan to do, when it goes 10x is partner with the winners again. And we have a pretty good idea of who that will be. The partners who think about long-term compliance and adherence and the people who will pick up those orphan patients from some of the small folks, who may go out of business, so we know the plan, we have got it ready to put in place and we partner with our customs on it.","So to summarize, Dave\u2019s point, we are looking at the AAHomecare and the large industry groups, but we are also working with customers on the second front on a daily basis and we\u2019re ready to grow through competitive bidding on too.","Benjamin Andrew \u2013 William Blair & Company","Great, thanks guys. ","Operator","And we have Matthew Prior from Bank of America online with the question. Please go ahead.","Matthew Prior \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Hi good morning guys. My two questions, are you guys focused on the contracts that you make? Mick, I guess compared to bidding Round 2, there\u2019s been several delays. Can you give us any kind of thoughts you have around timing for the announcement of that?","And just I\u2019m really interested in the pricing dynamics between CPAP and APAP given some manufacturers are pushing out lower pricing on CPAPs, you\u2019re focusing on APAPs, HST forces the APAP to switch, and I guess I\u2019m concerned somewhat that you could see more pricing aggression in CPAP that could drag down APAP as they fit under the same code?","Michael J. Farrell","Yeah, although I mean they are both on the E0601 code and we talk about that earlier, that\u2019s not going to change. We tried that five times. But the mix shift to APAP will continue. There will continue to be price pressure on both CPAP and APAP in a competitive market that what\u2019s happens.","Unfortunately, we don\u2019t have any special intel as to why Washington is moving slowly, other than if the government and they\u2019ve got 10 times the number of data coming through and probably the payment wasn\u2019t much bigger than Round 1 looking at it. So we don\u2019t have a date as to when that\u2019s going to come. But we\u2019re reasonably confident in our range of expectations as to what the reductions will be based up on Round 1 and some good surveys have been done across the group. But we\u2019ll see the data when we come to it.","In terms of low-cost players in the CPAP space and its impact on APAP, there is certainly an impact there. But if you don\u2019t have an APAP, you can\u2019t compete in the category of the market requires an APAP. So it\u2019s really two or three horse race, maybe four in that space. But it\u2019s a category that we plan to grow, and we have the best algorithms, and we\u2019ve done well so far. Connie, I don't know if you've any further intel into what\u2019s happening with CMS on that front?","Constance Bienfait","As Mick said, we expect that any day now as it\u2019s later than fall. So we\u2019re hearing noises that maybe next week. But we don\u2019t know anything more than the rest of you.","Matthew Prior \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, Thanks. That's good to hear to the extent they're keeping it all under wraps. But I guess my second question just focusing on that issue of compliance and more so informatics. Can you talk to what percentage now of the second and third tier DMEs are running a compliance system like EasyCare Online, and in your discussions with them in the late uptick competitive bidding? Do you think that's going to be a market share winner for ResMed or the other players?","Peter C. Farrell","I\u2019ll hand the second part of this question on to Don Darkin, because his team put together the healthcare informatics play EasyCare Online, which is penetrating across the group, but in terms of looking at the T\u2019s of HMEs in the U.S. market particularly, but across the America as the EasyCare Online was introduced, we had districts customers who have been on this platform for five to six years, who switched over within months, some of them weeks on to EasyCare Online.","The value proposition of EasyCare Online of having data available immediately in a very sort of outside Apple like user friendly iTunes like user friendly cloud environment has been incredibly powerful for not only the providers, the adjuvant providers, but really importantly the physicians who write the prescriptions and have access to those data.","And in future, to our customers\u2019 customers, for the providers to provide those data to payers and even in the future to patients as well, but specifically two questions, second and third tier, sort of large regional in the mom and pops really have started to adopt EasyCare Online because it\u2019s simple, it\u2019s easy, and it\u2019s available, and more and more prescriptions for connected S9 devices with wireless capability are coming to market, but those things been costliest sort of S curve adoption in EasyCare Online. I don\u2019t know Don, if you have any further comments on Hi or EasyCare Online?","Don Darkin","Yeah, thanks Pete. Matt, we are pretty impressed with the uptake. In fact, it has gone much quicker than we expected, and it's pretty much of sort of provided across all the DME groups. What we are seeing now is a slight connection between the uptick on the data for EasyCare Online and a push in the growth as well in that space. So we\u2019re quite pleased with that position.","And I\u2019m expecting with a small \u2013 we\u2019ve got a bunch of pending releases within that space both with EasyCare and some other software that we would continue to see a pretty big up tick in the adoption of that which also actually helps us with moving towards the APAP space as well for the data, so pretty positive.","Peter C. Farrell","And Matt just to add a bit more flavor you know on the issue of price pressures and cheaper products being available, if these guys can offer interim solutions and the robustness of the data management and the algorithms, I mean we\u2019re just not seeing \u2013 look, I\u2019m not saying we\u2019re complacent, that\u2019s the last thing we are, but we just don\u2019t see this as being a big deal.","Constance Bienfait","One other quick note on the timing Matt, the CMS has planned a bunch of webinars for the bidders and other constituencies in February. So if the numbers don\u2019t come out soon, they\u2019re going to have to push back the schedule for the whole year quite a bit.","Matthew Prior \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Thanks, guys. ","Operator","And we have Bruce Du from CDN on line with question. Please go ahead.","Bruce Du from \u2013 CDN","Thanks, guys for taking my question. Just in terms of the masked replenishment, I know you've given some update before, but you don't have sort of great detail in terms of end-user replacements. But can I ask in terms of the sort of US mass replenishment rates, what do you think the market is at currently and in particular whether or not you've come to see sort of more, some of the small to midsize DMEs really starting to push the replenishment story?","Unidentified Company Representative ","Well, there is no question that people are saying it as an opportunity and the more compliance improves and we have seen compliance improving effect talking to a guy who runs a small service company in Atlanta this morning and he surprised me by saying that they compliances 90%. So if you are getting that sort of compliance, you are going to obviously see impact on replenishment. ","And if you get right back to when CMS changes the rules and you got a share 30 days consistent years within 90 days period of a patient put on CPAP, then you are forced to get into the health informatics or at least track what\u2019s happening and that also cause people to improve their compliance. So that also has a very positive impact on replenishment, but the latest data I saw were it\u2019s still of the order, in fact a little less than two masks, two cushions per patient per year, but I will turn to Mick for further comments. ","Michael J. Farrell","Yeah Bruce and actually this dives back into Matt\u2019s question about the different tiers of HMEs right, so the large nationals, to the quantification, the large nationals have all adopted replenishment and I would say are executing pretty well on the current sleep test and we are working and partnering with them on that. The large regions, more than 50% of doctors, but there is still a lot of runway left on that large regional space.","The mom and pops very much under penetrated in this space and we through EasyCare Online, that\u2019s where it ties into Matt\u2019s question, through EasyCare Online penetrating its way into that that sort of mom and pop and small regional space will give them the facility and capability and some other software elements that don\u2019t into that that\u2019s linked to our Umbian acquisition and usually platform is that start to become available throughout the HME space can give far more capability for this masked replenishment to take off.","So if reimbursement allows 12 cushions per patient per year and we are solved two cushions per patients per year, and we are sub two cushions per patient. You can see there is a lot left on the runway and mask systems is more penetrated, but that cushions area, there is a lot of work to drive, no matter what happens on the reimbursement front.","So it\u2019s a balance across that and we are looking at how we empower the whole spectrum of our HME customer group across the small, medium and large segments and we have a team that is dedicated and focused to doing a consultant sales team that focus on this phase. So we are not just talking about it, we are taking action. ","Bruce Du from \u2013 CDN","Great. And just my second one was just in relation to your early comments in terms of potentially some masks product launches towards the end of this calendar year. Just I guess, the recent product launches you've seen from your competitors, I guess what are you seeing in terms of the feedback and how they're doing in terms of the nasal pillow category and also the full face mask category with some of those guys have launched? What are you seeing from the competitor products thus far?","Peter C. Farrel","Well, you probably saw one of the analyst reports was that in the last day or so, comparing the quality of the masks and across the Board, whether it\u2019s full face or whether it\u2019s nasal pillows or the nasal masks and Mirage effects, we are just significantly above the others in terms of patients and physician acceptance. So our current offerings are actually pretty damn good, but you can always improve and Don and I were chatting just before Christmas or around Christmas while I was in Sydney and Don was showing me through the new masks in the hopper and they are just hugely impressive, but even without talking about JFU I think what we\u2019ve got now is pretty good, you will in the future, we are not doing that, we continue to make improvements. ","Now when others release masks typically what we get at is, we got go hope, people are going to try them, but so the Respironics offerings and they got offerings across those three spaces, full face and pillows and nasal.  But we are still seeing better acceptance of our comp products and we expect that to continue. So you\u2019ve got a blip, people try stuff, but now we are seeing it reverse. ","Bruce Du from \u2013 CDN","Great thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ve Michael Matson from Mizuho Securities online with questions. Please go ahead. ","Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities","Thanks. I have trouble pronouncing it, too, sometimes. I guess, first of all, I guess I'm just curious there has been a lot of focus on the mix shift that you are clearly benefiting from with all the higher end products, but you know to the degree you're able or willing to answer it, I'm curious what you think the actual volume growth is in the market, both US and outside the US? Because, you know, the checks that I've been doing indicates that volume growth is actually pretty low, and obviously with these mix shifts, maybe you don't need a lot of volume growth, but I just want to see if I'm missing something, or does that seem reasonable?","Peter C. Farrel","Well, in terms of growth rates, we haven\u2019t changed in the last couple of quarters, based on the information that\u2019s coming from a variety of sources to us. So European growth is somewhere in the vicinity of 4% to 6%, 6% to 8% in the U.S. and maybe little nudged up a little higher in Asia\/Pac, 8% to 10% in terms of the overall market growth in terms of the volume of devices.","Now in terms of our specific business, no question that the benefit of HSTs to AutoSet is a huge plus, and as you know and we mentioned in the press release, all our products are now in the S9 platform, that is we\u2019ve seen this has had an extraordinary positive effect on the CPAP ST-A, but also on the adaptive servo ventilators, I mean we can bear in mind, there we went from an S7, which is almost like a car battery by comparison to this much more user-friendly lighter.","There were some changes in algorithm as well, we have gone to order rate, but so we have made improvements in both the size and to lesser extent the algorithms. And we're seeing if you like our Bi-Level business is coming back to where we believe it should be. And Michael, do you have any thing to add to that?","Michael J. Farrell","Yeah, hi, Mick and we saw your report that came out. I think one thing that when you look at the volumes and what the growth rate is and when we say the revenue growth rate in the Americas in 6% to 8%. It maybe that the volumes are slightly higher than that, I mean we have got mix shift as a positive, but then you\u2019ve got ASP declines in the 5% range that is a negative factor on that as well. We haven\u2019t talked publicly about volume numbers within devices, because we\u2019re the only public company that goes into this space, and whatever information we use is heard by our competitors, but we don\u2019t get the flip side of that.","But I think one area that maybe worthwhile adding to your research area is the leakage that happens throughout the pipeline when a patient goes into the pipeline. And patients sometimes when they get the referral onto PSG or HST leak out the system. Our research has shown when you have a choice between home sleep testing, particularly in PSG and even just offering the HST. You get less patients leaking out of the system.","So that would argue that even without the macroeconomic environment improving, which we think it probably is, you have that chance for lower leakage has HST goes from 12% a year ago to 25% this last calendar year to our projections are that is 35%, 45%, even some optimists at 50% by the end of this calendar year. So that leakage rate, we expect to reduce as home sleep testing comes to market. So that\u2019s just another parts put in the equation of patient flow volumes.","Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities","All right, I guess I\u2019m still a little confused just because it sounds like now you\u2019re seeing that the pricing, obviously peer price has been down. But I assume mix was more than offsetting that, maybe the difference is you\u2019re talking about the market more broadly, instead of ResMed specifically. But all right, so I guess my other question is just on Singapore. What portion of your production is going through Singapore at this point, and how much higher do you think that can go?","Peter C. Farrel","Well, we\u2019re north of 15%. We\u2019re heading to 75% and I don\u2019t know Rob, do you want to make a comment on that?","Robert Douglas","Yes Mike, it just stays as part of the long-term plan. We are putting growth in our production into Singapore, we're holding other facility steady. What will happen is we'll hit some capacity living in Singapore and then evaluate our next steps. But it\u2019s clear to say, that could easily go to 75%, but it will happen steadily and incrementally. We are also running production in Malaysia of headgear that was the result of an earlier acquisition of some business, so that\u2019s picking up that number a bit as well and our supply teams continuing to work on that strategy but in our growing business we can do this in a very organized way.","Unidentified Company Representative","And a little bit of advertizing here for Singapore, last month I was down there and had the pleasure meeting with the economic development board at least their healthcare sector people. And when the Singapore government talks about business and government and academe working together they actually walk to talk and then nice to the other countries where we\u2019re doing business, the United States or Australia they has done walk to talk, it\u2019s more of an anti business environment there like, it can be with taxes or unionization of whatever it is but the Singaporean government, they\u2019re just a pleasure, an absolute pleasure to work with ","Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities","All right, thanks a lot. ","Operator","And we have David Low from Deutsche Bank online with a question, please go ahead  ","David Low \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thank very much. Just a question on, we heard a couple of stories that Respironics have experimented with a direct to consumer model. Just wondering what ResMed\u2019s view is of that and whether you\u2019ve benefited from any backlash from the, say the Respironics side pushback ","Unidentified Company Representative ","Well you know if you go back a couple of years ago maybe three or four years ago, Philips actually flagged if they were looking into direct-to-consumer, so we weren\u2019t surprised by this statement to be honest. And Kroger is probably not a bad month to go where we have got 2000 outlets. But look I have heard a couple of stories that, there was one of the big DMEs and I listen you guys and they immediately withdrew, but then we heard that they only withdrew from the stores which were advertised, and it was still ongoing, but, Mick, you are closer to this than I am.","Michael J. Farrell","Hey, look, I think it\u2019s a great question about Philips. Basically, for those on the call who may not know, Philips worked on a pilot experiment with supermarket\/pharmacy chain called Kroger's, and they\u2019ve sent a letter to the industry about this, I am not breaching anything to this, they have made public. Their approach and experimentation with a pilot trial with a mass retail channel was provocative in a market.","The immediate question from customers to us was, well, are you guys going to follow and we said no and here is why, we think it\u2019s all about compliance and adherence, and ensuring that patient gets the best setup and the best chance to stick to seek that therapy. And that conversation with a physician, respiratory therapists, or some specialists in the space upfront talking about the comorbidities, heart failure, heart attack, hypertension, diabetes, morbid obesity upfront drives adherence. And the other part of it is just simple business models and what\u2019s won.","When you look at brick and mortar book stores, they are going out of business, the Amazon. So why would a patient who is compliant and happy with their mask want to pickup a cushion at Kroger's when they include if let\u2019s say, the HME had setup a good replenishment program and you could just click 1 on your phone or press Yes on a text or click on an iPhone app that maybe the HME had provided or through EasyCare Online or I\u2019m getting it provided for the patient.","So we think the best business model will win is the one that drives best compliance and adherence, showing the return on care and that is better business model HMEs and it\u2019s a wake-up call for HMEs. So if you don\u2019t service the patients with cash model options, right, where it\u2019s beyond reimbursement high deductible health plans, that someone else will fill that need.","So there wasn\u2019t a huge backlash in the quarter. Our growth numbers were based on solid performance. But it was an interesting experiment and it helped us create some conversations with our HMEs about reimbursement, cash business and replenishment that we think it was in line with our conversations before and was a catalyst for further discussions about maybe penetrating those large regionals and large mom and pops as to and even the small guys about how to drive replenishment, because if you don\u2019t do it, someone else will. That was a sort of experiment and summary from outside.","Peter C. Farrel","And if you\u2019re looking at direct to consumer, I mean one thing you could think more about is that to be more along of lines of a diagnostic system, in other words, something alerting to you that you have poor sleep quality or whatever and that\u2019s along the lines of sort of buying something in an Apple store or getting something from Omron measuring the wellness in this wellness category and then directing you to go to a sleep level, go to a sleep position or whatever.","And to Mick\u2019s point, if you don\u2019t get compliance, we all lose. And we\u2019re, frankly, pretty delighted with what we\u2019re hearing about compliance now, and surprisingly the government actually did something sensibly. So we\u2019re even more surprised at that. But the CMS, the 90-day, 30-day continuous user steam has been a positive of the marketplace. ","David Low \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Great. That's very helpful actually just on that same theme. Peter, you mentioned in France a change in requirements on telemonitoring. Can you give us a little bit more detail on what's exactly going on there, please?","Peter C. Farrell","Well, we are using the check book to force people to do data monitoring. You are going to get paid less if your device doesn\u2019t provide the appropriate telemonitoring, but Rob maybe you can say a few words about that. But we consider \u2013 we are on lovely, I mean really strong position with EasyCare Online and U-Sleep from Umbian and so on, but Rob do you want to add some more flavor?","Robert Douglas","Yeah, I\u2019d say the French bodies that are managing it, it really gets the economic case about sleep apnea and they want to make it even more efficient to treating, so there's been a discussion going on for about a year to implement this requirement for wireless monitoring effect of all patients and its been a tough discussion throughout the year, but its now reached a position where we know what to do. ","We have actually got our EasyCare Online system running in France and working well and we\u2019re going to provide the best online monitoring and the most efficient online monitoring service in France. It\u2019s going to be a very good solution that we will be providing there and the French authorities want to see this start real soon, and around the middle of the year, they will be expecting all new patients to be wirelessly monitored to seek development. ","Peter C. Farrell","And there is an economic incentive for people to do it for the healthcare providers, because they get paid more or they paid less if they don\u2019t provide this. And so well actually, they will go out of business ","Robert Douglas","","The reimbursement effectively changes midyear. You get paid less if you\u2019re not offering data monitoring","Peter C. Farrell","Well, the French reimbursement model, is sort of a fixed regular weekly fee, and that has got a plan for where that goes. And over time, like all issues in business, gradually decreases. But the rates, it won't decrease if you're on the telemonitoring. So it\u2019s an effective price differential coming in there for that.","Operator","We are now at the one hour mark. So I will turn the call back over to Dr. Peter Farrell for his final remarks.","Peter C. Farrell","Thank you, Adrean. Yeah, thanks everybody for listening and I think we will call it quit. And except to say that another great quarter from our team and I want to congratulate all ResMed employees for doing just an absolutely splendid job once again for our 72 record quarter; that\u2019s now 18 years, I sound like a broken record. So it\u2019s a pretty good record, which we are extremely proud of. So thanks to the guys and the team.","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference.

Earnings Conference Call. My name is Julie and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin.","Amy Wakeham","Great. Thank you, Julie. Good afternoon and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us, and welcome to ResMed's third quarter fiscal year 2019 earnings call. As Julie said, this call is being webcast live and the replay along with a copy of the earnings press release and our investor presentation will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website.","Joining me on the call today to discuss our quarterly results are Mick Farrell, our CEO; and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of management will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.","During today's call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures, please see the notes to the financial statements in today's earnings press release. As a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about ResMed's future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions; however, actual results may differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements.","With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick.","Michael Farrell","Thanks, Amy and thank you to all our shareholders for joining us today as we review results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2019. On today's call, I will discuss our long-term strategy. I will review top level financial results, some business highlights, and a few key milestones from the quarter. Then I'll hand the call over to Brett, who is with me here in Sydney, who will walk you through our financial results in more detail.","Before I get into the details, I would like to discuss ResMed's long-term strategy and our goal to include $250 million lives in 2025. Driven by a number of macro change such as an aging population, the increasing impact of chronic disease, chronic healthcare costs and a move towards digital transformation in healthcare. We see very exciting opportunities for ResMed.","Our goal is to empower people to live healthier lives outside of the hospital. Today there were a numerous pain points in existing care delivery models and in the quality of patient care that ResMed can address. You'll know healthcare costs are growing faster than GDP in many countries. And there aren't enough doctors to treat the people who need to be treated. When you couple that with the difficulty of getting the right care at the right time, delivering that health care in low cost setting and even further changes in challenges with interoperability, documentation, and clinical data availability.","It's a global healthcare system that is in the costs. When solutions in a microeconomic side, with ResMed's global leadership in digital health for sleep apnea or COPD and for outside of the hospital healthcare, we believe that these are problems that ResMed can solve faster and better than our competitors, providing superior value for our customers.","With that backdrop, I would like to quickly review our financial results. We achieved another quarter of strong revenue growth. We were up 12% in U.S dollar terms, and up 15% in constant currency terms. We benefited from a full quarter of revenue contribution from one of their latest acquisitions, MatrixCare. We also drove constant currency growth in domestic as well as international device styles.","Additionally, we had a very strong growth in masks and other accessories. Now I will talk some of the new mask orders a little lighter. We delivered operating leverage with Non-GAAP operating profit growth of 15% year-over-year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was a lot of about 89 things. We are proud of the top line and bottom-line performance from the global ResMed team. We expect to continue that success as we maintain fiscal discipline and invest in long-term growth of the global ResMed's business.","Now let's turn to a discussion of highlights across our sleep apnea and Respiratory Care businesses. And with MatrixCare businesses. In the device's product category, we delivered a good quarter with year-over-year constant currency growth of 6% globally, supported by 8% growth in the United States, Canada and Latin America in the category. We also achieved a return to constant currency growth for devices in Europe, Asia and the rest of the world.","As we discussed last quarter, we continue to cycle through strong year-over-year comparisons in both France and Japan, which were as a result of the digital health related reimbursement changes in those countries let drove the acceleration of the vast fleet device upgrades as the last number of quarters. Underlying patient activity in all geographies remains very healthy.","The masks and accessories side of our business was robust during Q3 growing globally at 13% in constant currency. In the U.S., Canada and Latin American geographies, masks markets grew at 13%. And in the Europe, Asia, and rest of world geographies, we grew at 12% in constant currency terms in masks. ","We continue to see excellent traction with the AirFit F20 in the full size category and the AirFit N20 in the nasal category. Our recent mask launches of the F30, the N30i and the P30i are all doing very well. Let me provide a little bit of color on each of these innovative products.","During October we launched the AirFit F30. This is an exciting innovation in the minimal contact full-face mask category. In January, we announced broad availability of our first tube up mask, the AirFit N30, which is in the nasal category. Both of these new masks, the F30 and the N30i contributed to our strong mask growth in Q3. After quarter end, just last month, we announced the launch of the AirFit P30i. This is a new tube up pillows options that complements our highly successful over many years P10 masks.","I have personally worn ResMed's nasal pillows technology for my own sleep apnea care every night for many years. A few years ago I thought nothing could beat the Swift FX, the pillows technology. Then I upgraded a few years ago to the P10. I\u2019m now looking forward to personally upgrading to the P30i, which has freedom of movement and the ability to enjoy better sleep. We believe that many other type sleep apnea patients not just the CEO, who have the same excitement after experiencing the P30i.","All these recent mask launches are important additions as we expand our mask portfolio to offer even more options to physicians and home care providers and are ultimately for the varying needs of the ultimate customer, a person who is suffocates every night. We remain focused on driving innovation to make underserved customer needs. We have an exciting product pipeline.","We are the industry leader in digital health technology. We announced supporting well over 10 million patients with AirView, our trial-based patient management system. And more than 9 million 100% cloud connectable ResMed devices in the market. Over the past 12 months, we've improved the lives of nearly 15 million people by delivering sleep apnea and COPD devices and full mask systems.","Our industry is changing, AirSense 10 device platform and the Air Solutions cloud-based software ecosystem are still seeing strong adoption. Our device market share continues to grow as healthcare providers and patients choose and physicians prescribe ResMed solutions. Our digital health technology solutions have been proven to improve both business, efficiencies and patient outcomes.","We are clearly the market leader, but we will never stop innovating in this space. The success of our connected health devices is producing an incredible data engine. We now have over 4 billion nights of medical sleep apnea and COPD data in the cloud. This was twice as many nights as we had just a year-ago. We're truly driving exponential digital health growth. Using advanced analytics, we are turning this clinical big data into clinical actionable insights.","We are focused on developing solutions to get the right healthcare, to the right patient, at the right time. And always more cost-effectively for all our customers. Everything we do supports our ambition to help more than 936 million people worldwide who suffocate every night with sleep apnea and the nearly 400 million people worldwide who suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.","As we expand our digital health platforms, one of that goals has been to take the success we've had with myAir and AirView in sleep apnea and replicate that within our respiratory care business vertical. Did I -- many patients with COPD and other respiratory condition, aren't getting the treatment that they made until it's too late. There are some frequent fliers at the hospital. We believe that technology combined with the medical equipment used to treat patients can add substantial value to improve both clinical outcomes and the patient experience.","Digital end-to-end solutions, connectivity, making information available to that ultimate customer, on their own smartphones and supporting patients through their the COPD, the disease progression to make a huge difference. Through digital health technology we are driving guidance with patients so I can benefit from the best therapy before it's too late. We've made good progress with cloud connectable AirCurve devices for noninvasive ventilation. And with Astral devices that have cloud connectable options for lot support ventilation.","Noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation solutions, three, -- Stage III and stage four COPD patients. Those were the insights of this dreadful disease. To meaningfully drive improved patient and clinical outcomes, our strategy growth and products had expanded to take a more holistic longer tubular view of the CFE patients journey. And to offer solutions for therapy and support through earlier stages of COPD. So that we can be there for the COPD patient from stage 1 all the way through to stage IV4 of their disease.","In early January, we moved Mobi, our premier portable oxygen concentrator, to a full product launch. Mobi best meets the needs of users and what to be mobile and enjoyed healthy active lives outside their home. Early results have met our expectations. We are about to commence sales of Mobi through our German team.","In the U.S., we are working in partnership with our HME customers to grow this category, the healthcare system reimbursed patients. And to use portable oxygen in situations where portable solution benefit the patient must. We also continue to test pilot and refine other potential go-to-market models with the ultimate goal to ensure that patients has the most efficient mask to a portable oxygen solution.","We expect the POC category to grow given very strong patient demand. We also expect that revenue will grow its share within the POC category. I want to be clear that we will take a long while for POC to be material mixed through our core sleep apnea and our core ventilation device businesses. So it's a long road ahead,","During the quarter, we added another significant element to our vision for longitudinal solutions in Respiratory Care when we closed on the previously announced acquisition of Propeller Health in January. Propeller's digital health solutions, help people and their doctors better manage COPD and asthma.","We are hoping with this new addition to round out ResMed's portfolio to treat COPD patients through all stages of their disease as I mentioned earlier. But that was sophisticated digital health platform leverage a small sensors that are attached to the pharmaceutical and higher ones. Along with a sophisticated cloud-based mobile application that automatically tracks the medication use and provides personal feedback, coaching, and insights to the individual, much like our sleep apnea patient engagement system just north of the same scale.","Propeller's clinically validated solutions have demonstrated incredible outcomes. Including a 58% improvement in pharmaceutical adherence, a 48% increase in symptom-free guide, a 53% reduction in emergency room visits. These are truly impressive pilot results and we cannot wait to scale them. In the same way we scale our digital medical device, ecosystem in sleep apnea and COPD to now 4 billion nights of medical data. Propeller is operating as a standalone entity with its dynamic and innovative management team is doing quite. It's gone through in San Francisco.","We are working with the propeller CEO, David Van Sickle, and his team to continue their momentum towards commercial style with the pharmaceutical customers as well as their health insurance customers. We had a board meeting last month and I\u2019m going to tell you I\u2019m very encouraged by the progress we are seeing. Earlier this quarter, Propeller announced publicly a partnership with Orion, which is a pharmaceutical company in Finland, and we\u2019re going to connect the propeller digital health platform to align easy and hyaline for both asthma and COPD patients.","Propeller Health is at the beginning of converting from pilot to scale and commercialization. We will empower the team to grow and to scale and bring all our skills to the table. The opportunities are vast. There are more than 60 million diagnosed COPD and after half of the patients in the United States and major markets in Europe alone.","Maybe these patients could benefit from Propeller Solutions and Propeller is the clear leader in digital health for inhaled pharmaceuticals. The evolution we\u2019ve made in our Respiratory Care business, I think is game changing. We are now even better positioned to become the global leader in digital health for COPD from stage I and stage 2 as well as our existing client Stage III and Stage IV COPD. We will continue to help physicians, providers, payers and patients as they manage this important progressive chronic disease.","Let's now turn to a quick discussion of our software-as-a-service business. And then I will hand over to Brett. The software-as-a-service portfolio continues its trajectory of excellent growth with revenue up 101% year-on-year on a reported basis, driven by continued expansion of Brightree and Healthcare first along with the first full quarter of contribution from our acquisition of MatrixCare.","On a pro forma basis compared to results in Q3 to the results of those visiting businesses before the acquisition, Brightree is growing in the mid to high single-digit range. And MatrixCare is growing at the low double-digit growth range. Overall we see significant growth opportunities for these fast [ph] businesses serving the out of hospital healthcare space with a lot of runway ahead.","The total addressable market is over $1.5 billion in out of hospital SaaS in the UNITED alone. Without competitive advantages and our leading positions in multiple SaaS verticals, we expect ResMed SaaS portfolio to move from high single-digit pro forma growth to low double-digit pro forma growth over the medium term and to be sustainable at that rate for the long-term. ","We\u2019ve started the process of integrating some of our SaaS portfolio assets. We recently transferred leadership of our home health and hospice offerings from Brightree and HEALTHCARE to under the MatrixCare management team. That will combine our strength in home health and hospice with private duty and beyond. This move will allow us to accelerate our product innovation and deliver a wide range of features for customers who have businesses across these verticals. It also supports our strategy of driving improved patient outcomes and business efficiencies for customers across all out of hospital healthcare settings. As our SaaS portfolio grows, I would like to reiterate the promise we made when we first acquired Brightree back in 2016. We're committed to protecting our customers business sensitive information.","We\u2019ve firewalls to do just that. I founded ResMed in 30 years ago. In 1989, the company was founded on the fundamentals of honesty, integrity. You\u2019re doing the right thing forward. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve always done and what we will always continue to do. We\u2019ve a vision to transform and significantly improve out of hospital healthcare. We have a strategy to enable better patient care, improved clinical decision support and drive interoperability across these healthcare settings.","The acquisitions we\u2019ve made of the past year, established ResMed after strategic player who is best positioned to lead this transformation in out of hospital healthcare. We now offer software solutions across out of hospital healthcare settings, from home medical equipment to home health and hospice to skilled nursing facilities, to senior living, to private duty and beyond. We're connecting capabilities across these platforms for these care settings, to help our customers be the most efficient they can be, to ultimately better serve people, to keep them out of the hospital and in a lower cost, higher quality setting of their choice as they age. And the best place is often their own home.","Together with our customers and partners, we are revolutionizing how healthcare is delivered. We are building an ecosystem of integrated digital solutions and services. The ultimate goal is to help individuals, aging individuals move seamlessly between these healthcare settings. So that they and their loved ones can receive optimal care and optimal quality of life with frictionless moves wherever they live. In parallel to helping individuals we will drive superior outcomes. So physicians, pilots and providers. We\u2019ve built the portfolio, now it's up to our SaaS team to execute and ultimately deliver on the promise of this strategy.","At the highest level, the mission of ResMed in our 2025 strategy is impact and improve 250 million lives in out of hospital healthcare. Our purpose is to empower people to live healthier, happier and a higher quality lives in the comfort of their own home. Our advantage comes from our focus on tech driven integrated care, from sleep apnea and COPD awareness to diagnosis, to treatment to management and then to ongoing therapy and healthcare management of chronic disease with digital health solutions.","Let me close with this before I hand over to Brett. We\u2019ve delivered a strong quarter. We are well-positioned for continued success throughout last quarter of FY 9. We are just in and beyond. The continued traction of our diversified mask and device portfolio along with our expanded lifeline of new products and enhanced digital health solutions for sleep apnea and COPD and out of hospital medical software, gives us confidence in our ongoing momentum as we look to the future. We\u2019ve positioned ResMed for the long-term as an innovative global leader in digital health. So we are just getting started.","With that, I will turn the call over to Brett for his remarks and then we'll open the ones up for Q&A. So over the table here in Sydney to you, Brett.","Brett Sandercock","Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2019. As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the March quarter was $662.2 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms revenue increased by 15%.","Taking a closer look that geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, our thousand U.S , Canada and Latin American countries with $350 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $232.3 million, a decrease of 1% over the prior year quarter.","However, in constant currency terms, sales in combined Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 6% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenue between product segments. U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $191.3 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. Mask and other sales were $168.7 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter.","For revenue in Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales were $155.2 million, a decrease of 3% over the prior year quarter, but in constant currency terms a 3% increase. Masks and other sales were $77.1 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms a 12% increase. Globally in constant currency terms, device sales were increased by 6%. while masks and other sales increased by 13% over the prior year quarter."," Software-as-a-Service revenue for the third quarter was $79.9 million, an increase of 101% over the prior year quarter. This includes revenue from our Brightree healthcare and MatrixCare businesses. During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measure adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles, and purchase accounting fair value adjustment to MatrixCare preferred revenue and tax related expenses associated with U.S tax reform.","The prior year comparable excludes amortization of acquired intangibles tax, related expenses associated with U.S tax reform and restructuring expenses. We\u2019ve provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our third quarter earnings press release. Our gross margin for the March quarter was 59.2%. Excluding the MatrixCare purchase accounting in the third revenue adjustment, now gross margins for the march quarter was 59.3% compared to 58.2% during the same quarter in the prior year. And 59.1% in Q2 FY19.","Compared to the prior year and our adjusted gross margin increased by 110 basis points predominantly attributable to manufacturing and procurement efficiencies. The MatrixCare acquisition and favorable product mix partially offset by typical declines in average selling prices. Excluding the deferred revenue fair value adjustment, the MatrixCare acquisition was accretive to our gross margin by approximately 50 basis points.","Assuming current exchange rates and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margin for the reminder fiscal year 2019 to be broadly consistent with our Q3 FY gross margin.","Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the third quarter were $164.5 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 17%. Excluding acquisitions, SG&A expenses increased by 6% on a constant currency basis. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 24.8% compared to the 25% that we reported in the prior year quarter. ","Looking forward and subject to currency movements and taking into account our recent acquisitions, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be broadly in the range of 25% to the balance of fiscal year 2019. R&D expenses for the quarter were $47.6 million, an increase of $0.27 over the prior year quarter or in constant currency basis an increase of 32%.","Excluding acquisitions, R&D expenses increased by 6%, reflect the incremental investments across R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7.2% compared with 6.3% in the prior year. Looking forward subject to currency movements and taking into account our recent acquisitions, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% of the balance of fiscal year 2019.","Amortization of acquired intangibles $22.8 million for the quarter, an increase of 95% over the prior year quarter, reflecting the impact from our recent acquisitions. Stock-based compensation expense in the quarter was $12.8 million. Non-GAAP, GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $192 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter. While non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $128.1 million, a decrease of 3% over the prior year quarter.","Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.89, a decrease of 3% over the prior year quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.73. Foreign exchange movements positively impacted third quarter earnings by $0.01 per share, reflecting the favorable impacts from the weaker Australian dollar relative to the U.S dollar which were partially offset by the weaker euro.","On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the March quarter was 23.6%. On a non-GAAP basis our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.4%.,We estimate that our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 will be in the range of 21% to 23%. Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was $139.6 million, reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management.","Capital expenditure for the quarter was $15.1 million. Depreciation and amortization for the March quarter totaled $41.8 million. During the quarter, we paid dividends of 53 million. On January 7, 2019 we closed on our previously announced acquisition of Propeller Health for consideration of $225 million net of cash acquired and that assumes a joint venture with Verily continued operations during the quarter and we recorded equity losses of $6 million in income statement in the March quarter associated with the joint venture.","We expect to record approximately 7 million of equity losses each quarter for the balance of fiscal year 2019, and also in fiscal year 2020 associated with the joint venture operations. Given the recent acquisition activity and interest rate movements, I would like to update you on our expected net interest expense. Our net interest expense in Q3 FY19 was $12 million, and going forward we expect to record quarterly net interest expense in the range of $12 million.","Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share. At March 31 we have $1.3 billion in gross debt and $1.2 billion in net debt. Our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels. At March 31, total assets were $4.1 billion and net equity was $2 billion.","Finally, in summary, our top line revenue was strong this quarter with growth across all major categories. Gross margin is improving, supported by the contribution from recent set acquisitions and our ongoing efforts to drive [indiscernible] efficiencies as well as favorable product mix.","Our operating costs remain well controlled even as we observed the impact of acquisitions. As a result, we are continuing to drive operating leverage with Q3 non-GAAP operating profit, up 15% year-on-year. We're focused on driving solid operating results, while ensuring we continue to invest in our strategic long-term opportunities.","And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy.","Amy Wakeham","Great. Thanks, Brett. Thanks, Mick. We will now turn the call to the Q&A portion. I'd like to remind everyone to please limit yourself to one question and if you do have additional questions, you\u2019re free to return to the call queue. Julie, we're now ready to start the Q&A section.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley is on the line with the question.","Michael Farrell","Sean, you might be on mute.","Sean Laaman","Yes, great. Hello. Can you hear me?","Michael Farrell","Yes, you need to start from the start, Sean. You were on mute, I think.","Sean Laaman","Yes, sure. Yes. Okay. Mick -- well, hope you\u2019re all well everybody. On the rest of world masks, so strong number there. Were you able to talk about or give us some granularity around your experience for the upgraded devices in France and Japan and sort of how much runway is there to go on the benefit on that resupply side of the equation?","Michael Farrell","Yes, it's a good question in terms of -- allow me to talk about France and Japan, what we\u2019ve done there. Look, clearly global revenue growth in masks was exceptional in the quarter, 13% constant currency globally. 13% in the U.S. Canada and Latin America and 12% across Europe, Asia and rest of world in constant currency terms. So we\u2019ve had probably 4 to 5 plus quarters of upgrades in France and similarly in Japan. And as we said in the prepared remarks and we said last quarter and the last number of quarters, we are going to be facing a headwind of the device sales in both France and Japan, although we're now through to get a modest positive on the rest of world devices this quarter. But it allows us through that upgrade of digital health assets in both France and Japan to now start interacting with patients and driving patient behavior through apps like myAir and with physicians through solutions like AirView and the whole Air Solutions portfolio. And so we believe there's long-term sustainable mask growth that we can achieve in both France and Japan that should help continue to grow out share which is quite high already in those geographies. But look, we are not done with it. We -- obviously, in the last five years, brought digital health in the United States and now to France and Japan with 120 other countries worldwide that we now need to start that opportunity on, but yes, it's certainly great growth in masks in the quarter off the back of digital health, but also off the back of some great mask launches.","Sean Laaman","Sure. Thanks, Mick. And just one follow-up. A lot of activity there with the integration of the software platforms. Just wondering though qualitatively or quantitatively if you could give us some description on some of the financial benefits of those, that integration process that we might see?","Michael Farrell","Yes. Sean, look we always think about that driving investment in digital health technology and it drives such good growth of the core sleep apnea and Respiratory Care devices. And as I\u2019ve mentioned just now also growth of the core masks and accessories. We have a lot of internal models. I\u2019m not prepared to share how those internal models of digital health technology are catalyzing growth of those areas that\u2019s what I\u2019m prepared to talk about is our public segmentation of the SaaS business which is powered by the same digital health technology capability. And that part of that portfolio grew a 101% including acquisitions. But as I said on the pro forma basis, it was growing at high single-digit range and we think over time we can optimize that digital health tech and that SaaS portfolio to grow in the low double-digit on a sustainable basis as we look at multiple years towards that 2025 strategy, we think that\u2019s a big part of it. Thanks for your question, Sean.","Sean Laaman","Yes, thank you, Mick.","Operator","Gretel Janu from Credit Suisse is on the line with a question.","Gretel Janu","Hi. Thanks very much. So just on rest of world devices, would you be able to give a little bit more about the breakout in terms of the performance of Japan and France in the third quarter? And then just in terms of the other rest of world countries, were there any other surprises in results?","Michael Farrell","Yes, thanks for the question, Gretel. Look, I -- we don\u2019t -- we already breakout a lot of information when we say all the different categories we go down to, but I\u2019m happy to talk -- put some color on to the Europe, Asia and rest of world countries. Look, as I mentioned in the prep remarks, it was a great expansion in France and Japan these last number of quarters. But that great expansion and extraordinarily high share that we\u2019ve achieved there now means that you\u2019re going to slow down in both [indiscernible] have already been upgraded on the device side. Look, yes, as we saw the total Europe, Asia, rest of world growth was in that sort of modest positive on the CC and slightly negative on the headline number the U.S dollars given currency movements. Look, we expect that part -- that aggregate portfolio to grow in that type of rate as we move forward. There will be some lumpiness up and down over time, but the device side of that portfolio is given -- a little up and down in Europe, Asia, and the rest of the world over the next number of quarters as I think we addressed last quarter and most of sell side analysts have put in there. But as we move forward and we start to lap those fleet upgrades, we will get back to what we are doing, which is core patient growth. That is very strong in both France and Japan and throughout the rest of the countries we have there. And that\u2019s what\u2019s the real determinant of long-term growth. How do we get 900 million people suffocating to realize they are suffocating and getting into the system talk to their doctor and get diagnosed and treated. And that flows need to be pretty steady in Europe, Asia and rest of the world. So, yes, there will be some lumpiness in device sales here as we left France and Japan, but we will get back to growth. But yes, -- so I\u2019m not going to give detail on China, Germany and all the other countries until and when there's a digital health upside in one of those countries and then we will become material element and I look forward to doing that really.","Gretel Janu","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","David Low from J.P. Morgan is on the line with a question.","David Low","Thanks very much. If we could just start with the commentary around the Software-as-a-Service business. Mick, you\u2019re suggesting that they return to low double-digit growth is the medium-term or long-term aspiration. I was just wondering if you would talk a little bit to Brightree versus the long-term postacute care space? Would I be right in assuming that the long-term postacute care growth opportunity is quite a lot larger than Brightree just given how immature it is?","Michael Farrell","Yes, I think -- look, there's runway still ahead, David, in the core Brightree business of home medical equipment. There's just so many efficiencies that we can have their, but yes as you know as I\u2019ve said, the quarter mid to high single-digit growth. I don\u2019t think we can get that path, even just a Brightree path to the high single digits and probably not brushing up and touching the low double-digit growth within that Brightree home medical equipment segment, because this is just so many efficiencies to gain. A little bit of market share again, we\u2019ve good market share. But it's more about bringing in modules the capabilities that take [indiscernible] away from our home medical equipment companies and bring such values that we can then share in some of that value creation. But, yes, look, the $1.5 billion addressable market includes many other out of hospital verticals. We are already playing in around seven of them and at scale at least through, like we\u2019re in home health and hospice at scale now. I\u2019m really excited about the Brightree, HEALTHCAREfirst and MatrixCare assets all being combined. And John Vanguard and his team out there in Minneapolis, I think they\u2019re going to do a great job in that vertical, home health and hospice. And additionally that same team working in skilled nursing facilities where we already have a strong position, but a lot of runway for growth. I think one of the things that ResMed brings that\u2019s unique is we're a strategic player and we\u2019re going to converting capabilities like cybersecurity, our management of AWS, Azure and all the cloud-based systems around managing that digital portfolio that we can bring superior value to it. But look, it's really a portfolio, Brightree will be a good part of that growth. MatrixCare will be a good part of that growth and we\u2019re looking to continue to grow as we empower that team. Roger has been doing a great job.","David Low","Great. Thanks very much for that. Just my other question, big picture the growth that we saw from ResMed, like in your traditional sleep business looks very strong across but devices and masks. I think we would hesitate or extrapolate that out in rest of world as well, if you want to pull out the impact in France and Japan. Just would like your thoughts on where the market growth is picking up, or whether you think this is being a large or significant contribution from market share guidance?","Michael Farrell","Yes, it's interesting, David. And you\u2019ve followed the same other companies that I did to try and track it. We got some really good market share data in some of that geographies and less good in others. Look, I look at out at this quarter we had constant currency growth of devices globally 6% and we had constant currency growth of masks of 13%. Traditionally, we say and I think it's still true that devices sort of growing in that mid-single digits and masks going at the high single-digits. So that would imply that we took some modest share in devices. Obviously, geographies outside France and Japan we already took the share there. And in masks, I think the N30i, the F30, we didn't even count any of the P30i, but that 13% growth is -- its clearly including some share growth as well. We love the game of innovating, small, quiet, more comfortable, more connected devices. It's a competitive game that, yes, we are winning more than we\u2019re losing. Thanks for your questions, David.","David Low","Thanks.","Operator","Andrew Goodsall from MST Marquee is on the line with a question.","Andrew Goodsall","Good morning and thanks very much for taking my question. Just on Mobi, you haven't called that out separately, just if you could characterize any contribution or feedback around the quarter? And also your move to go direct-to-consumer with OEM for Mobi?","Michael Farrell","Yes, Andrew thanks for the question. As I said in the prep remarks, the whole POC category, even if we had a 100% share, we would struggle to be material to our business. We are starting from a very early stage, Mobi, we\u2019re just sort of flipping to a full product launch as we move forward. And as I said, we\u2019re very closely partnering with our home medical equipment provider customers. And what we are looking to do is find patients that qualify, and if they qualify for the reimbursement versus Medicare or private insurance, we are working with our HME customers to provide that lead, if you like that person who is in need of a POC and to have them provide great care for that person. Two of our competitors have been -- one of them for many years and one for a period of time, experimenting with models that completed the genre on that reimbursed business and going direct to patient. We have stayed away certainly from competing with our customers in the reimburse business in the United States. It's not our game and we have been doing that plan to do that. In the case that a person who wants to buy a device by cash, we are at quality in different models, we've been, in the way the two competitors are. I think it would be foolish not to take care of the ultimate customer who is a patient, who needs when two other players in the market are doing that. But it's very early days in this. I\u2019m going to say that the opportunities that is huge for us and we think of it as a longitudinal play across COPD. POC is an interesting part of a big journey of a COPD patient. We want to talk to the patient in stage 1, stage 2 through digital health and inhalers. That\u2019s about 80% plus of the cost of the COPD patient is in the pharmaceutical side. So Propeller Health is the one that we should be talking about as a material element. I think with POC, noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation, we are already in that. And it's exciting, but it's really that long-term play of the patient through digital applications [indiscernible] of hospital, to keep them happy, so that their physician's happy, that the health insurance company is happy, that the caregiver, everyone is happy and also that our customers are under and [indiscernible] equipment customers can be happy. As a reimbursed patient, we want to take care of it.","Andrew Goodsall","Very good. Thank you. And just my follow up, just obviously GM, half of that was -- you attribute to metrics. The other half I presume is predominantly mixed with the higher growth in the U.S?","Brett Sandercock","Yes, hi, Andrew. It's Brett. The -- it's probably -- there is meaningful impact probably from the some production efficiencies in Q1 efficiency [indiscernible] that we\u2019re driving for maybe would like 30, to add. And then obviously product mix was favorable, and that was a meaningful impact on that as well.","Andrew Goodsall","Terrific. Thank you very much.","Michael Farrell","Thanks for your questions, Andrew.","Operator","David Bailey from Macquarie, is on the line with quarter question.","David Bailey","Hey, good morning. Just a quick one for me. [Indiscernible] up on the gross margin, just wonder if you can quantify the impact to currency on gross margin on a year-on-year basis.","Michael Farrell","Yes, year-on-year was favorable around COPD POC license points. And in -- at a sequentially it was basically pretty negligible.","David Bailey","On the context of the 50 basis points your refer to early are you probably looking around 10% -- 10 basis points organic gross margin expansion with the year-on-year. Excluding currency?","Brett Sandercock","Yes, and actually on currency, it's actually pretty negligible on both actually. If I look at year-on-year, correct that. It's pretty eligible [indiscernible]. And really [indiscernible] because we still [indiscernible] to see the all these are real types of [indiscernible] I would call for the [indiscernible]. And lastly I said [indiscernible].","David Bailey","Okay. Thanks.","Michael Farrell","Yes.","Operator","Saul Hadassin from UBS is on the line with a question,","Saul Hadassin","Thanks. Good morning. Just one question from me. Mick, the U.S. masks growth rate [indiscernible] ahead of market growth again. Can you talk to how much of that is resupply growth, an acceleration in resupply as opposed to success on new product launches. I mean, we have the impression that masks that redeployed the vast majority of your U.S [indiscernible] you talk to what you\u2019re seeing in the dynamic between resupply growth versus share shift that would be great.","Michael Farrell","Yes, that\u2019s a great question. We have Jim Hollingshead, the Head of our Global Sleep business on the line. Jim, you want to talk to as much cover you can gave on U.S growth organic etcetera.","Michael Farrell","Yes, sure. Thanks, Mick, and thanks for your question, Saul. I think the answer is both in. We are seeing very strong results of resupply and we\u2019ve seen that over the last several quarters as more and more of our HME customers have adopted automated resupply solutions. So that continue to be very strong. return results for us and for customers with the new products have also -- all gotten off to a terrific start. F30 is out of the gate very strong, N30i has a terrific patient preference and is doing very, very well and early result from P30 are also extremely encouraging. So I think we are getting both organic growth and we are taking some share in this space, but we\u2019re also enjoying very good results for the resupply.","Saul Hadassin","Thank you.","Operator","Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets is on the line with a question.","Joanne Wuensch","Good afternoon everybody and thank you for this quarter after the last quarter experience. Anyway two quick questions. What was the total acquisition revenue impact on the fiscal year third quarter. And then the second question is how do we think about operating leverage in the coming quarters and maybe even for next year? Thank you.","Michael Farrell","Well, I will jump to the operating leverage, I will hand to Brett to talk about sort of organic versus acquisition driven growth. But look Joanne as we\u2019ve been -- as you and other sell-side analysts have challenged us, that is, one is the ongoing leverage. And it's really our challenge to ourselves to ensure that we can achieve ongoing leverage and I think we\u2019ve had a good performance in the last number of quarters to that end. The operating programs, the business excellence programs, we put in place the drive with [indiscernible] manufacturing team, the [indiscernible] advanced manufacturing teams that I'm here on site with this week are all doing excellent work in that. Our commercial teams and looking at how to use digital health technology for the social media marketing versus old-school paper and television, really pushing the envelope of how we drive business excellence across all that functions in all our business verticals. It's something that we think is sustainable for the medium to long-term. But it's a game that never stopped throughout the game of continuous improvement and Brett, do you want to have a little discussion as to what\u2019s organic versus inorganic growth in the quarter.","Brett Sandercock","Yes, Joanne, you\u2019re talking on the SaaS side?","Joanne Wuensch","A number of acquisition in the last 90 to 180 days, , MatrixCare, Propeller, et cetera. Just I'm trying to piece through where all that came from.","Brett Sandercock","Yes if you look at -- on a group basis, if you look at -- growth you exclude the acquisitions, we grew at around the 8% mark constant currency. I think a good way to look at it, Joanne, is that masks -- the devices and masks and accessories -- none of those acquisitions came with us. So if you think of device growth year-on-year constant currency at 6% and masks and accessories growth year-on-year 10%, that gives you an idea for absolute core sleep apnea and Respiratory Care businesses. Excluding all acquisition about -- that happened.","Joanne Wuensch","Thank you very much.","Brett Sandercock","Thanks, Joanne.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Margaret Kaczor from William Blair is on the line with a question.","Margaret Kaczor","Hey, good afternoon, folks. Thanks for taking the question. For my question, I want to focus a little bit on Brightree and some of the strategic changes may be that your guys trying to make to accelerate revenue there. And part of that is really the number of recent product and program launches that you have. So how should we view the typical sales cycle for some of these new product launches? Is it six months, nine months? And then can you give us a sense of where that revenue growth is going to come from new users versus existing accounts?","Michael Farrell","Great question, Margaret. I'm going to hand that to Rob Douglas, Chief operating Officer.","Rob Douglas","Thanks, Mick. Thanks, Margaret. Margaret, you know that Brightree is recurring revenue model. So we compete on booking and that then reflect in recurring revenue on the U.S. So we do have a view of that. And as we talked about, we had headwinds around a little bit of consolidation in the industry. Our approach to that has been really improve modules on it and we\u2019re really happy with the way the new Brightree modules are going, including some of the analytics offerings and certainly some of the direct patient engagement offering in Brightree. We\u2019ve got the team really focused on driving those offerings in the market. And then even on a longer term basis, we've got the team working on additional modules and development. So we are very confident that that Brightree growth will continue as it did in this quarter. We saw a decent improvement in that and we are confident that will continue.","Margaret Kaczor","Thanks.","Michael Farrell","Thanks for the question, Margaret.","Operator","John Deakin-Bell from Citi is on the line with a question.","John Deakin-Bell","My question is just around Propeller. Last quarter you said that was going to be $0.02 to $0.03% dilutive third quarter for some time. Can you just confirm that that is the case in this quarter? And just give us an update on the trajectory of that -- of the losses over the next year or two?","Michael Farrell","Yes, Brett, do you want to talk to the losses \u2026?","Brett Sandercock","Yes, Sure, John. Yes, so I can confirm that it was in the $0.02 to $0.03 range for this quarter. And I guess for the next little while next few quarters I think it will around that sort of level.","John Deakin-Bell","That's fine. I mean, like for the whole of FY '20 is that -- are we talking about that length of time?","Brett Sandercock","I mean I don't want to make progress that sort of long-term predictions like that on Propeller but I think for the next few quarters it will be around that level.","Michael Farrell","The real question, John, is where that goes from down a penny to up a penny is the sales cycle of Propeller. So Propeller, as we said on the prepared remarks, are working with Orion in Finland, sort of niche pharmaceutical company. Its public that the Propeller are working with some very large pharmaceutical companies and some of them don't want us to talk about, some of them are in the archive. But if anyone of these pilots starts to commercialize, that stuff -- and they are comfortable for us talking about that publicly, how customer is, we will update you on that. And this will be very quickly from dilutive to accretive in a heartbeat, but that's obviously the play. It's a medium to long term play and we are not calling the date, the time or the hour or the quarter that, that happens. But that\u2019s what the investments are around, so that\u2019s where it like sort of as we start to get out there, those changes may happen. And so for the short term, [indiscernible] things down. For the long-term, incredibly excited for COPD patients to get better Digital Healthcare.","John Deakin-Bell","Right. Good color. Thanks for that.","Operator","Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America Merrill Lynch is on the line with a question.","Lyanne Harrison","Good morning, gentleman. I just got another question on your SaaS business. And you mentioned previously about the home health market and Brightree and MatrixCare. Can you actually shed some color on how we should be thinking about the revenue synergies in the -- in your SaaS business with Brightree and MatrixCare and also on HEALTHCAREfirst?","Michael Farrell","Yes, it's a good question. And the combination of those businesses, there is a number of factors. I mean, sort of basic one is that we can combine our digital health capabilities, our cyber security, cloud-based management and management team and sort of the economies of scale managing across those multiple portfolio. The big upside is that there are a number of customers, may be many thousands of customers out at hospital healthcare, that operate in multiple cities. They have a skilled nursing facility. They also have a hospice and maybe also a home health. And a lot of the players out there are small and or niche players in -- as in terms of our competitors in the SaaS space and they serve one or maybe two of those verticals. I think as ResMed now serves seven verticals, we are able to have frictionless or seamless moment of an aging person from care setting to care setting. That's good for them. It's good for the family. It's good for the health care system. It's good for the insurance company and its good for the customer. The person who is signing us on a per year to per month basis. And so that\u2019s the real upside. The synergies is on the backside, on the backend of the infrastructure, but there is also incredible synergies for the customer in ResMed being an offering that goes across those. And so we are actually [indiscernible] Healthcare first, allow us to really put it all under one umbrella and bring that value to the customer.","Lyanne Harrison","Thank you.","Michael Farrell","Thanks for your question, Lyanne.","Operator","Chris Cooper from Goldman Sachs is on the line with a question.","Chris Cooper","Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Most have been asked, but perhaps if I may probably just ask one on the growth opportunity in POC since you mentioned that. Just curious if you could share your thoughts, please on how big you believe that our addressable market might be, and also what you see is a current market growth? I know you expect to outperform that through share gains, but if you could just give some sense of how big that market is and how quickly you believe it's growing right now, that would be helpful for us. Thank you.","Michael Farrell","Yes, Chris, as I said in the prep remarks, it's going to take a long time for POC to get material versus other -- $2 billion plus franchise, but it is exciting as kind of the [indiscernible] top line. Rob, do you want to give a little more data as to the addressable market and\/or to that share.","Rob Douglas","Sure. We\u2019ve talked about addressable market over the years saying that $ 3million to -$4 million range. But it's actually changing a lot because as we\u2019ve talked about, POCs are a disruptive play to other forms of oxygen delivery. But in order for that disruption to really play out there are a few generations of technology needed. But we could see a strong market growth in that market and particularly as we introduce connected solutions and better management of products and better really management of patients. So long-term we see a lot of opportunity in growing that market, but as Mick has said in the short-term, it's going to take a long-term to be material, particularly given the growth rates of our other businesses. And we are happy with our current programs. We are really focusing on learning and the best way to support patients in the market and the best way to use the capabilities of our existing partners throughout in the market.","Chris Cooper","Got it. Thanks. Just one very quick follow-up. Just on the masks side, if you were to apportion or rank their contribution that you would expect from the F30, the M30i and the P30i, over the next few quarters could just give us some sense of how big you expect each of them to be relative to one another.","Michael Farrell","Yes, thanks for the question, Chris. Yes, we don't go into that level of detail around new masks set up versus existing or new mask growth. But what I can tell you in terms of color is we are very excited about the initial performance of the N30i and the F30. They have shot out of the gates beautifully. The P30i wasn\u2019t even in the quarter which is launched last month. I\u2019m looking forward to opening the packet and using it myself. And I can't wait to see many, many, many others do the same. But yes, we won't that right out, but I can tell I this growth in the quarter of 13% constant currency in masks and accessories wasn't a one timer. I think we have the ability to continue to grow pretty strongly with this really strong portfolio we have.","Operator","We are now at the one hour mark. So I will turn the call back over to Mick for closing comments.","Michael Farrell","Thanks, Julie.

Throughout fiscal year 2016, I have talked about ResMed\u2019s growing global leadership in digital health and connected care for respiratory medicine. This leadership has been a catalyst for strong overall revenue growth and market beating organic revenue growth these last 12 months.","We produced robust double-digit growth in the Americas region. These results were fueled by the ongoing success of organic masks and devices growth augmented by new software-as-a-service revenue from Brightree. We achieved above market growth in our combined EMEA and APAC regions with the highlight being double-digit growth of our flow generators in the combined EMEA and APAC group. At the bottom line, our diluted earnings per share, was $0.74 on a non-GAAP basis, which represents 9% year-on-year growth. In terms of non-GAAP net operating profit, we grew our bottom line at 20% in Q4 on a year-on-year basis. We continue to balance strong revenue growth with ongoing investments in R&D and our global focus on operating excellence. We achieved positive operating leverage in SG&A, keeping its growth well below our top line revenue growth. We are investing for the long-term future, maintaining R&D spend at around 7% of top line revenue. These R&D investments will enhance our long-term pipeline of innovation across the portfolios of sleep apnea, COPD and connected care solutions.","Now, let me drill into some regional highlights. First, in the Americas region, we had strong sales performance in Q4 with our commercial team driving 11% growth in masks and accessories and 6% growth in devices in the Americas. This latter number was up against a hefty 53% growth comparable from last year. These robust results from the Americas team have the foundation of stable market growth. However, it really shows the ongoing strength of the AirSense 10 and the AirCurve 10 systems, powered and catalyzed by our cloud-based Air Solutions software platform, including the U-Sleep and myAir applications. These applications are liberating data and unlocking value in terms of actionable information for HME providers and for patients, respectively. The double-digit growth for the masks and accessories category was a great result for the Americas in Q4. We expect solid masks and accessories growth as we move forward with resupply initiatives and new product launches during fiscal year 2017.","Turning to the combined EMEA and APAC group. We had strong sales performance in these regions, resulting in 8% growth on a constant currency basis in Q4. We produced solid growth in devices in the region, especially from our sleep apnea platforms. As we discussed last quarter, the ASV growth headwind started to subside mid-Q4, and we will pass the anniversary of the tail of this impact in this current quarter, Q1 fiscal \u201817. We are clearly turning the corner in ASV, and we continue to see exciting opportunities ahead for ASV therapy, particularly for patients with central sleep apnea, complex sleep apnea, pain management medication and posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD. We are excited to get back to growth on a trajectory for this really innovative, beneficial and high-margin therapy.","Let me now provide an update on our ResMed 2020 strategy. We have made good progress in global leadership for connected care, one of the key foundations of our growth strategy. We have now incorporated into our P&L high-quality, recurring software-as-a-service revenue from Brightree. We will continue to invest in our portfolio of cloud-based computing solutions to help our HME customers become even more efficient and to help them free up cash flow for even better patient care.","We recently announced a new CEO and a new COO for Brightree. Matt Mellott is the new CEO and Bobby Ghoshal is the new COO. Matt\u2019s experience in successfully building and running a multi-state HME that used Brightree as an integral part of that business sets him up as a strong and capable leader for Brightree. Bobby\u2019s experience in running ResMed\u2019s IT team for the Americas sets him up to be a great operating partner together with Matt. So Matt and Bobby, together with the Brightree leadership team, will guide the development and ongoing integration of the Brightree suite of software solutions within and as a part of the Air Solutions platform offerings.","The goal is clear to provide enhanced value for HME partners, for physicians, for payers and for patients. With our HME channel partners, our current connected care solutions are improving operating efficiency. They are eliminating waste, increasing medical device adherence and improving patient outcomes. We intend to continue to grow our connected care solutions in COPD as well as other chronic care applications as we move forward. This strategic foundation of connected care is an integral part of our current and our future success.","Let me now take a few minutes to update you on the progress against each of our Three Horizons and then hand over to Brett, and then we\u2019ll head on to Q&A. In our first horizon of growth, which focuses on our core sleep apnea business, we have seen strong, sustained growth since the launch of the Air Solutions platform. While many companies are talking about connected care and digital health, we have executed in connected care, and we lead the market with well over 2 million, 100% cloud-connected medical devices, sending data to the cloud every day. This is more than double the nearest competitor. We also have over 900 patients each day signing up for our patient engagement application called myAir.","Air Solutions not only has millions and millions of patients, it is also connected through APIs to hospital and physician managed electronic medical record systems that allow patients to share data with their caregivers. We are in mile 1 of a marathon of population health management and health care analytics. Through this ecosystem, we are liberating data that we turn into actionable information for patients, physicians, providers and for payers.","At ResMed, we are a company that is clearly founded on scientific principles of research. During the quarter, Dr. Dennis Hwang of Kaiser Permanente presented results from a large prospective randomized controlled trial at the SLEEP meeting in Denver, Colorado. The Kaiser Permanente study randomized 1,455 patients, and its conclusion was that the use of ResMed\u2019s cloud based algorithm called U-Sleep produced a 21% relative increase in sleep habit adherence. Dr. Hwang was quoted as saying the following: anything that significantly increases CPAP use in the first 90 days is a big deal. That initial period is crucial for patients to embrace CPAP to treat their sleep apnea, which is linked to heart failure, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes and other serious conditions. Tools like U-Sleep hold a lot of promise for patients on CPAP and the clinicians who treat them. We think that\u2019s a great quote.","We believe that U-Sleep and the broader Air Solutions platform is a huge value to Kaiser Permanente as well as other payer provider models in the U.S. and around the world, including ACOs, IDNs and many government run payer provider models as they look for ways to take better care of patients and essentially to keep their patients out of high cost hospitals and to treat them with high quality and great care in the concerns of their own home.","With the close of the Brightree acquisition in Q4, we have augmented Air Solutions to create an even stronger end-to-end value proposition for HME customers. We will continue to help our HME partners drive even more efficiencies in their businesses and also continue to invest in market development of new channels for the software-as-a-service offerings of Brightree in home health, home nursing as well as in the hospice channel. Watch this space. In the second horizon of our ResMed 2020 growth strategy, we have continued the integration process at Inova, which is the portable oxygen concentrator company we acquired in Q3. We have completed the integration of our commercial sales and marketing teams and we are now leveraging our global manufacturing, quality and product development expertise to take Inova to the next level.","We clearly have opportunities to grow revenue by selling POCs through our global market channels and we will prioritize the 100 countries where we sell so as to maximize physician, provider and patient value throughout fiscal year 2017 and beyond. We will create next generation Inova products that provide not only a step up in quality, but also to leverage our global connected care leadership in this space. The strategy is to leverage connected care solutions for COPD across a broad portfolio of offerings, including life support ventilation, non-invasive ventilation, and now portable oxygen concentrators. This spectrum of respiratory care products will help patients with neuromuscular diseases like ALS as well as normocapnic COPD and hypercapnic COPD patients. With COPD being the number three cause of death in the Western world and the number two cause of re-hospitalization in the West, we know connected care will play a big role in the future.","This quarter, we announced that we are adding a ResMed communication module, essentially a wireless communication module, to our life support ventilator, Astral. There will be more to come on this front. Along with our product strategies in this space, we are driving market channel strategies. In Q4, we announced a group purchasing organization, or GPO contract, to enable 3,600 member hospitals and 120,000 other providers to purchase and use ResMed\u2019s best-in-class respiratory care products and services as patients move from the hospital to in-home care. As I noted just a moment ago, there will be more to come on this front as we continue to execute against this part of our strategy. Our third horizon of growth, includes a robust portfolio of long-term opportunities in new markets, including atrial fibrillation, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, asthma, chronic disease management as well as sleep health and sleep wellness.","During the quarter, clinical trial results from the CAT-HF trial were presented at the annual Heart Failure Congress at the European Society of Cardiology or ESC. The overall CAT-HF study results were neutral. However, a pre-specified subgroup of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction patients showed a clinically and statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint. The primary endpoint for this study was a combined measure of mortality, morbidity and functional outcomes of the patient. This study, CAT-HF, is the first study globally to show that addressing sleep disordered breathing with Adaptive Servo-Ventilation may improve cardiovascular outcomes, heart outcomes for people with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction. We expect full publication of the CAT-HF study shortly and we are very excited about the patient outcome data and the potential opportunities to save hospitalization and re-hospitalization costs for the healthcare system globally.","Returning to our financial results, we have been able to put our balance sheet to work this fiscal year. We have invested $1 billion into high quality acquisitions that clearly drive us towards our ResMed 2020 growth strategy. You will see us laser focused on ensuring we get return on capital for these investments. Our Board has increased the dividend by 10%, reflecting confidence in our long-term strategy and our ability to drive ongoing cash flow from the business. Given our significant capital deployment this year, we believe it is prudent to continue to temporarily suspend our share repurchase program. It is important to note that we reserve the right to resume the share buyback program at any time in the future as conditions warrant.","Let me close with this. In fiscal year 2016, we established ourselves as the global leader in digital health and connected care for respiratory medicine. This is only strengthened by our acquisition of Brightree. We have added essential building blocks for our global cardio respiratory care strategy, particularly in connected care for COPD. We remain excited as we build the road ahead for our industry, for our partners and most importantly, for millions and millions of patients around the world.","With that, I will hand the call over to Brett, who is in Sydney for his comments, over to you, Brett.","Brett Sandercock","Great. Thanks Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter with more detailed commentary around revenue, given our acquisition this fiscal year. As Mick noted, we had a solid finish to the year. Group revenue for the June quarter was $518.6 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 15%. Excluding the acquisition of Brightree, revenue increased by 8% over the prior year quarter and excluding all acquisitions, organic revenue increased by 6% over the prior year quarter.","Taking a closer look at the geographic level and excluding revenue from our Brightree acquisition, our sales in the Americas were $295.6 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. Sales in combined EMEA and Asia Pac totaled $194.1 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales in combined EMEA and Asia-Pacific also increased by 8% over the prior year quarter.","Breaking out revenue between product segments, Americas device sales were $161 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $134.6 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter. The revenue in combined EMEA and Asia Pac, device sales were $133.6 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, an increase of 11%. Masks and other sales were $60.5 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, also an increase of 4%. Globally in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 8%, while masks and other increased by 9% over the prior year quarter.","I would now like to provide some additional information about the Brightree revenue contribution. Brightree revenue for the fourth quarter was $28.9 million. On a pro forma full quarter basis, Brightree\u2019s revenue would have been $32.2 million. This represents the most relevant measure of Brightree\u2019s fourth quarter revenue run rate. The difference in our reported revenue and pro forma revenue is related to two items. First, a one-time $2.3 million fair value adjustment to Brightree\u2019s deferred revenue balances required under U.S. GAAP purchase accounting rules and second, the pro forma revenue of $32.2 million for the quarter includes a few days revenue that was not included in reported revenue due to the close of the Brightree acquisition on April 4. As it relates to acquisitions, during the quarter we also incurred $1.9 million in acquisition and integration related expenses associated with the Inova and Brightree acquisition.","During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjusted for the impact of acquisition and integration expenses associated with our acquisitions of Brightree and Inova, the amortization of acquired intangibles, the Brightree acquisition of one-time deferred revenue fair value adjustment, the SERVE-HF accrual release and the cumulative tax benefit associated with the adoption of accounting standard ASU 2016-09. In the prior year comparable, that excludes the SERVE-HF accrual, amortization of acquired intangibles and the donation for UCSD and the ResMed Foundation. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our fourth quarter earnings press release.","Our non-GAAP gross margin for the June quarter was 58.2%. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margins declined by 20 basis points, reflecting typical declines in average selling prices and changes in product mix, essentially offset by manufacturing and procurement efficiencies and the favorable impact from our Brightree acquisition. On a sequential basis, our gross margin increased by 90 basis points, largely attributable to the Brightree acquisition and a more consistent product mix. Assuming current exchange rates and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margins to continue to be in a range of 57% to 60% for fiscal year 2017.","Moving on to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $133.9 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 10%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 25.8% compared to 27.2% that we reported last year. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 26% to 27% for fiscal year 2017.","R&D expenses for the quarter were $34.4 million, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter, or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 24%. This increase largely reflects the impact of our recent acquisitions and incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.6% compared to the year ago figure of 6.3%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% for fiscal year 2017. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $12.6 million for the quarter, an increase of $10.5 million over the prior year, reflecting the additional amortization associated with our recent acquisitions. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $11.6 million.","Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $135.1 million, an increase of 20% over the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $104.4 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter was $83.1 million. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.74, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter, while diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.59. Overall, foreign exchange movements positively impacted fourth quarter earnings by $0.02 per share, reflecting the favorable impact from the weaker Australian dollar.","During the quarter, we adopted a new accounting standard that was issued in the U.S. called ASU 2016-09, improvements to employee share-based payment accounting. As a result of adopting this standard, we have recognized the full year tax benefit of $11.2 million and this provided us with an opportunity to increase our foreign cash repatriation to the U.S. with the additional tax expense largely offsetting the tax benefit. With this adoption and the increase in cash repatriation, our full year effective tax rate remained relatively consistent at 19.8% compared to the prior year tax rate of 19%. On a non-GAAP basis, we have reflected full year tax benefit from the adoption of this standard within our tax expense for the fourth quarter, resulting in non-GAAP effective tax rate of 22%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 will be in the range of 20% to 22%.","Cash flow from operations was $143 million for the quarter. This reflects strong underlying earnings and an improvement in net working capital balances. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $14.4 million. Depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $27 million. For fiscal year 2016, we generated record operating cash flow of $547.9 million, an increase of 43% over the prior fiscal year. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.33 per share, an increase of 10% over our previous quarterly dividend. As previously announced, we have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to recent acquisitions. Consequently, we did not repurchase any shares during the June quarter, however we may at any time elect to reinitiate the share repurchase program. At the end of June, we had approximately 13.6 million shares remaining under our authorized share repurchase program. At June 30, we had approximately $1.2 billion in gross debt and $444 million in net debt. Our balance sheet remains modestly geared and very strong. At June 30, total assets were $3.3 billion, and net equity was $1.7 billion.","And with that, I will hand the call back to Agnes.","Agnes Lee","Thanks Brett. We will now turn to Q&A. And we ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions after that please get back into the queue. Laurel, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Andrew Goodsall from UBS is online with a question.","Andrew Goodsall","Thanks very much for taking my question. I was just wondering if you are willing to tell us something about your new mask range, we have seen the 510(k) there and perhaps if you are not willing go into too much detail whether you are willing to talk about the opportunity to evolve the business model with the AirSense 10 and the connectivity piece?","Mick Farrell","Thanks for the question, Andrew. You are right in your caveat around the question, but we \u2013 for competitive reasons, we don\u2019t think it benefits shareholder value to go into the details of product timing and product launches. But as you noted, there is some activity there in 510(k)s and we do plan to launch at least one new mask before the end of the calendar year and that\u2019s all the information I will give on that. But in terms of your second part of your question, which was about connectivity and how we can use the fantastic ecosystem of connectivity that we have and the installed base of 2 million cloud-connected medical devices to interact with patients and the myAir application, where patients are connected directly to the cloud, we think it\u2019s great to liberate these data and then to provide actionable information to patients. We think patients should know how long they have had their mask and when it\u2019s time to replace their mask and we are seeing patients really engage in that. So we do think there is a strong link to that. And I think if you look at this quarter, where we saw 11% growth in masks and accessories in the Americas, clearly we have patients engaging on that front, more to come on new products and more to come on engaging patients over fiscal year \u201817.","Andrew Goodsall","Thanks very much.","Mick Farrell","Thanks Andrew.","Operator","Next online, we have Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joanne Wuensch","Thank you very much for taking the questions. A couple of things, Australian dollar has been up and down a little bit, but mostly down, how do we think about that impact for next year\u2019s gross margins?","Mick Farrell","I will hand that question over to Brett Sandercock, our CFO.","Brett Sandercock","Yes. Thanks Joanne. Yes. If you looked at it sort of year-on-year sort of Q4, we did see some, a little bit of benefit from FX in particular the Aussie. Going forward into FY \u201817, we have seen more recently, I guess that\u2019s sort of bit of an up-tick in Australian dollar, it strengthened a little bit against the U.S. dollar. So in that context if you look at it sequentially into Q1, that\u2019s probably around a 50 basis point headwind for us on the gross margin there, at least in this kind of the near-term. Longer term I guess, it depends where the Aussie dollar goes, but short-term, probably a little bit of a headwind, but you would have to think longer term, it should be still be beneficial for us with the Aussie, but it has strengthened recently and we really don\u2019t know where that\u2019s going to go.","Joanne Wuensch","Okay. And can you just take a bigger step back and talk about the sleep apnea landscape, how it may be changing competitively, one of your comments talked about some pressure on average selling prices, so anything as it relates to pricing or products would be appreciated? Thank you.","Mick Farrell","Yes. Thanks Joanne. Well, the whole sleep industry landscape has changed fundamentally, I would say in these last 18 months since we launched, 18-plus months since we launched, approaching 24 months since we launched Air Solutions. And the basis of competition in the space is now changed to be not only do the devices have to be quieter, smaller, more comfortable, but they also have to be more connected. And we think that connectivity has really changed the space. It\u2019s meant that we are able to take waste out to increase adherence of patients and to remove some of the inefficient steps in the value chain and therefore extract some value for our partners our HME partners, our patient partners, our physician partners and also ourselves out of that. And so there is some mitigation of some of the historic price impacts. We don\u2019t go into details on that, but at a high level, I think that shift to value from price discussions has been a really beneficial one for us and our partners and the whole industry in general.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Anthony Petrone","Great. My first one will be for Brett, just some of the moving parts on the tax line and maybe can you walk us through the benefit of the ASU, but also the additional tax expense that you incurred from the repatriation of foreign cash and just how much foreign cash was repatriated in the quarter?","Brett Sandercock","Yes, I will give you a sense. So we did adopt that standard and what we did, I guess is we took that opportunity to increase cash repatriation and the tax expense associated with that largely offset that benefit. So you saw in our full year tax rate, it was pretty consistent with what we saw last year. To give you an idea on the repatriation, if you look at \u2013 we basically repatriated an additional $60 million this year compared to what we did last year, so quite significant for us. So we felt that, that was the best thing to do and just take the opportunity, I guess that would be implementation of the standard. So overall, if you kind of looked at our overall full year tax rate and tax rates going forward, I think it will continue to be pretty consistent.","Anthony Petrone","Okay, great, that\u2019s helpful. And maybe my follow-up would just be back on pricing a bit and maybe just a little bit more details on underlying pricing in sleep, specifically it relates to the competitive landscape, we did some checks earlier in the quarter and our understanding is Respironics came in with more of a price discount since the beginning of the year and additionally, we are hearing 3B Medical is sort of out there with more aggressive pricing, so any comments there would be helpful? Thanks.","Mick Farrell","Thanks for the question, Anthony. We don\u2019t go into particular details about competitor A or competitor B. I will reiterate what I said before a little bit and I will maybe give to Jim Hollingshead, our President, Americas, to give a little more color and detail around the U.S. environment. But at a high level, I think the shift to value and the shift to talk about how much data you are extracting from devices, how you are getting that data into my customer, who for our customer, their customer is either the hospital or the physician or even the payer. And by providing those data, we are extracting value for their customer and their customers\u2019 customer. So you are sort of changing the conversation from a pure price one to a value one. And if your box is X dollars cheaper, but the value provided is X plus, then the discussion goes back to the value side of it. But with that as a prelude, Jim any further comments on pricing?","Jim Hollingshead","Sure. I think everybody is aware that the big driver of pricing in the U.S. market has been ongoing Medicare changes to reimbursement and that\u2019s pressure that the market has been under for several months through the competitive bidding process. I think our results in Q4 show that our Air Solutions offers or our AirSense and AirCurve devices coupled with our software platforms create a lot of value. So we \u2013 our revenue grew against a huge Q4 comp last year precisely because we have really shifted, as Mick said just earlier, we have really shifted the nature of what we are doing with our HME customers to allow them to create more value out of their business. So our offerings allow them to increase their revenue and cut their operating costs and that\u2019s why our offerings have held up so well over the course of the year and continue to maintain share and volume growth.","Anthony Petrone","Thank you.","Mick Farrell","Thanks Anthony.","Operator","Next, we have Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Sean Laaman","Thank you, operator. Good morning everybody and thanks for taking my question. Just a question on Brightree, you have owned it for one quarter now, I don\u2019t know Mick, if you could give us a sense on the retention of existing customers and the uptake of new ones, just some commentary around there to give us something to work with would be fantastic?","Mick Farrell","Sure Sean. Thanks for the question. Yes. So we are 90-days plus into the close of Brightree and beyond that from the announcement. And I can tell you these first three months or four months have been a really smooth transition. We have seen great contributions from Dave Cormack, the CEO, in this transition and the new appointment of Matt Mellott as the CEO. And apart of the \u2013 directly after the announcement, which was four months or five months ago that we announced the acquisition, there was a series of phone calls and I might hand it over to Jim to talk a little bit about the details. But Jim Hollingshead, who runs our Americas, and Raj Sodhi, who runs our global \u2013 is the President of our global business unit for healthcare informatics, along with Dave Cormack called all the top customers and individually spoke to them both in our core HME space and in the Brightree space and had really good discussions with them about what we were trying to do with this acquisition, which is help them and reinvest with them to take costs and waste out and to improve patient adherence and have better flow of data through the industry and extract value for all the partners. The conversations I had, which were with a small subset of those customers were very positive and we have seen very good customer retention. In fact no significant change in customer retention pre or post the announcement or the close of the acquisition on both the core business and on Brightree. But Jim, you were involved in a lot more of those calls, do you want to provide some more color for Sean?","Jim Hollingshead","Sure. Thanks Mick. Sean, we have had by and large, very favorable responses from customers, whether they were individual customers on both sides, whether ResMed customer or Brightree customer or whether they were shared customers and there are several hundred shared customers out in the world. Initially, we had terrific conversations with customers and I think that the response has held up over time. We have maintained virtually all of our customer relationships with both businesses and any concerns that customers had about how the two units work together have been, I think have been effectively addressed both by the fact that we have kept Brightree operating as a separate commercial unit, separate sales force, etcetera and just in conversations that we have had. If I just go back quickly to one of the rationales for the acquisition was we were already working together out in the world making our customers business process is more streamlined. So we had data connections that were allowing an HME \u2013 so for example, in sleep, if you set up a patient on a ResMed flow gen, you could import all of the same data into the Brightree application and will go straight into our compliance applications with the click of a button. That kind of labor savings made a big difference. And I think customers see what we are trying to do, which is to extend our health informatics offering from the therapy into their back-office operations and just continue to add value by taking out costs and streamlining their business. And I think the customer response has by and large been very, very favorable.","Sean Laaman","Great. Thank you, Jim. And just one quick follow-up, is there any reason for perhaps seasonality in the revenue for Brightree?","Mick Farrell","Why don\u2019t I hand that over to Brett?","Brett Sandercock","Yes. Thanks Mick. Yes. Sean, that \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s very much a subscription model. So you would certainly, from that perspective, you certainly get much less seasonality. So it\u2019s less of an impact than it would be, for example, for our kind of core existing business, so less seasonality due to the subscription model.","Sean Laaman","As I hope, Brett. Thank you. And thank you Mick. And that\u2019s all the questions I have.","Mick Farrell","Thanks a lot Sean.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair. Your line is open.","Ben Andrew","Good afternoon. I guess maybe a question for Brett to try to be direct, can you give us a sense of what the tax hit was for the $60 million of extra repatriation and because you keep saying largely offset, but can you be more precise?","Brett Sandercock","Yes. I mean well, to that extent it did largely offset that side, so a slightly smaller number, but not \u2013 it\u2019s around that number.","Ben Andrew","So very close to the actual incremental...","Brett Sandercock","It\u2019s around that sort of $9 million, $10 million mark on the repatriation.","Ben Andrew","Okay. Thank you for that. That\u2019s very helpful, Brett. And I guess the second question for me, as we look at the Brightree revenues, the $32.2 million, is \u2013 what growth rate does that represent year-over-year and how do you think about the sustainability of that growth rate or what should we be looking for, for the business in the next balance of the fiscal year?","Mick Farrell","Yes. Thanks Ben. It\u2019s Mick here. One of the beauties of recurring software-as-a-service business model that Brightree has established over these last 7 years, 8 years, 9 years since they have been in business is that it\u2019s 80, 90-plus percent recurring revenue. And so you see a really steady flow, to Sean\u2019s question, proves a really steady flow, not much seasonality and sort of building up of per customer, per user, per member, per month, if you like, per user per month type of revenue models and they build up over time. We have seen really solid double-digit growth in Brightree year-on-year to get to where they are now and we expect to continue to do that. We really like the Brightree model. We really like what value it provides in the core business, which is its HME channel and partnership business. One of the upsides I alluded to in the prepared remarks, but I think related to your question there about growth and future growth is home nursing, home health and hospice channels, these two \u2013 as our population ages in the West and it\u2019s particularly focused on the U.S. market for this, there are some really exciting software-as-a-service revenue models, including iPad applications for home nurses directly entering data in the home that goes directly to the cloud, efficiency savings that are well ahead of the competition and really value that we can help extract for us and from new channel partners. And there is an upside for us and that there may be a large chunk of undiagnosed sleep apnea and COPD and untreated sleep apnea and COPD amongst those two channels. So there is sort two levels of upside. One is the core business is software-as-a-service and Brightree revenue in those two new channels, but secondly identifying patients for our core business in sleep apnea and our growing business in COPD.","Ben Andrew","Great. And just to be again direct Mick, is that mid-teens growth for Brightree or is it lower than that, higher than that? Thanks.","Mick Farrell","Yes. It\u2019s going to be around that mid-teens number. Brett, you want to go into any further detail on that or are we good with that?","Brett Sandercock","No, that\u2019s right, Mick. It\u2019s definitely tracking along mid-teens.","Ben Andrew","Thanks guys.","Mick Farrell","Thanks a lot Ben.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Saul Hadassin with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Saul Hadassin","Thanks very much. Good morning guys. Mick, maybe just one question, I wonder if you could talk to what you see as an industry growth rate, you have mentioned this in the past on previous quarters, where you think the industry is growing maybe in the U.S. and then rest of the world, just in a sense are you going ahead of markets, what do you \u2013 where do you see industry growth rates across the two key regions that you participate in? Thanks.","Mick Farrell","Yes. Look \u2013 thanks for the question, Saul. We think the market growth rate for the markets that we play in is in that mid to high single-digits revenue range globally. And so we think hitting that 8% constant currency growth in EMEA and APAC we are slightly ahead of market growth there. We think we took some share in that sort of combined sleep and respiratory care space. And if you look at excluding Brightree, the core Americas business, excluding Brightree grew at 8% as well. And so again, I would say we are taking some share there, not a huge amount of share, but taking some share and against a very tough comparable from Q4 last year. We think that\u2019s a pretty good performance. And as we look forward, that\u2019s our goal, right. We don\u2019t accept market growth. We like to drive market growth. We like to have innovations that create opportunities for us to grow ahead of the curve and so we don\u2019t give guidance as you know, but we see the market growing in that mid to high single-digits and we like to meet or beat on a regular basis.","Saul Hadassin","Alright. Thank you.","Mick Farrell","Thanks Saul.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ian Abbott with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Ian Abbott","Hi guys. Good morning. One thing, when you speak to DMEs, one of their focuses is on re-supply and they are focusing on trying to ship more accessories with masks and I am just wondering, from your perspective, how far do you think there is to go on this. And secondly, with your solutions with connectivity, how is that helping them?","Mick Farrell","So good question Ian, I will do the first part and then hand over to Jim for some further details on the Americas and what we are doing in re-supply. As a personal user of an AirSense 10 device and an AirFit P10 mask, I like to change my mask on a regular sort of three monthly basis. Any patient who puts a piece of plastic on their face every day and wears it for six hour, seven hours I think would find that a hygienic and an appropriate thing to do. The numbers out there in the industry are far below that, well below that sort of 4x replacement per year. In fact I think there was some data from some governments showing around 1.8, 1.9 masks per year, which would mean lasting 6.5 months. Personally, I think there is a lot of runway as patients get more engaged with high deductible health plans and health savings accounts in the U.S. and take more control of their own healthcare, but they will invest the co-pay dollars or even full cash pay to receive that dot com type payments to get themselves involved in this as the deductibles go up and so on. But I am just talking from a personal patient experience. Jim, why don\u2019t you give sort of the broader U.S. market thought on that?","Jim Hollingshead","Thanks Mick and thanks for the question, Ian. The first thing I would say is, just as Mick is relating his own experience, it\u2019s really important to remember that we have a very firm belief that re-supply is very good for patients. The experience of therapy for patients is always made better by fresh equipment. Equipment does wear out, it gets old, etcetera. And so when the experience with therapy is better it leads to better adherence and just better long-term health for the patient. So \u2013 and that\u2019s one of the reasons I think both ResMed and our customers seek to drive re-supply. It also happens to be good obviously for our customers business. We have been working with customers for years to help them to understand how to efficiently re-supply patients. And with the advent of our Air Solutions offering, we have been able to provide some software platforms that help to automate that process. And as a reminder, we actually have two platforms now with the acquisition of Brightree. We have a platform called ResMed ReSupply, which is a platform we built out of the acquisitions of CareTouch and Jaysec previously. And that\u2019s an automated re-supply platform that has both a software component and a call center live call and automated call component. And then Brightree has a platform called Connect, which is also an automated re-supply platform. Both of them create a lot of value for our HME customers because it allows them to re-supply in a very cost efficient, cost effective way. And we have seen very good growth, both in terms of number of customers joining these platforms and grow the re-supply through them over the course of the year and that\u2019s an ongoing phenomenon for us. So our customers are enjoying the benefits of it. It has helped our re-supply numbers obviously, so our accessory sales. And it helps patients. Patients love getting fresh equipment on an appropriate basis because it improves their quality of therapy, their quality of life.","Ian Abbott","Alright. Thank you.","Mick Farrell","Thanks Ian.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays. Your line is open.","Matt Taylor","Thanks for taking the question. Can you hear me, okay.","Mick Farrell","Yes.","Matt Taylor","So I just wanted to cover one thing with the gross margin, previously you had said that Brightree was going to add about 70 bps to 100 bps, is that about what you saw in the quarter and is that what we should think about as kind of the contribution for the next year?","Brett Sandercock","Yes. Hi Matt. The Q4, it came pretty much in middle levels \u2013 it was 80 basis points that it contributed. And then look going forward I think I would stick with that range around that sort of 70 basis points to 100 basis points.","Matt Taylor","Okay. And I guess with the moving parts that you alluded to before the Aussie dollars you talked about but also euro is going down, how does that factor into your guidance for GMs for next year, so what are you assuming?","Mick Farrell","Alright. Matt, I apologize. I missed the first half of that question.","Matt Taylor","Yes. I am just asking with the euro as well, euro is a little bit weaker in recent weeks, how are you thinking about those two major currencies for gross margin next year?","Brett Sandercock","Yes. I mean that plays into I think \u2013 we talked about that a little earlier on. Just for \u2013 it does, I mean obviously, a weaker euro, a weaker pound or whatever it might be doesn\u2019t impact us there. If I looked at it just at least in this sort of near-term into Q1 with that sort of strengthening of Aussie and probably some weakening in some of the European currencies, we \u2013 I think all up probably at the moment, estimates probably a 50 basis point headwind for us going into Q1 and now it\u2019s just a question of, I guess then if currencies stay where they are from thereon in that you wouldn\u2019t see any further impact on a sequential basis. We might see a little bit on a year-on-year basis, but pretty volatile at the moment. So it\u2019s hard to say on that, but near-term, I would say it\u2019s about 50 basis points and of course that can change depending on what currencies do. But at the moment, I will put it around that kind of number.","Matt Taylor","Great. And then can you just give us a sense of how to model the interest and other expense for next year, since you have the debt from Brightree, I think due to modeling some income, you had some expense this quarter, any parameters you can give us around the interest rate or the \u2013 your cadence of the debt pay-down to help with that number?","Mick Farrell","Matt, the interest rate for us would be around \u2013 is rough number around that 2% mark in terms of funding costs on the interest \u2013 if you use that. Had Brightree basically the acquisition from close to the beginning of the quarter and I think we finished with kind of this net interest expense for the quarter around $2.4 million. So it\u2019s probably kind of a reasonable go forward number going into FY \u201817.","Matt Taylor","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Wheen with Evans & Partners. Please go ahead.","Steve Wheen","Yes. Hi guys. Just a quick question on that GPO announcement that you made, are there any milestones in terms of volumes that are required and is there any sort of color you can give around how that will contribute going forward. And then just if we could Brett, go sort of talk on the gross margin outlook for FY \u201817 you have mentioned FX and you have mentioned Brightree, but just any other sort of moving parts that we should be mindful of? Thanks very much.","Mick Farrell","Thanks for the questions. Steve I will answer the first one and as you indicated, I will hand it to Brett for the second. The GPO announcement was really as an example of us executing on that channel strategy and you may or may not see further press releases from us about other GPO and government contracts that we have over time, but we don\u2019t give details of any particular customer and milestones associated with them on a sort of milestone basis. Essentially these GPO contracts are hunting licenses and then you are allowed to go in hospital-by-hospital and move forward on it, but it\u2019s an upfront negotiated air cover for the sales folks to go in there and work with those 3,600 hospitals and 120,000 other providers and push forward on our respiratory care growth within the channel. So I said in my prepared remarks, more to come on that front. There will be a lot more to come. We might not put press releases out on all of them. It was really just an indicator of where we are moving on that front. Brett, do you wanted to take the second question about gross margin?","Brett Sandercock","Sure. Yes. Steve, on the outlook there on gross margin, I guess as you know, there is a lot of moving parts on that. We have mentioned on FX if I look at certainly from a product mix perspective, it\u2019s definitely that sort of unfavorable mix is certainly moderated for us. It\u2019s far more consistent to the extent and Mick mentioned earlier in terms of new mask introduction and so on, you could probably expect that would be supportive on a product mix front as we get through FY \u201817. We have done \u2013 the team has been doing some really good work around the manufacturing procurement and so on. We have seen some of that come through. So I am quite positive on that. And then you have got, obviously the Brightree is now kind of built into that Q4 margin, but that will continue to be supportive as well. I mean you have the usual ASP declines and things like that coming through. But overall, in the mix I think some of the big unfavorable items are certainly moderating and potentially could have \u2013 as masks are introduced and so on, that should be beneficial. So overall, we have got \u2013 it\u2019s probably a near-term currency headwind that\u2019s a bit unhelpful. But overall, pretty comfortable with that 57% to 60% range and we are kind of more or less just about right in the midpoint of that range at the moment. So that\u2019s kind of how I would characterize the moving pieces.","Steve Wheen","Great. Thanks very much.","Mick Farrell","Thanks for the questions Steve.","Operator","Next we have a question from the line of Chris Kallos with Morningstar. Your line is open.","Chris Kallos","Thank you. Thank you for taking my question. Just a quick follow-up on the cardiology trial Mick, from the sound of your \u2013 of the CAT-HF numbers, they are neutral to positive, does that now maybe reboot your efforts in cardiology and are you planning any more sponsoring of clinical trials in that space?","Mick Farrell","Thanks for the question, Chris. That allows us to talk to our sort of third horizon portfolio if you like. And we are absolutely dedicated to cardio-respiratory care since it\u2019s almost \u2013 I am not sure it\u2019s a medical term out there in the formal literature, it\u2019s something that we are really leading the market on and I would define it as sleep disordered breathing amongst atrial fibrillation, sleep disordered breathing amongst heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. And I would also include some play in hypertension and some other cardiovascular diseases. But clearly, the data from CAT-HF were incredibly exciting. I don\u2019t know if you had a look at the detail that was presented there at ESC or the Heart Failure Congress at ESC. But as you start to look at those clinical data and the level of clinical and statistical significance from a relatively small group of patients, it certainly indicates to us and if you talk to Chris O\u2019Connor, who is the primary investigator who was formerly at Duke and is still the PI on the trial, clearly our investigators in all the hospitals and all the clinicians involved want to do some follow-on work in the heart failure with preserved ejection fraction space. So it certainly gives me more excitement in the space. The clinicians are very excited about it, the nurses, the doctors and we would like to continue to invest in the space. And so we won\u2019t go into details about what an investment will look like large multi-year clinical trials or a lot of market development work or some combination of the above. But you will hear a lot more from us regarding that Horizon 3 growth opportunity, including the CAT-HF trial and follow-up in the coming quarters.","Chris Kallos","Mick, just on that, is the data strong enough to incorporate into marketing to cardiologists and also these initiatives, are they in the next 2 years in terms of next steps, is that the sort of timeframe we are talking about?","Mick Farrell","So the data are not strong enough for an indication for use or IFU to start marketing to cardiologists. So no, it would require a lot further work on that front. What you might see is some work with \u2013 we talked about that trial with Kaiser Permanente, where we did some work on U-Sleep. We might work with payer providers, who are looking at these clinical data saying that\u2019s exciting, we would like to work on that in some sort of IRB or other controlled environment. But yes, I don\u2019t want to go into sort of real details here on the final question of our Q&A about what that part of Horizon 3 will look like at this point, but what I will say Chris is you will hear more from us over the coming quarters as to what we are doing in the cardio-respiratory care space, but it\u2019s pretty exciting data from CAT-HF. I am glad you noticed that.","Chris Kallos","Great. Thanks Mick.","Mick Farrell","Thanks Chris. May be one last question?","Operator","Yes, of course. Your next question comes from the line of Will Dunlop with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Will Dunlop","Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just wondering if you could please give more detail on your rest of the world flow gens growth and what countries perhaps and what products are driving good 11% growth there? Please.","Mick Farrell","So I will hand over to Rob Douglas, our President and COO to talk about EMEA and APAC.","Rob Douglas","Yes. Will, thanks for that question. We \u2013 as you saw, we reported pretty good results through there. We are not going to break it up by country, but we saw good continued take-up of the AirSense platform. We had previously talked about the value proposition really came on very strong, but it\u2019s been a little more work to get that value proposition going in some of the other countries. And we are very pleased with the progress going through there. And so we are really seeing good take-up across the board with that. So it\u2019s really been a good result.","Will Dunlop","Okay. Thank you.","Mick Farrell","Thanks a lot for your question, Will.","Operator","We are now at the one hour mark, so I will now turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.","Mick Farrell","So in closing, I would like to thank the now more than 5,000 strong ResMed team from around the world for their commitment to changing the lives of millions of patients with every breath. I am really proud of what the team accomplished, not just here in Q4, but throughout the whole fiscal 2016 to establish ResMed really as the world\u2019s leading tech-driven medical device company. Through clinical research, new features that expand our products and solutions and our acquisitions, we are transforming how healthcare is delivered and shaping a new frontier in connected care in respiratory medicine. We remain focused on our long-term goal of improving 20 million lives by 2020. Thanks for your time. And we will talk to you again in 90 days. I will hand back to Agnes.","Agnes Lee","Thank you, everyone, again for joining us today. If there are any additional questions, please feel free to contact me.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin.","Amy Wakeham","Great, thank you, Christine. Good afternoon and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us, and welcome to ResMed's second quarter fiscal year 2020 earnings call. This call is being webcast live and the replay, along with a copy of the earnings press release and our updated investor presentation, will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today.","Joining me on the call today to discuss our quarterly results are CEO, Mick Farrell; and CFO, Brett Sandercock. Other members of management will be available during the Q&A portion of the call. During our call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures, please review the notes to today's earnings release.","As a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about our future performance.

I'll then review top level financial results, some business highlights from the quarter, and a few key milestones. Then, I'll hand the call over to Brett who will walk you through our financials in further detail.","Our team achieved another quarter of strong revenue growth across the portfolio driven by superb performance in the mask category, particularly in the US market with good performance across the 140 countries where we provide our solutions. We continue to take market share with our software solutions that enable increased therapy adherence with resupply programs providing support to those who need it and with our innovative new products. Customers are voting with their wallets and they are voting for ResMed.","As the world's leading software driven medical device company, we are using digital health technology to transform the industry. We have sold nearly 11 million, 100% cloud connectable medical devices into the market, and Air Solutions our cloud-based ecosystem manages more than 12 million patients. In the last 12 months, we have changed over 15 million lives by providing a person with a ResMed device or complete ResMed mask system to help them breathe better and live better lives.","In addition, our Brightree and MatrixCare software systems are helping to manage 90 million more people outside the hospital. Digital health technology is an integrator across everything that ResMed does. AirView, myAir, Propeller, and a portfolio of other digital health solutions allow us to better engage with our customers and partners, including patients, physicians, providers, payers, and complete healthcare systems. We are investing in advanced analytics and expanding our capabilities in machine learning and machine intelligence so that we can grow this digital health ecosystem at double digits on a volume basis.","We will grow from just over 100 million lives improved with our healthcare products and solutions as we ended 2019 to our ambitious forward looking goal of improving 250 million lives in 2025. We now have over 5.5 billion nights of respiratory medical data in the cloud, and we are analyzing these data to derive actionable insights for the benefit of patients, physicians, providers, and healthcare systems. Our relentless focus on product and software innovation continues to set us apart from our competition.","We have massive opportunities ahead in sleep apnea, in COPD, as well as in outside the hospital software to help patients live better quality lives, to help patients and healthcare systems save money, and to help achieve better management of chronic disease. We believe that the future of healthcare is outside the hospital. That's where ResMed competes today and that's where we are winning today. We have the right elements in place to achieve our strategy and to drive financial success as we provide market-leading value to customers.","Let's now briefly review our top level financial results. We achieved another quarter of double digit revenue growth. We're up 14% in constant currency across our portfolio. This growth continues to be well balanced across our domestic US, as well as our global product sales, as well as from our software-as-a-service business. We continue to deliver operating leverage with non-GAAP operating profit growth of 21% year-over-year and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.21.","I'd like to focus now on our core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses. In the device\u2019s category, we delivered a good quarter with year-over-year constant currency device growth of 8% globally supported by strong 9% device growth in the United States, Canada, and Latin America geographies as well as by improving Europe, Asia, and rest of world growth, which was at 6% constant currency in the device category.","We continue to face headwinds for device growth in France as a result of the 2018 and 2019 digital health related fleet upgrades. We expect that the headwinds will begin to abate in the upcoming European summer, and we will start to return to market growth for devices in France during fiscal year 2021. Underlying patient growth remains healthy around the globe, and we continue to benefit from strong market dynamics with over 900 million people worldwide suffering from undiagnosed and untreated sleep apnea.","Growth in the masks and accessories category of our business was incredibly strong during the quarter. We were up 16% constant currency globally in this category, well ahead of market growth rates, indicating that we gained significant market share with our latest patient interface innovations. Removing the impact of some software within this category, we are still growing our global mask franchise in the mid-teens. Our flagship masks the AirFit F20 and the AirFit N20 continued their growth across global markets.","The success of these masks was augmented by continued good uptake of our more recent mask launches. We have launched a steady rhythm of mass innovation over the past 15 months. We have just lapped the successful launch of the F30 in the December quarter, and we will lap the launch of the N30, the N30i, and the P30i during the coming 12 months. The F30i was launched just over a week ago combining the needs for patients in the Freedom and the Minimalist mask segments. ","With our portfolio of solutions, we are ensuring that we have the right mask for every patient, every time. We are innovating and expanding our mask portfolio to offer comprehensive options for physicians and home care providers, and for the specific needs of the ultimate customer, and that's the person who suffocates every night with sleep apnea. We remain focused on driving innovation to meet underserved customer needs. We are creating future products that are smaller, quieter, more comfortable, and more customized to each person's needs.","Through digital health technologies, such as the myAir app, we are driving patient engagement without therapy, so that people can enjoy the benefits of better breathing and better sleep. We have well over 2 million patients using myAir and leveraging its insights and personalized feedback through coaching algorithms. In parallel, we are also ensuring that the cost of sleep apnea as a chronic disease can be better managed by physicians, providers, payers, and healthcare systems.","Our Digital end-to-end solutions combined with available 100% cloud connectivity, as well as information provided to patients on their own smartphones are all leading to significant improvements in cost, improvements in healthcare outcomes and improvements in quality of life. We believe cloud based software combined with world leading medical devices can add value and improve both clinical outcomes as well as the patient experience.","On the partnership front, our joint venture with Verily is creating software solutions to help identify and engage and enroll people with sleep apnea on a journey to better sleep and better breathing. We have commenced pilots in a handful of US cities to improve awareness, identification and engagement with the importance of good sleep and breathing to overall health. Our philosophy is this, the more a person knows about how much they suffocate every night, and the consequences of that suffocation on their overall health outcomes, the more likely they will seek solutions.","At its simplest level, this partnership will drive incremental growth in our core sleep apnea business over the longer term and on a deeper level. This partnership will also allow ResMed to participate in a broad chronic disease management platform covering sleep apnea, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mental health and beyond.","I'd like to now focus on our business in respiratory care. There are nearly 400 million people suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD worldwide. We don't believe these people are well served by global healthcare systems today and many COPD patients are frequent visitors to hospital emergency rooms with admissions and frequent readmissions. We have a vision to better manage COPD patients through the use of technology with digital end-to-end solutions.","Technology such as our Propeller platform helps how patients are communicated to, it helps how they are encouraged in the medical care and it helps how folks are looked after as an individual person. We believe that technology combined with world leading medical equipment can add substantial value to improve both clinical outcomes and the patient experience. We plan to offer a portfolio of solutions through all stages of COPD progression.","We will be there with Stage 1 and Stage 2 COPD patients as they commence inhaled pharmaceutical therapy managed by the Propeller platform. We will be there with Stage 2 and Stage 3 COPD patients as they add portable oxygen therapy to their care. We will also be there with Stage 3 and Stage 4 COPD patients as they commence non-invasive ventilation therapy and ultimately life support ventilation therapy.","We will manage the person on one end-to-end digital health COPD platform, helping the patient, helping their caregivers and loved ones, as well as helping their physicians and providers so that they have the right information at the right time, lowering costs and improving outcomes. Our team at Propeller continues to progress their business as we move along the path from pilot trials to commercial partnerships with both pharmaceutical partners and healthcare systems.","The digital health opportunity with inhaled respiratory medicine adherence will take time to build and we are making good progress. In December Propeller was included the only chronic respiratory disease solution in Express Scripts first formulary for digital health solutions. In November, access for Propeller users was expanded to pharmacy services from CVS, from Walmart, from Kroger and from Rite Aid. This was access directly from the Propeller app via my pharmacy feature within that smartphone application. We will update you on the milestones for Propeller with partners in both pharma as well as healthcare systems as we move forward throughout 2020.","Finally, I'd like to focus on our software as a service business. We continue to integrate and optimize the out of hospital SAAS portfolio for long-term growth. We are focused on leveraging our competitive advantage as the only strategic player competing with leading software solutions focused on home medical equipment providers, skilled nursing facilities as well as home health and hospice providers. Our SAAS portfolio revenue grew 37% year-on-year this last quarter, benefiting from the MatrixCare acquisition that we left during November.","We estimate that the weighted average market growth rate of these sectors we compete in is in the high single digits, excluding the timing benefit of the MatrixCare acquisition and on a pro forma basis, our SAAS portfolio grew in line with market in Q2. Our plan is to beat that market growth rate over the medium to long-term. As we reached the fourth anniversary of our Brightree tree acquisition here in 2020, we are achieving strong [Technical Difficulty] in our home medical equipment or HME sector with our Brightree team in Atlanta.","We just passed the one year anniversary without MatrixCare acquisition in the quarter and we are increasing our investments in our MatrixCare team up there in Minneapolis. This investment is focused on new module introduction for our MatrixCare platform, so that we can ensure that we're able to grow and share in our skilled nursing facility as well as home health and hospice sectors as we move forward. We're doing the hard work to make MatrixCare as successful as Brightree is in the ResMed portfolio. And we have all the elements in place to do that.","It took around 24 months to see strong sustainable returns from our investments in R&D and our management team at Brightree. We think we can meet or beat that timeline for strong and sustainable returns from our MatrixCare investments that we are currently making. Last quarter, we announced a collaboration with Cerner as the new preferred partner for home health and hospice software for Cerner's customers. It is early days in that partnership and things are going very well.","We've started to migrate existing home health and hospice customers to our MatrixCare solution. Our sales team is actively engaged with Cerner's sales team, with customers learning of the benefits of our MatrixCare, home health and hospice software. We are excited to drive growth from this partnership. The rich interoperability between our two solutions will provide value for both Cerner and ResMed and customers as well as their patients and residents.","I would like to take a moment to announce and exciting technology tuck-in acquisition that we are just in the process of completing. Just this week Brightree signed an agreement to acquire a company called SnapWorx. SnapWorx is a privately held software company that provides patient contact management and workflow optimization for sleep apnea resupply. The combination of Brightree's technology and logical services with this new SnapWorx technology creates the largest resupply base in the industry with end-to-end workflow automation.","For our HME customers, the combination of these two technologies Brightree and SnapWorx will increase patient adherence and increase operational efficiency. We expect the transaction to close very shortly. The acquisition of SnapWorx is expected to be neutral to our non-GAAP ResMed earnings per share initially. However, we expect this acquisition will be accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share during fiscal year 2021.","In summary, we have the vision to transform and significantly improved software solutions across outside the hospital healthcare sectors. We see a future where patients seamlessly transfer from HME to skilled nursing facilities to home health providers to hospice providers and beyond with reduced costs and increased efficiency resulting in better system outcomes as well as a high quality of life for the person in out of hospital care.","Before I turn the call over to Brett, let me close with this. The first half of fiscal year 2020 was strong, and we are well positioned to grow through the second half of fiscal 2020 and beyond. The continued success of our mask and device portfolio along with a solid pipeline of new products and new digital health solutions covering sleep apnea, COPD and out of hospital software gives us confidence in continued growth as we move through the year.","We have positioned ResMed for the long-term as the global leader in digital health driving top line and bottom line growth as we execute toward our 2025 strategy. We are focused on our triple aim; first, to slow chronic disease progression; second, to reduce overall healthcare system costs and third, to improve quality of life to the ultimate customer, the patient.","With that all hands go over to Brett in Sydney for his remarks and then we'll go to Q&A. Brett?","Brett Sandercock","Great, thanks Mick. In my remarks today I'll provide an overview of our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. As Mick noted we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the December quarter was 736 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms revenue increased by 14%.","Excluding revenue from acquisitions, group revenue increased by 11% on a constant currency basis.","Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our software as a service business our sales in US, Canada and Latin America countries were 408 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter.","Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled 242 million, an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter. However, in constant currency terms sales in combined Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 8% over the prior year quarter.","Breaking out revenue between product segments; US, Canada and Latin America device sales were 204 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales was 204 million, an increase of 19% of the prior year quarter.","The revenue in Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales of 162 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms an increase of 6%.","Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets was 79 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms an increase of 11%.","Globally in constant currency terms device sales increased by 8%, while masks and other sales increased by 16% over the prior year quarter. Software as a service revenue for the second quarter was 87 million, an increase of 37% over the prior year quarter.","During the rest of my commentary today, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjusted the impact of amortization acquired intangibles, purchase accounting fair value adjustments to MatrixCare deferred revenue, litigation settlement expenses and acquisition related expenses.","We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release. Note that this quarter for GAAP reporting purposes we are now reflecting the portion of amortization of acquired intangibles attributable to develop technology in our cost of sale, rather than being allocated to operating expenses. We've made this change along with SEC disclosure guidance.","This mainly [ph] will disclose both GAAP and non-GAAP profit ratios going forward. We have included reconciliation of both GAAP and non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin in our press release.","Going forward I will reference this non-GAAP metric because I believe it is the best measure of our underline gross margin. Our non-GAAP gross margin improved to 59.7% in the December quarter compared to 59.1% in the same quarter last year.","Compared to the prior year, our non-GAAP gross margin increased by 60 basis points, this was predominantly attributable to viable product mix and manufacturing efficiencies partially offset by typical declines in average selling prices.","Moving on to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the second quarter were 171 million, an increase a 6% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms SG&A expenses increased by 8%.","Excluding acquisitions, SG&A expenses increased by 2% on a constant currency basis. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 23.3% compared to 24.8% that we reported in the prior year quarter.","Looking forward subject to currency movements and taking into account recent acquisitions, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 23% to 25% for the remaining two quarters of fiscal year 2020.","R&D expenses for the quarter were 50 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 18%. Excluding acquisitions, R&D expenses increased by 4% on a constant currency basis. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.8% contains a 6.6% in the prior year.","Looking forward subject to currency movements we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for the balance of fiscal year 2020.","Total amortization of acquired intangibles was 20.6 million for the quarter, an increase of 30% over the prior year quarter, reflecting the impact from our recent acquisitions. Stock based compensation expense for the quarter was 14.1 million.","Our non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was 219.5 million, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter. While non-GAAP net income for the quarter was 176.3 million, an increase of 22% over the prior year quarter.","On a GAAP basis our effective tax rate for the December quarter was 10.2%, while on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rates for the quarter with 11.6%. Our tax rate was favorably impacted by a tax benefit of 20.3 million associated with the vesting of employee share based compensation in particular the tax deduction associated with the vesting of executive performance documents in November,","Excluding the impact from this benefit, our GAAP effective the tax rate would have been 21.6%. And our non-GAAP effective tax rate would have been 21.5%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rates for the second half of fiscal year 2020 will bring the range of 19% to 21%.","Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.21, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.10. Our diluted earnings per share were also favorably impacted by the text benefit that I've just discussed. Excluding the impact of this guidance our non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $1.07.","Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was 69.9 million reflecting robust underlying earnings partially offset by the timing of tax payments with 111 million in tax paid in our second quarter. Additionally, we made the payment for our settlement to the US Department of Justice of 40.6 million this quarter.","Capital expenditure for the quarter was 25.1 million. Depreciation and amortization for the December quarter totaled 45.5 million. During the quarter we paid dividends of 56.1 million.","We recorded equity losses of 6.9 million in our income statement in the December quarter associated with a Verily joint venture. We expect to record approximately 6 million in equity losses each quarter for the balance of fiscal year 2020 associated with the joint venture operations.","Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share. At December 31, we had 1.3 billion in gross debt and 1.1 billion in net debt. Our total assets were 4.4 billion and our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels.","Finally, to recap, our top line revenue was strong this quarter with growth across all major categories. Gross Margin expanded and our operating costs remained well controlled. As a result, we are continuing to drive operating leverage with Q2 non-GAAP operating profit up 21% year-on-year. We are focused on driving operating results, integrating our SAAS acquisitions and ensuring we continue to invest in our strategic long-term opportunities.","And with that I'll hand the call back to Amy.","Amy Wakeham","Great, thank you Brett. We'll now turn to the Q&A portion of the call. I would like to remind everyone to limit yourself to one question and if you have additional questions, please feel free to return to the call queue. Christine. We're now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from line of Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Your line is open.","Margaret Kaczor","Hey, good afternoon, guys and Good morning to Brett out in Australia.","Mick Farrell","Thank you.","Margaret Kaczor","And you may be the first one for me is on mask growth. Obviously, you guys continue to do very, very well from that perspective. So as we look at the last maybe 12 to 18 months, can you give us a sense of the relative impact of new product launches, especially in the white spaces maybe that you weren't in before, the resupply agreements that you kind of referenced, a little bit at JP Morgan, market growth and general share taking and the idea is as we look forward how're the moving dynamics between those categories, and how do you kind of adjust your strategy to keep performance high? Thanks.","Mick Farrell","Yeah, thanks for your question, Margaret. And as you noted, there's a number of factors contributing to this very strong mask growth that we had, 16% constant currency on a global basis, and even taking out some of the software just well up there in the mid-teens. You hit on pretty much all of them. There's an increased adherence that we're driving through our digital health solutions when we're achieving 87% adherence, when the doctor is using AirView and the patient is using myAir, and all the digital techs in play that drives up our mask growth. Secondly, when there's resupply and patients have the opportunity if they want to, to participate in getting a fresh mask as their old mask becomes used, and we are partnering with Brightree, Connect, and with ResMed ReSupply to provide that and the acquisition of SnapWorx will help.","And then thirdly and really importantly, these last 15 months, the steady flow of four really exciting new mask innovations. Interestingly, these mask innovations aren't to replace a previous product, but to go after underserved or under met customer needs. And we call the minimalist category and the freedom category where people move through different positions during sleep; prone, left, right, sleepers want a Freedom mask and people who had some claustrophobia or want small, larger masks go to the minimalist category, and the F30 that we just launched is right in the heart of both of those. So it's all the above contributing to this really strong growth. We still think that the market growth right is in the high-single digits for masks. And we took really good share during this December quarter. Our job and challenge is to keep driving all those things: resupply, adherence, mask innovation and we plan to do just that.","Margaret Kaczor","Thanks guys.","Mick Farrell","Thanks Margaret.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Matthew Mishan","Great and thank you for taking the questions, hi, just a follow up on the market share gains in masks. Are you winning new patients at a higher market share clip or are you able to convert existing sleep apnea patients from competitors and getting them to switch?","Mick Farrell","Yeah, Matthew, that's a really good question. I'll hand that to Jim Hollingshead, the President of our Sleep Division to walk through that.","Jim Hollingshead","Good morning, Matthew. I'm down in Australia. So I hope you can all hear me as well.","Matthew Mishan","I can hear you just fine.","Jim Hollingshead","Yeah, it's a combination of both. We feel very confident in our overall position with mask that we\u2019ve had so many masks launched, and and as Mick referenced, we've had several mask launches in the last 15 months. All of them have been successful launches. We now have a very wide portfolio. It's the widest portfolio offering of mask on the market. So, we continue to take new patient share across all three mask categories. I'm sure we're likely to also be getting competitors switching, and there's less market data available on that dynamic, but we're very confident we're taking new patient share pretty successfully.","Matthew Mishan","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Sean Laaman","Good morning, Mick. Hope you're well. My question relates to something you announced last quarter, and I wonder if you can give a bit of an update on how this Novartis deal with Propeller, is there any update there and how that might be tracking? Thanks.","Mick Farrell","Thanks, Sean. Well, we don't talk in our core business or in our new software businesses about individual customers or partners until things are public and moving along, but there was a public data last quarter from our work with pilot trials with both GSK and Novartis in the Propeller area looking at inhaled pharmaceutical medicines. Look, the beauty of it \u2013 as I sort of described in the opening remarks, the beauty of Propeller is it provides an end-to-end platform to help us take care of people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. And so, Stage 1 and 2, with Propeller, we can take care of the patients, ensure they have the medicines that their doctor prescribed for them but also engage with that person because they're going to \u2013 it's a progressive disease, they're going to move from Stage 1 to Stage 2 and Stage 3 and Stage 4 COPD. And so our goal with Propeller is not just to have a partnership with pharma company A or B, but it's to really create a platform where we help end-to-end management of a person as they move through disease progression and it helps us engage with that person to help them adhere to their therapy, whether that therapy is the pharmaceutical inhaler or that therapy is a portable oxygen concentrated or that therapy as they move forward is a non-invasive ventilator or a life support ventilator. And so that's our goal with these partnerships. As we hit milestones during 2020 on the pharma side and as we hit milestones on the healthcare system side, we'll give updates on that. But look, yes, we did talk to the MAGNIFY trial that we're still enrolling patients for with Novartis. That's in its early days. So we will give updates on the clinical data, but also importantly commercial partnerships as they move forward through 2020. Thanks for your question, Sean.","Sean Laaman","Yeah, thank you Mick.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Deakin-Bell from Citigroup. Your line is open.","John Deakin-Bell","Good morning. My question just relates to the increase in the SG&A, obviously, you've got fantastic leverage from that and I think we've talked about it previously, but the 2% underlying seems a \u2013 I think that's a record low numbers for you. And just give us a sense perhaps, of how that might look over the next six months and maybe going forward or should it return back to the kind of mid-single digit levels?","Mick Farrell","So I'll hand that to Brett who's down in Sydney.","Brett Sandercock","Yeah, thanks. Hi, John. Yeah, it was a low this quarter. And we did benefit, certainly from much lower litigation related expenses this quarter relative to last year. So that did certainly moderate that growth rate. In my guidance, I said, I think will revert back to the range of 23 to 25 for the second half, which would suggest that it will track higher in terms of growth rates for SG&A at least in the back half, but certainly helped by some reduction or significant reduction in litigation costs coming through this quarter relative to last year was probably the single biggest driver. And that certainly motivated the growth rate. And try to adjust for that in that kind of range above given as a percentage of revenue going forward to be a better indicator, I think.","John Deakin-Bell","That's helpful. Thanks Brett.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Saul Hadassin from UBS. Your line is open.","Mick Farrell","Saul, you may be on mute.","Saul Hadassin","No, I'm not. Can you hear me?","Mick Farrell","We can hear you now. Yes.","Saul Hadassin","Great, thanks. Yeah, just a question for Brett, Brett just on gross margin, I'm just wondering if you can give some color on the underlying sleep and respiratory care business to what the gross margin has done ex acquisition contribution and usually provide an outlook for the rest of the fiscal year for gross margin as well. Can you just give us that some color there too? Thanks.","Brett Sandercock","Yeah, I mean, I think going forward the second half, I think we'll be consistent with where we are, would be an estimate on the gross margin, as you know, a lot of moving parts on that. That would be our expectation. If you look at the acquisitions, we did \u2013 [indiscernible] halfway through the quarter, but fairly \u2013 it's kind of fairly minimal impact this quarter, the big drivers of that year-on-year growth or expansion of that gross margin around the product mix. And that's really being driven by that out performance you're seeing in mask growth and that's typically high margins, what you would see on devices so that that's the biggest impact. And then we're still seeing manufacturing efficiencies, some around logistics and so on as well. And they continue to come through on gross margin, so they're the two big drivers this quarter.","Saul Hadassin","Alright, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Shane Storey from Wilson HTM Limited. Your line is open.","Shane Storey","Yeah, hi, thanks. Just looking again, back at the US mask business kind of just from another angle, you spoke about the adherence in resupply. But have you measured the step up in the number of mask per patient per year say, over the last 12 to 18 months and the last reference point that I've got is may be a tick under two per patient per year? So any observations around that might be very useful. Thanks.","Mick Farrell","Yeah, Shane thanks for your question. I think there's a whole portfolio of customers doing different levels of resupply in different countries around the world. If you take the example of France, there's a government mandated requirement that you provide to masks, two masks per patient per year. And it's different in all the 140 countries. Yeah, you focused on the US growth, which was strong. And yes, the last public number we didn't talk about that was 1.9 masks per patient per year. But look out of the 5000 customers in the US there's a broad spectrum of adoption of Brightree. Resupply, Brightree Connect, ResMed resupply, and technologies like SnapWorx that we just acquired. And so there's a broad range. But Jim, do you want to \u2013 Jim Hollingshead, do you want to provide any further color as to what you'd want to share on mask supply metrics?","Jim Hollingshead","Yes. Thanks Mick and thanks Shane. I would just add to add to a mix that just a couple things. The first one is the trend is we don't we don't talk about the number of publicly obviously, but the trend in the US has been steadily slowly, but steadily up over the last several years. And we attribute that both to the range of things Mick talked about earlier in the call. So better adherence tools that we're providing our platforms, better masks lead to better adherence initially and therefore better long term adherence and also the adoption of resupply platforms by our HME customers. So the trend is slowly and steadily up. It's still well below Medicare and commercial parallel levels and so it's a good trend and there's still a lot of opportunity.","Shane Storey","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Steve Wheen from Evans & Partners. Your line is open.","Steve Wheen","Hey, good afternoon guys. My question is just on specs [ph] businesses and growth rate there. I was wondering if you could help us reconstruct that growth rate, particularly between MatrixCare and Brightree and perhaps as part of that, to give us an update as to your understanding of how those businesses are performing since you've been acquired. I guess, with reference to the EPS outlook that you provided at the time of the acquisitions.","Mick Farrell","Thanks for the question, Steve. That allows us to talk to our investment in SAAS and again SAAS this quarter was 12% of our global revenue. And so it's a sector that we're calling out and you'll see that in our financials. It's a very hyper competitive sector, when you look at HME software, you look at skilled nursing facility software and you look at home health and hospice software, so I'm going to be really hesitant to give detailed market share and\/or growth rates within each of those sectors. What I said on the prepared remarks is true that cost \u2013 if you look at ResMed's weighted average revenue across HME, skilled nursing facility, home health and hospice, as well as the others private duty home care and client communities. The weighted average market growth rate in those sectors is in that high single digit. And during the December quarter over that portfolio we held share, we grew at the \u2013 taking out the acquisition benefit that gave us 37% growth. We grew in that high single digit on our weighted average portfolio. One thing I'll say is we've \u2013 when we hit April here in 2020, we will have and Brightree four years.","And as you guys remember, because you followed the stock for a long time, the first two years with Brightree we were investing. Yeah, we put some new management team leaders in there we brought in new CEO, new CTO and some skill sets in R&D. We're doing very similar things now in our MatrixCare journey. And so I'm not going to break it out in detail, but qualitatively I'll say that the investments that we put in those first two years into Brightree are really starting to pay off. We've got new logos, new customers, new modules, and we're taking share, the growth is picking up. And at MatrixCare we're making those investments today in more R&D, more management skills and capabilities and looking obviously back in synergies across our portfolio. So I think we can meet or beat the timing of our Brightree investments and the strong and sustainable growth that we're now getting out of that in our MatrixCare investment.","Steve Wheen","Thanks Mick.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Low from JP Morgan. Your line is open.","David Low","Thanks very much. Just a quick one from me, you mentioned that the mask sales included some software revenues, just wondering if you could explain what that is and how much contribution that will make going forward?","Mick Farrell","Yeah, there's a little bit of that. I'll hand it to Brett to go through the financial details on that.","Brett Sandercock","Sure. The probably the bigger one there is the \u2013 just through the software related to the \u2013 or the platform related to Propeller acquisition. So that's kind of \u2013 that's probably the biggest single delta, but there are a few other things there, but that's probably the biggest one.","David Low","Great, thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Andrew Goodsall from MST Marquee. Your line is open.","Andrew Goodsall","Thanks very much, just obviously looking at the current of coronavirus issue and I think if we go back to size, you might sales of about $5 million of sleep [indiscernible] levels into China. Just wondering if there's any follow through affect to yourself from the current coronavirus.","Rob Douglas","Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. It's Rob Douglas speaking. There's a pretty dynamic situation going on at the moment in China. And so tracking, it's difficult, but we are tracking very closely. In terms of our China business, we think obviously the hospital's going to be very busy on their respiratory. So there'll be a lot of focus on that. We would expect to see increased demand for ventilators, whether it's of the same relative scale to size or not, we don't know yet. We're actually working hard on our local supply chain there. Remember, we've got a really good team in China building good ventilators in China for China. And so, in fact, some of that team has been working in some of these hospitals and Jason Sun, Head of China they're local heroes who are really staying on the ground there and helping look after patients in the face of this terrible disease. So I wouldn't be predicting exactly what the impact will be on an overall scale, there will be an offset as well, likely the hospitals won't be looking at sleep patients for a while. So there may be some in asleep in China, but it's unlikely all of that to be material. Just one other point in terms of the overall business, we've mentioned many times our supply chain isn't configured around China. Most of its not in China, but there are some second and third tier suppliers in their way work closely with them at the moment. We wouldn't expect this to be a problem, but we'll have to keep a close eye on them.","Andrew Goodsall","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lyanne Harrison from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Lyanne Harrison","Good morning, gentlemen and thank you for taking my question. Just to continue the discussion on the SaaS business and probably most specifically previously we talked about resupply expansion and that given over about six months in, can you share how the resupply program outside of sleep apnea is tracking and what your expectations are for the remainder of financial year '20?","Mick Farrell","Thanks Lyanne. Yeah, so you're talking about our expansion of \u2013 our resupply capabilities, we went into some diabetic supplies and orthotics and urology products and so those \u2013 they're not a material part of ResMed's overall business. But they were a good expansion of ResMed's capabilities to look off to the HME sector beyond just sleep apnea and sleep app supplies that we are very good at making sure that they work through and so it's not material to our overall business. I'm not going to break out the specifics and other than to say they're going well and customers are adopting them and I'd love them to become a material part of our overall business to be able to break out like that. But it's early days and it's a good strategic ply of Brightree to sort of expand their capability with workflow optimization and both the combination of live call and tech that we use on masks and sleep apnea supplies. It's the same technology used on those diabetics and those other areas of HME. And so we're just helping our customers grow their businesses and get appropriate resupply when customers are there and requiring for authorization for it as well. So sorry, I can't get more specific than that, Lyanne.","Lyanne Harrison","Thank you.","Mick Farrell","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Gretel Janu from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Gretel Janu","Thanks. Good morning. So would you be able to give us an update on the outlook for competitive bidding? So what are your expectations in terms of reimbursement changes in 2021? And if there is potentially a decline in mask reimbursements, how is ResMed thinking about responding? Thanks","Mick Farrell","So I'll hand that question to Dave Pendarvis. Dave?","David Pendarvis","Yeah. Thanks Gretel. We continue to be at the same place we were last quarter. And that is we're waiting along with everyone else in the industry what the results are, the competitive bids that are in. We expect them at the end of the North American summer. So sometime around August or September and we'll know where the results are. We are pleased with the efforts that we made and others in the industry made to educate bidders, so they understand the portfolio nature of the lead item pricing and the impact of bidding on CPAP reimbursement on mask reimbursement. We're comfortable that that we conduct business with our customers now on a portfolio basis. And however, reimbursement settles out in the Medicare space. We expect to there'll continue to be strong demand for mask resupply that will continue to be important part of our customers business and it'll be an important part for patients' long term adherence success. So we don't see any significant changes in the trajectory going forward. But obviously, like with everyone else, we just have to wait and see what the actual reimbursement amounts come out to be.","Gretel Janu","Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of David Bailey from Macquarie. Your line is open.","David Bailey","Yeah, good morning, guys. Just for me Brett, cash flow looked a bit awake this quarter. Just wondering if you could talk through some of the moving parts there? You've called out the Department of Justice litigation settlement. Just talk us through what normalized tax cash payment would look like? And then also net interest on a cash basis for the quarter will be great.","Brett Sandercock","Yeah, so yeah, was impacted by plenty of tax payments as well, if you look at it underlying, excluding those I still think actually pretty strong on the cash flow front. Normalize is probably \u2013you're probably more like around the kind of 40 million a quarter. And I think going into Q3, it's going to be more like that. So that's impacted for this quarter. Expect Q3 and Q4 to be much better in terms of cash flow performance. And in the next one was that on the interest, interest expense?","David Bailey","Managed expenses, it is broadly monitor [ph] the income statement you're talking about.","Brett Sandercock","Yeah, pretty close. You wouldn't \u2013 that's a good proxy. It's not that far different to that.","David Bailey","Yeah. Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Chris Cooper from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Chris Cooper","Thanks for taking the question. I was going to follow up to one of the previous questions. So the competitive bidding, I know it's a bit early to speculate on the particular outcome. I just guess I'm more interested in how you expect to manage the discussion with the DNA partners yourselves. Would you expect positive and negative changes to be passed on to you one to one? Or is there an outcome here where, I guess you bet more downside than the upside given there's a possible agreement here were some categories going to increase and some decrease just any thoughts around how you think that would be helpful.","Mick Farrell","So I'll hand that for David and if Jim, you want to add any color from the customer perspective, as well, but Dave you first and then Jim?","David Pendarvis","Sure, I mean, we already have ongoing discussions with our customers. We view them as good partners with us and we have robust discussions where they would like to get the best prices they can and we want to make sure that we serve them as best we can. That dynamic won't change with competitive bidding or anything else. So we expect to continue to have good discussions with them and the environment for the last year and a half and for the balance of calendar year '20 is that there's been about a 2% increase each year in the Medicare reimbursement. And so that's obviously contributed to a benign pricing environment that we've been experiencing for the last period of time. But we didn't participate with our customers in their bidding, obviously, they made their own decisions, we're confident that the bidding process will be a more fair one this time, and we're hoping it'll end up with a process that will be able to be good for the overall industry. But in terms of individual customer negotiations, Jim, you might want to comment on that.","Jim Hollingshead","Thank you, Dave. I'll just add to that, I mean, I think that's very well, but we do have very good relationships with all of our customers with our key customers and we'll work through it together. The other thing I would just remind everybody is a Medicare fee for service is the minority part of the market. So it's an important part of the market, but it's a small percentage of the market.","Operator","And your next question comes from line of Mike Matson from Needham. Your line is open.","Mike Matson","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Just have, I guess one more competitive bidding question. So with \u2013 specifically with non-invasive ventilation, that's the first time it's been included, I think could see a fairly steep decline. So can you maybe comment on what you expect there? And then also, I don't know if you could quantify how much of your sales are coming from non-invasive ventilation in the US, but just to help us understand what the exposure is.","Mick Farrell","Dave and Jim, you again,","David Pendarvis","Up again, so thanks, Mike. Non-invasive ventilation obviously is in two different categories. One what we would characterize as life support ventilation is the new category that it's now going to be a competitive bidding, our air curve ranges the buy levels have previously been in competitive bidding. So that's not changing. It's more on the life support side. And that is newly there, but they're also had been reductions in that reimbursement over the past few years leading up to this. So it's not necessarily the case that you'll see the same kinds of reductions that you saw in the round two kind of range previously for the sleep products. Nevertheless, we think it's important that patients can benefit particularly COPD patients can benefit from these devices, they ought to get into the hands and that's of those patients and it's certainly a device that requires a lot of service. A lot of people in the in the home are making sure the device is working appropriately, so you need to have a strong reimbursement for it. It's a smaller group of customers who actually do this kind of business, and they're probably likely to be focused on what their real cost of serving are. So again, we're optimistic that our customers are sophisticated customers, they'll bid appropriately, so that they can make an adequate margin to be able to provide that service that's really, particularly in this area very well needed. So we'll wait and see how it goes. But we don't break out specifically our sales of life support anywhere in the US or otherwise, but thanks.","Mike Matson","Okay, thanks and then just would SnapWorx, maybe just comment on what that brings to the table they didn't already have with Brightree? Thanks.","Mick Farrell","Yeah, so SnapWorx is a technology that adds to Brightree end-to-end capabilities that SnapWorx has to partner with the HME. So it goes beyond just the live call and technology capability. They have provided to a number of customers and ability to further reach out to customers. And we had observed this software that was partnering with our Brightree platform and performing really well with those customers. And so we had a relationship with SnapWorx over the last 12, 24, 36 months and we've seen them really grow into a really good technology talking and the Brightree team looked at the technology from the team there in Nashville, Tennessee that created this tech and the entrepreneurs that created it. And we're really excited not only by what they're achieving in the market, which has better adherence and better engagement with both the HME and really importantly, with the end user customer.","And what I bring it back which is the patient, what I bring it back to this is some data, some clinical data that we presented from the 5.5 billion knots of data that show that as you increase adherence, and as you engage with the patient and resupply the two add to each other. And some data we just released last quarter shows that for every hour of sleep, we reduce the total healthcare costs for inpatient by 8%. So this is all tied together, right. So Brightree, resupply \u2013 ResMed resupply and SnapWorx will increase adherence, drive increased mask resupply and that will also through that increased adherence lower the costs of the total healthcare system by 8% for every hour of sleep after those seven hours and so I think that combination is really powerful of now Brightree plus SnapWorx. Now, it's early days, we're just literally going through the finals of this acquisition, but watch us over the next 12, 24 months and we'll give you updates obviously every quarter as to how well that integration on that technology's going.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Suraj Kalia from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. This is Mike on for Suraj. We read recently that Fitbit is adding an oxygen variation graph for select users with an FDA submission for sleep apnea diagnosis somewhere in the near term here. I'm just curious if you see that as longer term helping to increase the number of OSA patients treated.","Mick Farrell","Yeah, Mike thanks for the question. And look, it's really interesting that tech companies are really getting involved in the field of, I call it health wellness and sleep wellness is a big part of that. Obviously, we have our partnership with Verily and I have the Google watch as part of their baseline study and they're doing some identification, I'd call it. You call the diagnosis; I call it identification of potentially at risk people for poor sleep suffocation or sleep apnea. I think what Fitbit has is along those same lines and what they try to do, and that Fitbit is now part of the Google portfolio. I believe there's an acquisition in line there. It'll probably add on to that capability of, if you see de-saturations in the oxygen, there's a higher likelihood. There's other causes potentially of those de-sat, but there's a high likelihood of sleep apnea, so I would call it more in the medical terms a screener that will then hopefully identify and engage a person that maybe I have a sleep issue, maybe I have a breathing issue and indicate to them they need to get on to the true diagnostic pathway. And then we can sort of bring them into the identification, engagement enrollment capability we're trying to perform. But look, Jim you run the global fleet business, is there any further detail you think about some of these tech companies and the ability for them to identify more patients?","Jim Hollingshead","Sure yet, Mike, thanks for the question. I think it's an unreserved good that companies like Fitbit are putting in place technologies to help consumers understand how they're sleeping and whether they might have a sleep disorder. And we know that there's 936 million people globally, who suffer from sleep apnea, the vast majority of them don't know it. And forever in the industry, one of the bottlenecks has been driving awareness on the one hand and then making objective screening and then diagnosis, on the other hand easier and so when companies like Fitbit \u2013 there's a whole range of companies that are now doing something like that in the space. When they when they decide to put that out in consumers hands. It's fantastic for us and for those patients more importantly.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, thanks Mick and Jim.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Anthony Petrone","So maybe just two quick ones, one just on local manufacturing just given bushfires, obviously in Australia, so any update just on that manufacturing plant. And then just one on legislation in the US, H.R.2771 just to maintain the 50-50 blended rate in rural areas, is there any update on actually where that sits and the likelihood that it gets to Congress this year? Thanks.","Mick Farrell","Thanks for the questions Anthony. I'll ask Rob to answer the first one around manufacturing and then Dave to answer the second one around the H.R.","Rob Douglas","Yeah. Thanks, Anthony. As we said the ResMed supply chain is configured around multiple sources. At this stage most of our manufactured products come from our Singapore plant, but we have full capability in the Sydney plant that does often focus on newer and more complex products. But we have full process capability in both plants. The fire season in Australia has been devastating. However, it hasn't actually gone into the outskirts of Sydney, which would actually make the whole thing a lot worse if it did. And today, we haven't seen any interference with that at all. But if there was interference that wouldn't overly affect us because of our ability to reconfigure.","Anthony Petrone","Thank you.","David Pendarvis","And as to the bill and we certainly support that bill. Again, we think it's important that our customers receive the appropriate reimbursement and particularly in rural areas. It's difficult to do that. So we certainly support 2771. I think it's \u2013 you may have noticed there's a lot going on in Congress these days. So it's a little difficult to get anything through. But there is an opportunity in the middle part of the year, when I think some of the Medicare extenders come up for renewal, that there could be a push to get this along with some of the other items the industry supports in place. So we'll have to wait and see. But we certainly support that. And at a minimum, Congress indicating their support the industry is positive.","Anthony Petrone","Thanks.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of David Bailey from Macquarie. Your line is open.","David Bailey","You know like I'm just following up on Saul's question actually, just wondering if you're able to quantify the contribution of those acquisitions to US or America's masks and accessories revenues for the quarter that would be helpful.","Mick Farrell","Yeah, I said in the prepared \u2013 thanks for the question David. I said in the prepared remarks, it's the \u2013 so if you take that sort of global mask growth rate of 16%, and you take out Propeller software, you're going to be in the mid-teens, so maybe 100 basis points or something on global. And if you take the US growth, we're all pretty \u2013 I mean most of the Propeller software is the US growth on masks was 19% on a constant currency basis. If you take out Propeller and the software, you're about 200 basis points there, you're probably around 17% growth in the US territory, so 16 becomes around 15 and 19 would become around 17 David. I think that answers both your questions. And thanks to everyone for spending an extra eight minutes since we were eight minutes delayed due to the phone lines there, but appreciate that all.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.","Mick Farrell","Hey, great. Thanks, Christine. And thanks again to all of our shareholders for joining us on this call. I'd also like to take the opportunity to thank the 7,500 ResMedians, many of whom are also shareholders, for their dedication and hard work. You produce these great numbers that we get to report. You help people sleep better, you help people breathe better, you help people live better lives outside the hospital in a 140 countries, which is pretty amazing. Thanks for all that you do today and every day and we'll talk to all of you again in around 90 days. Amy?","Amy Wakeham","Great, thank you all again, for joining us today and to echo Mick, thanks for bearing with us through the audio difficulties. If you do have any questions or additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out. As previously mentioned, all the documents along with the transcript and hopefully a clean replay of today's call will be available on our website.

Agnes, you may begin.","Agnes Lee","Thank you, Marianna, and thank you for attending ResMed\u2019s live webcast. Joining me on the call today are Mick Farrell, our CEO, and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call.

Important factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially, are in the forward-looking statements detailed in filings made by ResMed with the Security and Exchange Commission.","I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell.","Mick Farrell","Thanks, Agnes, and thank you to all of our shareholders, as we summarize our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. We achieved solid double-digit global revenue growth this quarter, led by sales from Brightree and continued strong growth in our device platforms. We also saw the start of a steady ramp our latest mask technologies.","For the call today, I will review top level financial results, outline some regional highlights and discuss key announcements this quarter. Then, I will hand the call over to Brett who will walk you through our financial results in further detail.","We achieved strong device sales due to our leadership in digital health and connected care. The number of patients managed on the AirSolutions platform and the number of daily uses of our Brightree platform continue to grow rapidly. This quarter, we announced that we have reached a milestone with more than 1 billion nights of sleep data in our cloud-based physician and provider solution called AirView. We have well over 2 million, 100% cloud connected medical devices. We are liberating data and unlocking value for physicians, providers and patients like never before.","Midway through the quarter, we commenced the launch of our new AirFit range of mask, the AirFit N20 nasal mask and the AirFit F20 full face mask. Both of the products leverage new step change technology called Infinity Seal that provide significant advances in fit and comfort to the patients. Earlier this month, at the JPMorgan healthcare I announced that we had received FDA clearance for the ResMed AirMini, our world leading, travel friendly, sleep app technology. I will talk more about that a little later.","At the bottom line, in terms of non-GAAP net operating profit, we grew at 13% on a year-over-year basis in Q2. Including financing costs, our diluted earnings per share or EPS was $0.73 on a non-GAAP basis.","We continue to balance revenue growth and gross margin improvements as well as ensuring an appropriate investment in both R&D and SG&A, so that we can maximize the success of multiple product launches across our global markets.","Now for some regional highlights. The Americas region produced double-digit revenue growth. These results were fueled by Software-as-a-Service revenue from Brightree and 13% growth in devices. Device growth was particularly remarkable given that we were up against a 24% year-over-year comparable.","The mask and accessories category in the Americas grew 4% in the quarter. This is up sequentially and reflects the fact that our sales team that received products around Thanksgiving timeframe has started showing the new technology to physicians and providers. There is clearly a long way to go in the ramp of these products in Q3, Q4 and into fiscal year 2018.","Growth in devices was driven by the continued support for the AirSense 10 systems by our customers. These are powered by the cloud-based AirSolutions software platform, including the myAir patient engagement app that has over 1,000 new patients signup every day.","We achieved good growth in our respiratory care device platforms in the Americas, particularly our cloud-connected life support ventilation platform called Astral. We earned strong growth in our combined EMEA and APAC regions this quarter, primarily driven by Flow Generator sales, with some outstanding performance from our combined Curative and ResMed China businesses.","We have now completed the earn out and the integration is going very well. As we enter the Chinese New Year, we have truly formed one ResMed China team with one vision, one mission, two brands and many and varied customer channels, the thing is really coming together well.","Mask, accessory and other sales in the combined EMEA and APAC regions were down year-over-year due to a couple of factors, one we had some international licensing revenue from the comparable quarter a year ago in the region and two, the N20 and F20 were only released in a few countries, and as we know uptake of new masks is a lot slower in EMEA and APAC then the U.S. market. We expect this mask category to return to public growth in EMEA and APAC as we continue to launch the N20 and F20.","Feedback from patients, physicians and homecare providers on the fit range and comfort of the N20 and F20 are very positive. This is a great indicator for stronger mask growth in Q3, Q4 and into FY 2018. Looking at our Software-as-a-Service revenue Brightree continues to grow strongly and in line with our acquisition model in the low-to-mid teens.","We are on track with our work to integrate Brightree software functionality into the AirSolutions portfolio. We are truly creating end-to-end software solutions for our customers and Brightree is achieving strong double-digit growth, with high levels of customer's satisfaction and customer workflow efficiencies gains.","Let me now take a few minutes to update you on the progress against each of the three horizons in our 2020 growth strategy and then I\u2019ll hand the call over to Brett.","In the first horizon of growth which focuses on our core sleep apnea business, we are making significant advances with the smallest, quietest, and most comfortable products, catalyzed by digital health and connected care solutions.","We launched our new AirFit F20 full size masks and our new AirFit N20 nasal masks in the second quarter. The Infinity Seal technology is a step change in comfort for patients and fit ranges of 97% to 99% of patient populations approving a winning value proposition with respiratory clinicians. We are seeing exceptionally strong demand for the N20 and F20 products and for some of the masks SKUs demand is in fact outpacing supply as we ramp up our production capabilities for these new technologies. We will continue to ramp up our supply and expect to be out pacing demand as we go through Q3 and into Q4.","At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco earlier this month, we announced the FDA clearance of the world's most CPAP called the ResMed AirMini, it's a tiny portable travel PAP with all of ResMed's best in class comfort features. AirMini is intended to be a secondary device for travel, and it truly compliments our world leading AirSense 10 platform.","AirMini is an amazing technology and we expect to launch this product commercially before the end of the fiscal year. I have personally been using a prototype of the ResMed AirMini for over 12 months. It has traveled with me to Asia, all over Europe and throughout the Americas. For those listening to this call, who may also be CPAP patients feel free to go to airmini.resmed.com and signup. We\u2019ll make sure that you\u2019re amongst the first to know when the product is fully launched through our Homecare Channel Partners.","We continue to lead in the field of connecting care, one of the key foundations of our growth strategy. We have reached as I said earlier 1 billion nights of sleep data and are focusing on algorithms to convert big data into actionable information. The ultimate goal is to unlock even more value for physicians, providers, payers and most importantly for patients. This quarter, we announced results from a European study published by PricewaterhouseCoopers analyzing data from more than 23,000 patients in Germany and the UK.","The study shows that myAir patients when compared to controls, used their CPAP devices for longer durations and have significantly higher adherence rates. This adherence study was executed in our core sleep apnea vertical, we are extending this cloud based coaching algorithms to our ventilation and oxygen technologies, watch this space.","This is a great transition for the second horizon of the ResMed 2020 growth strategy. We know that COPD is the number three cause of death and the number two cause of re-hospitalization in the western world. The spectrum of cloud connected respiratory care products across our ResMed portfolio will play a big role in reducing costs for providers and improving outcomes for patients with this debilitating disease. Connected Care in ventilation can reduce costs and improve patient outcomes in COPD and beyond.","We continue to see portable oxygen concentrators or POCs as an important addition to our spectrum of respiratory care products. Our integration of the Inova acquisition has focused on quality improvements to the current Activox POC platform. We are gradually ramping the launch of this technology to our global sales team as we continue to improve quality and functionality of the product. We will ultimately add cloud connectivity to our POC platform which will help drive adherence for patients, fleet management for providers and activity tracking for physicians.","Our third horizon of growth encompasses a portfolio of long term opportunities including sleep help and wellness as well as clinical adjacencies, such as atrial fibrillation and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Another key area of horizon three growth is our work in chronic disease management algorithms, including population health models, health care analytics, care co-ordination and Software-as-a-Service models for home health, home nursing and hospice.","In the area of sleep help and wellness we are making good progress with our new joint venture called Sleep Score Labs with capital investments from ResMed, Pegasus Capital and Dr. Mehmet Oz. We started the partnership last quarter with an entire Dr. Oz show dedicated to the field of sleep wellness. Dr. Michael Bruce and Dr. Oz leveraged the S+ by ResMed the world's first non-wearable sleep device and Smartphone app designed to help people track, better understand and improve their sleep.","The sleep awareness campaigning encompassed anonymous sleep data from a database with over one million nights of sleep. Sleep Score Labs calculated America's overall sleep score and Dr. Oz announced the results at the Consumer Electronics Show or CES in Las Vegas earlier this month. Dr. Oz reported that people are not sleeping as well as they should, we're getting less than what the National Sleep Foundation recommends which is seven to eight hours plus of sleep. We are about one hour behind the minimum with around six hours of sleep.","People say they're tired and people say they want to understand their sleep better. Sleep Score Labs will do just that, they will truly quantify sleep and help people objectively determine which sleep solutions are best for them.","For ResMed this is about driving the importance of sleep awareness and sleep health. We will be helping people realize that they need to go see their doctor if they have any risky breathing at night or any shortness of breath day or night. These and other signs and symptoms of sleep apnea and COPD impact overall health. We will continue to drive sleep health and sleep awareness and our ResMed brand as a leader in the field.","Let me close with this, we are incredibly excited about the ongoing launch of our N20 and F20 mask technologies and our pipeline of products in 2017 including the new ResMed AirMini. We continue to lead in connected care with enhanced solutions that lower cost for providers and improve outcomes for patients.","We are leading the industry, driving consumer awareness of sleep, so that undiagnosed consumers go to see their doctors and healthcare providers. We continue to bring out strategy into action for the benefit of physicians, providers, payers and most importantly to improve the lives of tens of millions of sleep apnea and COPD patients around the world.","With that I will turn the call over to Brett for his remarks and then we will go to Q&A. Over to you Brett.","Brett Sandercock","Right, thanks Mick. In my remarks today I'll provide an overview of our results for the second quarter fiscal year 2017. As Mick noted we had a solid quarter. Revenue for the December quarter was 530.4 million, an increase of 17% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 18%. Excluding acquisitions in constant-currency terms organic revenue increased by 10% over the prior year quarter.","Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Brightree acquisition, our sales in the Americas were $293 million, an increase of 9% over the prior-year quarter. Sales in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific totaled $203.6 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific increased by 13% over the prior year quarter.","Breaking out revenue between product segments, Americas device sales were $154.3 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $138.6 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter. For revenue in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific, device sales were $146.7 million, an increase of 19% over the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms an increase of 21%.","Masks and other sales were $57 million, a decrease of 7% over the prior-year quarter or in constant currency terms a decrease of 4%. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 17% for masks and other increased by 2% over the prior year quarter. Brightree revenue for the second quarter was 33.8 million, with growth on a prior year comparable basis continuing to track in in the low to mid-teens.","During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjusted impact of amortization for acquired intangibles, acquisitions related expenses associated with additional contingent consideration, restructuring expenses and litigation settlement expenses. In the prior year comparable, they exclude amortization of acquired intangibles, restructuring expenses and the release of the SERVE-HF accrual. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release.","Our gross margin for the December quarter was 58.3%. On a year-over-year basis, our non-GAAP gross margin increased by 20 basis points, reflecting manufacturing and procurement efficiencies and the favorable impact from our Brightree acquisition. These were partially offset by product mix, typical declines in average selling prices, and unfavorable currency movement. Due to current exchange rates and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margins to continue be in the range of 58% to 60% for the balance of fiscal year 2017.","Moving on to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $139.3 million, an increase of 18% over the prior-year quarter and in constant currency terms, also an increased to 18%. Excluding the impact from acquisitions, and in constant-currency terms, our SG&A expenses increased by 10%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 26.3% compared to 26% that we reported last year. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 27% to 28% for the balance of fiscal year 2017. This reflects expected marketing expenses associated with product launches and ongoing legal expenses.","R&D expenses for the quarter were $38.2 million, an increase of 32% over the prior-year quarter, or on constant currency basis, an increase of 28%. This increase largely reflects the impact of our recent acquisitions and incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. Excluding the impact from acquisitions, our R&D expenses in constant currency terms increased by 11% over the prior year. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7.3% compared to the year-ago figure of 6.4%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for the balance of fiscal year 2017.","Amortization of acquired intangibles was 11.7 million for the quarter, an increase of 7.3 million over the prior year, reflecting the additional amortization associated with our recent acquisitions. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was 10.8 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was 131.6 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was 103.3 million, an increase of 1% over the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter was 76.7 million. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.73, consistent with the prior year quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.54.","Note that our prior year earnings per share comparable was restated as a result of the adoption of accounting standard ASU 2016-09. Whereby we recorded a tax benefit of 5.1 million in Q2 FY16. In the current quarter, under the standard we recorded a tax expense of 25,000. Excluding this impacts non-GAAP earnings per share would have increased by 6% over the prior year quarter.","Additionally, foreign exchange movements negatively impacted second quarter earnings by $0.03 per share, reflecting the unfavorable impacts from the weaker euro and stronger Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.1%. And looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2017 will be in the range of 20% to 22%.","During the quarter, we recognize restructuring expenses of 4.4 million associated with rationalization of our European R&D activities. Additionally, we recognize an expense of 10.1 million for additional contingent consideration associated with acuity acquisition. The additional accrual was the result of the business achieving performance milestones that result in the investment contingent consideration payable under the purchase agreement. Finally, we recognize an expense of 8.5 million is part of global settlement of all litigation between ResMed, BMC and 3B.","Cash flow from operations was 119.9 million for the quarter. This reflects strong underlying earnings offset to some extent by modestly increase in net working capital balances during the quarter. Capital expenditure for the quarter was 14.7 million. Depreciation and amortization for the December quarter totaled 27.7 million. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.33 per share, an increase of 10% over our prior year quarterly dividend.","As previously announced, we have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to recent acquisitions. At present, we expect to recommence the buyback in fiscal year 2018. At December 31st, we had approximately 1.2 billion in gross debt and $380 million in net debt. Our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels. At December 31st, total assets were 3.3 billion and net equity was 1.7 billion.","And, with that, I will hand the call back to Agnes.","Agnes Lee","Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A and we ask that everyone limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions after that, please get back into the queue.","Mariana, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] David Low from JPMorgan is online with a question.","David Low","If we could just start with the mask rollout. Mick, you mentioned that you've had some issues with keeping up with demand and you've also talked about the rollout into other countries outside the US. I was wondering if you could just expand on those two issues, and wondering particularly whether that production issue means that the rollout internationally might take a little longer.","Mick Farrell","Thanks for the question David. Look the patients and provide and clinician acceptance in the mask has been great. The Infinity Seal technology particularly and its ability to reach 97% to 99% of the patients that coming to a sleep lab or through a clinic. And so these acceptance has been great and certainly exceeding what we had thought it may be.","And so what we\u2019re finding with the new production technology that we\u2019re using for this infinity sale is that, as we ramp across the different stock keeping units, that in some of those SKUs, we are not keeping up with very high demand, but as we look forward over Q3 and Q4 we will start to catch up and we will expect by certainly, the end of Q4, that we\u2019ll be well ahead of the demand for the product.","Rob, do you want to add something on that?","Robert Douglas","I said, regarding the rest of the world rollout, the volumes in the U.S. are much larger than elsewhere in the world and we really don\u2019t see a big impact on the rest of the world rollout, that will continue slow and steady progress as we reported previously.","David Low","Great. Yes, looking at it obviously, it seems like a good problem to have if you can't keep up with demand. Just the other question I had, Brett, you mentioned in the SG&A commentary, you've given us guidance, which I think is above what we've just seen and I think you made a comment about legal expenses. Just wondering if that relates to the settlement that's already happened or are we talking about other ongoing legal expenses?","Brett Sandercock","No, that\u2019s really the ongoing legal expenses Dave, I mean, we're into, obviously, legal action with S&P, so that's not inexpensive.","David Low","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Andrew Goodsall from UBS is online with a question.","Andrew Goodsall","Probably a follow-on call, sorry, follow-on question from David, just trying to get a bit more granular on the N20 series. Just the 4% mask growth you saw in the U.S., just if you're willing to characterize, was that mainly the N20, I guess, after a sort of flat growth elsewhere? And just also any feedback from the pilots that you guys ran on those masks?","Mick Farrell","Thanks, Andrew. Well both the N20, which is mask, and F20, which is the full face mask are doing very well. They both have the Infinity Seal technology this year, single-layer technology that provides excellent fit and moment for patients, I personally wear a CPAP mask and the N20 is particularly comfortable for me, but those products are going very well and doing well in the U.S. market and that\u2019s what got us to the sequential uptick in the U.S. mask growth and we expect to, as we go through Q3 and Q4 and pick our production up to continue to grow quite strongly there and to turn back to a positive growth in EMEA and APAC.","Andrew Goodsall","Any new feedback from the pilot? Did it meet your expectations in terms of the way the DMEs are thinking about this mask ahead of other masks?","Mick Farrell","Yes, certainly as the DME or HME home care providers, as we call them in Europe start to see this product, that fit range, fitting 97% to 99% of the patients that walk through the clinic has just been a real winning value proposition for the respiratory technicians. The N20 is the go to mask for nasal now for them. And the F20, we believe is a go to mask for them on full-face, and its early days in the rollout, the U.S. team got this at the weak of Thanksgiving, they\u2019ve really only had half a quarter and one with the bunches of Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, but we do expect as we look for Q3 and looks to Q4 and start to ramp the production up, that\u2019ll be a slow steady gradual increase in both the U.S. and in other regions through Q3, Q4 and of course beyond FY2018. These technologies have a lot of legs.","Andrew Goodsall","That's great. And I just want to think of that 4% as a good lead indicator of the early success.","Mick Farrell","Correct.","Andrew Goodsall","Okay. That\u2019s great, really appreciated. Thank you.","Operator","Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets is online with a question.","Joanne Wuensch","Couple of things. You mentioned the impact of lower ASPs and mix on the expense structure. Could you expand upon that just a little bit?","Mick Farrell","[Multiple Speakers]. Brett, you want to take that?","Brett Sandercock","Yes. Just on -- that was really truly that the gross margin year-on-year that kind of ASP product mix is probably the biggest one year-on-year, we\u2019re still seeing, well we\u2019re seeing that really strong device growth continuing and unfavorable FX impacts was quite a bit too. If you just look at it sequentially, Joanne, it was 60 basis points, but we had unfavorable FX of 40 basis points. So it was -- that was probably the drivers you look at on a sequential basis.","Joanne Wuensch","Okay. That's very helpful. Share repurchases, when are you likely to restart those, given your cash flow in the quarter? ","Brett Sandercock","Yes, we\u2019re still of the view that we\u2019ll commence that in FY18.","Joanne Wuensch","Okay that\u2019s very helpful. I\u2019ll leave it back. Thank you very much.","Operator","Margaret Kaczor from William Blair is online with the question.","Margaret Kaczor","Brett. The first question is really what drove the acceleration in Americas devices and the number was pretty big. The question is, it sustainable and can your mix of new products and ASV offerings really keep that revenue growth profile for ResMed in the low double-digit or teens range?","Mick Farrell","Thanks for the question Margaret, it's Mick here. So we did have very strong growth in devices in the Americas, it's 13% on a constant currency basis. We think that was primarily fueled by AirSolutions, the portfolio of AirView and myAir capabilities to lower the labor costs for setting up a CPAP by 50%, 60% for a home care provider. Also the ability for engagement apps like myAir to drive adherence from previous industry standards of 50%, 60% up to 80%, 87% in some of the data that we have talked about publically.","So we think all that comes together to drive good sustainable growth and that does of course include some of the growth in the respiratory care line, our Astral ventilation, our life support ventilation line. Look we talk in terms of the industry growing in the mid to high single digits. Clearly, we were taking some share in devices in this quarter and you know as we look forward we'd expect to see you know good mid to high single digit growth of the industry and we'd like to lead or beat that and clearly we beat that this quarter.","Margaret Kaczor","Okay and then maybe a similar question on the international side. Obviously you had strength international generator, so was there anything specific to this quarter? And then I hate to sneak one more in, but the constant currency of mask growth what was it excluding the licensing fees that you referenced at the beginning of the call?","Mick Farrell","Okay, I'll hand it to Rob to talk about international devices and licensee. ","Robert Douglas","Yes, so Margaret, the factors driving the international sales are similar to the ones driving the U.S. sales, just that the sort of the ramp has been different as the take out from the whole process of explaining AirView and getting the myAir going is a longer process. Then the other really significant thing in the rest of the world data, outside of the U.S. data is China had a big impact, and so we had a very strong quarter in China, really related to the teams getting together and our integration plan going really well. And the team all pulling together focusing on new channels, really getting the sleep business and also really driving our respiratory care business in China. And then of course you know the Q2 is sort of like the end of year in China, is traditionally a strong quarter for us.","Mick Farrell","The only thing I'd add to that, Rob, which I think is really good is that ASV turned from the post survey check where it was a headwind into a tailwind again. And so we're starting to see growth in ASV, not just in complex sleep apnea and central sleep apnea, but the pain management and in the U.S. in the PTSD category. So all that together, Margaret, is sort of what's one of the tailwinds driving those strong device numbers.","Margaret Kaczor","Thank you.","Operator","Matthew Taylor from Barclays Bank is online with a question.","Matthew Taylor","Hi, thanks for taking the question can you hear me okay?","Mick Farrell","Yes, got you loud and clear Matthew.","Matthew Taylor","Okay great. So one question I wanted to ask is you announced the settlement of all your litigations with BG. And I just wanted to know if you could help us understand what the ongoing impact is going to be in terms of the licensing royalty revenue that you could see and the lower legal expense that you could have, now that you have this settlement.","Mick Farrell","I'll hand that question to Dave Pendarvis, our Global General Counsel, Dave.","Dave Pendarvis","Thanks Matt, first of all we're really pleased with the settlement. We think that it is helping to validate the strength of our IP that we're now going to get paid royalty on sales in the U.S. by our competitor for the products that are covered by the deal. The reality is, those royalty streams will not likely be material to us going forward and you know that's fine. They don't have a large market share in the U.S. market. We don't expect that to change anytime soon. So we don't expect it to be material.","Obviously there is a reduction in the ongoing litigation cost that were associated with that case and really a number of cases around the world, but as Brett mentioned earlier we continue to have really, frankly a larger case against F&P and some other ongoing legal expenses. So there still will be significant legal expenses going forward. But obviously one of the reasons you settle cases is to the avoid the further ongoing expense and that was one of the reasons that motivated us to reach this settlement with BMC that we did, but we're very pleased with it.","Matthew Taylor","Great and then just a follow up on an earlier question. I mean it's a little bit surprising that's late and kind of the flow gen launch to see such a big acceleration, was there any kind of stocking order or anything else that was abnormal that you would call out or was this just a good execution quarter?","Mick Farrell","Yes, Matthew I think it was really about good execution. The value proposition of AirSolutions has shown itself to be very sustainable. It's a sustainable compelling value proposition for customers. When you're reducing the costs of therapy setup by 50% or 60%, it's just embedded -- becomes embedded into the work flow and just how our home care provider partners like to work, they like to work with the cloud-based system. They like to work with one that's lower costs and drives adherence.","And so as Rob said there was some sort of good acceleration in China and some good sales of our China team running through the tape. But then globally we're seeing the AirSolutions platform have a really good impact and Astral as it comes into play and is now part of the cloud-based or cloud connected system, is getting some good traction as well. And then the third factor is ASV, the Adaptive-Servo Ventilation technology coming to a tailwind. So all that together has provided strong flow generator growth and we expect strong growth to continue. And obviously the rates will be what they'll be, but mid-single digits -- mid to high single-digits is what we see the market going at and again we'd like to meet or beat that.","Operator","Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley is online with a question.","Sean Laaman","I've a question on Brightree. So good revenue number there ahead of us. I was just wondering, Mick, if you could give us a sense of I guess some of the CPAP share dynamics and some of the resupply dynamics you've seen amongst new adopters of Brightree? That's the first question.","Mick Farrell","Thanks Sean, I think I'll hand that question over to Jim Hollingshead, who runs the Americas. I'll just start off with, yes the low to mid-teens growth from Brightree is strong, again it's a compelling value proposition for our home care providers, and they like it incorporated into their work flows. Jim, any further color with regard to ongoing resupply sales associated with Brightree?","Jim Hollingshead","Yes, the Brightree platform, if you think of it from a point of view of the core sleep business is an extension of process automation. And so there's a lot of affinity between new Brightree customers and customers who are users of the AirSolutions platform and the data connection between the two of those platforms makes it much easier for them to continue do that. And so it's -- even though the two businesses have separate commercial teams, separate sales team out in the market they tend to reinforce each other in the market.","Brightree customers tend to have a very good experience with ResMed sleep products and back and forth. And then the Brightree software platform for a resupply which is called Connect is getting increasing adoption in the market. It's very valuable for the customers who adopted it and it's very-very good for patients because it drives regular resupply for patients and they therefore have a better experience on therapy and that is a growing part of their offer.","Sean Laaman","Sure, thank you. And just as a quick follow-up when might we see the P20?","Mick Farrell","Sean, we don't talk about future pipelines to a great extent. We did open up a little bit on this call about the ResMed AirMini, the world's smallest travel seat CPAP that we got FDA clearance on, that was a public FDA clearance, but we won't be talking about the pipeline of future masks. But thank you for the question.","Operator","Will Dunlop from Bank of America is on line with a question.","Will Dunlop","Just firstly on pricing in the U.S. I think you mentioned a few quarters ago that you had gone early with customers in reducing price prior to the introduction of competitive bidding on 1 July. Not all customers, but some I remember you saying. Just wondering when you might cycle those price reductions and you might see maybe a more favorable pricing environment in the U.S.?","Mick Farrell","Will, I think you're referring to something maybe 18 plus months ago, where they were some changes around competitive bidding round two. So 18 almost, 24 months ago [Multiple Speakers] when there were some resets.","William Dunlop ","I'm referring to the latest round of competitive bidding. [Multiple Speakers].","Mick Farrell","So, okay. Well if it\u2019s related to that they know that what we\u2019ve being saying, which is the reality around the competitive bidding round three and round three national expansions, and the rebids going on now is that it\u2019s pretty steady pricing picture, in fact no step change at all. Industry normal price changes year-on-year in a steady pricing environment. Obviously, we\u2019re seeing a lot of competition amongst the innovation. Innovation in the masks and innovation in the cloud connectivity and connected care side. So intend complication for us and our competitors in masks and digital offerings. But in terms of price it\u2019s been a very steady environment last four, eight, plus quarters.","William Dunlop ","Okay. Thanks. And then could you just talk to demand for the AirSense in Europe please?","Mick Farrell","Sure. Rob, do you want to address?","Robert Douglas","We don\u2019t really break it out, but as I said before the value proposition around AirView and the connectivity is the same in European countries as it is in the U.S. It's just that some sort of the dynamics of how people understand the value and create the value is different and it takes -- has taken more time to build that up.","In particular, in France, we had talk about, there was some legislation or some rules supporting that that was going to effectively create a differential reimbursement. So there was more reimbursement, the devices that were monitored wirelessly. And that was then knocked out in a court case, but subsequently that rule has been reversed and we\u2019re expecting sometime this year to see it become the norm that there will be that differential back in the French business and that, for example, in that one country, of all those many countries would help drive volume.","Other than that, we continue to see the volume increases going on, the take up of myAir is strong and we continue to see that patients in Europe are very interested in getting their own data and using that to help their treatment and help improve their own health outcomes.","William Dunlop ","Okay. Thanks.","Mick Farrell","Thanks for the questions Will. ","Operator","Mike Matson from Needham & Company is online with a question.","Mike Matson","I guess, I just wanted to start with your manufacturing operations. I think they are pretty much all outside the U.S. One, I want to know if that\u2019s correct, and two, how do you think you\u2019d be affected by some of these border tax proposals that the Republicans are talking about?","Robert Douglas","Listen Mike, currently we have a very strong global supply chain footprint that manufactures in many countries and we talk a lot about Singapore and Sydney as being major part to that supply chain. What we don\u2019t often talk about is that we do have manufacturing in the U.S. as well and our motor, ResMed motor technology subsidiary is based in the Los Angeles area. And we also manufacture some in the U.S. in our Atlanta facility. And so we\u2019ve actually got the capability to respond to what is needed on a tax basis, as needed and we'll keep any eye out and be flexible with it. Dave I think you had a comment?","Dave Pendarvis","Yeah Mike, its Dave here. Though I think the one thing we can all agree on about U.S. politics today is it's going to be hard to predict. There are a lot of -- there is a lot of discussion about tax reform and what that might mean and we'll just have to wait and see what the actual proposals are, and what the details are, and what gets implemented, when it gets implemented.","As Rob said, we\u2019ve got opportunities to do things and frankly, if there become incentives to manufacture more in the U.S., clearly that could be an opportunity for us. We've got a lot of customers in the U.S., a lot of patients in the U.S. But we take care of all of our stakeholders, we look at what we do best for shareholders, what we do best for customers, what we do best for employees and take all those factors into account when we make our decisions. But it\u2019s going to be I think a few years for things to sort themselves out, and we\u2019ll obviously make the best decisions we can on the basis of whatever the details are.","Mike Matson","Okay. Thanks. And then just curios for AirMini, I think there is one other product out there that\u2019s big part of that segment of the market. So I was just wondering if you had a feel for how big that market is currently, I guess in the U.S. at least, if not globally?","Mick Farrell","Thanks for the question Mike. The current travel PAP is a very small niche segment and what our goal at ResMed as the global leader in sleep apnea therapy is to bring the world\u2019s smallest, the world's most comfortable, the world\u2019s quietest and most engaging travel CPAP to the market. And so we think we will actually expand on what is currently a very small travel CPAP niche and create a sizable segment of travel CPAP users that are willing to pay retail cash and work with our home care provides who access those products and really make it as part of their care so that you can have the same experience when you\u2019re traveling around the country, around the world as you do at home. So that\u2019s the goal of the ResMed AirMini and as we launch that between now and June 30, you'll see us talk about how we're going to drive awareness, create that niche and make sure that patients the world over have the opportunity to have ResMed therapy with them wherever they are.","Mike Matson","Thanks. Can I squeeze one more in? Just curious if the liquidation of AirStart devices had any kind of material impact on of your U.S. flow generator growth in the quarter.","Mick Farrell","Thanks, Michael. I\u2019ll hand that over to Jim any thoughts on AirStart?","Jim Hollingshead","It is a very small part of sales in the quarter. Not material.","Mick Farrell","Thanks for the questions Mike.","Operator","Suraj Kalia from Northland Securities is online with the question.","Suraj Kalia","So, Mick, a couple of questions from my side. First, you just mentioned you're expecting AirMini to be cash-pay for customers, specifically from a travel perspective. Mick, can you give us some idea about how you'll stratify this market in terms of numbers in the U.S.? Just trying to get a sense -- obviously, you guys have a head start here also, how the numbers could play out? That would be one question.","And the second question would be how do you all view a potential Tom Price confirmation as HHS had? Our checks obviously are that he's pro DME. Any color from you guys thinking perspective also would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking my questions.","Mick Farrell","Thanks, Suraj. I\u2019ll take the second one first and then I\u2019ll hand to Jim maybe to talk a little bit about AirMini and we're looking at segmenting the cash-pay market and working with our provider, customers. But the second part first, Tom Price was a Congressmen from Georgia who spoke at the Mid Trade Conference in Atlanta last fall. And I don\u2019t think anyone in the room knew or thought that he might become HHS Secretary, but when he got off on the floor and made a very passionate speech about the importance of home care, importance of keeping patient's out of hospital, taken well care of in the home. He's an Orthopedic surgeon, I think he understand the economics of the broken sort of sick care system where patients are frequent fliers in the ICU and CCU with COPD and we believe also sleep apnea is a big impact on that.","I think he will be a big supporter. And if he puts in place some of the policies that he was advocating for in behalf of the homecare industry as HHS Secretary, we think it could be beneficial for our industry. But look you know as Dave said earlier, there is a lot of things going on in Washington right now, a lot of change and we're going to wait and be ready to hopefully see some more homecare friendly policies out of Washington, but we'll wait till we see them and then we'll act on them. But that sort of the early take on Tom Price, I\u2019d say it's a positive for our industry.","Jim, on the AirMini, thoughts?","Jim Hollingshead","On the AirMini, we see a couple of opportunities with the AirMini. One for patients and one for HME customers. Patients, we believe have a strong pent up demand for a good travel solution for CPAP. And right now there are some solutions on the market that we think are not up to snuff. We think our offer is going to be very superior and well actually as Mick was saying earlier, we'll grow demand in the category because patients really want to take our full featured CPAP with them when they travel. And so we see an opportunity for patients to have better care and more convenient life with their CPAP as they travel.","For customers it's an opportunity because we know that our HME customers, especially in the U.S. are trying to grow their cash-pay business. There is more and more health care spend that's out of pocket in the U.S. because the way insurance is increasingly shifting the landscape. Our DME customers, HME customers are looking for and often exploiting quote, unquote, cash-payer out of pocket opportunities. We intend to take this product through our dealers which will allow them to service patients and that pent up need for a good travel PAP experience and also create a cash-paying opportunities to grow their businesses.","Operator","Anthony Petrone from Jefferies is online with the question.","Anthony Petrone","Just a couple on underlying device growth in the quarter and it sounded like there's some moving parts there. I'm just wondering if you have the combined contribution for Astral and Nova and ASV. And then maybe just a revisit on underlying sleep margins, where they sit today, just getting all the moving parts with pricing and mix versus Americas or U.S. and masks flow gens? And then one follow up question. Thanks.","Mick Farrell","Right, Anthony, well look, the underlying device rate, we don\u2019t split up sleep versus respiratory care and then respiratory care down to ventilation and oxygen. But as you saw in the Americas, a really strong 13% constant currency growth in devices and in EMEA and APAC, very strong 21% with the global 17% growth. We think that growth is strong and sustainable, but there are elements, as we've said earlier with regard to China where there were some things that where sort of onetime and there were other more sustainable parts such as the AirSolutions platform and its ability to continue to drive AirSense 10 and AirCurve 10 sales along those lines.","But with regard to margins and as we look forward, I think other than the foreign exchange impact, it was pretty reasonably good quarter in terms of margins. Any color there Rob, you'd like to add?","Robert Douglas","Well, I think as I said some of the drivers around margins in the sleep have to do with product mix, so while machines grow stronger as the headwinds for margins, sales strong in the U.S. compared to our lower volume markets in Europe and in Asia will generally also be a headwind to margins as well.","Offsetting that our efficiency improvements in our supply chain and as we really cranking the production for the AirSense 10 and in other products we see ongoing improvement and it\u2019s a continual headwind to our win rates, so we run neck and neck too. Brett, I don't know if you have any other comments?","Brett Sandercock","No, everyone thinks you've articulated it pretty well. I guess we try to take it all into account as best as we can and so we're still looking at the guidance of 58% to 60% and then it\u2019s just contingent on how the product meets geographic mix, FX plays out during the quarter.","Anthony Petrone","That's helpful. And then a follow-up would just be, did you quantify the benefit from China and then just any comments on the Cures Act, with that passing, obviously, that pushed out some of the reimbursement cuts, how does that play out? Our checks are suggesting there's sort of one-time payments that DMEs will get at some point in 2017, but that it could be scattered throughout the year. Thanks.","Mick Farrell","Right, thanks Anthony, I think somehow you managed to get four questions in there, but we don\u2019t quantify the breakdown there. Rob was talking qualitatively to the curative ResMed China combination and its impact on the quarter, so we're not going to break all that out. Dave do you have any comments with regard to 21st Century Cures and impacts for ResMed?","Dave Pendarvis","Sure, so it's really well done by the industry to get this through, you know it's been a long time coming. You remember we were a while back and we were about to have some relief for the rollout of the national expansion of rates and it was stopped by a protest on the floor of the house for gun controls. Just goes to show you, crazy things can happen when you're trying to go through the legislative process.","So the industry worked very hard, really across the board and was able to ensure that this time around it stuck and they got some relief, that was six months of relief and there are still some issues with competitive bidding rates and how competitive bidding is determined. But the industry I think on the whole feels good about having gotten a win and feels like, as Mick was saying earlier, that if Congressman Price is confirmed as Secretary of the HSS, there should be at least a sympathetic ear for perhaps some further regulatory relief. And as the industry moves forward you got some stability now. The rates are set with Medicare for the next two years, till January of '19 and Congressman Price has billed to add in binding bids, so that now anyone who bid in an area has to put up a bond, that's a benefit. And so I think the industry is feeling like it\u2019s a better environment with some more predictability and some more stability and that's a positive.","Anthony Petrone","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question, Saul Hadassin from Credit Suisse is online with a question.","Saul Hadassin","Maybe first question, Mick, any more color on just what the production issues involved with regards to those SKUs on the masks. In other words, is it a matter of adding more manufacturing lines, for example, or is it just simply putting more product through the existing lines and the demand has maybe caught you by a bit of surprise versus the production capabilities? Thanks.","Mick Farrell","Thanks Saul, well yes clearly the market acceptance has been ahead of our expectations and Rob you want to go into some detail with regard to the manufacturing?","Robert Douglas","Any new product sold has new tooling and new things to learn about it and really new fine tuning to do on the process and it's really just a matter of mixing that fine tuning and matching that fine turning and process building, plus capacity building, which is predominantly driven by tooling and supply chain management. Matching that with the take up of demand and we should see that sort of match up as we said earlier through the quarter.","Saul Hadassin","Great. Thanks. Just a follow-up for Brett maybe. But just on the cash flow from operations, for the half, again, looks like it's reasonably weak versus the PCP. You did flag the inventory build. Should we expect that to recover second half as you start to clear this product that you've been building up, particularly on the mask side for the launch? ","Brett Sandercock","So, we've had -- I mean -- I think Q2 [ph] cash flow around 120 million was quite good and we just had some sort of modest working capital gain. So that was pretty good. If you look at comparing it to the prior year, I guess we're kind of -- working capital was definitely moving in our favor and we pushed that down quite a bit, so we're generating some big cash flow last year. But I'm still -- Q1 was a little low, it was quite happy with Q2, actually that cash flow ran 120 million, and you might -- we thought new product flow and so that we need to sort of catch up with -- and you might say that you're a little bit, but I still think overall working capital probably just a modest increase that we'll see.","Operator","Matthew O'Brien from Piper Jaffray is on line with a question.","Matthew O'Brien","Just to start with on the core sleep business, by my calculations, and there's a lot of inputs here, looks like it increased, the gross margin increased by about 80 basis points. First of all, is that fair sequentially? And then is that strictly -- it looks like it's mostly manufacturing driven, maybe a little bit of mix on the generator side, but would love to hear your thoughts on that.","Brett Sandercock","So, I'm not sure on that. Sequentially -- if you look at this sequentially, we're at Q1 was 58.9 and this quarter was 58.3. I mentioned before unfavorable effects impacts around 40 basis points, a little high then what we expected with kind of deterioration in euro really through the quarter. I mean I guess the rest was pretty benign if you looked at it sequentially. If you look at it year-on-year which is up a tad from 58.1 up to 58.3 --.","Mick Farrell","Hey Brett, excluding Brightree.","Brett Sandercock","Yes, so excluding that we've got. Yes, I mean the bigger impact there is on product mix and we're still seeing really strong device growth. I think as we go forward and we get some improvements in mask growth with the new products and so on, then you'll see that impact moderate, but at the moment it's still a headwind for us, so that's kind of if you like kind of offsetting this to large extent on the Brightree. And had typical ASP decline and there was FX also year-over-year which was unfavorable, but as we mentioned earlier in manufacturing procurements so on, we've driven that and we've got efficiency there as well, which more than offsets those other elements.","Matthew O'Brien","Okay. I'll follow up a little bit offline on that. As far as Inova goes, I think when you bought that about this time last year, you said it would take about 18 months to refine the product, feel more comfortable in rolling that out to your broader sales force. Just based on the comments from earlier in the call, is it fair to say that you're a little bit ahead of schedule and you could be a little more aggressive in rolling that out throughout the course of 2017?","Mick Farrell","I\u2019ll take that. Matt, I\u2019d say we\u2019re pretty much on schedule for that sort of 18 months, I'd get it to, where we think ResMed's quality and functionality should be. Look the Activox product is a great POC. It\u2019s light and very portable. But it can improve in some areas and we\u2019re really working on the improvement of those areas in terms of oxygen delivery and sustainability of that over the many months that they\u2019re out there helping patients get freedom back.","And so I\u2019d say, I don\u2019t track and we\u2019re looking forward to gradually ramping that Inova product out there. And as we said in the prepared remarks earlier adding communication capability onto that and pulling it as part of the whole AirSolutions portfolio, we think we\u2019ll allow home care providers to do better fleet management of all these POCs that are out there, but really engage the patients in terms of inherence for the product as well. So the conclusion is, I think we're just pretty much right on track with the versus the timeline that you talk about.","Matthew O'Brien","Thank you.","Operator","Victor Windeyer from Citi Investment Research is online with a question.","Victor Windeyer","Look, my phone dropped out before so if I'm going to be repeating something, I apologize. I just wanted to understand the rest of the world masks and I think, from the questions, you've been saying that supply outstripped demand on this. Can you just confirm that? And why the masks in the rest of the world declined 4% post launch and what we're expecting there.","Mick Farrell","Thanks Victor. So I mean, I\u2019m sure, you heard the prepared remarks what we talked about. There are two factors behind EMEA and APAC on the masks. Number one, we had a big comparable, what was about around 8% constant currency growth in the quarter a year ago in EMEA and APAC. So we had some licensing revenue in there and some really good sales to particular customers.","And we just launched the N20 and F20 at the ERS. And so it\u2019s the first quarter out there and as you know, you\u2019ve been following our stock for a long time, mask launches in EMEA and APAC, you're talking hundreds of countries and you go country-by-country and thy see the masks, they don\u2019t immediately buy the masks. It can even slowdown the purchases of current masks, because they see the next generation technology and they put it through their systems, they have it as their frontline setup and they work out how to put it into the protocols and starts to get launch through.","So as we said earlier, we expect to gradual improvement of masks growth not only in the Americas, but also in EMEA and APAC. Certainly the positive in that region and then through Q3 and Q4, we really think the impact N20 and F20 are going to be there and sustainable throughout fiscal 2018.","Victor Windeyer","Okay. Great. And then I just wanted to ask about the sort of pricing and whether there has been a significant return -- end of quarter bulk discounts been away for a while. Has that come back into the market? How are you sort of seeing pricing around [indiscernible]?","Mick Farrell","We\u2019re seeing pricing as I said earlier in the pretty steady state these last six to eight quarters. Back to industry standards on year-on-year in terms of price. So the competition is fierce, but it\u2019s around innovation. Who's got the best fit, the best comfort, the quietest device and now best informatic solution to really improve quality of care with patients and provide us to improve their world flow efficiency.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Agnes, you may begin.","Agnes Lee","Thank you, Susan, and thank you for attending ResMed\u2019s live webcast. Joining me on the call today are Mick Farrell, our CEO; and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release, it can be found on our website at investors.resmed.com.","I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including but not limited to statements about future expectations, plans and prospects of the Company, corporate strategy and performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in filings made by ResMed with the SEC.","I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell.","Mick Farrell","Thanks Agnes. And thank you to all of our shareholders joining us on today, as we summarize our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. We have made great progress towards our long-term ResMed 2020 goals this quarter. We achieved solid double-digit constant currency revenue growth led by strong regional results in the Americas.","Last week, we announced the acquisition of Inova Labs based in Austin, Texas. This acquisition expands our respiratory care therapeutics portfolio for COPD each now include portable oxygen concentrators.","First, I\u2019ll discuss our top and bottom-line results, I\u2019ll then review some regional highlights from our business and progress on our ResMed 2020 strategy. After that I\u2019ll hand the call over to Brett our CFO to walk you through our financial results in greater detail.","For the fifth quarter in a row, our global team achieved double-digit top line revenue growth on a constant currency basis. We saw strength in the Americas region with robust double-digit growth at 17%. We achieved solid steady growth in our combined EMEA and APAC regional groups. These global results were fueled by the ongoing success of Air Solutions, our cloud-based connected care software platform, as well as the AirSense 10 and the AirCurve 10 medical device platforms.","Looking at the bottom line, our diluted earnings per share was $0.69 on a non-GAAP basis. We have been balancing our investments and growth opportunities, and significantly expanding our install base of cloud connected medical devices. At the same time, we have been efficiently managing our OpEx growth in both R&D as well as SG&A. This quarter, we gained operating leverage in SG&A keeping its growth well below our top line growth. We continue to invest for the future in research and development, maintaining our R&D investment level at around 6% to 7% of top line revenue.","Now for some regional highlights. In the Americas region, we had very strong sales performance in Q2, with our commercial team driving to 17% growth in a competitive market. Flow generator growth in the region was 23%, reflecting the ongoing success of our AirSense 10 and AirCurve 10 platforms powered and catalyzed by Air Solutions software. The mask and accessories categories grew at a solid 11% in the Americas for Q2. We continue to expect solid mask and accessories growth throughout fiscal year 2016 and beyond.","We grew our combined EMEA and APAC group at 7% on a constant currency basis in Q2. We continue to see good growth in our sleep disorder breathing business and our respiratory care businesses in these regions. The headwinds that we have faced from the SERVE-HF trial results of May 2015m continued to be annualized through the P&L and this will continue until May 2016.","The ASV sales impact for Q2 in Europe was broadly consistent with last quarter. As we noted during our last quarter investor call, the ASV sales impact in the U.S. continues to be less than that in Europe. The ASV platform remains an excellent therapeutic solution for a number of important clinical applications including one, treatment emergent central sleep apnea; two, opiod or pain management induced central sleep apnea; three, post traumatic stress disorder or PTSD.","This quarter, we acquired Maribo Medico, our distributor in Denmark. These forward vertical integration acquisitions have proved very valuable to us in the past, we expect this to be the same. We also expect that our partnership with the great team at Maribo which is now part of ResMed Denmark will allow us to continue to lead in market development in the country and to build connected care and digital health solutions for sleep apnea, COPD, neuromuscular disease and beyond.","Now, I\u2019d like to provide an update on our ResMed 2020 strategy. Before going to the three horizons, I\u2019d like to talk about three key underlying enablers of our strategy. The first of these is our global leadership in healthcare informatics, the second is our expansion in high growth geographic markets, and the third is a focus on our best in class operational excellence. So, the first enabler on our list is our global leadership in healthcare informatics.","Connected care and digital health are almost now industry buzzwords that are referred to by many companies in the space. We\u2019re not just talking about it, we\u2019re executing on this front with over 1 million cloud connected medical devices, sending data every morning to the cloud, and more than 750 patients signing up every day for our patient application called myAir. We are transforming ResMed into a tech-driven medical device leader.","Our first step on this journey has been changing the basis of competition in our core sleep apnea business. We led the industry 15 months ago with 100% cloud connected medical devices and now our competition has had to follow. We are improving the efficiency of our customers by embedding our software solutions in their work flow and providing value to providers, physicians and patients by improving patient device adherence and therefore patient outcomes. We can leverage this core competency from sleep apnea into chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD into neuromuscular disease and other chronic disease spaces.","Our second enabler is our investment and expansion in high growth geographies. Our investment in Curative last quarter is an example of this strategy in action. Curative allows us to have products developed in China, made in China for sale in China. It opens up channels that just weren\u2019t available for imported products. We\u2019ll continue to invest and expand our presence in China, South Korea, India, Brazil and many countries in Eastern Europe. In each country, the value we deliver is to improve patient outcomes and reduce overall healthcare costs for the country in key chronic diseases.","Our third enabler is operational excellence. It is an important and fundamental foundation to our growth strategy. It\u2019s just part of our DNA. We continue to create efficiencies to allow us to free up cash, to invest back into innovative organic R&D programs and also allow us to better unlock value from our tuck-in acquisitions.","We take a continuous improvement approach across our entire global business including component supply management, manufacturing excellence, supply chain and logistics optimization, and OpEx management. We are committed to grow our operating profit and to ensure that we have headroom to free up cash to reinvest in the business and continue to drive profitable growth.","Now, I would like to spend a few minutes updating you on progress against our long-term ResMed 2020 growth strategy. In our first horizon of growth which includes our core sleep apnea franchise, our leadership in healthcare informatics remains a critical growth driver. Last month a market research firm, Berg Insight published a report on mobile health and home monitoring. The report ranked ResMed as the number one global leader in connected care for all medical devices. This was not just in respiratory medicine but in all device categories including cardiovascular disease, diabetes and beyond.","So 15 months after the launch of AirSense 10, AirCurve 10, and Air Solutions the cloud based softer platform, we have achieved this market leadership position. I want to tell you that we are not done. We intend to continue our leadership in connected care and digital health as we add features and enhancements to our solution to bring even more value for providers and physicians, and even better applications for patients to see their own data, to participate more in their own health and wellness.","With well over 1 million patients, cloud connected medical devices sitting on their bedside tables providing daily updates to the cloud, we are liberating data, providing actionable information, unlocking value, and improving outcomes for patients, physicians, providers and for payors. Our customers are clearly experiencing the value proposition of the AirSense and Air Solutions platform and incorporating this into their workflows, and reaping cost savings in their own P&L.","On an investor call last year, I referenced a clinical care study that was presented at the American Thoracic Society in which an Air Solutions customers saw patient adherence increase from 73% to 83%, along with the 59% decrease in their own labor costs. Earlier this month, this clinical care study was published in the peer reviewed journal called Sleep and Breathing. We continue to deliver results like this for many of our customers. And many of these are proprietary results that we just cannot share. One study that I was committed to share at the JP Morgan health care conference in San Francisco earlier this month, showed an increase from a very solid baseline of 60% adherence for our customer, the standard care up to top tier patient adherence of 87% when using our cloud-based Air Solutions platform.","You will see further publications and evidence from us showing increased operating efficiencies for our customers and increased patient adherence like this, all enabled Air Solutions. Connected care is here to stay.","Our acquisitions of Jaysec and CareTouch have added both ResMed branded resupply solutions combined with an end to end referral and document management system for our customers.","Our system provides automated resupply solutions to customers, so that they can effectively manage ongoing supplies of masks and accessories to patients via automated text, via e-mail, and even via interactive voice response. We also have a multilingual call center backing up the solution.","The referral and document management capability reduces days patient and position sign off, reduces the number of errors and incomplete documents, and eliminates a large number of follow-up phone calls. These systems improve both our homecare customers efficiencies and just as importantly, their cash flow.","In terms of progress against the second horizon of our ResMed 2020 growth strategy, we announced the acquisition of Austin, Taxes based Inova Labs which we plan to complete this quarter. With this acquisition, we have expanded our therapeutic portfolio to COPD, to include portable oxygen concentrators or POCs. POCs enable patient mobility and fit well with our life support ventilator platform called Astral. Both of these give increased mobility and increased freedom back to COPD patients.","Inova Labs fits well with our respiratory care strategy and our innovative company culture here at ResMed. We know that we can manage the business to add to ResMed shareholder value. We even know that we will have opportunities to grow revenue by selling POCs through our global market channels. We will work to prioritize the 100 countries that we sell into maximize physician, provider, and patient value. We will also be able to bring global operational and technological capability to create economies of scale in supply chain management, manufacturing and logistics at Inova Labs.","Finally, together with the team in research and development in Austin and Sydney and beyond, we can create next generation products that leverage our healthcare informatics leadership to create solutions for connected care for COPD.","Finally, I would like to review our third horizon of growth. Our third horizon of growth includes a portfolio of opportunities in new markets including atrial fibrillation, nocturnal asthma, and also sleep health and wellness. Rob and I and others from our team attended the Consumer Electronics Show or CES earlier this month in Las Vegas. Almost every variable and non-variable health and wellness technology at CES included sleep as part of their offering. This clearly shows that there is a demand from consumers to measure, monitor and improve their sleep. Our S+ by ResMed sleep wellness tool is just our first foray into this space. Consumers realize that sleep health is as important as cardiovascular exercise and good nutrition for overall health, and we agree.","We also continue to explore clinical areas of interest in adjacent market. For our more than 26-year history, our team at ResMed has emphasized relationships with key opinion leaders in pulmonology, cardiology, neurology and related clinical areas. Through our recent $5 million gift to the University of California at San Diego, we have helped to establish a world leading center for clinical care and medical research in the fields of sleep apnea and COPD, the two most costly and most important clinic diseases in the field of respiratory medicine. You will see plenty of exciting developments in the field from this team. One recent example was a sleep apnea and cancer symposium at UCSD that worked together key opinion leaders in pulmonology with KOLs from oncology to discuss the impacts of sleep disorder breathing and specifically repetitive hypoxia on cancer cell development.","Although these discussions are still in their early days, literally at the molecular level, this is just one of many new clinical areas that could lead to new therapeutics and solutions for patients that ResMed could provide in the future.","So returning back to our quarterly results, we remain active on the capital management front. And this quarter in Q2, we bought back 700,000 shares. In addition to funding our dividend and completing the acquisitions of Curative Medical and Maribo Medico.","We continue to look for potential acquisitions where these three criteria are met: One, the business is aligned with our long-term ResMed 2020 drug strategy; two, we can leverage the asset to increase ResMed shareholder value; and three, really importantly, that there is a cultural fit between the business team and ResMed. We clearly hit and nailed all of these three criteria with our acquisition of Inova and our acquisition of Maribo. And we will continue to refresh our acquisition radar screen with further growth opportunities as we move forward.","We are the global leaders in sleep apnea and respiratory medicine, not just in market share but more importantly in products and solutions innovation in connected care. We remain excited as we build the road ahead for our industry, our partners, and most importantly for patients all around the world.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brett for a more detailed review of our Q2 financials. Brett?","Brett Sandercock","Thanks, Mick. Revenue for December quarter was $454.5 million, an increase of 7% over prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 13%. Movements in exchange rates, predominantly a weaker euro relative to the U.S. dollar, negatively impacted revenue by approximately $21.7 million in the second quarter.","At a geographic level, overall sales in the Americas were $269.5 million, an increase of 17% over the prior-year quarter. Sales in combined EMEA and APAC totaled $185 million, a decrease of 4% over the prior year quarter. However in constant currency terms, sales in combined EMEA and APAC increased by 7% over the prior year quarter.","Breaking our revenue between product segments, Americas flow generator sales were $136.5 million, an increase of 23% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $133 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter. The revenue in combined EMEA and APAC, flow generator sales were $123.5 million, a decrease of 4% over the prior year quarter, but in constant currency terms an increase of 6%. Masks and other sales were $61.4 million, a decrease of 2% over the prior year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 8%. Globally in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 14% while masks and other increased by 10% over the prior year quarter.","During the quarter, we incurred restructure expenses of $6.9 million associated with rationalizing our European R&D and manufacturing facility. These operations have been integrated in their existing largest care locations. Restructure charge consists primarily of severance payments and an asset write down of a legacy manufacturing facility.","Additionally, during the quarter, we released $2.4 million of an accrual associated with our SERVE-HF field safety notice activity, as we substantially conclude the obligation arising from the field safety notification.","During the rest of my commentary today, I\u2019ll refer to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures exclude the impact of restructure expenses and the SERVE-HF accrual released in the current quarter, as well as the amortization of acquired intangibles, both in the current year and last year. We\u2019ve reconciled the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release.","Non-GAAP gross margin for the December quarter was 58.1%. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin contracted by 410 basis points, reflecting an unfavorable product mix, declines in average selling prices, and an unfavorable geographic mix partially offset by favorable net currency movements. However, on a sequential basis, non-GAAP gross margin improved slightly increasing from 58% in the September quarter.","Given current exchange rates and taking into account the current trending products and geographic mix combined with the impact from our cost out programs and our recent acquisitions, we continue to expect gross margins to be in the range of 57% to 60% for the remainder of fiscal year 2016.","Moving onto operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $118.2 million, a decrease of 4% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 4%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 26% compared to the year ago figure of 29%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 26% to 27% for the remainder of fiscal year 2016.","R&D expenses for the quarter were $29 million a decrease of 1% over the prior year quarter, but in constant currency terms an increase of 14%. This increase largely reflects incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.4% compared to the year ago figure of 6.9%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for the remainder of fiscal year 2016.","This reflects our ongoing commitments to investing in our diverse product pipeline including informatics solutions, but also a benefit of the weaker Australian dollar in which the majority of our R&D is denominated.","Amortization of acquired intangibles was $4.4 million for the quarter. The increase over the prior amortization expense of $2.2 million reflects the additional amortization associated with our recent acquisition. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $11.5 million.","Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.5% compared to 21.1% in the prior year quarter. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year will be in the range of 20% to 21%.","Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $116.9 million, an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $97.5 million, also an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter was $9.5 million. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.69, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter while diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.64.","Overall, foreign exchange movements positively impacted second earnings by $0.04 per share, reflecting the favorable impact from the weaker Australian dollar, partially offset by the weaker euro.","Cash flow from operations was a record $147.4 million for the quarter, this reflects strong underlying earnings and an improvement in the net working capital balances. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $12.9 million while depreciation and amortization for the December quarter totaled $21.5 million. We continue to be active on the capital management front. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share, additionally during the quarter we repurchased 700,000 shares for consideration of $40.1 million. At the end of December, we had approximately 13.6 million shares remaining under our authorized share repurchase program.","During the quarter we completed three international acquisitions, Curative Medical based in China; Maribo Medico, our distributor in Denmark; and then a precision tooling company located in Sydney. These acquisitions were funded by utilizing our existing cash balances. Additionally, this month, we announced the definitive agreement to acquire Inova Labs. Inova Labs is a U.S. domiciled entity and this acquisition will be funded by utilizing our existing credit facility. We expect to include Inova Labs in our consolidated results in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016.","For the rolling 12 months ended December 31, we returned 84% of free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and repurchases. Over the last five years, we\u2019ve returned 98% of free cash flow to our shareholders via dividends and repurchases. Our balance sheet remains very strong. Net cash balance at the end of the quarter was $257 million while December 31 total assets stood at $2.2 billion and net equity was $1.5 billion.","And with that I\u2019ll hand the call back to Agnes.","Agnes Lee","Thank you, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A. And we ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question please. If you have additional questions after that please get back into the queue. Susan, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matthew O\u2019Brien of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Matthew O\u2019Brien","Good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the questions. I was hoping to start off on the generator side and the performance in this quarter again very, very strong. Just curious as far as what you\u2019re seeing in the marketplace with this product now out there today, are you guys competing head to head? And if so, it seems like you\u2019re continuing to be very successful. Is that a trend that we should expect going forward.","Mick Farrell","Thanks for the question, Matt. Yes, that allows us to talk about our Air Solutions portfolio and AirSense 10 and how it fits in the market. I\u2019ll have a first go and then I might hand to Jim Hollingshead to talk a little bit about Americas business and what\u2019s happening there with the AirSense 10 launch.","So, as I said in the remarks earlier, we have had competitors follow us into the space with the cloud-connected devices. We think our offering is superior because it\u2019s 100% cloud-connected and requires a channel to do nothing other than plug it in and breath, and in the morning the data go to the cloud, and then can be accessed by the patient on myAir or the physician on AirView or the payor provider through an API from Air Solutions. And we think it\u2019s a really strong value proposition taking up to 60% of the labor costs out of the channel for them. And it\u2019s just a really important improvement to their P&L. And it\u2019s really embedded in their workflow and becomes something that they are doing well.","We believe in competition; we like healthy competition; and we like the fact that our competitors are looking to compete on value offerings, not just in the flow generators segment but in the masks segment and looking to compete with technology. And so, as we look forward, the market growth rate is in the mid to high single digit numbers. We like to meet or beat market growth rate; we don\u2019t except it, we drive beyond that. That\u2019s sort of where we are at. But Jim, anymore color on the Americas?","Jim Hollingshead","Thanks Mick. We are very confident in our offering. I mean the AirSense 10 and AirCurve 10 platforms have been very, very well-received. We have taken lot of -- we\u2019ve taken a significant market share and the Air Solutions inclusion in that. So, as Mick is saying, I think we\u2019ve now clearly proven to our customers that we can drive efficiencies in their business with the platform. So that\u2019s a very compelling offer, remains a very compelling offer, even in right of competitor launches. We obviously have big comps that we are going to work through. And so your question was about sustainability, we intend to continue to grow our program, position above market growth rate. But given the share we\u2019ve taken, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s sustainable indefinitely, [ph] the growth rate you\u2019ve seen this quarter.","Matthew O\u2019Brien","Okay, thank you. And as a follow-up, talking about the Inova acquisition, just curious as far as where they were selling historically and where you can take that device fairly quickly? And then the investments that you\u2019re going to need to make in support of it, is activity pretty sizable and then how does that business affect the financial make up of ResMed? I think that the gross margin profile and operating margin profile likely be somewhat of a headwind going forward.","Mick Farrell","Thanks Matt. The Inova acquisition is a great opportunity for us; it\u2019s our first foray after 26 years of positive airway pressure, noninvasive ventilation, and dental treatment, so our first foray into portable oxygen concentrators. And it\u2019s a great technology, has great mobility and gives great freedom back in terms of the battery life and the weight of these portable oxygen concentrators. Yes, when you look at our scale and selling into 100 countries, Inova currently sales into five to maybe 10 countries. So, you\u2019ve got a 10 to 20x multiple, just on the number of geographic countries that we can move into. And so, we are really excited about it. I might ask Rob -- Rob Douglas, our COO, President and Chief Operating Officer and I were touring the plant in Austin last week just before JP Morgan and it was great to walk around and see all the team and to get a feel for the innovation. Rob, any further comments as to the investments and what we need to do going forward?","Rob Douglas","Yes. I mean obviously Inova is at a scale not where ResMed is at but they are at a scale that ResMed use to be at. And so, walking around the factory, there\u2019s lot of a very similar approaches to what ResMed have taken in the early days. And we know that we can actually share a lot of experiences and working and integrating those teams, we can really accelerate the development of way that -- way those products go and how we take them into the market. Huge amount of opportunity there, really good cultural fit; it\u2019s going to be very exciting for us all to work in that area.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David Low of Deutsche Bank. Go ahead, your line is open.","David Low","First, I just had a question around pricing, I mean really there has been the experience of competitive bidding round two and what that led to and how the manufacturer process, just wondering what your experience has been as we head into international roll out of competitive bidding?","Mick Farrell","Thanks for the question, Dave. Competitive bidding has been in play for almost seven years now, CB1, CB2 and then the national expansion that is going on, as we speak from January 1 through July 1. So, these obviously have had an impact. We have talked about that over the last number of quarters on our customers, and we have worked with our customers to make sure that we can help them approve the efficiencies of their P&L and drive to a profitable growth through all of this in the value chain so that we can continue to serve patients and invest in infrastructure. A lot of our investments around Air Solutions are about taking 50%, 60% of the cost -- the labor cost out of the channel and so therefore improving the P&L.","Obviously acquisition price hold [indiscernible] are in their P&L as well but when you\u2019re able to take 60% of the labor cost that frees up a lot of cash for reinvestment in their business. And it\u2019s really bringing a technology solution into apply. I would characterize the pricing environment as historic normal and what it has been over the last number of many years. We don\u2019t go to quantitative detail of that for competitive purposes, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s at historic normal levels.","David Low","I think to follow up on the same topic, I guess what I\u2019m looking for is a little bit of comfort that what we saw with right round two where I think your commentary was quite similar at this after just announced that we\u2019re not -- or that you\u2019re comfortable that we\u2019re not going to see [ph] the dynamic with the competitors I think in -- the competitors push pricing down and raise ResMed in due course followed. Are you concerned that there is a risk of that playing out gain or...","Mick Farrell","Yes Dave, I can\u2019t predict the psychology of other players in the market. I can tell you what we\u2019ve done and what we continue to do, which is we bring technology into play that improves the P&L for our value chain. And we really understand how that value chain operates. And we\u2019ve got embedded into the workflows and really helped partner with industry to take those costs out. And we will continue to do that in the future.","Other players in the marketplace have followed and produced similar technologies. We don\u2019t think they are quite as good but they\u2019re doing similar things which is looking to take labor costs and inefficiencies out of a system. And frankly, together we aimed our competitors in the space, are fighting the real competitor, which is frequent [ph] in the hospital and getting those patients with sleep apnea and COPD rather than going back to the ER taking care of them by product on bedside table and using data from that to get back to the hospital system, back to the API system, so that they know that they kept out of play.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Chris Kallos of Morningstar is on line with the question. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Chris Kallos","Great, thank you. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask in light of the acquisitions and Inova in Denmark, how does that affect your CapEx going forward? Can you provide some you guidance on that?","Mick Farrell","Brett, do you want to take that question?","Brett Sandercock","I mean it\u2019s the CapEx that sort of run at around -- let\u2019s go to sort of run rate 13, 14, 15 in the quarter something like that. In terms of Maribo, it\u2019s very much a distributor, so it\u2019s not a lot of [indiscernible] product that one, so I don\u2019t see too much impact there. To move to things like Inova, probably be a small uptick but pretty negligible, fairly small operation at the moment. I think the big one on that in terms of investment, they\u2019re not big; where we\u2019ll incrementally put some money I think is in R&D, really think we can turbo-charge those products and them very effective. And obviously with our distribution channel capability, what we can bring to the table, we very much think that we can grow that business very nicely. So, pretty -- some small investments but nothing significant.","Chris Kallos","And just a follow-up on the R&D in Inova, are you planning on keeping that domiciled in the U.S. and how does that affect your 6% to 7% forecast on R&D?","Mick Farrell","Rob, do you want to take that question maybe or -- we have Rob, why don\u2019t you go first and then maybe Brett can answer.","Rob Douglas","We\u2019re still working on integration plans and finalizing how that\u2019s going to work. But we don\u2019t see in the short-term major moves. It\u2019s a really good team in Austin, who really know the stuff around that and they have confidence and we\u2019re very keen to maximize the value of that. In terms of ongoing [indiscernible] made a short-term bit of investment in the R&D, but long-term that shouldn\u2019t change how we think about the right level of investment for R&D for our overall business.","Operator","Anthony Petrone with Jefferies is online with the questions. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Anthony Petrone","Great, thanks a lot. One quick for Brett and then I\u2019ll follow-up with the question on just some CMS news that was coming out late last year. Just Brett on the acquisitions in the quarter, they were three that -- one was we were aware of but the other two in terms of distributor work or integration we were not aware of. So what was the collective contribution just from those three acquisitions in the quarter in terms of revenue and EPS? And then one follow-up. Thanks.","Brett Sandercock","Yes, I mean these are pretty small acquisitions, so not going down to that granularity. I think we did for those ones, not material from our perspective, so we haven\u2019t disclosed too much detail on that.","Anthony Petrone","And then just from a margin perspective, this vertical integration, will that help offset some of the pressures that you\u2019ve been seeing? And maybe just an update on the transition from I guess area of freight charges which was a tailwind that was potentially coming in the second half of this year. Was there any benefit from that this quarter or do you expect that to be more of a second half event?","Brett Sandercock","So, just on the first one, it really -- continuing on the acquisitions, they\u2019re fairly small, so that\u2019s kind of around the ages. But typically with the vertical integration for example in the distribution, that would help, that would sort of be if you like help improve your margins or be accretive to your margin for example. If you look at benefit [ph] example that\u2019s really vertical integration within our supplies and we think we can pick up obviously, it\u2019s for better tooling cost but also improvements in strategically in markets and things like that. So that was what we call it\u2019s not strategic tuck in for us. If you look at acquisitions such as Inova, and I think we highlighted that at the time, there will be a little bit of dilution to gross margin there. So that does present a little bit of a headwind but I think the opportunities are so good for us on that on growing that portable oxygen and concentrator market and our share in the product and so on that I think it was quite compelling for us to do so. We weren\u2019t going to worry about sort of, some sort of myAir margin dilution if you like impact, from not doing the deal, we think it will be pretty compelling in due course.","And on the freight side of things, we\u2019re seeing some of that coming through and obviously we will see more of that coming through in the second half as well of the fiscal.","Operator","And Saul Hadassin of Credit Suisse is on line. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Saul Hadassin","Thanks very much. Maybe question for Brett as well, on gross margins, jus looking the sequential movement up about 10 basis points. Looking at your mix, product mix, if anything is probably slightly better this quarter than 1Q \u201816. You should had a benefit from a lower Aussie U.S. sort of line, just wondering was there anything holding back that gross margin uplift? For example what was the reference before so that moved to -- is that still to come through? In terms of your underlying gross margin ex the dilution that might come from the Inova just wondering should you -- should we think sequential gross margin uplift over the course of this fiscal year assuming currently holds where it is? Thanks.","Brett Sandercock","Yes, I mean it\u2019s a little sequentially; we still are seeing an impact on -- negative impact from product mix and also geographic mix. And of course I mean the big standouts obviously you know Americas growth and then the flow generator growth as well, that remains really strong. So, there\u2019s still headwinds for us but in the frame there\u2019s a whole bunch of other stuff. We had a small uplift from FX, you\u2019re right, that was probably around 40 basis points or so. There\u2019s a bunch of other -- there\u2019s other stuff that plays out on that that can impact you kind of quarter to quarter. But overall, I guess you\u2019d characterize that as kind of margins pretty much stabilized. And depending on trends, on product mix and geographic mix I suppose the term is kind of where we land within that kind of guidance band that I gave. So, still working on a way on the cost out programs and so on. We\u2019ve got opportunities there, will flow through into the second half. But then it does -- it depends a lot on the normal product mix, geographic mix, a little bit on the acquisition around the edges, a little of a headwind for us. You\u2019ve got typical declines or mix. So, that\u2019s all in and I said a lot -- quite a lot, it\u2019s pretty hard to predict on the gross margin when you\u2019re looking at kind of 90-day window. But overall I think pretty comfortable with that margin even and clearly we\u2019ll work hard to improve that but we\u2019ve got to be realistic on what we\u2019re seeing with product mix and geographic mix and acquisitions and so on. So rest assured we\u2019re working hard on margin improvement.","Saul Hadassin","And just a follow-up on that regarding the ASV sales that you would have not had this quarter, was there any material change to those lost sales relative to the quarter that\u2019s just passed, so relative to 1Q \u201816?","Mick Farrell","The ASV sales, as I said earlier, the impact that we saw in Q2 was the same as the impact we saw pretty much in Q1 for Europe. And the impact that we saw in the U.S. was much less than that that we saw in Europe which is again the identical situation to what we saw in Q1, so that you know it\u2019s still going through the P&L being annualized. The impact of SERVE-HF results from May 2015 and we\u2019re in mid January now, so we\u2019ve got four more months of annualizing that through the P&L and then we\u2019ll be clear with sort of annual cost of the ASV impact in May 2016 here in five months -- four months time from now.","Operator","And Margaret Kaczor of William Blair is online with a question. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Margaret Kaczor","So just to go back to Inova Labs and that acquisition, obviously they have a good product, they\u2019ve got some good advantages. But that said, do you have an interest in bringing a new POC to market, that\u2019s up to the same standards as ResMed, similar to what you guys did with Astral and Sans [ph] and should this be a shorter or longer timeframe or are you happy and willing to continue selling the existing products to your customers today?","Mick Farrell","Yes, thanks Margaret, good afternoon to you. That\u2019s a good question. It allows us to talk to the longer term play here around Inova. So, Inova is a strong player in the POC market and they have excellent mobility and excellent freedom that they give back to patients because the battery life is best in class and lasts a very long time, similar to what we do with the Astral, lots of what where did 24 hours of freedom back to patients with that. Having said all that and as Rob alluded to earlier, there\u2019s a lot of capabilities that we have from our global business in the 26 years in respiratory medicine here that we can bring some skills to the table for the next generation of products in the portable oxygen concentrator front. And some of that will be some of the engineering around efficiencies, our supply chain logistics, manufacturing, quality reliability and those types of factors that we\u2019ve learned a lot. But really importantly bringing the capability or the core confidence of cloud based healthcare informatics solutions to the able to put a cloud-connected POC as part of end-to-end across the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease medical device space, so all the way from noninvasive ventilators, life support ventilators and the portable oxygen concentrators and take that data and be able to give pulmonary and critical care physicians or ACOs data that can really help them understand mobility, freedom, breath right and hospitalization rights of their COPD patients to help them improve outcomes and lower cost. That\u2019s the game. And we do think that we can bring a lot to the table.","So the short answer is obviously we like the product, we will continue to sell existing products. But we like even more the combination of the Inova portable oxygen concentrator engineering with ResMed\u2019s healthcare informatics engraining, what the two combinations, what that synergy could bring.","Margaret Kaczor","Okay, then I don\u2019t know if you had talked at all about the timeframe because obviously it took you guys a little bit a time, sense to bring that kind of a product to market, so should we assume it\u2019s within that 2020 timeframe or longer than that?","Mick Farrell","You should assume it within the 2020 timeframe for sure. Yes, the difference between stand, we have got life support ventilators where the life cycle of those is sort of six to seven or even up to eight to 10 years. The life cycle of a portable oxygen concentrator is probably closer to that of the C peptide type device or that sort of time horizon. So yes, we will have a next generation well before 2020.","Operator","And Joanne Wuensch of BMO Securities is on line with the question. Go ahead, your line is open.","Joanne Wuensch","Could we touch on SG&A please? Revenue was stronger than we expected but you really also pulled in your SG&A; what\u2019s going on there?","Mick Farrell","Rob, do you want to just set maybe -- maybe Rob first, Brett and then you can go.","Rob Douglas","Joanne, actually we\u2019ve got a number of areas that we are working on. Brett will probably go into few of them but across the board we are running a really strong operational excellence program that not only talks about our products and our supply chain, which we have talked about a lot but we are also moving a lot of that thinking and approach into our SG&A road as well. And so we have done a lot work around the world. We do run our different countries with different go to market models and so the different programs around the world. But we can really call out the U.S. and Americas teams of pulling a lot of operational leverage in and we have got very strong plans around our European teams. So, it\u2019s really easy stuff for us to do, in terms of sharing the way some things work nice and easier. And we are taking a view of that we are freeing up a lot of capacity to continue to invest in innovation and really optimizing these acquisitions as well.","So Brett, I don\u2019t know if you want to go into little more on some of the areas.","Brett Sandercock","Yes. We\u2019ve adopted to some extent some of the methodologies that they are using with the supply management team and so and being more disciplined around that. So that\u2019s certainly helping a lot and just making sure kind of mindset is thinking to that extent as well in a smart way. And so that\u2019s sort of enabled us to get some pretty solid leverage there. Obviously if you go back last year running, we had for example AirSense and selling and doing some marketing and some variable compensation, that\u2019s more normalized this year, which has helped us a bit as well. And to some extent, you\u2019re getting some currency benefit as well. But even if I normalize for currency, we still -- we see around that 27% mark. So, we\u2019d still be in very good shape, some of those savings or kind of holding expenses tight. And then with revenue growth obviously you get that leverage. So that\u2019s been -- we\u2019ve been working on this for a while and I think it\u2019s just sort of starting to flow through into the P&L now.","Joanne Wuensch","And just as a follow-up if I may, I think there is some pricing on Inova clearly going outside of your core OSA type of area into more sort of traditional DME type of oxygen concentrators, what made this be the right acquisition at this time? Thank you.","Mick Farrell","With respect to -- I\u2019ll disagree that it\u2019s not in our space. Our space is -- ResMed is respiratory medicine. And what we have done in the field of sleep apnea certainly for 25 years is lead that market, and most recently lead it by taking cost out through healthcare informatics and really showing we can improve the efficiencies of the delivery of this amazing noninvasive ventilation and positive airway pressure therapy to patients in sleep apnea. We\u2019d already started within the fields of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with our noninvasive ventilators to help those patients as well, stay out of hospital and get better with COPD through noninvasive ventilation including publication of studies showing that we can actually reduce the mortality rate, so literally save lives of COPD patients with severe hypercapnic COPD with noninvasive ventilation through the current one study that we published. So the extension through that vertical, if you like of the disease state of COPD into the other medical device that is often used in that COPD space which is oxygen therapy.","Now, we aren\u2019t really doubling down in stationary oxygen, and it does have a stationary oxygen concentrator but it\u2019s actually the only one in the world that the stationary oxygen concentrator can allow a portable oxygen concentrator to connect directly on to it and charge and be there, so that when the patient wants to leave the home. Because these folks are still active folks with COPD, they can grab the POC and see the grand children, get out to the park and play ball with the grand kids and have the freedom back, which is what POC is bringing. The total market for oxygen therapy is $1.2 billion or so, of that around $200 million plus or minus is a portable oxygen concentrator market, but it\u2019s that $200 million portable oxygen concentrator market that has very strong growth, mid to high, even low-double-digit numbers growth in terms of year-over-year. We are really excited to participate in that POC market and to bring our innovation play. And we think it\u2019s a very larger to extension into the vertical of COPD patient treatment and it will become a good -- a great part of our portfolio, not just in the U.S. where it primarily sales now, but globally.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Goodsall, UBS. Your line is open.","Andrew Goodsall","Just want to pick up on the mask, obviously it\u2019s second quarter now that you\u2019ve achieved quite good U.S. sales. Just want to understand sort of what\u2019s been behind that; is conversion or I guess better pairings; is again conversion on the compliance rate that data that you\u2019re showing? And then I guess Brett\u2019s probably covered this a little bit, but just how I guess incrementally that continues remarkably that in the margin?","Mick Farrell","Okay. I\u2019ll hand the first part of the question. 11% solid growth in masks and accessories in Americas and hand to Jim Hollingshead and then Brett maybe you take the second part of that.","Jim Hollingshead","Yes. There is a lot going on behind that mask number, just to be -- try to think about it. And the first thing is the price reductions that we\u2019ve put into place in January to June [indiscernible] now completely annualized. So we\u2019re through that. And while the market remains, the mask market in particular remains very competitive, we\u2019re into more of a historic norm kind of pricing situation in masks. Our offering remains very strong in particular the AirFit line of masks are very well received and continues to do very, very well in the market.","Our recent buy offerings have driven a lot of growth and that is directly connected to our health informatics offering because the acquisition of the providers that we\u2019re now integrating into a program we called ResMed Resupply and that\u2019s an automated resupply program, it\u2019s part of our HI offering that\u2019s helping to grow our mask business. And then we\u2019ve done a number of things. We\u2019ve done a number of -- without getting into the tactics, a number of things in marketing and a number of things with sales compensation and so on, and all of those leverages have contributed to the growth we saw.","Andrew Goodsall","And what you\u2019re expecting gross margin\u2026[Multiple Speakers]","Mick Farrell","Yes. Brett, you want to address the -- actually sort of a third question, why don\u2019t you addresss the gross margin and then Jim or I will address the ongoing masks...","Brett Sandercock","So pretty simply, typically mask margins are higher than flow gen margins. So, to the extent you get stronger growth in mask obviously be supportive to group margin. So that\u2019s kind of the pricing masks.","Jim Hollingshead","And in terms of where it goes, I think all the activities we have in place would suggest that that\u2019s stable.","Operator","Steve Wheen of JP Morgan is online with the question. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Steve Wheen","Well, thanks very much. The question for Brett, just on the FX typically in the positive given some indication on current exchange rates, what the gross margin impact might be going into third quarter? And then also you\u2019ve often provided the FX impact at the impact [ph] line as well?","Brett Sandercock","Yes. So on gross margin going forward, assuming currently the way they are and they\u2019re particularly volatile at the moment. But we probably sequentially probably get a small uptick but it will be only around 10 basis-point mark Steve, it\u2019d be pretty small sequentially that is point in time. I mean all the sort of types it will be the trajectory and stays there and probably Q4 you\u2019d see that impact on a sequential basis being a little bit bigger than Q3, but for Q3 I think it would be around 10 basis points. So kind of overall net impact from currencies, I do typically give it on EPS. And I think even the commentary was around [indiscernible] this quarter, as we\u2019re starting to see some of that benefit from a lower Aussie dollar kind of kicking through, which is offset to some extent by the way to euro, but we are starting to see the benefit from the Aussie dollar now which is great.","Steve D. Wheen","And then just final follow-up. In the past, in the last quarter, you guided towards the effective tax rate going down by 100 basis points. You seem to sort of have changed the stats on that. Could you just give some reconciliation as to what might have changed there?","Brett Sandercock","It\u2019s seats around the cost of H1, so probably in the vicinity of 20; it\u2019s around that range Steve, on that. And just it varies around with the basically where the geographically taxable income is. And so we continue to have pretty good numbers out of the U.S. and that\u2019s probably sort of moved it up a little bit. But in the vicinity of that 20%, I\u2019ve just gone with 20 to 21. So maybe sort increase that a shade above where I was thinking from Q1.","Operator","And your next question is Sean Laaman on line from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Sean Laaman","I have a question on myAir, I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s any way you\u2019ve been able to track or quantify the uptake and usage patterns from patients and any observable benefit to the company? Thanks.","Mick Farrell","Great question, Sean. I mentioned that it\u2019s actually now in our investor deck that we\u2019re adding 750 patients per day to the myAir application. And myAir for those who don\u2019t know is an app that can run on an iPhone or an Android, Samsung or whatever device, portable device where a patient can access and interact with their own therapeutic data from their device and trends and gaming and interaction with it. And in the same way that many people around the world are now measuring their steps either with a Fitbit or an embedded app in their Smartphone to try and get the 10,000 steps a day and keep the cardiovascular exercise up. A lot of patients now with myAir are looking to get their score to 100, because we literally give a score out of 100 everyday on how you slept. This includes duration of sleep, probably mask week and efficacy of the respiratory rate and so on throughout the evening. So, it\u2019s an algorithm, if you like that score the patient\u2019s wellness with regard to sleep and their treatment sleep apnea. We\u2019ve seen incredible engagement from patients on it. I talked about 60% adherence going up to 87% adherence with some customers in the case studies from the JP Morgan presentation. I\u2019d tell you a big part of that is engagement with the patients through these cloud-based algorithms that interact, email, text, IVR and psychologically work with patients through these cloud-based capabilities. So we\u2019re really excited about myAir and we think it\u2019s a big contributor. And we\u2019re in mile one of a mask on this one. There\u2019s a long way to go onto the capability for us to engage with patients.","Operator","Your last question in today\u2019s question-and-answer session will be from Matt Taylor of Barclays. Go ahead your line is open.","Matt Taylor","So, I just wanted to ask you a follow-up on the acquisitions because you\u2019re talking about them very excitedly but also they\u2019re immaterial this quarter. You said Curative was about 1% last quarter, so two things. One is when do they become material as engines more material and then are you going to call them out separately for reporting purposes because most of us just have masks and flow generator models, so it\u2019s hard to recognize.","Mick Farrell","So, I\u2019ll let Brett talk to the first part of that materiality and then I\u2019ll talk into a little bit as to why we\u2019re excited about the long term.","Brett Sandercock","So, at this stage I mean it\u2019s still not material from accounting stands and even on that aggregate there Matt, so at this stage we wouldn\u2019t -- won\u2019t disclose that in sort of any too much granularity. Now obviously, as we go forward and so on we\u2019ll keep looking at how we report or disclose from a business perspective. But at this stage we\u2019re going through pretty much the same channels and so on, we\u2019ll continue to basically aggregate that into our results and not try to split that out.","Mick Farrell","And Matt, just to give you some sort of ballpark on it, we have mentioned that it\u2019s less than 2% of our global revenues, so you can run the math on $1.7 billion that puts it at less than $34 million in revenues. We\u2019re not going to go into exactly what number it is for competitive reasons. But take that number and then also think about the $200 million marker of POCs and think about what ResMed\u2019s done, I guess if you look back over the last 20-25 years in the sleep apnea market where we started from a very small base and have grown to a very strong global leadership, number one position. We would look to do the same in POCs and how we look to do that is the same way we did in sleep apnea, which is innovation and technology. And I talked a lot about the innovation in healthcare informatics and engaging patients. Applying that to POCs we think is a huge opportunity and we\u2019re very excited about being a major player in the POC market, and really importantly rolling that up to a major play around COPD, which is the number three killer in the United States, and the number two cause of re-hospitalization in ERs and ICUs and CCUs. So we think it\u2019s a huge opportunity and we look to be a part of that.","Operator","We are now at the one hour mark. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.","Mick Farrell","Thanks Susan. So, in closing I want to thank the more than 4,300 strong ResMed team from around the world for their continued commitment to changing the lives of literally millions of patients with every breath. I\u2019m very proud of what our team has accomplished in creating market leading innovation and connected care, including new product lines, new solutions, new channels that we\u2019ve incorporated into our business portfolio.

This call is being webcast live and the replay, along with a copy of the earnings press release and our updated investor presentation, will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website later today.","Joining me on the call today to discuss our quarterly results are CEO, Mick Farrell; and CFO, Brett Sandercock. Other members of management will be available during the Q&A portion of the call. During our call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures, please review the notes to today's earnings release.","As a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about our future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions. However, our actual results may differ. You are encouraged to review our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made today.","With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick.","Mick Farrell","Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today as we review the results for ResMed\u2019s first quarter of fiscal year 2020. On today's call, I will discuss our long-term strategy. I'll then review top level financial results, some business highlights from the quarter and a few key milestones. Then I'll hand the call over to Brett, who will walk you through our financials in further detail.","We have started fiscal year 2020 right where we left off with 2019. Our team achieved another quarter of balanced growth across the portfolio, driven by continued strong performance in the mask category. We are taking share with recent new product introductions and our solutions are enabling increased therapy adherence as well as expansion of resupply programs to those who need it. Our dedicated team of more than 7,500 ResMedians around the world, have again delivered strong results. As the world's leading software-driven medical device company, we continue to use technology to advance our leadership position. We have sold more than 10 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices into the market. And our AirView, cloud-based ecosystem manages more than 11 million patient accounts.","In the last 12 months, we changed over 15 million lives by providing a person with a ResMed device or a complete mask system, to help them breathe better and live better lives. In addition, our Brightree and MatrixCare branded out of hospital software systems are helping to manage 93 million more people. So during the last 12 months we improved more than 108 million lives with ResMed products, services and software solutions. We are well on our way to the ambitious goal to improve 250 million lives in 2025.","Our connected solutions are providing us with valuable access to de-identified therapy data that we are using to derive actionable insights to benefit patients, physicians and providers, as well as to inform future innovation in products and software. These datasets are growing exponentially and we now have 5 billion knots of medical sleep and respiratory care data in the cloud. Our relentless focus on product and software innovation continues to set us apart from our competition.","We remained laser focused on growth in our core market of sleep apnea, as well as in our adjacent respiratory medical markets of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as asthma. Our expanded focus to now grow outside the hospital software solutions allows us to help customers create efficiencies to take costs out of the healthcare system and to improve the quality of care across home medical equipment, home health, hospice, skilled nursing facilities, life plan communities and beyond. We believe the future of healthcare is outside the hospital. That's where ResMed competes today. That's where we are winning today and that's where we will continue to win in the future as we provide market-leading value to customers.","Let's now briefly review our top level financial results for the quarter. We achieved another quarter of double-digit revenue growth, up 17% in constant currency across the portfolio. This growth was well balanced across domestic U.S. and global products sales, as well as balanced across our Software-as-a-Service businesses. We continued to deliver operating leverage in the quarter leading to a non-GAAP operating profit growth of 22% year-over-year, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.93.","Turning to a brief discussion of our sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses. In the devices category, we delivered a good quarter. We achieved year-over-year constant currency device growth of 6% globally, supported by very strong 8% device growth in the United States, Canada, and Latin America geographies. We achieved 4% constant currency growth of devices in combined Europe, Asia and rest of world. We achieved excellent device growth in the UK, Switzerland and across our Nordics countries. As discussed over the last few quarters, we experienced a continued headwind during the quarter for device growth in France as a result of digital health-related fleet upgrades. We expect that headwind to ease by the end of this fiscal year and then return to market device growth in France. It is great to see a steady flow of our digital health solutions into different European countries and to see positive constant currency device growth across the continent this quarter.","The growth in the masks and accessories category of our business was incredibly strong during the quarter. We were up 19% in constant currency globally. This is well ahead of market growth rates, indicating we gained significant market share during the quarter. The reason that we continued to take share around the world is that we make the smallest, the quietest and the most comfortable masks available in the market. Our flagship masks, the AirFit F20 and the AirFit N20 continue their growth across global markets. The success of these flagship masks was augmented during the quarter by good uptake of our recent mask launches.","To recap those launches, we have now launched four new masks during the last 12 months; the F30, the N30i and the P30i. And just this week, actually on Monday, our newest innovation was launched, the N30. We have the right mask for every patient, every time, and the N30 adds innovative dimensions to these portfolios. The N30 is a world first tube-down nasal cradle CPAP mask in a new product subcategory that we are calling the minimalist category. The N30 is our smallest, our lightest mask ever and our quietest nasal mask ever. I personally think this new N30 is another winner from our amazing research and development engineers. Watch this space as it gets into the hands of our market-leading marketing and sales teams.","Now mask portfolio overall is positioned to offer world-leading options for physicians to prescribe for home care providers to fit in a first-time set-up, and most especially for the needs of the ultimate customer, the person who suffocates every night with sleep apnea. We remain focused on driving innovation to meet all underserved customer needs. The bottom line is that our new masks have a lot of runway ahead. Unfortunately, they don't let me talk about ResMed\u2019s future product pipeline, so I won\u2019t.","Our success comes as healthcare providers, physicians and patients around the world continue to vote with their wallets and choose ResMed products, not just for the innovative design and high quality of our devices and masks, but also for the sustainable value proposition of the digital health solutions that we offer. Our digital end-to-end solutions combined with available 100% cloud connectivity, as well as information provided to patients on their own smartphones through apps like myAir and apps like Propeller, are all leading to significant improvements in lowering cost, and improving health outcomes and improving quality of life for patients around the world. Through digital health technology, we are driving patient engagement so that people can enjoy the benefits of the best therapy available.","In parallel, we are also ensuring that the cost of chronic disease can be better managed by physicians, healthcare providers, payers and governments. There's still a long way to go. Our research that was just published by the Lancet Respiratory Medicine journal in July shows that there are over 936 million sleep apnea sufferers worldwide, while only around 20 million or so are being treated today. We keep forging ahead, investing in our own research and development to drive further innovation and advancement, as well as by working with partners.","On the partnership front, our joint venture with Verily is working on software solutions to help identify and engage and better manage more people with sleep apnea. It is very early days on \u2013 in this JV, but our philosophy is that the more person knows about how much they suffocate every night and the consequences of that suffocation on their own personal healthcare outcomes, the more likely they will seek solutions. Over time, we know this partnership will drive incremental growth in our core sleep apnea business, while allowing ResMed to participate in a broader chronic disease management ecosystem, covering not just sleep apnea, but also cardiovascular disease, diabetes, COPD and beyond. These chronic disease management platforms will include clinical care as well as wellness improvements in nutrition, in cardiovascular exercise and in mental health.","Let's now turn to our second vector of growth here at ResMed, our business in respiratory care. There were nearly 400 million people worldwide suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD. We don't believe they are well served by healthcare systems today. We see the opportunity to better manage COPD through the use of technology with digital end-to-end solutions that can help patients as they progress with this chronic disease, including how patients are communicated to, how patients are encouraged in their medical care and how patients are looked after as individual persons.","We're advancing our respiratory care strategy in multiple ways. Earlier this summer we introduced a number of enhancements to AirView, our cloud-based patient management platform. We are making management of ventilation patients much simpler and much more useful for home medical equipment providers. Physicians and HMEs can now look deep into therapy data to see key performance indicators such as pulse rate, inspiratory time, maximum airflow, and even a patient\u2019s rapid shallow breathing index or RSBI. All these data are now available within our digital healthcare ecosystem, with the easy to use AirView platform. Our goal is to help create a frictionless experience when managing COPD patients with ResMed's solutions.","Our team at Propeller also continues to grow their business as we move from pilot trials to commercial partnerships with leading respiratory pharmaceutical companies. The team was recently at the European Respiratory Society Annual Congress in Madrid. It was great to see Propeller represented at multiple pharma booths, including live demonstrations of Propeller solutions for physicians. Propeller was also featured in several scientific presentations during ERS, including the public announcement of a new large COPD outcomes trial that's sponsored by Novartis. The trial will compare Propeller plus COPD standard of care to COPD standard of care alone. The trial has already begun enrolling patients during this quarter.","As we outlined, when we acquired Propeller in January, the digital health opportunity with respiratory medicine adherence will take time to build into critical mass. This quarter, we passed a significant milestone with more than 100,000 people enrolled into the Propeller ecosystem. Let's be clear, we are still in the early days of market development here. The analogy is that we are now just lacing our shoes for the digital health ultra marathon in both COPD and in asthma. So there's lots of terrain ahead.","The evolution that we have made in our respiratory care business has set ResMed up to become the global leader in digital health for COPD. From Stage 1 and Stage 2 COPD with Propeller's pharmaceutical adherence solutions to Stage 3 and Stage 4 COPD with portable oxygen concentrators as well as our cloud-connected non-invasive ventilation solutions.","Let's now turn to our third vector of growth, our Software-as-a-Service business. We continue to integrate and optimize the SaaS portfolio for long-term growth. Our competitive advantage derives from our leadership position in SaaS solutions for home medical equipment, for skilled nursing facilities, for home, health, hospice, life plan communities and home care services. ResMed is the best strategic player competing in these verticals. And we have the expertise running global digital health systems at scale to be able to succeed in the future.","Our SaaS portfolio continues its growth trajectory this quarter with revenue up 83% year-on-year during the quarter. Clearly, growth in this first quarter was accelerated leveraging our MatrixCare acquisition in November of 2018. We will lap that acquisition during this current second quarter.","We estimate that the underlying market growth of the blended portfolio of seven out-of-hospital SaaS verticals that we serve is in the high single digits. Leaving out the MatrixCare acquisition, we grew right in line with the market in Q1. We have set up an execution plan to continue to innovate and to continue to launch market-leading upgrades combined with new capabilities that will allow us to gain market share in our SaaS verticals and participate in the fastest growing ones so that we can beat market growth. We plan to exit fiscal 2020 with solid double digit growth in our SaaS business segment.","One example of the progress that we're making in our SaaS portfolio is the recent announcement of our collaboration with Cerner as a new preferred provider for home health and hospice software. This agreement validates ResMed as an industry-leading provider of digital health solutions for out-of-hospital healthcare.","Our Matrixcare managed offering for home health and hospice customers includes the best-of-breed capabilities from both the MatrixCare technology and from the Brightree technology. This agreement ensures our home health and hospice solution is available to all of Cerner's large customer base. The net result is growth opportunities for both Cerner and MatrixCare sales teams. In fact at the recent Cerner Health Care Conference, a major healthcare system with a very large home health business was introduced to the ResMed solution and they are quickly moving toward a contract with our MatrixCare team. It is clearly early days as the ink dries on the Cerner contract, but the bottom line is, we are excited to drive growth from this partnership and to leverage interoperability to provide value for all of our customers.","In summary, for the SaaS business, we have the vision to transform and significantly improve out-of-hospital healthcare. We are helping people stay out of the hospital and in the care setting of their choice with lower costs and a higher quality of life for the person. The best place that people often choose is almost always their own home. Ageing in place is a trend that is growing not just in the U.S. but globally and we plan to enable and leverage that positive change. We think that's an important part of the future of healthcare.","Before I turn the call over to Brett, Let me close with this. We have had a great start to the new fiscal year and we are well positioned to grow throughout fiscal year 2020 and beyond. We have positioned ResMed for the long-term as the global leader in digital health driving both top-line and bottom-line growth as well as executing on our strategy to improve 250 million lives in healthcare that's delivered outside the hospital in 2025. We are focused on our triple aim to slow chronic disease progression, to reduce overall healthcare system costs and to improve outcomes and quality of life for the ultimate customer, the person who simply to sleep well, to breathe well and to live a better life well away from that hospital.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brett in Sydney for his remarks and then we'll open up for Q&A. Brett, over to you in Sydney.","Brett Sandercock","Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the September quarter was $691 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 17%. Excluding revenue from acquisitions, group revenue increased by 11% on a constant currency basis.","Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, our sales in U.S., Canada and Latin American countries were $317 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $224 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter. However, in constant currency terms, sales in combined Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 8% over the prior year quarter.","Breaking out revenue between product segments. U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $197 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $193 million, an increase of 19% over the prior year quarter. The revenue in Europe, Asia and other markets device sales were $152 million, which is consistent with the prior year quarter, but in constant currency terms, a 4% increase. Masks and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets was $72 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, a 19% increase. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 6% while masks and other sales increased by 19% over the prior year quarter. Software-as-a-Service revenue for the first quarter was $87 million, an increase of 83% over the prior year quarter.","During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles and the purchase accounting fair value adjustment to MatrixCare deferred revenue. The prior year comparable excludes amortization of acquired intangibles. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our first quarter earnings press release.","Our gross margin for the September quarter was 59.5% compared to 58.3% in the same quarter last year and 59.3% in Q4 FY19. Compared to the prior year, our gross margin increased by 120 basis points. This was predominantly attributable to manufacturing and procurement efficiencies, the MatrixCare acquisition and favorable product mix.","Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the first quarter were $167 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 16%. Excluding acquisitions, SG&A expenses increased by 6% on a constant currency basis. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 24.6% compared to 25% that we reported in the prior year quarter. Looking forward subject to currency movements and taking into account recent acquisitions, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 23% to 24% for the remaining three quarters of fiscal year 2020.","R&D expenses for the quarter were $48 million, an increase of 24% over the prior year quarter or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 27%. Excluding acquisitions, R&D expenses increased by 2% on a constant currency basis. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7.1% compared to 6.6% in the prior year. Looking forward, subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for the balance of fiscal year 2020.","Amortization of acquired intangibles was $18.5 million for the quarter, an increase of 44% over the prior year quarter, reflecting the impact from our recent acquisitions. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $13.3 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $191 million, an increase of 22% over the prior year quarter, while non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $135 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter.","Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.93, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.83. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the September quarter was 20.2%, while on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.6. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2020 will be in the range of 19% to 21%.","Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $162 million, reflecting robust underlying earnings. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $22.7 million. Depreciation and amortization for the September quarter totaled $38 million. And during the quarter, we paid dividends of $56.1 million.","We recorded equity losses of $6.8 million in our income statement in the September quarter as I said via Verily joint venture. We expect to record approximately $7 million of equity loss of each quarter in fiscal year 2020 associated with the joint venture operations. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share. During the quarter, we repaid $49 million of our outstanding debt. At September 30, we had $1.2 billion in gross debt and $1 billion in net debt. Our balance sheet remained strong with modest debt levels.","Finally, to recap, our top-line revenue was strong this quarter with growth across all major categories. Gross margin expanded and our operating costs remained well controlled. As a result, we're continuing to drive operating leverage with Q1 non-GAAP operating profit up 22% year-on-year. We are focused on driving operating results, integrating our SaaS acquisitions and ensuring we continue to invest in our strategic long-term opportunities.","And with that, I'll hand the call back to Amy.","Amy Wakeham","Great. Thanks. Brett. We will now going to turn the call over to the Q&A portion. I'd like to remind everyone to please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, please do feel free to return to the call queue. Chris, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Gretel Janu with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Gretel Janu","Thanks. Good morning. So just on the U.S. device growth continues to be very strong, just wondering what would be the growth in kind of new patient setups in the quarter, give us some detail on that?","Mick Farrell","Yes. Thanks for the question, Gretel. So we don't actually have full visibility even to the number. We sell to in the U.S. to home medical equipment companies that then sell to patients that are renewing in their five-year renewal or to new patient. So we don't have full visibility into that. But it is interesting with a reasonably sized patient pool in the United States it would be a good double-digit percentage or so of those that will be replenishment devices. But the 8% growth I think is really ahead of market. We think the market growth is in the sort of mid-single digits. And so to be at 8% growth in the U.S. shows that we were taking some share due to the value of Air Solutions, AirView and myAir and all the sort of digital health solutions that are there.","Gretel Janu","Thank you.","Mick Farrell","Thanks, Gretel.","Operator","Your next question is from Steve Wheen with Evans. Your line is open.","Steve Wheen","Yes. Hi guys. Just a question also on the devices, there seems to be certainly amongst the DME land a bit of a rush on COPD codes and the setting up of patients with ventilators. Just wondering if you're seeing any benefit from that, particularly around amongst your Astral \u2013 your ventilator range in particular, the Astral?","Mick Farrell","Steve, thanks for the question. We actually saw really solid growth in the core fleet business, as a sizeable chunk of that 8% growth in the U.S. Astral tends to be more of a player, ventilation in general tends to be more of a player in Europe and so some of that sort of 4% constant currency growth in Europe, Asia and rest of world will have been driven by the Astral in some sort of much smaller element of the 8% U.S. growth. But one thing that we've been really strong with our DME customers is to make sure that the right device goes on the right patient at the right time. And when you look at COPD, there were lots of solutions from our [indiscernible] as well as \u2013 so non-invasive ventilation, as well as even Stellar product in non-invasive ventilation all the way through to our Astral product, which is really a life support ventilator and should be used in very severe COPD and in life support needs.","And so, yes, it really wasn't a huge contributor in the U.S. this quarter, probably slightly more significant in Europe. But it's really good solid balanced growth, if you like, from our sleep apnea side with some additions from respiratory care is how I'd position it.","Steve Wheen","Great. Thanks very much.","Mick Farrell","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Your next question comes from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Your line is open.","Margaret Kaczor","Hey, good afternoon. And good afternoon to most people, good morning for others. But thanks for taking the question. Just kind of big picture, I know some people are going to focus on the device sleep apnea growth, but I know you guys ended up delivering 11% top line growth, excluding acquisitions and that's above market in almost every category and even as you're seeing a headwind in France. So I guess looking out whether it's this year or the next couple of years, what prohibits you guys from continuing that double-digit top line growth rate and what could drive it higher or lower from today's levels? Thanks.","Mick Farrell","Thanks for the question, Margaret. Certainly, we did have a very good quarter here in Q1. And as you said, we grew like sort of 11% constant currency globally in our sleep and respiratory care combined businesses. If you think about the global growth and we have enough data now to know that the growth really is in that mid- to high-single digits, so the devices growing in the mid-single digits and masks growing in the high-single digits. Clearly, we did take share in Q1 and a lot of that is driven by the digital health technology on the flow generator side to have some of the share taking on the device side, and then the new product introductions that I detailed in the prepared remarks, four new masks in addition to two strong flagship marks there, so NPI has been an incredible contributor to us.","Just if you think through the year ahead, even during this quarter that we're currently in the second quarter, we're going to lap one of those four product launches on the mask side and we'll continue to lap those during the quarter. So look, I'm always very excited about our innovations; the smallest, the quietest, the most comfortable, the most connected, and I think that innovation drives. But you can't outgrow market forever, right? You've got to then focus on getting more patients into the funnel, which is our whole identify, engage and enroll people in. So I think a fantastic Q1, but as we look through the fiscal year, we think we can meet or beat market growth, but you're not going to beat it every single time.","Margaret Kaczor","Great. Thank you, guys.","Mick Farrell","Thanks, Margaret.","Operator","Your next question is from David Low with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","David Low","Thanks very much. During the period, we heard \u2013 we saw from your competitor Philips that they had issues with their connected care business. They talked about tariffs, et cetera. Just wondering sort of market landscape in the U.S., whether you saw any disruption from that? Do you think some of the \u2013 that ResMed may have been a beneficiary of the issues that they were working through?","Mick Farrell","Yes, I'll hand that \u2013 good questions, David. I'll hand that to Rob Douglas, our COO.","Rob Douglas","Sure, David. Just generally on the tariffs issue just to reiterate, as we've said before, the way our whole supply chain is configured, we're not really affected by the specific tariffs. We export very little into China from the U.S. and very little from China to the U.S. Our supply chain is more Southeast Asian focused. And we've got a great team in China doing local products for China. So that's pretty solid. Our AirView solutions on the other hand, mostly by the way developed by teams all around the world, but really a strong product offering, continues to deliver superior value to our customers. And we think \u2013 with day-in and day-out we'll fight competitions with those products and belief that we've got a better proposition to offer.","So we \u2013 from our perspective, we didn't see any particular competitive issues that were sort of changing the normal competitive dynamics. We do have to sell and execute well. And our teams have been doing that.","David Low","Great. All right. Thanks very much.","Mick Farrell","Thanks, David.","Operator","Our next question is from Andrew Goodsall with MST Marquee. Your line is open.","Andrew Goodsall","Thanks very much, guys. Perhaps just thinking forward into competitive bidding and I guess the bids are in, so I guess by the next time we\u2019ve got a sense where the clearing price land. I'm just wondering whether there\u2019s any preliminary comments you've got and your thoughts there or any preliminary actions you're taking I guess to prepare for competitive bidding, and whether that involves new product launches or anything? Just say preliminary is your sort of doing or preparatory actions?","Mick Farrell","Yes, thanks for the question, Andrew. I'll hand that to David Pendarvis.","David Pendarvis","Thanks, Andrew. The \u2013 obviously we spent a lot of time along with others in the industry trying to educate the market participants so they would be able to bid effectively and bid smartly given the new rules. We remained encouraged with the changes that were put in place principally that clearing price is what's going to drive reimbursement as opposed to the median price under the old regime, and some of the other changes that were made, including requiring bonds to bid in particular areas. We hoping that together with the education that the industry did will lead to smart bids and that'll lead to a fair, more realistic reimbursement.","We obviously didn't participate in the bidding process and haven't had direct conversations with customers about what they bid. So it's all conjecture at this point as to where the ultimate reimbursement will land. But no matter where it is, whether it's a private pay, reimbursement change or a Medicare U.S. change or something elsewhere in the world, we're continually working with our customers to help them be more efficient, help them take advantage of the opportunities that present themselves and to enable them to better serve patients under whatever the reimbursement schemes are. So we'll definitely continue to do that, and watch where the U.S. Medicare landscape evolves. But at the moment, that's still a year and a bit away. So we'll just keep doing what we're doing and obviously focus on it when the time comes.","Andrew Goodsall","Thank you.","Mick Farrell","Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","Your next question is from Lyanne Harrison with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Lyanne Harrison","Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you for taking my question. Solid mask growth outside of outside of America, and I just wanted to understand you've had one of your competitors launch a new full face mask outside of America. Have you seen any difference in your full face mask sales outside of the U.S. versus within the U.S.? And how are you positioning yourself now that they've got FDA approval to launch within the U.S.?","Mick Farrell","Yes. So thanks for the question, Lyanne. And look, we have multiple competitors in the 120 countries we sell into and we expect new product introduction from our competitors on a regular basis. Yes, as you noted, during the quarter, we had 19% constant currency growth in U.S., Canada, Latin America. We also had 19% constant currency growth of masks in Europe, Asia and rest of world, where some of those masks and new launches have already been in play during the quarter.","So I think we've \u2013 I know we've got the most robust sleep apnea mask portfolio on the planet versus our competitors in all the 120 countries that we participate in. But there's no arrogance or hubris heated out. Our team of R&D engineers furiously working, not only on technology to address underserved needs, but to think differently about how to really achieve that ultimate goal, which is sort of the silent CPAP and the invisible mask. And if you look at the N30 that we just launched, this minimalist category mask, it's about as close to an invisible mask as you can get. It is small, it is quiet, it is comfortable.","So, look, I love innovation coming to the market from our competitors and from us because it keeps us all honest. But during the quarter, we performed very well versus all the NPI from our competitors with our own NPI. And I expect us to be able to do that into the future. And competition is just a healthy part of making sure that tens of millions of people get the breathing night.","Lyanne Harrison","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Deakin-Bell with Citi. Your line is open.","John Deakin-Bell","Well, good morning. I have a question for Brett. Just to deconstruct that gross margin expansion a little bit. I think previously you've given us the fee of what was from the MatrixCare. But can you just maybe elaborate a bit more in terms of strong mask growth, higher margin that would have impacted, and also whether there's a more benign processing environment in the U.S. which is helping as well?","Brett Sandercock","Hi, John, it\u2019s Brett. I think it's all of those things, probably the pricing environment is relatively been on at the moment, so the impacts there were pretty modest. In terms of acquisitions that contributed around 50 basis points. So if you think about that, still really a strong, let's call it organic expansion of the margin, which is really good. That's really around the manufacturing and procurement efficiencies. And then clearly some product mix benefit there as you saw the outperformance in the mask growth. So a combination of all of those factors I think led to that expansion.","John Deakin-Bell","Okay. Thanks, Brett.","Operator","And your next question comes from David Bailey with Macquarie. Your line is open.","David Bailey","Good morning, guys. Just in relation to U.S. mask and accessories, you've talked to adherence to resuppliers as key drivers of growth. Just wondering if you can comment on your views as to those factors being drivers of growth over the next two to three years?","Mick Farrell","Yes, it's a good question, David. I'll hand that to Rob.","Rob Douglas","Yes, thanks, David. Yes. The resupply program has definitely supported the mask portfolio. We've talked many times. You've got to understand the sort of the feedback of this. If we can get patients onto a good mask, they're more likely to stay on treatment, they'll do better and then they'll need a mask. And so we continue to see that dynamic happening. Our software solutions that support the resupply programs and enable our HME customers to manage resupply programs more efficiently and ensure that the patients have the treatment that they need when they need it. We\u2019re also supporting it. These are long-term programs. We've been running resupply programs for many years now and our teams will continue to refine and focus it.","And as Mick said earlier though, these markets are competitive. We do have competitors playing it. We have competition in resupply programs as well as in mask. And it really gets down to, we've got a really strong team executing broadly across all parts of the portfolio on this that will continue to make sure that we're providing the best solutions for patients and providers delivering the best outcomes. So I think it's really a steady as she goes progress. We love \u2013 we really like these resupply programs and they're providing us a very solid steady business.","David Bailey","Thanks very much.","Mick Farrell","Thanks, David.","Operator","Next question is from Sean Laaman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Sean Laaman","Good morning, everybody. Mick, I'm wondering if you can give a little bit more granularity on the Novartis study you mentioned in your preliminary comments and perhaps some timelines that would be really useful.","Mick Farrell","Yes, thanks for the question, Sean. I wasn't at ERS, but I'll hand over to David Pendarvis, who can give us some more detail on the Novartis clinical trial.","David Pendarvis","Terrific. Sean, we mentioned in the opening remarks, it goes by the name of magnify, and of course with trials these days you have to have a good acronym, and that stands for maximizing adherence and gaining new information for your COPD. And the trial is going to be obviously sponsored by Novartis. And what it's doing is taking patients within clinics and then within those clinics, randomizing the patients to either standard clinical practice or using Propeller. And then there'll be a comparison. And the endpoint is the time to failure of treatment. And then failure of treatment is defined in various ways such as needing an additional medication, having some particularly acute exacerbations, winding up in hospital, those kinds of things.","And it'll look and see, whether or not adding the adherence benefits of Propeller linked since the time that patients stay in that good controlled state. It's beginning recruiting now and I believe it's supposed to run through the end of 2021. So it will take quite a while before it meets it\u2019s \u2013 the end of that time period.","But the important thing is a lot of the data that's been out now has been done in the asthma setting. Obviously, that's an important area and we want to take care of those patients. But the COPD strategy is very important to us because of the way it connects with our overall respiratory care strategy. So having someone like Novartis sponsor a study, looking at Propeller benefits to a COPD patient population, we think is a real important milestone and we'll look for good benefits to come out of that study in the future, but it will be a few years.","Sean Laaman","Fantastic. Thanks, Dave. Thanks, Mick.","Mick Farrell","Thanks, Sean.","Operator","Your next question comes from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Anthony Petrone","Thank you. Great. I'm just going to have a follow-up to the Novartis question and somewhat Mick, you mentioned a couple of weeks ago indications of interest from AstraZeneca, Glaxo and Novartis on Propeller health. I'm just wondering if you have an update there and anything you can share potentially on how that would be priced on a per user per month basis. Thanks.","Mick Farrell","Yes Thanks for the question, Anthony. Pharma companies \u2013 there are many respiratory pharmaceutical, pharma players in the field and the names you mentioned all have drugs in the market. One thing about pharma companies is they\u2019re very competitive with each other and they don\u2019t want information shared too much publicly. Certainly on our Investor deck we put the names of those where we have published clinical data and we are working with. And the reason we\u2019re bringing Novartis in our prep remarks here is that\u2019s a public clinical trial. One of the interesting things that\u2019s happening here is there\u2019s a lot of trials that aren\u2019t public that are happening out there that obviously we cannot talk about.","As we look forward, the important thing if you think about milestones, Anthony, to sort of to look at on this, sort of digital health option play if you like that we have in our strategy with the Propeller solution is when somebody goes from these pilot trials to a commercial trial and when they would allow us to talk about that publicly. And so, if and when that happens, that\u2019s the milestone, I think that\u2019s most important in a material element to our shareholders.","As I said in the prep remarks, we got in early with Propeller and this is a long road. I think I used the analogy that it\u2019s an ultra marathon. This is beyond just 26.2 mile. This is a huge journey. COPD number two cause for hospitalization and rehospitalization, the number three cause of death. It has such good runway for us in the future, but there\u2019s nothing material in the quarter. And so, we\u2019re just giving the update. We hit 100,000 patients. We think that\u2019s fantastic. Right validation to have Novartis start its public study. It\u2019s going to take a couple of years as Dave said. But I would expect that before those couple of years we will have some other milestones of going to some commercial trials that we can talk about in upcoming conference calls. But at the moment this quarter, Anthony, there\u2019s nothing to report other than really good early data.","Anthony Petrone","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Saul Hadassin with UBS. Your line is open.","Saul Hadassin","Thanks. Good morning, Mick. Good morning or good afternoon, Mick and Brett. I want to talk about the SaaS business making the tie-up with Cerner, I mean it suggests that they\u2019re effectively leaving that post-acute space to providers like yourself. I\u2019m just interested to know the \u2013 how much work needs to be done to allow for the two architectures to talk to each other. If you have a new electronic medical record for example in the acute space offered by Cerner, what work has to be done in terms of your SaaS business to allow those two systems to talk to each other. When do you expect to see the ability of the benefits of that tie-up to come through? Thanks.","Mick Farrell","Yes. Thanks for the question, Saul. It allows us to talk to the area of interoperability, which is incredibly important for us here at ResMed. We have 100 API calls per second from integrators into our air solutions ecosystem. So every second 100 interactions with another EHR, EMR whether it\u2019s an individual person or myAir app checking the therapy or a physician at Massachusetts pioneer looking over 20,000 patients to do some management by exception protocol. And so, the Cerner contract or deal is that they \u2013 Cerner are looking for ResMed and really truly through our MatrixCare managed team to take care of home health and hospice customers for them.","So they have customers that have hospital systems, but for the out-of-hospital part where it goes to home health and hospice, they want ResMed to be their partner to take care of those. And we think it\u2019s a really exciting opportunity for the MatrixCare sales team and for the Cerner sales team to partner up and have that move forward. And it was really interesting at the Cerner conference to have our MatrixCare and Brightree teams there and all the technology available from the iPad app and all the capabilities that we have for home health and hospice and to get some really good leads.","It\u2019s not going to be material in the next 90 days for us, this Cerner contract, but the reason we\u2019re talking about it is that idea of interoperability with Cerner, with Epic, with Allscripts, with all the players in hospital healthcare, we think it\u2019s going to be really important that ResMed is the best person that can provide that handshake that API from someone in acute care to what they call post-acute care, but what we call out-of-hospital healthcare and we think that partnership is going to be really strong.","So we\u2019ll give you updates as the quarters progress, not just to the Cerner home health and hospice partnership, but to other partnerships with hospital systems, hospital providers and EHR providers. We think it\u2019s a good milestone to show that one of the top three leaders along with Epic and Allscripts there in hospital EHR has chosen ResMEd as their home health and hospice care provider with our MatrixCare managed solution and we\u2019re really excited about that.","Saul Hadassin","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from Thomas Yeo with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Chris Cooper","Hi, there. It\u2019s Chris Cooper on for Tom. And apologies if I missed it, but I didn\u2019t hear much commentary on Mobi portable oxygen concentrator this morning and in your prepared remarks. Could you just give us an update there, please?","Mick Farrell","Yes. Thanks for the question, Chris. I\u2019ll hand that to Rob.","Rob Douglas","Thanks, Mick. Yes, Thomas. We, as you recall, we launched Mobi very early this year and we\u2019ve sort of been in a really still in a learning mode. It\u2019s a great product. We\u2019re actually learning a lot about the performance of the product and we\u2019ve talked about and continue to validate the issue of the balance of the performance specifications and how the product works. And so, we\u2019re in good shape there.","What we\u2019re also learning is that it is challenging through, particularly through the U.S. reimbursement model how to get the right patients on the right treatment and how to get that property funded and we have been trialing experiments in looking at ways to optimize and develop that. Really we\u2019re learning a lot about what our sort of future pathways to market would be and how to \u2013 how can we make it best suitable for our HME customers to support patients and also what are the future needs of products further down the track and feeding learnings into our future roadmap.","So with that all going on, the learning process is quite successful. We\u2019re still not a major market share player with the product and that\u2019s unlikely to change into the short-term future with the Mobi product that we\u2019re currently investing and the way we\u2019re heading at the moment.","Operator","Your next question is from Mike Matson with Needham & Company. Your line is open.","Mike Matson","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I just wanted to ask about, there is a I guess a bill in Congress H.R. 2771 to kind of extend the relief from the bidding program that I think is set to expire into 2020. So just curious to get your thoughts on that and what that mean if that were not to be successful? Thanks.","Mick Farrell","I\u2019ll hand that question to Dave Pendarvis.","David Pendarvis","Yes. Thanks, Mike. Yes, there is a lot of efforts under way in the U.S. Congress right now to try to provide relief, particularly the one you mentioned which is try to extend the relief that was given that was that sort of 50-50 blend between prior reimbursement and the new system reimbursement into those rural areas. We certainly support that legislation. We think it\u2019s important that our customers who are operating particularly in extended areas where they\u2019ve got to drive many miles to patients\u2019 homes need to have reimbursement that reflects the operating cost that they\u2019ve got and we would certainly hope that the champions that there in Congress will carry the day.","Now as your question implies, there is a lot going on in the U.S. Congress these days. It\u2019s very difficult to predict whether something like that will ultimately pass or whether CMS could respond on their own and provide that kind of relief. If it doesn\u2019t, I think as I said before when talking about competitive bidding, we\u2019ll obviously work with our customers to do what we can to support them. We think the remote capabilities of our devices are ideal for providing care to remote setting. You could do things like change some of the settings on a CPAP, you can certainly interrogate the CPAP for information about the quality of the therapy that has been provided, all without having to drive to someone\u2019s home.","So we think that those systems helping customers whether they are in rural areas or not to deploy them is probably the best thing we can do to help in that kind of a setting. But we\u2019ll continue to support that legislation and other efforts with CMS to try to make sure that the Medicare policies and reimbursement is as favorable as it can be for the ultimate benefit of Medicare beneficiaries.","Mike Matson","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Shane Storey with Wilson. Your line is open.","Shane Storey","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. It\u2019s maybe a bit tangential, but it relates to the CMS reimbursement changes that hit skilled nursing providers this month. Sort of weighing up that as an incremental opportunity for Matrix, I mean do you have an estimate of the proportion of providers that are yet to adopt good solutions there? And just interested to know, just how much growth there is, a scope sort of toward available for Matrix there in the SaaS market?","Mick Farrell","Yes, Shane. Thanks for the question. It\u2019s a good one. There are changes in reimbursement not just in HME as we just talked about, but also in skilled nursing facilities and within home health and hospice. These provide excellent opportunities for Software-as-a-Service providers to \u2013 if you\u2019re ahead of the game as MatrixCare was for the skilled nursing facilities changes as we are for the home health and hospice changes to be able to support customers through that change and even grow share because you\u2019ve got the best solution that deals with those changes well.","One thing I can say is that the new CEO there at MatrixCare, Steve Pacicco has formed great relationships with the customers and he has a great sales team that know the skilled nursing facility teams really well. And we\u2019ve not only helped them through these changes in this quarter, but also set them up for success that our systems are operating well under the new reimbursement approach within those verticals.","So that\u2019s \u2013 when you roll that all together, it\u2019s part of sort of that 2020 execution plan I talked about earlier that we see a good pop even if the blended rate of growth across these seven out-of-hospital healthcare verticals is in those high single digits. We think there are areas where we can get better growth than that. And we plan to exit 2020 with a double digit growth trajectory in the segment of SaaS. And part of that is going to be doing just what your question asked about, which is every part of the vertical, whether it\u2019s skilled nursing facilities, whether it\u2019s our new play in home health and hospice, the hunting license with Cerner in addition to our ability to grow share through having solutions that are ahead of the curve on reimbursement changes, they\u2019re all opportunities to be able to grow faster and form longer partnerships with our customers.","Shane Storey","Thanks, Mick. Appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question is from Steve Wheen with Evans. Your line is open.","Steve Wheen","Hi, sorry. I just wanted to come back to Brett on the gross margin. You typically gave a bit of a range for that in terms of guidance. Are you able to do that again this quarter?","Brett Sandercock","Yes. Sure, Steve. I mean there\u2019s a lot of moving parts, but I would think it would be broadly consistent with where we were for Q1.","Steve Wheen","Perfect. Thank you.","Mick Farrell","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","And your next question is from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Anthony Petrone","Just a quick follow-ups on masks. I know you mentioned, Mick, a couple of launches. I\u2019m just wondering how much stocking potentially there was in the quarter? And then just on lead item. Is there any \u2013 Dave, you mentioned, we spoke a couple of days ago, but is there any indication on how this is kind of coming in post the notification period? Thanks again.","Mick Farrell","Yes. So Anthony, I\u2019ll take the first part of your question on masks and Dave will take the second part. Clearly we had excellent new product introduction over the last 12 months, but your question was around do people do stocking orders. Our U.S. distribution, and frankly, our global distribution partners are getting very intelligent about inventory management, not just those who use Brightree and have ResMed\u2019s Brightree inventory management system, which will actually manage it for them, but many of them are getting really appropriate on that knowing when a new mask comes, watching how there r teasers setting it up and seeing the patient flow and making sure they don\u2019t get too ahead of the curve or behind the curve. You don\u2019t want a patient in the fitting room that wants the N30 and it\u2019s not there, but on the other hand, you don\u2019t want excess inventory because I have inventory carrying costs as everyone knows and our U.S. distributors are actually quite sophisticated on this.","So I \u2013 obviously when some \u2013 you launch a brand new mask, people do need to make sure they got that mask on the shelf. But given the proportion of existing resupply patients, which is a very large portion, particularly the U.S. distributors patient flow, we don\u2019t think there was material impact from stocking. Now, we don\u2019t have full insight into our customers that aren\u2019t using Brightree or other inventory management solutions, but we think it\u2019s a pretty steady approach and we\u2019ve done new product introductions over the 20, 30 years we\u2019ve been in business. And I don\u2019t \u2013 we haven\u2019t seen that a significant rate before and I don\u2019t think we saw any significant rate of that during the last quarter.","Dave, the second part of the question for you.","David Pendarvis","Sure. Yes, thanks Anthony. I mentioned a little bit earlier that ResMed along with other industry participants put a lot of energy and resources behind trying to educate the market participants who are going to be bidding about various factors including lead item pricing and we developed a calculator that was put out. There were some stats that were just discussed in the Medtrade meeting just earlier this week in Atlanta that there were over 17,000 downloads of that calculator. And that\u2019s just simply the one that was available to the participants here. CMS had their own calculator that folks downloaded.","From the conversations that I\u2019ve had, my understanding is that most DMEs have a pretty good understanding of lead item pricing and how it works. And hopefully they\u2019ve avail themselves of the tools to be able to model out scenarios based on their own business and their own volume of products in different categories so that they can bid intelligently and in a way that\u2019s going to ultimately derive a fair and reasonable reimbursement.","So I\u2019m confident that we got that message out that it was received. Obviously, we don\u2019t know how people bid and we\u2019ll work with customers as best we can to try to implement things when the day comes. But we are confident that we did what we could to try to educate.","Anthony Petrone","Thanks again.","Operator","We are now at the one hour mark, so I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.","Mick Farrell","Thanks, Chris. And thanks again to all our shareholders for joining us on the call this quarter. I\u2019d also like to thank the 7,500 ResMedians, many of whom are also shareholders for their dedication and hard work, helping people breathe better, sleep better and live better lives outside the hospital in a 120 countries worldwide. Thanks for all that you do today and every day. We will talk again with all of our shareholders in approximately 90 days. Talk to you all then.","Amy Wakeham","Great.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I'll now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin.","Amy Wakeham - ResMed Inc.","Great. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us and welcome to ResMed's earnings call for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 ending June 30, 2018. This call is being webcast live and the replay along with a copy of the earning press release and our investor presentation will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website.","Joining me on the call today to discuss our quarterly results are Mick Farrell, our CEO; and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of management will be available during the Q&A portion of the call following our prepared remarks.","During our call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures. For reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures, please see the notes to the financial statements in today's press release. And as a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about ResMed's future performance.

Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements.","I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our shareholders that are joining us today, as we review results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. On today's call, I will review top level financial results, some business highlights and a few key announcements from the quarter. Then, I will hand the call over to Brett, who will walk you through our financial results in further detail.","So, first, our top level financial results. We achieved another quarter of broad-based strong performance and I'd like to recognize the continued hard work that our 6,000-strong team has put in to achieve these results. Revenue once again grew by double digits, 12% on a headline basis and 10% on a constant currency basis, led by our sleep and respiratory care therapy businesses, performing well across global markets in both devices and masks. We also achieved good continued growth in our cloud-based Software-as-a-Service business.","In addition to strong top line growth, our focus on operating leverage has resulted in continued bottom line success, with non-GAAP operating profit improving 19% year-over-year. Our efforts across the board from top line to bottom line performance resulted in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.95. So, now some business highlights across our sleep and respiratory care business.","Turning to a discussion of our business and its operations, so let's start with this part. We continue to pioneer and lead the industry in connected health and digital health. We now have over 8 million patients supported by our cloud-based patient management system called AirView and well over 5 million patients with 100% cloud-connected devices that are available for remote daily monitoring.","In addition, over 1 million patients have signed up to access and review their own data with our personal patient engagement app called myAir. Our big data efforts to gather actionable information continued to increase exponentially and we now have over 2.5 billion nights of medical sleep and COPD data in the cloud. These data support our efforts to analyze information and unlock value for our customers, enabling us to take action to better support home care providers, physicians, payers and ultimately, the most important customer, the patient. We continue our efforts to improve market access by working with payers across many geographies to improve reimbursement.","Last quarter, we highlighted the revised reimbursement that went into effect in Japan during April. This resulted in our Japanese customers increasing their adoption of our cloud-connected devices. This increased activity continued in the fourth quarter and we saw another period of very strong sales in Japan. During the quarter, France continued to benefit from telemonitoring reimbursement incentives that went into effect last year. We expect year-over-year growth to return to normal patterns in France throughout fiscal 2019.","Further, on the topic of reimbursement changes, our largest sleep apnea therapy geographies; the U.S., France, and Japan, getting beyond these and starting to look a little deeper. South Korea began reimbursing diagnosis and therapeutic treatment for sleep apnea during July. While the market size in South Korea is not nearly as big as the U.S., France, Japan or Germany, this is a really positive sign that our market access efforts are raising awareness and public health and the importance of diagnosing and treating sleep apnea.","Also, in July, in the United States, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, issued a proposed rule to make changes to the bidding and pricing methodologies under the competitive bidding program. Here are my two key takeaways: one, overall these changes will be a net positive for patients, for home care providers and for ResMed; and two, it's great that CMS is listening to industry advocates and responding to our concerns that have been impacting patients for many years.","On the masks and accessories side of our business, in Q4, we had another very strong quarter, with global constant currency growth of 13% in the category. This was led by continued strong demand in our Europe and Asia markets, which grew a very strong 16% on a constant currency basis in masks and accessories. We are seeing continued good traction with our AirFit F20 full face mask and our AirFit N20 nasal mask products across all geographies. We're also encouraged by the success of our N20 Classic, which is positioned specifically for countries in Europe and is performing really well in those countries that we targeted. This is the validation of our approach to create unique solutions for specific geographies.","The U.S., Canada and Latin America teams achieved very solid revenue growth of 12% in masks, driven by a continued success of the AirFit F20 and the AirFit N20 masks with patients, physicians and our home care providers. I'm proud of our team taking market share, growing ahead of the market in the U.S., Europe and Asia and globally.","On the devices side of our business, we saw solid year-over-year constant currency growth of 8% globally, driven by strong growth in the U.S. of 9% on a year-over-year basis in devices. We continue to grow our device market share as healthcare providers and physicians are choosing and scripting ResMed, respectively, because of our quality, the sustainable value proposition of Air Solutions and the connected health and digital health outputs that come from Air Solutions, AirView, myAir, and the whole portfolio of cloud-based solutions that we have.","Let's now turn to a discussion of our out-of-hospital Software-as-a-Service businesses. This part of our business continues its trajectory of steady growth with revenue up 12% year-over-year. Brightree, which makes up the vast majority of this category, remains the top choice for home medical equipment companies, who use third-party software providers. Brightree's growth and leadership position in the health IT industry was recently recognized by Healthcare Informatics Magazine as a Top 100 Healthcare Information Technology Company for the fifth year in a row. I'm really proud of that part of our global ResMed team.","We continue to invest in options for the future and to drive further growth in our Software-as-a-Service offerings. On July 9, we closed the acquisition of HEALTHCAREfirst, a company offering electronic health record software, billing and coding services, as well as advanced analytics to both home health and hospice agencies. HEALTHCAREfirst enables these providers to optimize their clinical, financial and administrative processes, and we are proud to welcome the talented team from HEALTHCAREfirst to ResMed.","Brightree also has home health and hospice and offerings that we think will combine very well with HEALTHCAREfirst. The HEALTHCAREfirst acquisition complements these existing solutions from Brightree and expands our footprint even further into the large and growing home health and hospice segments. These markets will continue to grow swiftly as an aging population shifts the lower cost out-of-hospital healthcare settings. The combination of Brightree and HEALTHCAREfirst capabilities will allow us to drive further enhancements and innovation for home health and hospice customers, ultimately increasing the business efficiency of our provider customers and improving outcomes for our patients.","Now, let's discuss the progress we have made in executing on our operating excellence initiatives across the organization. We have delivered on our fourth quarter in a row of double-digit net operating profit improvement, and we're very pleased to once again deliver operating leverage to improve our bottom line.","Non-GAAP income from operations improved 19% in the quarter, combining solid revenue growth and stable margin with very disciplined growth in SG&A, which grew by just 3% constant currency, and research and development, which grew at 6% constant currency. I want to reemphasize that our operating excellence initiatives are about the long-term. It's about working more efficiently, being focused and working smarter. We're taking a disciplined and thoughtful approach, and we will continue to invest in market-leading innovation across our businesses to continue to deliver strong organic growth.","On that front, our product development teams continue to deliver meaningful product innovation. As I mentioned last quarter, we have just launched our brand new QuietAir technology that is part of our AirFit F20 full face mask and we're really pleased to see good customer response to this mask during the quarter, which continues to lead in the full face mask category over all our competitors.","Last quarter, we also discussed the controlled launch of Mobi, the first ResMed-branded portable oxygen concentrator for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and for others who require oxygen therapy. We continue to gain insights and gather data on our go-to-market model for POCs. We are getting ready to scale this business. Tens of millions of COPD patients need our help and we are preparing to do just that.","Now, for some business highlights in clinical research. A fundamental element of our mission here at ResMed is not only to deliver life-changing products and connected-health solutions to patients worldwide with sleep apnea, COPD and other severe respiratory and chronic disease conditions but to also spread awareness about these conditions and the availability of good diagnostic and treatment alternatives.","As part of our efforts to raise awareness of sleep apnea and COPD, our medical affairs team focused its priorities to harness and analyze the over 2.4 billion nights of medical sleep and COPD data available in our AirView cloud-based system. These big data-driven studies are producing important results that are worthy of publication in the peer-reviewed press and throughout medical conferences. ResMed is pioneering digital health research in order to drive better patient outcomes.","During May, at the Annual Meeting of the American Thoracic Society, ResMed presented and supported over 18 studies in sleep apnea and COPD. We are not just leading the market in sleep apnea and COPD in terms of market share, but we're also leading with the best and top quality, world-class medical research. I won't go into details on this call of all these 18 studies; however, I'd like to mention a few that I believe highlight the importance of our products and services for all of our customers, from physicians to providers, to payers, and especially our most important customer, the patient.","The first study relates to the global prevalence of sleep apnea. We convened a global team of leading researchers and key opinion leaders who looked at the prevalence studies from the many different countries around the world where they've been conducted. The team propensity-matched the population characteristics from these studies to calculate the new global prevalence estimate of 936 million people worldwide who have mild, moderate or severe sleep apnea. That is higher than the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and many other chronic disease conditions that are widely regarded as a global epidemic, and a public health crisis.","If you remove the mild sleep apnea sufferers from the analysis, the experts estimate there are over 424 million people with moderate or severe sleep apnea. Considering this, we and others in our space have barely scratched the surface of this disease and its prevalence around the world. Sleep apnea remains a huge opportunity and a strategic imperative for ResMed. We have to raise awareness and get help for these people \u2013 hundreds of millions of people who are suffocating each night, we need to get them aware so they can get diagnosed and get treated.","On that front, we have two joint venture investments that are driving sleep and sleep apnea awareness. In our joint venture that is called SleepScore Labs, and our brand new joint venture with Alphabet and the Verily arm of Alphabet that is a joint venture that was announced during the quarter. Through these types of partnerships, we plan to continue to invest to help identify, engage and enable the 936 million people with sleep apnea to find a path to diagnosis and world-leading connected health therapy from ResMed.","The second study to highlight is an economic analysis that demonstrates the successful in-home combination of non-invasive ventilation and oxygen therapy versus oxygen therapy alone. Nick Hart (00:16:05) and his colleagues analyzed the economic impact of combining non-invasive ventilation and portable oxygen concentration and found that adding these two together saves money to the tune of $50,000 per quality of life adjusted year. That's an amazing result and we believe it will help drive adoption of the use of non-invasive ventilation.","The third study I want to quickly mention relates to the patient benefits of the mask resupply program, which is a program to automate the process of resupplying masks by validating insurance, contacting the patient to determine if they need a new mask, fulfilling and then shipping that mask and then billing for it. Most insurance systems will let a patient receive a new mask two, three, or even four times per year. In a study of approximately 100,000 patients, half were on a resupply program and half were not.","We demonstrated that for a patient on a resupply program, the likelihood of therapy termination after one year was reduced by more than 50% and there was a significant increase in the daily usage of PAP therapy among patients on resupply. These are meaningful outcomes and this demonstrates that resupply programs are an effective way to help patients achieve long-term adherence to therapy and thereby improve overall healthcare outcomes and lower healthcare costs.","These three studies also demonstrate ResMed's commitment to support research from our over 2.5 billion nights of medical data to change the trajectory of two of the world's toughest and harshest chronic diseases, sleep apnea and COPD.","Before I turn the call over to Brett, let me close with this. We had a great fiscal year 2018, ending June 30, and we finished the year with solid revenue growth and even stronger operating profit growth. ResMed is positioned well as we head into fiscal 2019. Our connected health strategy is advancing across multiple markets. We've seen continued success with our new mask and device products and we have a robust pipeline of new products and new connected health and digital health solutions.","We are positioning ResMed for the long-term, driving top line and bottom line growth into 2020 and well beyond. We're going to execute on our strategy to lead the medtech field to create value with digital health solutions to slow chronic disease progression, to also reduce overall healthcare system costs, and most importantly, to improve outcomes and quality of life for our ultimate customer, the patients.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brett for his remarks on the finance in detail and then, we'll go over to Q&A. Brett, from Munich to Sydney, are you there?","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the June quarter was $623.6 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 10%.","Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Brightree Software-as-a-Service business, our sales in U.S., Canada and Latin American countries were $346.7 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $236.5 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter. Sales in constant currency terms in combined Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 9% over the prior year quarter.","Breaking out revenue between product segments, U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $189.9 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $156.8 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter. For revenue in Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales were $162.2 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter, or in constant currency terms, a 6% increase.","Masks and other sales were $74.3 million, an increase of 22% over the prior year quarter, or in constant currency terms, a 16% increase. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 8%, while masks and other sales increased by 13% over the prior year quarter. Brightree revenue for the fourth quarter was $40.4 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter.","During the rest of my commentary today, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles, restructuring expenses and tax-related expenses associated with U.S. tax reform and an adjustment of foreign tax credits. The prior year comparable excludes amortization of acquired intangibles. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our fourth quarter earnings press release.","Our gross margin for the June quarter was 58.1% compared with 58.2% during the same quarter in the prior year. Our margin was essentially consistent with the prior year and reflects typical declines in average selling prices, largely offset by manufacturing and procurement efficiencies. Assuming current exchange rates and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margin for fiscal year 2019 to be broadly consistent with our Q4 FY 2018 gross margin.","Moving to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $156.8 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 3%. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of revenue, improved to 25.1% compared to the 26.6% that we reported in the prior year quarter. Looking forward and subject of currency movements, we expect SG&A as a definitive revenue to be in the range of 24% to 25% for fiscal year 2019. Consistent with historical trends, Q1 FY 2019 will likely exceed this range, while the second half of the fiscal year is expected to track at the lower end of the range.","R&D expenses for the quarter were $39.7 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter or on a constant currency basis an increase of 6%. This increase reflects incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.4% compared with 6.6% in the prior year. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for fiscal year 2019.","Amortization of acquired intangibles was $11.6 million for the quarter, the increase of 1% over the prior year quarter. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $12.5 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $166 million, an increase of 19% over the prior year quarter, while non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $136.3 million, an increase of 24% over the prior year quarter.","Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.95, an increase of 23% over the prior year quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.76. Foreign exchange movements positively impacted fourth quarter earnings by $0.02 per share, reflecting the favorable impacts from the stronger euro relative to the U.S. dollar, which were partially offset by the stronger Australian dollar.","As discussed during the previous call, we implemented a strategic global workforce review that was completed this quarter and resulted in a restructure expense of $7.5 million being recorded in our fourth quarter results. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the June quarter is 22.1%. As discussed during the previous quarter, we have recorded additional income tax expense of $126.6 million relating to newly enacted U.S. tax laws. This calculation is permitted to be provisional for 12 months after the enactment of the law. And as part of the current quarter activity, we further refined our calculations, which resulted in additional income tax expense of $5.8 million being recorded in our fourth quarter results.","Additionally, we recorded a one-time charge of $7.2 million, reflecting the cumulative adjustment of our foreign tax credit position. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the one-time charges I've just discussed, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 14.9%.","And now turning to guidance on our expected fiscal year 2019 effective tax rate. You will recall from last quarter, we have to take into account two offsetting impacts, unfavorable Australian tax reforms and favorable U.S. tax legislation along with estimates of the geographic attribution of our income. Taking into account these factors, we estimate that our fiscal year 2019 effective tax rate will be in the range of 22% to 24%.","Cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter was $129.4 million, reflecting strong underlying earnings and improved working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $17.6 million. Depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $31.7 million. And during the quarter, we paid dividends of $50 million.","Our board of directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share, representing a 6% increase on our previously declared dividend. We also continued with our share buyback during the fourth quarter and repurchased 250,000 shares for consideration of $25.9 million.","As Mick noted, subsequent to quarter end, we closed on our acquisition of HEALTHCAREfirst. HEALTHCAREfirst revenue in calendar year 2017 was $29 million. At June 30, we have $281.5 million in gross debt and $92.8 million in net debt. Our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels. At June 30, total assets were $3.1 billion and net equity was $2.1 billion.","And with that, I'll hand the call back to Amy.","Amy Wakeham - ResMed Inc.","Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to the Q&A. I'd like to remind everyone to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. If you have additional questions, please feel free to get back into the queue. Tim, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Saul Hadassin with UBS is online with a question.","Saul Hadassin - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.","Thanks very much. Good morning. Can you hear me?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","We can hear you loud and clear. It's actually good evening here, Saul, in Munich.","Saul Hadassin - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.","Good evening. Good evening in Munich, Mick. Can I just ask about masks, particularly in the U.S.? So strong growth rate there. You mentioned market share \u2013 taking market share. Can you maybe comment a bit more on the contribution from growth in the resupply business? And cognizant that Brightree had some acquisitions during the year, the quarter as well, just in terms of the performance of ResMed resupply and Brightree, just how they are contributing to the resupply growth as evident in the mask growth rate this quarter?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah, absolutely, Saul. We talk about sort of the devices growing in the mid-single digits and the masks growing at the high single-digits. And so clearly, 13% constant currency growth of our masks and accessories business in the U.S., kind of Latin America being 12% on a constant currency basis, we clearly took some share. And you saw in our sort of organic growth within the Brightree business, that was also in parallel actually a 12% on our Software-as-a-Service business. And clearly, that does through Brightree resupply and Brightree connected ResMed resupply, there are some combinations that are driving our share growth through not only first time set up of these great new masks, the N20 and the F20, but also through those resupply programs. So there's a combination of both of them coming into play into that really solid 12% growth number in the U.S. and really good global growth of 13% constant currency as well.","Saul Hadassin - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.","Thanks. So just one follow-up on that. Just the launch of QuietAir, how significant or how material was that? When did it come \u2013 actually, when was it rolled out during the quarter?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yes. So it was rolled out during the quarter. And as you know, Saul, our market is not uniform and so it's multiple contact points, over 3,000 contact points within just one geography, the U.S., and multiple in many of the markets that we go to through homecare providers. So it's account by account and doctor by doctor. They get to see it and start to write prescriptions for it and homecare providers start to adopt it. In our patient markets, like Australia and UK, you've got to get the word out and they've got a big social media drives and all that to get that technology there. But, look, I personally use one of these devices in QuietAir, the ability to have that level of noise reduction to well below the air conditioning \u2013 most QuietAir conditioning system in anyone's bedroom is incredible and a great advance. And I think this technology has lots more legs than just one quarter and we've got a lot of runway to go in QuietAir. But it was really just launched during this last quarter and so we've got a lot of runway ahead on that.","Saul Hadassin - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.","All right. Thanks very much, Mick.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks, Saul.","Operator","Margaret Kaczor with William Blair is online with a question.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, good evening, guys, and thanks for taking the questions. First of all, I wanted to touch a little bit on the device growth that we saw internationally. Can you give any more color in terms of how big of an impact Japan had? Are you seeing more patients getting diagnosed or are you seeing more fleet upgrades? And how should we think about that benefit over the next kind of 12 to 18 months (00:31:10)","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah, Margaret, thanks for the question. Look, we had some really good growth in devices in Europe, Asia and our global markets, 6% on the constant currency basis and actually even better growth within U.S., Canada, Latin America of 9%. We had the benefits of the changes in reimbursements in both Japan and France, which are the sort of S curves of growth that we've been talking about over the last number of quarters and those Ss will start to taper off as we talked about, but those devices that are now set up are 100% cloud-connected.","And if you go back to the study I referred to in the prepared remarks, if you have a resupply program and if a patient has cloud connectivity, you start to get adherence rates in 80% range, just in cloud-connected and using myAir. And then, you add on the resupply program, which leads to even greater adherence. That combination we think will be powerful to be able to drive long-term mask and accessory growth across that patient group. So if you like, getting a connected device in there is the gift that keeps on giving.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got it. And then, just to follow up with a similar question, in the U.S., obviously, the U.S. device number ended up being quite strong again. And so I think, generally, when you talk to investors, they'll be surprised that you continue to take share, you continue to see strong underlying market growth. So are you seeing existing DMEs or maybe already ResMed purchasers buying more of them? Are you seeing more of the fleets moving towards ResMed? Are you seeing that incremental buyer come in and say, I'm going to standardize on ResMed? Thank you.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for the follow-up, Margaret. Look, I think it's a combination of a little bit of all the above. If our devices are able to save you 50% labor cost on setting up the devices, it's really \u2013 you have Adam Smith's invisible hand helping you choose ResMed at the homecare provider level. And if you're a physician and writing prescriptions and you can do this AirView based management by exception and automated connectivity and follow-up with your patients through the Air Solutions platform and particularly through AirView, then you're going to write more prescriptions for our product. So it's both of the above.","And look, I do think, to your third point, we are betting on the winners. The people that are adopting ResMed's cloud-connected devices are the ones that are taking share in their geographies, whether it's the Southeast in the United States or whether it's Western France, and now in Japan. And so, I don't think that this is the end of it. I think this is the start of it.","And as we said in the prepared remarks as well, Margaret, we're not satisfied with the current market growth, particularly with these new prevalence numbers showing over 900 million people with sleep apnea. We think that our partnership with Alphabet and Verily, and our partnership with Pegasus Capital and Dr. Oz to just drive awareness of sleep and then specifically sleep apnea so that we get more patients into the diagnostic and therapeutic funnel is a strategic imperative for ResMed. And we're not going to accept not being able to drive that market growth rate up as well as continue to take share.","Operator","Anthony Petrone from Jefferies is on the line with a question.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC","Thanks again for the question. Just a few contribution questions in the quarter. Just wondering what acquisition contributed there and maybe just an update on Mobi, as that's under controlled launch and what your expectations are perhaps into the fourth quarter for Mobi? Maybe once it's under a full launch in 2019, how big of a market opportunity do you see Mobi and what does the margin profile for that product look like? Thanks.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah, Anthony, thanks for the two questions. I'll take them in reverse order. I'll take the Mobi question and hand the contribution question over to Brett in Sydney. But, yeah, look, I know that here in Germany healthcare \u2013 ResMed healthcare office here in Germany, and there's really a great market and is biggest economy in Europe for portable oxygen concentrators. And so we think long-term, there is a really exciting opportunity globally for ResMed with portable oxygen concentrators. Our controlled launch is really focused in the U.S. primarily and it's about our go-to-market model.","When you talk about market potential, look, there are a number of players in this space. We're not alone in having a portable oxygen concentrator. What I think we bring to the table is the ResMed brand, ResMed quality, reliability, the awareness amongst pulmonary doctors of our brand name. And I do think that will contribute a lot to the prescriptions that we've started to get and will continue to get with Mobi. But as I said in the prep remarks and you alluded to there, Anthony, we're doing a controlled launch and then we will go to a stronger, larger launch as we refine that go-to-market model.","So throughout FY 2019, 2020 and beyond, you're going to see ResMed be a major player in the global portable oxygen concentrator market. And it won't just be having a device that filters nitrogen. Its' going to be a device that's smart, that moves with the patient and is mobile, is small, quite, comfortable, high-quality oxygen output and also, ultimately, a system that'll have connectivity and will link up to Air Solutions and all the value that we provided in digital health across the rest of our business.","Brett, do you want to take the first part of Anthony's question about contributions from organic versus inorganic?","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. Sure, Mick, thank you. Anthony, we've got \u2013 I mean we've made a couple of tiny acquisitions over FY 2018. So in terms of group results, it was really pretty much de minimis in terms of their contribution. It's pretty much organic growth that you're seeing.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC","Thanks again.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks, Anthony.","Operator","Joanne Wuensch is on the line with BMO Capital Markets with the question.","Unknown Speaker","This is Steve (00:37:31) on of Joanne. Can you guys hear me okay?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Can hear you loud and clear, Steve. (00:37:35)","Unknown Speaker","Awesome. Hey, I appreciate some of the early commentary on the HEALTHCAREfirst integration and just piggybacking on the last question. But can you talk about some of the strategy behind combining it with the Brightree offering and maybe some of the revenue and cost synergies we should be focused on in the long-term?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","So, really, HEALTHCAREfirst, I mean, as Brett said, it was de minimus. I mean, we only really just closed it recently and so there was no sort of revenue impact in the numbers that we talked about in FY 2018. But as we look forward, and as Brett indicated in the prep remarks, it's about $30 million run rate trailing revenue in this business and we expect that to grow pretty fast. The home health and hospice sectors of out-of-hospital care are very fast growing.","We've got an aging population. People want to age in place. They don't want to be in hospital. They don't want to be in an acute care setting. And so we're really seeing great growth \u2013 just secular growth within those two segments. And HEALTHCAREfirst has an excellent offering and Brightree home health and hospice has an excellent iPad app and capability and really user friendly for the home nurses and the folks that are walking around hospice agencies and traveling around to people's homes for the home nursing and home health.","So we are really excited about the strategic combination of those two parts of our business and we have some really strong leadership that have experience at much larger companies within this space. And we're very excited about those sectors. So you're going to see ResMed invest for organic and inorganic growth across the out-of-hospital software part of our business.","Unknown Speaker","Okay, great. And just as a quick follow-up, just a competitive question, now that we have sort of one more quarter under your belt, have you guys seen any further impact from the masks from Philips?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. Look, I mean we don't go into details around other than the fact that we're taking share versus our competitors, but I might hand to Jim Hollingshead to give a little more detail. He's President of our Global Sleep business. He can maybe talk a little bit about the innovation of N20 and F20 and how they're beating the competition and how that works. Jim?","James Hollingshead - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Mick. See, as Mick says, we don't go into details about specific \u2013 really, in general about our competitor shares, specific competitive products. I'll just say that we feel very comfortable with our mask portfolio. The whole portfolio continues to perform very well both in the U.S. and in global markets. The F20 full face mask is performing extremely well and continues to be in a very strong leadership position in the market with the QuietAir vent adding to that offering. And we're very confident in our portfolio.","Unknown Speaker","Okay, great. Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","David Bailey from Macquarie is on the line with a question.","David Bailey - Macquarie Securities (Australia) Ltd.","Yes. Good morning. It's David from Macquarie. Just my first question is in relation to Mobi in portable oxygen concentration. Seen some of your competitors looking to employing a direct-to-consumer strategy. You've previously said you're looking at partnering with the HME channel in terms of your own strategy. Can you just talk through how you plan to go about things on the go-forward basis in the POC space?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for the question, David. And as you mentioned, there are a couple of competitors doing a variety of different go-to market models. Our goal is, we really like our U.S. homecare provider customers. The HME is a great customer base we partnered with for decades to help grow this market. And they have the best people to start working on reimbursement models and to understand Medicare reimbursement and private care reimbursement for POCs. And so we're really partnering with them on that. And we're also partnering with them on the best way to get the product to patients who want to pay cash. And so you'll see us work with the channel and help support them with many different models in this space. But rather than \u2013 because I'm sure our competitors will be reading this transcript or listening live to go into the details of that go-to-market model. I'll just say that our model is going to be more partnership with the channel than that what we're seeing, I think, from some others is competition with the channel. I just don't think that's a smart move. I think you want to partner and understand how you can grow as you have for a number of decades other parts of the business like our sleep apnea franchise that we've grown incredibly well with our U.S. HME partners and our French homecare providers, and our Japanese homecare providers and grow in those spaces. And so, obviously, every market in the world is different. We have different go-to-market models in Germany or Australia, New Zealand. But I think your question was about the U.S. market where our focus is partnership with the HME channel and helping both of us win. And additionally, really most importantly, helping that patient win and get access to ResMed's POC if they want to.","David Bailey - Macquarie Securities (Australia) Ltd.","That's great. Thanks. That's very clear. And just a follow-up from me. Just in terms of resupply in some of the new markets that you've entered, France and Japan, the U.S. obviously eligible for full mask to run. (00:42:59) How does the resupply criteria or eligibility criteria in the rest of world compared to what you see in the United States?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah, David. It's a good question. Let's talk about the resupply side of our business. In the U.S., every payer operates differently. There are some private payers that is two full mask systems per year, 10 or more cushions per year. There's some that are three full mask systems and even some that are four full masks systems. I think what it's really about is checking in with the patient because you want to make sure that that patient wants the new mask, is ready for a new mask and is engaged in this therapy.","And, David, as you heard me say in the prep remarks, when you engage with the patient around a resupply program and you're checking with them, do you want to be email, do you want to be text, do you want to be a live call. And you ask them, how, when and where they want to find that out, and to what level do we partner with the channel to check on reimbursement and to help them provide shipping and follow-up care to that patient. We're seeing really good growth of that resupply business.","So, look, it's a long-term play. I think you saw in the quarter really good mask growth from us not just in the U.S., but also in Europe. Every market is different. You actually find sometimes in patient pay markets like Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore, and UK, that patients are even more active in working with the adherence models because it's their own mask and they get to choose when they want it. But the really important thing is, ask the patient, get in touch with them, and we're seeing really good success as you saw in the quarter there.","David Bailey - Macquarie Securities (Australia) Ltd.","That's great. Thanks for the detail.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks, David.","Operator","David Low with JPMorgan is online with a question.","David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.","Thanks very much. If I could just start with the restructuring, so we saw another round of restructuring going through, just if I could get you to comment on whether that's now complete. And then, sort of to the operating leverage, which has been such a strong driver of earnings in recent times, is a lot of what you're seeing going forward \u2013 going forward in the guidance reflecting the benefit from that restructuring or there a broader opportunity on the operating leverage front?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. I'll hand the first part of question over to Brett, who will talk about the restructuring and then maybe, Brett, you can have a go with the operating leverage and hand back to me or anyone else in the team you think appropriate.","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Sure. Thanks, Mick. Yeah, Dave, we \u2013 I mean, we've got \u2013 that's sort of like the global restructure was in Q3 and we did flag up that we'd have this final charge coming through into Q4. So that's essentially that one that's completed. And then, probably you sort of see some of that benefit from the Q3 restructuring, I guess, coming through. But that was really around strategically looking at kind of where we wanted to balance resources and so on, what we felt we needed to invest in. So it's a much broader picture in terms of what we're trying to do.","If you look at the kind of operating leverage, we're pretty committed on that and we're really looking to see how we can do things smarter, or how we can do them differently. And then, really, looking at how can we achieve scale, and then as we grow revenues, grow SG&A at a lower clip than that. So there's a lot we're doing there, a lot we're doing around business excellence program and things like that. We're really trying to make sure that we're operating as efficiently as we can. But I don't want you to feel \u2013 we're really cognizant that we'll be continuing to invest for the long-term sustainable growth in the business, so we won't back off that whatsoever. We do think we can manage in terms of efficiencies and scale and then kind of how we deliver particularly around kind of back office, if you like. So we're continuing that program, but the aim is to support the long-term sustainable growth.","David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.","Okay, great. I mean, I might just switch topics. The sales line was pretty much where we expected and clearly very strong across masks in the U.S. The one part that was a little softer to my mind was the device sales outside the U.S., Europe and Asia, particularly in light of the commentary that we heard about France and Japan being strong, Korea perhaps a bit earlier stage. But is there anything else across the region that would explain if France and Japan was strong? Why perhaps 6% growth was \u2013 is certainly down a bit on what we saw in Q3. Just wondering if there's anything else happening in other markets perhaps?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for the question, David. And we did flag this last quarter when we saw pretty strong outside U.S. device growth in that high single, low double digits last quarter. And what we said was that some of the step-up like in Japan, where it's a fleet sale to Japanese home care providers based upon that telemonitoring chain that it would be sort of a one to one and a half quarter effect. And so, I think you're seeing that Japan \u2013 in and Japan out element from Q3 to Q4.","But, look, 6% growth in devices in Europe, Asia and around the world is a really solid number. I mean you're talking mid- to single digits growth globally in that space normally and ResMed grew at 8%, so well above global market growth. And as we said we had a little bit of benefit additionally in France, but most of that is starting go away and we're starting to get back towards those organic growth rates in Europe, Asia and others.","So I think it's a natural return to market growth and then some additional market share taking for those who still are switching over to the cloud-connected devices in France and to a much lesser extent in Japan. But, look, the real benefit, as I was alluding to in one of the earlier questions, is not just selling that one device and then resupplying that every three or five years based on patient upgrade or warranty models. It's really around the fact that a patient now on a cloud-connected device in a region where cloud connectivity is used a lot, like France, Japan and obviously, the U.S., is something that starts to drive really strong and sustainable mask and accessory resupply.","And so that's really the benefit that we're sort of highlighting with these great telemonitoring tools. Yes, there's some great one to two quarter benefits in device sales, but most importantly, it's a patient whose life has changed. And therefore, when you ask them, text them, call them, do you want a new mask three months or four months or six months later, they say, yes, because you're contacting them the way they wanted and how they wanted and they're getting part of that resupply program. So it's good for everyone, then the payer because patients go in hospital, the patient because they're getting great care, and the provider because they're able to provide that extra mask and obviously for ResMed.","David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.","Great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thomas Yeo is on the line with Goldman Sachs, Sydney, with a question.","Thomas Yeo - Goldman Sachs Australia Pty Ltd.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. The first question is, in regards to the recent CMS proposed rules, could you help us understand a few of the potential changes that is happening? Like, how is a lead product being defined? And also, what do you expect the change in proposed rules to have on the different mask categories?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","So I'll hand that to Dave Pendarvis, who is with me here in Munich, regarding reimbursement CMS.","David Pendarvis - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for the question. We're pleased with the CMS proposal. As Mick mentioned earlier, we think it's going to be overall good for the industry. And the first thing I would point to there is that they've moved to the clearing price, establishing the reimbursed amount. And that in and of itself is something the industry has been asking for quite a while, and so that should be strong. There is some discussion in there about lead product and categories. And so it remains to be seen how much of that will come out in the final rule and how much of it will be handled by sub-regulatory guidance down the road, but we do think that if sleep is a separate category from oxygen, that's a good thing for our sleep business. Remains to be seen whether non-invasive ventilation would be a different category or combined with others. So that will have to come out in the final rules and guidance thereafter, but we do think that our focus on sleep overall is a good thing.","And as a overall measure, what we really like about this is that the industry has been talking for some time about the need for change in the way this competitive bidding structure was operating. And CMS has responded. You have to give them credit for listening to the industry, working with the industry, and not just us but others throughout the whole industry have been participating in this process. So we have to give credit where credit is due.","Now, there's still some things we'd like to see on top of that. I mean, the fact that in some of the non-competitive bid areas, a town like Niland, California, which is near the Salton Sea, or a small county that's outside of Chicago is viewed as no uplift, not really considered a rural area, we think that's an area where CMS ought to step in and provide some additional reimbursement. So there's always room to improve. The industry is still looking for improvement here, but overall, we think it's a good positive development.","Thomas Yeo - Goldman Sachs Australia Pty Ltd.","Yeah. Thanks. And just a follow-up and kind of to switch topic as well, what's the progress being made in COPD? We have seen some supportive studies lately. Could you outline which of those are underway today and what you expect to be the most impactful and when do you expect them to read out?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. I'll hand that question to Rob Douglas, our Chief Operating Officer, who is in San Diego.","Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Thomas. So, yeah, there's been quite a few studies on and some of them were actually previewed in posters at ATS, but there were studies really looking at various sectors. The main one we've been talking about is the HOT-HMV study, which showed the benefit in terms of keeping people out of hospital by adding NIV on to oxygen. And then, as Mick mentioned earlier, that really had an economic study done to it, which showed a very significant cost reduction per quality of life here that you almost never see in treatment. So that should be really powerful.","Other studies are ongoing. There were studies looking at really getting at identifying, which patients are going to benefit more and understanding how to get out and predict the patients that have high CO2 levels, which is really the patients that benefit the most from the addition of NIV treatment. It's a very fertile ground. Around the world, standards of care are still quite varied and there's a lot of opportunity for those to be normalized as these studies bear fruit, both from the benefit of oxygen, integrated or not with NIV therapy and then models of using them. There's a lot coming.","Thomas Yeo - Goldman Sachs Australia Pty Ltd.","Thank you.","Operator","Sean Laaman with Morgan Stanley is on the line with a question.","Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.","Thank you, and good morning or good evening. I have a question on AllCall connect. I'm just wondering, Mick, if you give us a bit of granularity around that. Like, how broadly is it adopted? How much of a driver in a broad \u2013 sort of the good resupply number as a start?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. So, Sean, look, there's a portfolio of offerings in resupply. Within the Brightree Core, we had Brightree Connect and then we had our ResMed ReSupply model and then we had added onto that, which are both sort of automated, if you like, cloud-based AI type algorithms, ML type algorithms to contact patients. In addition, we added AllCall Connect, which is live humans as well as automated levels. And so, now we've got a portfolio of live and automated calling for people.","And I'll go back to my comments a little earlier that it's really about finding the best solution for a patient as they need it. And AllCall is really just part of that portfolio. We don't break out how much is from the Brightree, how much is from the ResMed, which is for users of ResMed beyond just Brightree users, and how much is part of the AllCall. But what I can tell you is they're really well-coordinated on the back end and there's a skin, so it's pretty much invisible to the frontend users and patients won't actually know what back end system they're using. The others say, wow, ResMed is reaching out to me or we may even do it on behalf of DME A or B (00:56:01) and reach out to the patient.","So, really, we're seeing a good growth across the portfolio of those.","Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.","Okay. Thanks, Mick. And just one quick follow-up just to check a number. On HEALTHCAREfirst, there was no contribution in the current fiscal year and there was about trailing 12-month revenue of $30 million, if I heard correctly.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. The trailing 12-month is around $29 million, $30 million. Brett, no real material contribution, correct?","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","No, we closed that sales (00:56:29) in the quarter and, Sean, I think, it was on 9th of July. So just had it for three weeks. So, certainly no impact in Q4, but obviously that's a \u2013 we think it's a really good growth area. So we've got good expectations at both the Brightree and the HEALTHCAREfirst offerings in that space.","Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.","Perfect. Thank you, gentlemen.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks, Sean.","Operator","John Deakin-Bell from Citigroup is online with a question.","John Deakin-Bell - Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd.","Good morning. I was just wanting to turn to Brightree for a moment. Could you just give us a sense \u2013 obviously, strong growth numbers, a sense of the growth between new customers and existing customers spending more money with you? What's the rough split?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. John, we don't go into that much detail on it. Jim, who runs our global sleep business probably has a little more color that he can provide qualitatively. We're not sort of going to breakout per user per month type growth that we have as customers grow and\/or take share and\/or acquire other customers. But, Jim, do you want to provide any further color on Brightree and how we achieved those strong 12% growth numbers in the quarter.","James Hollingshead - ResMed, Inc.","Sure, Mick, and thanks, John, for your question. Without getting into granular detail, we're getting growth on both sides of that equation and not just out of Brightree, of course, but out of other offerings in the SaaS portfolio. So it's pretty balanced growth.","John Deakin-Bell - Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd.","Okay. Thank you. Maybe just a change text, you called out early in the call the prevalence of sleep apnea. What was the actual severe number? Do you have that separately because obviously it's quite important?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. Look, I just want to do some \u2013 I actually don't know if that study does break it out. And if so, we're really happy to share that with you, John. But what doctors call mild is an AHI or suffocation index of 5 to 14. So with 14, that's approximately just over every four minutes of sleep that you suffocate for 10-plus, minimum of 10 seconds. Every four minutes of sleep, 10 seconds suffocation, that's called mild.","And if you talk about moderate, what doctors call moderate sleep apnea, which is an AHI of 15 to 30, and you're pushing 30, that's every two minutes now, you're suffocating for 10 seconds or more. That's called moderate. So, I think there's a difference between what doctors call moderate sleep apnea. And if you talk to a patient, say, hey, you're suffocating every two minutes, but don't worry, your doctor says that's moderate, but you're suffocating for every four minutes, but don't worry, your doctor says that's mild. This is what it is.","To be called severe, you have to suffocate every \u2013 less than every 120 seconds of sleep for more than 10 seconds. You're starting to get close to 10% of your time in suffocation mode. So I don't know, look, I'm a mild sleep apnea sufferer and I use this device. Obviously, I'm passionate it as CEO of the company. But many people with mild sleep apnea are seeking treatment and don't want to suffocate. You don't wait till you really overweight before you start exercising, why would you wait until your suffocation index is every 110 seconds.","But anyway, I'll hand over to Rob, if he wants to handle any further information about the severe element of that study.","Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. Just one other bit of information, John, the reimbursement programs around the world would \u2013 may distinguish between mild and severe. And so in many U.S. models, you need a comorbidity and mild to get reimbursed, which is most people do have comorbidity, so it's very common, or just having it moderate or mild get you into it. So that's really why we focus more on the difference between mild and moderate versus severe.","John Deakin-Bell - Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd.","Understand. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks for your questions, John.","Operator","We have Andrew Goodsall from MST Marquee on the line with a question.","Andrew Goodsall - MST Financial Services Pty Ltd.","Thanks very much. Lucky, last, I think quickly on ASP, I know you've sort of talked about in masks business a bit, but you did talk about ASP declines. Was that regionally based, was it a European or U.S. feature?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. We don't get into details on ASP, but it was pretty steady changes globally, Andrew. So, nothing really different from the last eight to 12 quarters we've been talking about this.","Andrew Goodsall - MST Financial Services Pty Ltd.","Okay.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Pretty steady.","Andrew Goodsall - MST Financial Services Pty Ltd.","Okay. So, no particular region where you're feeling competitive or other sort of changing pressure?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","No, look, we've been going through a lot of details about U.S. reimbursement, how \u2013 actually, there were some really good news on the competitive bidding front in terms of where they came to in this quarter. So I think we're seeing pretty steady levels of ASPs in terms of those decline rates being steady over the last eight, 12 quarters. There's really nothing dramatic happening there.","Andrew Goodsall - MST Financial Services Pty Ltd.","And a quick on Narval. In France, we're hearing that's doing quite well. Just I guess any color on how that's going?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. Look, I'm here over with the European team and I got to tell you, there's a lot of passion for our 3D printed medical device there with the Narval. I mean it's just a fantastic mandibular repositioning device and the reimbursement actually increased by over 30% in France with some recent changes for Narval. And it's a really well-run operation We have the 3D printers in Lyon. We have incredibly strong sales team and really aware sleep and dental sleep specialists and good relationships between the pulmonary and dental sleep medicine specialists.","So, yeah, we are seeing strong growth. We don't break that out, obviously, by the numbers there, Andrew, but if you're doing your channel checks, I think you'll find that ResMed is not only the number one supplier of CPAP, APAP and bilevel for sleep apnea. They're also the number one supplier of MRDs for treatment of sleep apnea within France.","Andrew Goodsall - MST Financial Services Pty Ltd.","Perfect. Thank you very much.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks Andrew.","Operator","We are now at the one hour mark. So I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Mick Ferrell.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Tim.

Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from those forward-looking statements.

There are also other members of the management team present that will be available to answer questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Mick Farrell. Mick, please go ahead.","Michael Farrell","Thanks, Sherry, and thank you all for joining us today. As usual, I will review the highlights of our fiscal Q2 and then I will hand the call over to Brett to go through the quarter in some more detail.","So first the financial summary. Global revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 grew by 2% year-on-year to $384 million, that\u2019s up 1% on a constant currency basis. Europe, Asia, and rest of the world headline revenue increased 8% for the quarter to $178 million, which is 5% on constant currency terms. Americas revenue decreased by 2% to $207 million. We believe the long-term global growth rate for our industry remains in the 6% to 8% range.","Net income for the quarter increased 11% to $86.6 million. GAAP EPS increased by 13% to $0.60 for the quarter, while hybrid EPS which includes the amortization of intangibles, was $0.61 per share. This bottom line result demonstrates strong global operating performance from the global team.","Let me start with the Americas, where clearly we had some external headwinds and where we were not satisfied with the results. The Americas had a challenging quarter with overall sales decreasing by approximately $5 million year-on-year, which was 2% on a year-on-year basis. It's interesting to note that it was approximately $5 million increase on a quarter-to-quarter basis which is a 3% sequential quarter-to-quarter increase.","Sales revenues from masks were flat year-on-year while flow generator sales revenue declined by 5% year-on-year. It's also of note that we were up against some very tough prior year comparisons in both those categories. Float generators were up 16% in Q2 fiscal 2013 and masks were also up 16% 12 months ago in Q2 fiscal '13. However, the result was not solely a reflection on these comparables. I will walk through the two key areas of impact in this regard. Firstly, competitive bidding, and secondly, competitor actions in the marketplace.","So first, on competitive bidding. U.S. market dynamics were challenging in Q2 and remain challenging today as we have been discussing. The distraction we saw in Q1 continued throughout Q2. As we had indicated it would on our core. And our customers have grappled with the U.S. reimbursement changes that went into effect in July for Medicare patients, which is a CB2. As we discussed on our Q1 call, winners and losers of competitive bids adjusted their market strategies and structures. And this temporary distraction caused a net reduction in sales volumes for the quarter. Patients are navigating their way through the new HME landscape while HME providers simultaneously try to ensure that patients they are picking up meet their reimbursement and documentation criteria. This occasionally causes what are so called orphan patients, who are not able to be serviced by the old or a new HME. And this has reduced net volumes for the quarter.","This also impacts new patients as winning HMEs establish a presence in territories through subcontracts, acquisitions of assets or Greenfield [indiscernible]. As we work through these challenges with our U.S. HME customers, we continue to believe that this interruption in volume is temporary. Customers are developing new business models and footprints and finding ways to serve both new and existing patient needs. While it is hard to predict the future precisely, we continue to think that there is a number of months before the market stabilizes. The key signs we see indicating that this the case are that the distraction is beginning to recede in some leading indicators in the U.S. market.","First, we continue to see new patient growth in the U.S., in PCP visits, in elective procedures, and in referrals to sleep physicians. Second, many of our U.S. customers are picking up existing and new patient volume through asset purchases and referral pathway development. The other key area I want to walk through in regard to competitor actions. We saw impact from our competitors in Q2 in addition to the external market conditions. On the product introduction front we saw strong competition in both the nasal mask and the nasal pillows categories. Product introductions from our major competitors have reversed some portion of the share gains that we have had in these two categories over the last number of years.","Competitive pricing, particularly in the CPAP category, also influenced our results. And we are establishing appropriate value pricing premiums to ensure that we get back to taking share in that category too.","Let me go into a little more detail on product introduction. We are executing to our plan that we talked about in our Q1 call to bring a strong product pipeline to the market. This product innovation dynamic is returned to the competitive product cycle that we have demonstrated for over two decades in this market. We are confident that our new product offerings and our pipeline can address this challenge. It is a game we have played before and we know that we can win. Last quarter we said we would launch three new masks throughout this fiscal year and we are executing well against that plan.","At the beginning of last week, we launched the AirFit P10, our latest nasal pillows system. This is our quietest mask to date. It is 50% quieter than the market category leader, our existing Swift FX. The AirFit P10 is literally whisper quiet. It is also 50% lighter, weighing in at just 1.6 ounces. And finally, its revolutionary vent technology which we call quite air, gently diffuses the air, minimizing disturbance to both the patient and their bed partner. After only two weeks in the market, the AirFit P10 has received many positive reviews in social media, on the online stores, and from patients who have tried the product with our U.S. HME customers. I personally have been using this product for the last two months and I got to tell you, it's the most comfortable, quite and effective mask that we have brought to the market.","Continuing with our announced product innovation plan, we will launch two additional new masks during the balance of fiscal year 2014. We expect them to similarly be well received by patients, providers, physicians and patients. Let me also go into a little more detail on pricing. Clearly the pricing environment is very competitive in the Americas, pricing declines impacted our results across the board in the U.S., but especially in our CPAP product category. Going forward we will continue to evaluate our price premium, category by category, segment by segment. And we will ensure that we are appropriately positioned reflecting both the current market realities and the superior value proposition that our products deliver to our patients and to our providers.","Importantly, I want to let you know that for competitive reasons, we are not going to announce the details of our average selling price changes. Whether global or by region, or by product segment. The reason behind this is that one, other market participants do not publically reveal their amount of detail, and two, we are concerned this information may affect us in the marketplace. In short, we don\u2019t believe doing so is in the best interests of our shareholders.","Finally, on the Americas and before turning to Europe, Asia and rest of the world, there are a few bright spots in the Americas results for Q2. We saw good growth of our Adapt SV and Stellar devices, reflecting our emerging growth in both cardiology and respiratory care markets. The Stellar received regulatory approval in Brazil during the quarter and we are encouraged about the prospect for respiratory care in the Latin America market over the coming years.","The VPAP COPD, which is the first and only device with an FDA clearance with an indication for use to treat COPD, is gaining traction in respiratory care. And finally, accessories sales for both flow generators and for masks was solid, reflecting growth in the installed base. And the fact that many of our customers despite competitive bidding continued to drive an increased their focus on patient replenishment programs.","So now I am going to switch to on our review on Europe where we saw good growth with solid performances in many countries, including European dealer network, the U.K., Switzerland and both our German dealer business as well as our German homecare business. Two of the main drivers of growth in Europe were our respiratory care and cardiology markers, including in particular the products, Stellar and AutoSet CS, which both produced good growth. It's interesting to note that in Europe plus Asia and rest of the world, our flow generator growth year-on-year was plus 6% constant currency. We also contribution from our recently released mask products in that region, the Quattro Air and the Nano.","In France, the previously announced telemonitoring requirements went into effect October the first, right at the start of the quarter. We believe this development started to help and will help grow our share in flow generators in the region. The emerging focus on healthcare informatics in France and throughout Europe as it grows, plays to ResMed's strength. We are seeing interesting in EasyCare Online solutions both within France but now outside France in various parts of Europe, where customer's recognize EasyCare Online is efficient and provides adherence benefits and high quality. It also has incredibly strong and robust data protection that is increasingly important for these markets and also for our global customers.","We continued to expand our reach in Eastern Europe during the quarter, building on our recent acquisition that we announced in Q1 in Poland. In December we acquired Unimedis, which is a Czech Republic based distributor of sleep disordered-breathing and respiratory care products. The Czech Republic has a population of over 10 million and its healthcare spending ranks just below the general European level and has more physicians per capita than most other EU countries. This acquisition allows us to drive market growth in emerging markets opportunity in Eastern Europe, in Poland and now Czech Republic across sleep disordered-breathing, homecare ventilation, as well as cardiology markets.","In the Asia Pacific region, sales growth was light. Although we were encouraged by progress in our cardiology sales in Japan, overall sales to our Japanese customers were not as strong as we would have hoped. We expect Asia-Pac to be stronger in the second half of this fiscal year as patient flow remains solid in the region overall. And we are partnering with our customers in the regions to do so. We saw good growth in China in Q2 and we remain confident in the long-term opportunities of emerging markets in Asia-Pac, as well as the more established markets in the region of Japan and Australia, New Zealand.","Turning to R&D. In addition to the patient interface product development that we mentioned on our press release earlier in the call, we are also making good progress in our respiratory care pipeline. We are on track to launch our next generation respiratory care platform in Europe during this fiscal year, with a subsequent launch into the Americas and then into Asia-Pac. We have a strong R&D team focused on bringing meaningful innovation to the market and the benefit to patients, physicians and providers in this space. It includes the diseases of COPD, neuromuscular disease, obesity hypoventilation syndrome and beyond. We are very encouraged by the results of the first patients who are being put on this next generation respiratory care product and we will go into further detail in the coming quarters.","In short, horizon two of our three horizons growth strategy, which is this respiratory care market, is lining up for growth in Europe and then the Americas and Asia-Pac. Watch this space.","Let me close with this. We remain focused on the long run. Our markets remain underpenetrated and absolutions provide symptomatic relief of patients while slowing the progression of key chronic diseases, while saving money to the entire healthcare system. We have the right solutions, we have the right people, and we have the right strategy to succeed. We are confident that we will continue to do so. Now I will turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer. Brett, over to you.","Brett Sandercock","Great. Thanks, Mick. Revenue for the December quarter was $394.3 million, an increase of 2% over the prior year quarter. While in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 1%. Income from operations for the quarter was $105 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter, and net income for the quarter was $86.6 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share were $0.60 for the quarter, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter.","Gross margin for the December quarter was 64.7%, an increase of 290 basis points compared to Q2 FY '13. On a year-on-year basis, our gross margin benefited from manufacturing improvements, favorable product mix and favorable currency movements, partially offset by ASP declines. Looking forward, we expect our gross margin to be in the range of 63% to 65%, assuming current exchange rates. Additionally, we continue to execute on initiatives targeted at improving our global manufacturing, supply chain and logistics cost structure.","SG&A expenses for the quarter were $111.7 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter. While in constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 5%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 29.1% compared to the year ago figure of 28.6%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the vicinity of 29% for fiscal year 2014.","R&D expenses for the quarter were $29.5 million, a decrease of 3% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, R&D expenses increased by 5%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 7.7% compared to the year ago figure of 8.1%. Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 8% for fiscal year 2014. This reflects an ongoing commitment to investing in our product pipeline, tempered somewhat by the depreciation of the Australian dollar as the majority of our research and development is undertaken in Australia.","Amortization of acquired intangibles was $2.5 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $10.7 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.9%, compared to the prior year quarter effective tax rate of 20.8%. We currently estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2014 will also be in the vicinity of 21%.","Turning now to revenue in more detail. Overall, sales in the Americas were $206.6 million, a decrease of 2% over the prior year quarter. While sales outside the Americas totaled $177.7 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas increased by 5% over the prior year quarter.","Breaking out revenue between product segments. In the Americas, flow generator sales were $88.7 million, a decrease of 5% over the prior year quarter, while masks and other sales were $117.9 million, consistent with the prior year quarter. For revenue outside the Americas, flow generator sales were $118.3 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter, and in constant currency terms an increase of 6%. Masks and other sales were $59.4 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms an increase of 4%. Globally in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 1%, while masks and other also increased by 1%.","Cash flow from operations was $84.2 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $19.7 million, while depreciation and amortization for the December quarter totaled $18.6 million.","Our share buyback continues to play a major role in our capital management program. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for consideration of $74 million. At the end of December, we had approximately 2.6 million shares remaining under our authorized buyback program. In addition to the share buyback, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, consistent with our previously advised dividend policy.","Our balance sheet remains very strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $537 million, and at December 31, total assets stood at $2.3 billion and net equity was $1.6 billion.","I'll now hand the call back to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Joanne Wuensch of BMO Capital Markets.","Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets","I actually have two. The first one happens to be, how much of the foreign exchange uptick year-over-year is associated with foreign exchange.","Michael Farrell","Brett?","Brett Sandercock","How much of the earnings?","Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets","Well, no. I mean your -- the gross margin was up well over 200 basis points year-over-year, almost 300 basis points. And I am just wondering how much of that is from foreign exchange.","Brett Sandercock","On the margin, yes. So on the year-over-year, Joanne, on the FX was about 140 basis points of that.","Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets","And that\u2019s mostly related to the Aussie, the Australian dollar?","Brett Sandercock","Yes. Predominantly. We have a -- there is a little bit of benefit from the euro but that\u2019s predominantly the Aussie dollar weakening.","Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets","Okay. And then I understand why you don\u2019t want to talk about your pricing paradigm, but can you step back and talk a little bit about what's happening to pricing in the industry?","Michael Farrell","Yes, Joanne, I mean they are pretty much the same thing asking what we are doing in pricing, what the industry is doing with pricing. Given that we want to maintain our appropriate value premium over our competitors but ensure that we are competitively priced to make sure we get back to taking share. So specifically within the U.S. market, we are looking at our value premiums and ensuring, based upon the market dynamics that are going on throughout Q1 and as we saw in Q2, to make sure that we get back to taking share across the segments. So we are looking at pricing on a category by category basis and SKU by SKU basis and the segment by segment basis, based upon how the customers look at it. But to qualify that, whether by industry or by us, we would sort be parallel and it doesn\u2019t make sense to break out either. It's just not in the interests of our shareholders to do so.","Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets","Okay. Just [indiscernible] a little bit on that. One of the things I am seeing from other companies that have products with competitive bidding is that the other companies around them are dropping prices that they need to respond to. I am going to assume that\u2019s what's going on in your world also.","Michael Farrell","Look, Joanne, we are the value premium leader. We don\u2019t generally in our industry move down ahead of the curve. So I think that\u2019s a safe assumption to say and, yeah, it's safe to say that we are more responding on the downward approach and trying to find and elicit the appropriate premium to maintain across each of the SKUs. And we have got pretty good signs behind this and it's really just an adjustment of external dynamics with our internal dynamics to make sure that all makes sense. But the premise does sound like what we have been executing to.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from David Clair of Piper Jaffray.","David Clair - Piper Jaffray","So I was just hoping, Mick, in the commentary you talked about a moderating impact to competitive bidding in the quarter. Can you just give us some additional thoughts there? And I know you talked about 6% to 8% global growth, do you think that U.S. grew as a market or did it decline? And when do you think that we should expect ResMed to kind of rebound and put up positive growth in the U.S.","Michael Farrell","Yes. I mean clearly in the U.S. market, we talk about 6% to 8% as the long-term growth of this industry. Clearly there is some impacts through competitive biddings. We talked about the patients who get moving from HME A to HME B, you know these last 90 days, that will have some impact on the growth. We don\u2019t have it down to the decimal point, and to your point, it doesn\u2019t make sense to go there. But the leading indicators that we see that -- and we have a lot of data on this and some of it's public. And we have shared that on our latest investor presentation that patient flow to primary care physicians are picking up. Patient flow for elective procedures which are analogous to referrals for sleep-disordered breathing, such as hip and knee replacements, are starting to move up.","Referrals specifically in our industry to sleep-disordered breathing specialists are starting to move up on the diagnostic front. So all these leading indicators are macro and generally public, and allow us to talk about them. We have many other indicators that we have customer by customer as they buy assets of patients. So they are starting to monetize that asset. Getting the pipe work together. Working with patients to ensure that pipe works is of the standard of the acquiring HME versus the HME who sold the asset, and ensuring that they can get that replenishment revenue and get the patients back on the right care that\u2019s needed to happening there. So they are the sort of what we would call, David, the green shoots of growth that we are seeing on these leading indicators to make us believe that the impact of competitive bidding is beginning to moderate in the market. We are not done but there are green shoots starting to appear which, as we look forward the next 12, 24, 36 months, we see a whole lot of opportunity.","The change that we often get asked that is, will be it a one month or a three month, or a five month. We don\u2019t know exactly. And so we say it's a number of months for those green shoots to start turning to moderation of the entire market and for us to, as an industry, get back on the growth track. And we think we are well positioned to do that, we are partnering with our HME customers to do that.","David Clair - Piper Jaffray","Okay. Thank you for that. And then on the pipeline, I mean obviously you guys have a lot of stuff going on there. Can you give us a sneak peek at Medtrade? Should we expect some material product launches coming up here?","Michael Farrell","So David, we don\u2019t give sneak peeks on any trade show. Not one for Medtrade or about trade shows in medicare in Europe or elsewhere. But I will recite what I said, that we have three amazing new masks coming this fiscal year. The first one is out there, the AirFit P10. The other two masks will go on other categories and they are very exciting. Can't give you any details, David. I can tell you that we have a respiratory care next generation platform that has had its first patient on therapy already in Europe, and we are excited about a full product launch of that product before the end of the fiscal year. That I can share with you. But no details on any of the trade shows throughout 2014, David.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ben Andrew of William Blair.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company","So let\u2019s see. If we think about volumes and new patients are growing and overall domestic CPAP was down 5%, in the lower side masks were flat. That has to suggest that existing patient volume on masks was -- volume was either negative or modestly positive if price is probably worse this quarter than it had been. Is that a fair way to characterize it?","Michael Farrell","Well, Ben, you used a number of different parameters there. What we saw and I think what we said, is that in the quarter there were some volume impacts from competitive bidding. I mean that\u2019s clear. As a patient is moving from HME A to HME B and that asset is picked up, you know if they were on a replenishment cycle that was every three months and then they are changing from HME A to HME B over a three months or a six months process, that maybe one of those masks in terms of the pickup or one of those cushions in terms of the pickup is left out. So that temporary distraction is real for competitive bidding and will have an impact on market price within a particular period of time, for a particular DME.","But to ramp that up over the 4000 to 6000 plus HMEs out there in the U.S. marketplace, it's really difficult to know exactly, you know precisely pick where that volume change is occurring. But the leading indicators of patient flow into the channel are there. The analogy that we used at JPMorgan last week is it's like you have got a garden hose, where the garden hose is the flow of patients is the water, and the garden hose has got a crimp in it, which is this competitive bidding. And it's a [indiscernible] bend in the curve of the pipe. And we starting to work with our HMEs to uncrimp or unkink that garden hose and the water is starting to flow. So the patients are starting to come through the channel and they will get to an HME. The new HMEs that are establishing in the areas where they have won have to establish referral pathways and pick up those patients. And even established HMEs have to ensure those referral pathways are solid.","But as we look to the long-term, we see getting back to that 6% to 8% market growth rate as something we will absolutely do. This is not a structural change, it's a temporary change that will allow us to help the customers and get us back to growth.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company","Mick, I guess my second question would be, as the HME customers obviously have seen their profitability tighten, they are clearly coming back at you guys and asking for concessions. You competitors are responding, you are not going to respond to them more aggressively, you are not going to give us pricing information anymore which I understand. But shouldn\u2019t we assume that this is a more permanent dynamic on the pricing side and that the volume as they come back over the course of time with the new patient flow that the structural growth rate has to be lower than it was before.","Michael Farrell","So I will hand to Jim to go in a little more detail on the profitability of the HME customers and then I will come back to talk to your point about long-term and why I think we can get back to the 6% to 8%. Jim?","James Hollingshead","Hi, Ben. I don\u2019t think the market dynamic that we are seeing now is a permanent market dynamic. I mean that\u2019s your question. I think what we are seeing, we have been talking internally about how to describe what we see going in the market, and the metaphor that we keep coming back to is, it's like a thunderstorm has passed through town. The storm is through but there is cleanup, right. And so -- and talking to our customers what we are seeing, we have talked about in this call before, is the things that our customers have to go through with doing subcontracting, and a lot of the larger customers are doing acquisitions, and as they do that they are buying a -- they are either buying a business whole or they are buying a list of patients. They then have to figure out how to get those patients in their replenishment systems and so on.","There is a lot of logistics and administration that is working its way through the HME world right now. There is pricing pressure, there is clearly pricing pressure. And as Joann said earlier, you have seen that in all the competitive bid markets. But I don\u2019t think there is any reason to believe that what's going on right now is just sort of a new normal that will last forever. I think the market is working its way through what we have previously described as distraction. And I think over the next several months, and it makes very difficult to know how long that timeframe is, but over the next several months we will see it stabilize. So, no, I don\u2019t think this kind of challenge is a permanent challenge. I think we have to work our way through it as an industry and we are working with our customers to do that.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company","Right. And, Jim, what I was trying to get at is that I think the value proposition for a user in a lower reimbursement environment to the HME is more compressed and so they are going to be more price sensitive to the higher end products or to any product, and less willing to step up on the mix side which is a structural change versus the ability you have had in the past to keep moving that mix a little bit higher and holding price as a result. That\u2019s what I am concerned about.","Michael Farrell","I think the mix dynamic is still there, Ben, and here is why. The CPAP to APAP mix shift is still going even despite the compounding of the two effects. We talked about competitive bidding and the volume impact, the competitors actions and the pricing impact. So all that hit at once. Yet, still, we see some growth there for us. And as we are partnering with our customers to try and understand how to make that happen, the move to HST is implied. And we said somewhere between 30% to 35% of the tests, the diagnostic tests done in the U.S. were home sleep tests in the last 12 months. That will get to 40% within the next nine months. And it will then go to 45% and up and beyond. And we have said it many times, that the analogy is some markets in Europe, where you are talking about 70%-80% of the test being home sleep tests. This is sort of endpoint.","That drives volume into the market. It allows more patients to get into the diagnostic channel who man not have gone to a PSG. This is all being driven by the insurance companies and payers but it has a benefit of providing more volume as a long-term. And the positive mix-shift, to your point on pricing, that allows that CPAP to APAP mix shift to happen. Additionally, for ResMed, as we start to launch more of our respiratory care products that we are launching in Europe and also launching in the Americas over the coming year or two, will have a mix shift for ResMed that allows us to move to higher end products. Where ASPs are just higher and there is mix shift from segment A to segment B that is a positive tailwind for us. So that\u2019s why as we look at the market and as we look at our opportunities, we think a 6% to 8% market growth rate makes a whole lot of sense.","But going from the global macro, I will drill back down to your question which is on the Americas. Jim, do you have any more to add there?","James Hollingshead","Yes, thank you, Mick. I just wanted to add one thing to that, Ben, which is, what we are seeing is actually what we have anticipated happening in the market. Which is as HMEs are working through the challenges that reimbursement cuts have posed for them, there is pricing pressure and that makes sense to us, but they are also looking for more efficiencies in their business. And so they are looking to a couple of things. Everybody wants to drive up their compliance rate and that actually works in our favor because our products have higher compliance, both on flow gen and on mask.","The other thing they are looking to do is to get each patient compliant and then to get them into replenishment programs in the cost effective way. So that\u2019s why you have been seeing us focus on some of the [indiscernible] You have seen us improve EasyCare Online platform. You have seen us with our [indiscernible] subsidiary driving some automation into the business process. And you will continue to see things like that from us over the coming months. We are working with our customers -- you know our products still get a premium. They get a premium because they are better products but we continue to enjoy good position with the customers because we are helping to drive efficiencies into their business. And so we are very bullish on where we are taking our offering in that direction.","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question is from Matthew Prior of Bank of America.","Matthew Prior - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a question in regards to the exit trajectory from the quarter. Mick, you spoke about, obviously, this being a question of months not necessarily quarters, in terms of when we see those green shoots having benefit. But in terms of the three months of the quarter can you talk us through, given the last six months of seeing the impact of competitive bidding, was September the darkest month of the six? To give us a sense as to how that line would look over the six months.","Michael Farrell","Yes. To determine the exact trajectory of this combines a whole bunch of factors across 4000 to 6000 customers, and as they look at their patient referrals in and as they look at subcontracting, as they look at building facilities, and as they look at developing new organic referral pathway. So to pick down exactly where the nadir is and when the curve starts to move up, is very difficult. And that\u2019s why we are here saying, look, it's going to be a number of months for us to get through this and we don\u2019t know exactly how many. You know by customer of course you have all the dynamics going on, but if customer A buys customer B than one has a 100 percent growth, they are doubling, and the other is going to zero. Yet, the volume remains the same. So putting that across the whole weighted average of our customers is a difficult equation.","And then you are predicting other market dynamics as to who is going to be better at developing referral models to cardiologists or to new pulmonary referral sources, or within the U.S. market as the development of the accountable care organizations or ACOs, where hospitals and primary care physicians are now working together with shared costs. You have other dynamics of cost and volume that go in on a market-by-market basis. So predicting exactly where the bottom is and how many months it is to see the trajectory moving up is very, very difficult, Matt.","Matthew Prior - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, I guess to clarify, Mick, what I was really after was, do you think that second quarter is the worst that we have seen in terms of all the dynamics going on around price and competitive effect and irrationality out in the marketplace, and behavior of DMEs and disruption of patients finding equipment? Is it just a question of the rate of exit in terms of things get better from here or given the dynamics are still in flux, could we see, obviously, another quarter of weaker performance than what we have seen? I am trying to get a sense as to the dynamics you have seen, how long have they been going on to the extent of could things get worse from here, or is it just a question of the rate of trajectory out of the quarter?","Michael Farrell","Yes. You listed about 15 things which we are trying to predict all of them as we go forward. And to say precisely on all those 15, we don\u2019t know. Here is the thing we can control. We can control our new product launch. And we just launched the AirFit P10, which in its first two weeks if flying off the shelf. We will be launching two other new masks between here and June 30 that similarly have huge opportunities for value generation. For patients, providers and for physicians. And we are also launching, I would call a leapfrog next-generation respiratory care system that I might ask Geoff Neilson to talk about some of its value as we have started to get our first patients on therapy in Europe for.","So we know that we have the pipeline to start delivering and turning to strong growth here, and to get back to share gain in some of the categories like nasal masks and nasal pillows. And then also in the CPAP category with regard to appropriate pricing. So we have got the plan of action ready to go. And I will go back to what I said in the early notes when I said at the start of your question, Matt, which is, it's a number of months for us to get back to that growth trajectory but there a number of bits in play. Some are macroeconomic that we can't control. Some are directly within our control, like delivery of products. And we have done a pretty darn good job over the last two plus decades on that and we plan to execute on that over the coming 6-12 and beyond.","Matthew Prior - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, Mick, understood. My second question is in regards to France. You know given the changes to reimbursement there and obviously informatics. Have you seen anything in terms of the second quarter around mask consumption relating to those informatics in France in terms of that shift that has occurred?","Michael Farrell","I will hand to Rob Douglas to talk about that France and the HI.","Robert Douglas","Yes, thanks, Mick. Matt, the French business has been going well. We are encouraged by the performance of our system, our online system and how we are picking up all the patient numbers and managing the data. And also compiling with all of the privacy rules and that type of thing, which are quite complex throughout Europe. We think that\u2019s performing well. In terms of, other sort of structural changes in terms of mask usage and things like that, it's still too early days to make a comment on that. But we are pretty happy with the way the French business has been going in the light of those changes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Low of Deutsche Bank.","David Low - Deutsche Bank","If we just switch in to the rest of world [indiscernible] right there. Mick, you began talking about that you think market growth could be 6% to 8% again. Help us understand why rest of world growth, constant-currency growth, I think is 5% versus that 6% to 8%. What's holding back that business or perhaps the market outside the U.S. at the moment?","Michael Farrell","Yes. So, David, the line was cutting in and out a little bit, but you were asking about Europe, Asia and rest of the world growth and who to get that to the 6% to 8% range. Look there are many impacts that are -- I mean counties obviously when we say Europe, Asia and rest of the world. We are talking about the other 99 countries we are in other than the U.S. But within those markets there are many different market dynamics. We talked in some detail in the call earlier about Japan being soft in Q1 and also being soft in Q2. We think there is some tailwind for us potentially in Asia Pac as we look to Q3 and Q4. So that has an opportunity to get us back to stronger growth rates and we think that can help get the rest of world number to where it should be.","Look, I got to tell you, I was incredibly impressed by our European team. We don\u2019t breakdown the particular countries within the Europe or the particular countries within Asia Pac. But there was some really good performances, particularly in Northern Europe, within our teams of partnering with insurance systems. Understanding the total value of the healthcare system and how ResMed takes patients with providers. Takes patients out a hospital, puts them in the home, and treats them more cost effectively and saves money for the healthcare system. And when you have socialized medicine and governments involved in healthcare, as you do in northern Europe, they'd very heavily involved in analyzing all that. So we have a lot of partnerships in the U.K. and Northern Europe that are moving us down that road and we are very excited about it. So as we look to that long-term and talk about 6% to 8% market growth. And do I feel confident that our Europe, Asia, and rest of the world group can achieve in that range, I absolutely do.","We have got the right strategy, we have got the right people, and they are starting to execute on it. There will always be some lumpiness from quarter-to-quarter but as you look forward over 4, 8, 12 quarters, we can absolutely see our growth being very solid within that range.","David Low - Deutsche Bank","Great, thanks very much. And just coming back to the U.S. Trends in the mix shift through auto setting devices and then bilevel devices. I know you have mentioned it particularly the gross margin, but just wondering with this move to competitive bidding and DMEs being under pressure, are you seeing any sort of pushback towards a basic CPAP where in the past you were seeing a trend to auto setting devices?","Michael Farrell","Look, this is all being driven by the payer and insurance companies, right. When they move the market from PSG to HST, they are driving it. And so when the payer establishes a home sleep testing protocol, it's going to require that the device that goes out is an APAP. Because otherwise you have to bring them back into the lab to get them titrated. So payers are generally driving the HST shift. They are also then driving the APAP shift. So that\u2019s just a fact. It's going to happen. The bilevel opportunity is really about a broader opportunity which is about non-invasive ventilation. And the idea there is bringing something that\u2019s been pretty well established in Western Europe, which is using non-invasive ventilation to treat patients with COPD, neuromuscular disease and obesity hypoventilation syndrome, to bring more of that and to grow that category within the Americas market.","I am going to ask Geoff Neilson to talk a little bit about our global respiratory care business and how that might apply to allow us to get some of that positive mix shift in our ventilators.","Geoff Neilson","So if we take COPD as an example, you know bilevel treatment for COPD in Europe is well established, particularly in Germany and ResMed is competing well in that space. There is a huge opportunity for COPD globally, including in the U.S. But it's somewhat muted by the reimbursement pathways to actually get patients on to therapy. However, on the other side, that has created some larger opportunities around higher-end ventilation products for COPD. And that\u2019s a segment that should really be growing quickly. So that brings me into the our ventilation platform, which can be positioned for COPD in the U.S. and also globally across the range for life-support and ventilation. So our Astro platform, we have started market trials in Europe. So we have had significant number of patients on that device now. It's being incredibly well received. As Mick mentioned there, this is a leapfrog platform that was developed from scratch over the past year and we are looking forward to launching that globally, but certainly in Europe by the end of this fiscal year. And depending on FDA timing and so on, as soon as we have a 510(k) approval, we will route further up our ventilation sales force in the U.S. and start driving into that couple of hundred million dollar market with this product, which is replacing our Elis\u00e9e and VS ranges [ph].","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Goodsall of UBS.","Andrew Goodsall - UBS","Actually, just to take up that point on ventilation. You mentioned it's been growing quickly and I know you don't break it out at the quarter. But could you just characterize it at the quarter? Was it actually growing and did it contribute to growth in this quarter?","Michael Farrell","Yes. So Andrew we don\u2019t break out ventilation and we will, as Geoff talked to, it's a material opportunity for us, but not yet by country and by segment a material business that we will break out as yet. But we are very excited about that product launch. And you know over the coming quarter, two or three, we will start to go into more detail as to the product launch and how that moves over time. We are already quite well established respiratory care player in some countries in Europe. So the product will roll into an existing referral and sales channel that we have already developed. In other markets, as Geoff was talking about the U.S. market and some others globally, we are developing the referral channels and the pipeline as well as bringing the product to market. So it's an S curve that will go rapidly in some countries and slowly in other countries. But specially to your question, Andrew, we are not going to break out the details in Q2 but as we look to going forward we will give more details of the products as it's launched in each of the different geographies worldwide.","Andrew Goodsall - UBS","Okay, and just with the masks, I think going into this quarter, you would have full contribution from the Quattro full face Air and the Swift Nano FX. Obviously from the quarters, there is a lot of noise in the numbers, pretty difficult to understand sort of what traction you're getting. Could you just again characterize what they might have been doing on an underlying basis?","Michael Farrell","Yes. So Quattro Air was launched sort of mid-calendar year. So we are in month five or six of that. We are actually seeing in the full face category, we are doing pretty well and Quattro Air is a strong part of that. And we like what Quattro Air is doing and customers seem to like the fact that it's 3.3 ounces and incredibly light on the face for the category of patients, the segment of patients that it's able to treat, the Quattro Air is doing well. Having said that, the Mirage Quattro and the Quattro FX, the other two full face masks we have are also holding share quite well. So we are reasonably comfortable with those.","The Swift FX Nano has had a good start up, particularly in Europe, Asia and rest of the world. I mean masks were up, 6% headline and 4% constant currency in rest of the world. So the Swift FX Nano has started to have a pull up. But it was launched in the September timeframe in the U.S. and a little later in Europe so we haven't seen as much material contribution from that in the nasal category. But we are looking forward to that over time. But we are also, Andrew, looking very much forward to the next two masks and what contribution they are going to bring as we look forward.","Andrew Goodsall - UBS","Okay, and just a final bit of housekeeping. Just going to ask the FX contribution to EPS, and I think we got that number here from Brett?","Brett Sandercock","Yes. Andrew that was $0.05 this quarter, the EPS impact.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ian Abbott of Goldman Sachs.","Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs","My first one is around share loss in masks. Do you think you're losing share just in new patients or do you think there is some spillover into existing patients?","Michael Farrell","So as you know we don\u2019t sell directly to patients so we don\u2019t have any idea as to whether it's a new patient or an existing patient. In the U.S. market we sold to distributors who move that forward. As we look at the temporary distraction from competitive bidding impacting as well as the competitor actions of new product launches, particularly in nasal masks and nasal pillows categories. There is a whole combination of factors going on there. It's very difficult to discern that. And underlying fundamental is that it is difficult to switch existing patients out. So like a comfortable pair of jeans or a pair of shoes that you love wearing, you tend to stick to the same ones. It's difficult to get a patient, particularly something they were every night if they are comfortable and happy. Firstly, you probably don\u2019t want to do it if you are physician or a patient. And then even the provider who might have some margin gain. The margin gain of that versus the margin loss of potentially losing the patient to another HME or not being able to switch the patient and spending the cost to do so, generally means that they are not switched as often.","Having said that, we believe that the new products, the three new products that we are bringing out this fiscal year, the AirFit P10 and the two others, will allow us to get back to rapid gain of new patients and establish therefore installed base that should be a replenishment for years to come on that basis.","Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs","Great, and my second question was around the cost side of things. You have raised your guidance on SG&A from 28% to 29%. R&D, you pushed the guidance just to a straight 8%, previously 7% to 8%. Is that a function of higher investment or is that more a function of lower expected sales outlook? And I suppose if there is, if it's the latter, I'm just wondering how much ability is there to start to trim those expenses and how long would that take?","Brett Sandercock","Yes, Ian, there is rough estimates or a range where we think it will be. So I mean that can easily move around from that number so it's not kind of, probably not the precision that you are thinking about. We have got this pipeline through on product and so on so you can expect R&D will really, I think to some extent a factor of a pretty solid pipeline in R&D that we are undertaking. And also we are taking a foot off in terms of R&D and what we are doing there. And in SG&A we need to contain those. I think we have done a reasonable job and we will continue to make sure we are spending effectively and efficiently. But we will certainly be investing in some of these newer growth areas around respiratory care, around cardiology. Geoff mentioned earlier in terms of ramping up, for example, in the sales force in the U.S. when the time is appropriate to support sales there. So there is a number of those programs or projects that we definitely want to support. But notwithstanding that, clearly we want to continue to leverage on SG&A and make sure we are driving R&D expenditure efficiently. So we will continue to do that. So the short answer, yes, I think there is scope that I think that we can continue to be effective in those areas and drop that benefit to the bottom line.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Saul Hadassin of Credit Suisse.","Saul Hadassin - Credit Suisse","Mick, just two questions. First one is, I think in your opening remarks you spoke to what was happening on the competitive dynamics on the CPAP side of the business. I assume you were referring to fixed pressure devices. I was wondering if you could give us a bit more color as to what you are seeing there, whether it's share loss as opposed to just competitive pricing and just what your response is to that? And the second question is, just with regards to your customer, well, to your DME customers, whether you are actually seeing any consolidation yet, actual closures of particularly small to medium-sized players? Thanks.","Michael Farrell","It sounds like a U.S. folks [ph] question. Jim, you want to address that too?","James Hollingshead","Sure, I shall. So, yes, the CPAP dynamic that Mick was referring to in the opening comments was about the fix pressure devices. What we are seeing is continued growth in the AutoSet or APAP part of the market. There is a mix shift underway across the whole markets. AutoSet where we continue to do well. In CPAP what we are seeing is increased pricing pressure, especially at the low end. That is a decreasing part of the market. So the low-end CPAP is actually a smaller part of the market than mid-tier CPAP which is, it's about smaller than AutoSet. And that we are seeing more severe pricing pressure at the low-end. So we have lost some share and there is pressure down in that part of the market. And as we said in the opening comment, we are looking hard at how we want to be positioned in that space in terms of -- we have a great offering, we are looking hard how we want to be positioned as the category declines and we see pricing pressure there.","Michael Farrell","And the second one was with regard to DME customers and consolidation. And on that one, Saul, clearly we have -- 4000 to 6000 plus HMEs in the U.S. market. There are some changes as we talked about as we go through. I liked the analogy of the storm going through and it's led some order there. There is some cleanup there and there will be some consolidation and we have seen, and some of that has been public of some of these companies selling their assets from company A to company B. And the fundamental is that the patients are there, the volume is there and it will increase over the coming years. And so to what extent there is consolidation, we can't precisely tell but we are working with those who won bids within the competitive bidding environment and those who are bidding on the future. And as we look around the HME landscape, there are definitely signs of an HME that is planning for future growth. If an HME is investing in EasyCare Online, is driving usually to drive patient engagement and get patients adherent to care. And if an HME is using our electronic data in the change and programs to say, use our billing systems, such as say Brightree, where you can do a one stop shop and click to purchase ResMed products. Then they are thinking about efficiency, they are thinking about scale, they are thinking about cost and they are thinking about the long-term. And they are the type of HMEs that we are spending a lot of time working with to say what's an appropriate price premium for our products and what value will it drive for you in the market over the next 6, 12, 24 months. And we are working through all that. So we are very confident that we are working with those who are investing in the long term for this industry and those who are preparing for the long-term growth that we see of patients coming through the channel. Both in sleep and in home care, respiratory care and as longer-term, as we are already doing in Europe and Japan, in the cardiorespiratory space.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from Ben Haynor of Feltl and Company.","Ben Haynor - Feltl and Company","Just had a bit of a mechanics question on product introductions. When you introduce, say a new mask, do you typically see larger stocking orders to the DMEs and HMEs when the product is first introduced than you might see in subsequent quarters? Or is the reorder rate often enough where that doesn't factor in?","Michael Farrell","Yes, Ben, it's more often than not it's an S curve that goes up over time. There is not usually large lump at the start, it's more around spending time with the physicians, spending time with the providers, and spending time working with the channel to help get them familiar with the benefits of a new mask. For instance the AirFit P10, being 50% quieter and 50% lighter, you have to sit down there with the doctor and explain and show the benefits for it. And I think there is some early clinical data and a white paper showing, a patient gets 40 minutes more of sleep from that product, for instance. So you then need to talk to the physician and get them onboard with that. You have to talk to the provider to make sure it's on their schedule and negotiate pricing and so on. So it you like, it's an S curve with a bit of lag at the start, but then acceleration from there rather than the other way around.","Ben Haynor - Feltl and Company","Okay, great. So with a product like the AirFit P10, we should expect to see that go up the S-curve as time goes on?","Michael Farrell","Correct.","Ben Haynor - Feltl and Company","Okay. Great, well, congrats on that product.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Amy, you may begin.","Amy Wakeham","Great. Thank you, Rob. Good afternoon and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us, and welcome to ResMed's fourth quarter fiscal year 2019 earnings call. This call is being webcast live and the replay along with a copy of the earnings press release and our updated investor presentation will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website.","Joining me on the call today to discuss our quarterly results are CEO, Mick Farrell; and CFO, Brett Sandercock. Other members of management will be available during the Q&A portion of the call.","During our call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures, please review the notes to today's earnings press release.","As a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about ResMed's future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions; however, our actual results may differ. You are encouraged to review our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements.","With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick.","Mick Farrell","Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today as we review results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 for ResMed.","On today's call, I will discuss our long-term strategy. I\u2019ll review top level financial results, some business highlights from the quarter, and a few key milestones. Then, I'll hand the call over to Brett, who will walk you through our financial results in further detail.","Reflecting back on fiscal year 2019, we have a lot to be proud of here at ResMed. The business is performing well; we past $2.6 billion in revenue and grew at double digits in the top line and the bottom line. We are exiting the year with momentum. And I feel strongly that we are well-positioned heading into fiscal year 2020 and beyond.","ResMed is the world\u2019s leading technology-driven healthcare company. We have more than 10 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices in the market around the world and our AirView cloud ecosystem monitors more than 11 million patient accounts, while our out-of-hospital software systems are helping to manage 19 million more. So, that is over 100 million lives that we improved with ResMed products, services and solutions in the last 12 months. We have over 4.5 billion nights of medical sleep and respiratory care data, which continues to grow exponentially. And we are turning these data into actionable insights that will inform future innovation in products and software solutions to further benefit our customers. Our relentless focus on innovation continues to set us apart from our competition, demonstrated by the success of our latest software releases and our latest sleep apnea mask systems that we\u2019ve just launched.","We have ambitions and strong ambitions to grow. We\u2019re growing our business at -- volume at double-digits; we\u2019re going to improve 250 million lives in 2025. We\u2019ll do that by helping people live happier, healthier and high quality lives outside the hospital. We remain laser-focused on growth in our core business of sleep apnea as well as in our adjacent businesses of COPD, asthma, and other chronic conditions.","We\u2019ve extended our focus to include out-of-hospital software solutions that help customers create efficiencies, take costs out of the system and improve the quality of care across home medical equipment providers, home health and hospice services as well as skilled nursing facilities and beyond. In short, we believe the future of healthcare is outside the hospital, that\u2019s where ResMed competes and that\u2019s where we win.","Let\u2019s briefly now review our top level financial results. I mentioned earlier that we ended the fiscal year on a strong note, and it is, thanks to our 7,500-person global team and their hard work to drive these great results. We achieved another quarter of double-digit revenue growth, up 15% in constant currency. We produced constant currency growth in both domestic and international sales as well as in our software-as-a-service business, which is growing organically as well as through contributions from our recent acquisitions. We continued to deliver operating leverage through the business with non-GAAP operating profit growth of 18% year-over-year and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.95.","Let me now turn to a discussion of highlights across our sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses. In the devices category across these two businesses, we delivered a good quarter with year-over-year constant currency growth of 8% globally, supported by 11% growth in the United States, Canada and Latin America geographies.","We had 1% constant currency growth of devices in combined Europe, Asia and the rest of world. We continue to cycle through strong year-over-year comparisons in France and Japan as a result of digital health related fleet upgrade that we\u2019ve previously discussed, and we will continue to do so for a number of quarters.","Underlying patient growth remains healthy around the globe. ResMed is well-positioned to continue to benefit from strong fundamental market dynamics, including an ageing population as well as increased awareness and attention from governments, payers, providers and physicians to better manage chronic disease.","The masks and accessories growth of our business was very strong during Q4. We were up 15% in constant currency globally. In the U.S., Canada and Latin America geographies, masks and accessories grew at 16%. And in Europe Asia, and the rest of world geographies, we grew at 12% in constant currency terms, in masks and accessories. We are taking share around the world with our latest patient interface innovations.","We make the smallest, quietest and most comfortable masks in the market. Results this quarter show the benefits of this innovation as customers vote for ResMed with their wallets. Our flagship masks, the AirFit F20 in the full face category and the AirFit N20 in the nasal category, continue their success across global markets. Our three most recent masks launches the F30, the N30i and the P30i have taken off at an incredible pace.","These market share gains are complemented by higher rates of adherence, driven by our digital solutions and increasing adoption of mask resupply programs through the market. We have extended our mask portfolio to offer even more options for physicians and homecare providers, and for the specific needs of the ultimate customer, the person who suffocates every night with sleep apnea.","We remain focused on driving innovation to meet underserved customer needs. And while these new masks have a lot of runway ahead, we also have an exciting product pipeline for the future. ","We are the industry leader in digital health technology. We now support well over 11 million patients with AirView, our cloud-based platform for managing sleep apnea and COPD patients. And more than 10 million 100% cloud connectable ResMed devices have installed into the market. Over the past 12 months, we have improved the lives of 15 million people by delivering sleep apnea and COPD treatment devices and full mask systems.","Our industry-changing AirSense 10 device platform and the Air Solutions cloud-based software ecosystem are still seeing strong adoption. Our device market share continues to grow as patients and healthcare providers choose ResMed and physicians prescribe ResMed. Our digital health technology solutions have been proven to improve both business and patient outcomes. We\u2019re the market leader and we will never stop innovating in this field.","We believe that digital health technology combined with the medical equipment used to treat patients can add substantial value and improve both critical outcomes and the patient experience. Digital end-to-end solutions, connectivity, making information available to patients on their own smartphones through apps like myAir and Propeller, as well as supporting patients through their chronic disease progression, can altogether make a significant difference in both health outcomes and quality of life of patients.","Through digital health technology, we are driving engagement with patients, so they can enjoy the benefits of the best therapy available, and so the cost of chronic disease can be better managed by their physicians and other healthcare providers.","The success of our connected health devices is producing an incredible data engine. We now have over 4.5 billion nights of medical sleep apnea and COPD data in the cloud. Using advanced analytics, we are turning these clinical data into actionable insights. We are lowering labor costs for our homecare provider customers. And we are taking waste out of the system through our focus on developing solutions to get the right healthcare product or service to the right patient at the right time.","At the American Thoracic Society and at the Sleep Medicine Conference during the quarter, we presented over 40 clinical studies from our digital health databases. We are advancing the field of sleep medicine with doctors Nunez, Benjafield, and Armitstead, and their physician colleagues from around the world.","Just over one year ago, we announced a joint venture with the Alphabet subsidiary, Verily, to study the health and financial impacts of untreated sleep apnea. Based on research outcomes from this JV, we will develop software solutions to help identify, engage and better manage people with sleep apnea. The JV has been set up and is running since November of last year and the combined ResMed-Verily team is making good progress to analyze data, code software, and to launch pilot studies into the market.","This investment, which can be seen as a sophisticated, tech-driven research and development project is a great long-term bet. Over time, we know this work will drive incremental growth in our core sleep apnea business, while allowing ResMed to participate in a broader ecosystem, covering sleep apnea, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and other major chronic diseases.","Everything we do supports our ambition to help to more than 936 million people worldwide who suffocate every night with sleep apnea, and then nearly 400 million people worldwide who suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD.","In January, we closed on the acquisition of Propeller Health. This is a significant addition to our vision of longitudinal solutions in respiratory care. Propeller\u2019s digital health solution helps people and their doctors better manage COPD and asthma healthcare. Propeller rounds out ResMed\u2019s portfolio to now treat COPD patients through all stages of their disease. As a reminder Propeller\u2019s advanced digital health platform leverages small sensors that are attached to the inhalers of these medicines. These sensors then pair with an easy-to-use cloud-based mobile app that automatically tracks COPD medication use and provides personalized feedback and insights to the individual, much like myAir and our other sleep apnea patient engagement systems, just not at the same scale yet.","The Propeller team is making really good progress, as they work with partners to reach commercial scale. We\u2019re very encouraged about where we are at with the team. There are few things that I can point to that give you an idea of how Propeller solutions have been recognized and adopted by their partners.","In May, the Cleveland Clinic published research showcasing that the use of Propeller\u2019s digital medicine platform for COPD patients, reduced the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s COPD-related healthcare utilization and hospitalizations across their clinic. And the year before the study, patients averaged 3.4 visits per patient per year; following the use of Propeller\u2019s technology, the rate decreased to 2.2 visits per patient per year, with the majority of patients indicating that the sensor was convenient and very easy to use. That 35% reduction in clinic visits is an incredible cost savings and productivity opportunity for hospital systems and payers.","Earlier this week, Walgreens announced that Propeller has been added to the pharmacy\u2019s health platform called, Find Care, expanding the ability to get Propeller into the hands of people struggling to manage their chronic disease through Walgreens.","Propeller\u2019s clinically validated solutions have demonstrated amazing outcomes, including trial studies showing a 58% improvement in medication adherence, a 48% increase in symptom-free days, as well a 53% reduction in emergency room visits. These are impressive results, and we can\u2019t wait to scale.","The evolution that we have made in respiratory care business has set ResMed up to become the global leader in digital health for COPD, from stage 1 and 2 COPD with Propeller to stage 3 and stage 4 COPD, with portable oxygen and noninvasive solutions. We will continue to help physicians, providers, payers and patients as they manage COPD this important, progressive and chronic disease, keeping people out of the hospital, happy and healthy in their homes.","Let\u2019s now turn to a discussion of our software-as-a-service business for the out-of-hospital healthcare settings that we operate in. Our SaaS portfolio continues its growth trajectory, with revenue up 111% year-on-year on a reported basis this quarter. On an organic pro forma basis, comparing results in Q4 to the results of these businesses before recent acquisitions, Brightree grew in the high single digit range and MatrixCare grew low double digits. We are pleased with the momentum and progress the teams have named as we integrate and optimize across the portfolio for growth.","Our competitive advantages and leading SaaS positions in home medical equipment, skilled nursing facilities, home health, hospice and other out-of-hospital care markets support ongoing portfolio growth. On a pro forma basis, we are growing this portfolio at high single digits across the blend of SaaS portfolio. And we have a clear pathway to drive sustainable, double-digit growth in our SaaS portfolio as we further integrate these businesses.","I'd like to call out a few highlights from the quarter. Our Brightree home health and hospice electronic medical record solution was awarded the 2019 MedTech Breakthrough Award for best overall healthcare administration software. Additionally, our latest K L A S or KLAS scores for home health and hospice have gone up again. KLAS looks at many aspects of customer satisfaction, which provides a holistic measure of performance. So, the trend and these latest data further validate our leading position in high-quality offering in the marketplace.","As you may recall, MatrixCare has received the best-in-class a long-term care software three years in a row. We have now organized all of our home health and hospice solutions from both HEALTHCAREfirst and Brightree under MatrixCare management. This will allow customers who operate across care settings, to enjoy the scalability and seamless transfer they want, but it also helps patients and aging seniors to navigate more easily across these healthcare settings. Additionally, we launched MatrixCare I which is a single platform for care management across out-of-hospital healthcare settings. Having a single platform, enables centralized management of care settings, consistency between functions, user management and navigation and a single view of the individual, resulting in streamlined care transitions for our customers.","Also, during the quarter, Brightree launched a new pharmacy suite for home infusion therapy providers and HME pharmacies. We've also expanded our Brightree ReSupply solutions, three new categories, incontinence, diabetics and enteral to enable HMEs to create efficiencies and optimize patient support.","In summary, for the SaaS business, we have a vision to transform and significantly improve out-of-hospital healthcare. ResMed is the strategic player, best positioned to lead this transformation. We are connecting capabilities across Brightree and MatrixCare platforms in care settings to help our customers to be more efficient, so they can better serve an aging population, helping them stay out of hospital and in a lower cost, higher quality care setting of their choice, and the best place is almost always their own home.","Before I turn the call over to Brett, let me close with this. We had a great fiscal year 2019. Full year revenue was up 15% in constant currency, and we translated that into 18% operating profit growth. We are all well-positioned to continue to drive top and bottom line growth in fiscal year 2020 and beyond. We published the prevalence data study showing the 936 million people worldwide with sleep apnea in the top tier clinical journal, Lancet. Our connected health strategy continues to support growth across global markets and the continued traction of our diversified mask and device portfolio along with an expanding pipeline of new products and enhanced digital health solutions for sleep apnea, COPD and out-of-hospital medical software markets. We have confidence in our ongoing momentum.","Finally, we\u2019ve position ResMed for the long-term as an innovative global leader in digital health. Our triple aim is to slow chronic disease progression, to reduce overall healthcare system cost, and to improve outcomes and quality of life for the ultimate customer, the patient.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brett for his remarks. And then, we\u2019ll open the lines up for Q&A. Brett, over to your in Sydney.","Brett Sandercock","Great. Thanks, Mick.","In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenues for the June quarter were $705 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 15%. Excluding revenue from acquisitions, group revenue increased by 8% on a constant currency basis.","Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our software-as-a-service business, our sales in U.S. and Canada and Latin American countries were $386 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $234 million, decrease of 1% over the prior year quarter. However, in constant currency terms, sales in combined Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 4% over the prior year quarter.","Breaking out revenue between product segments. U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $203 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $183 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter. For revenue in Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales were $156 million, a decrease of 4% over the prior year quarter, but in constant currency terms a 1% increase.","Mask and other sales in Europe, Asia and other markets was $79 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, a 12% increase. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 4% while masks and other sales increased by 15% over the prior year quarter.","Software-as-a-service revenue for the fourth quarter was $85 million, an increase of 111% over the prior year quarter.","During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles, purchase accounting fair value adjustment to MatrixCare deferred revenue, restructuring expenses, litigation and settlement expenses, tax related expenses associated with the U.S. tax reform and any payment on a minority interest investment. The prior comparable excludes amortization of acquired intangibles, restructuring expenses and expenses associated with U.S. tax reform. And replacing that, we provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our fourth quarter earnings press release.","Our gross margin for the June quarter was 59.3% compared with 58.1% during the same quarter in the prior year and 59.3% in Q3 FY19. Compared to the prior year, our gross margin increased by 120 basis points, predominantly attributable to manufacturing and procurement efficiencies, and the MatrixCare acquisition, partially offset by typical declines in average selling process. Assuming current exchange rates and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margin for fiscal year 2020 to be broadly consistent with our Q4 FY19 gross margin.","Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter were $171.6 million, an increase of 9% over prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 14%. Excluding acquisitions, SG&A expenses increased by 3% on a constant currency basis. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 24.3% compared to the 25.1% that we reported in the prior year quarter. Looking forward, subject to currency movements and taking into account our recent acquisitions, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 23% to 25% during fiscal year 2020.","Consistent with trends in prior year, Q1 FY20 will be at the higher end of the range while with second half of the year will trend toward the lower end of the range.","R&D expenses for the quarter were $51.1 million, an increase of 29% over the prior year quarter, on constant currency basis an increase of 32%. Excluding acquisitions, R&D expenses increased by 6%, reflecting incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 7.3% compared to 6.4% in the prior year.","Looking forward, subject to currency movements and taking into account our recent acquisitions, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for fiscal year 2020.","Amortization of acquired intangibles was $23.4 million for the quarter, an increase of 102% over the prior year quarter, reflecting the impact from our recent acquisition.","Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $14.2 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $196.2 million, an increase of 18% over the prior year quarter while non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $137.6 million, an increase of 1% over the prior year quarter.","Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.95, consistent with the prior year quarter while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.48.","On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the June quarter was 28.2%, while on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.8%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2020 will be in a range of 21% to 23%.","During the quarter, we recognized restructuring expenses of $9.4 million, predominantly associated with the workforce planning review in our respiratory care business, closure of our R&D facilities in Germany and cost associated with ongoing integration program in the SaaS portfolio. Additionally, during the quarter, we recognized a write-down of $5 million associated with a minority equity investment.","Finally, in relation to legal settlement, we have tentatively agreed with the government to resolve the U.S. Department of Justice investigation for a payment of $39.5 million. We expect to also incur legal and administrative cost to typically accompany such a resolution. As a result, we have recognized a reserve of $41.2 million in our fourth quarter results in connection with this tentative agreement. While we believe a voluntary resolution is likely, there can be no assurance as to whether or when the parties will finalize a negotiated settlement.","Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $141.8 million, reflecting strong underlying earnings. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $22.2 million. Depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $42.8 million.","During the quarter, we paid dividends of $53.1 million. Our joint venture with Verily continued operations during the quarter and we've recorded equity losses of $6.5 million in our income statement in the June quarter associated with the joint venture. We expect to record approximately $7 million of equity losses each quarter in fiscal year 2020, associated with the joint venture operations.","Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share, representing an increase of 5% from our previously declared dividend.","At June 30, we had $1.3 billion in gross debt and $1.1 billion in net debt. Our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels.","On July 10, we closed on our U.S. private placement offering with $500 million in debt, consisting of $250 million and seven-year senior unsecured notes at a 3.24% coupon and $250 million in senior unsecured notes at 3.45% coupon. Net proceeds from the offering were $498 million, which we used to reduce our current borrowings under the unsecured revolving credit facility. The transaction significantly lengthens our debt maturity profile and provides improved visibility on our long-term debt funding costs.","Finally, to recap. Our top line revenue was strong this quarter with growth across all major categories. Gross margin was solid and our operating costs remained well controlled, even as we observed the impact of acquisitions. As a result, we're continuing to drive operating leverage with Q4 non-GAAP operating profit up 18% year-on-year. We are focused on driving operating results, integrating SaaS acquisitions and ensuring we continue to invest in our strategic, long-term opportunities.","And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy.","Amy Wakeham","Great. Thank you, Brett. We will now go ahead and turn to the Q&A portion of the call. Before we start, I would like to remind everyone to please limit yourself to one question. If you do have additional questions or a follow-up, please feel free to return to call queue. Operator Rob, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Lyanne Harrison of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Again, Lyanne Harrison, please go ahead. Your line is open.","Lyanne Harrison","Hi Mick and hi Brett. Thank you so much for taking my questions. It\u2019s in relation to the SaaS business. Can you shed some light on how the growth was achieved, whether it\u2019s new users, new module and increase in revenue per user? And also, how you might -- or when you might expect Brightree to get to double-digit growth?","Mick Farrell","Yes. Lyanne, thanks for the question. And as we said during the quarter -- or during the prepared remarks, during the quarter, we had strong growth across the SaaS portfolio, high single digit growth from Brightree and low double digit growth from MatrixCare with a blend of the two in the very high single digits. Your question of where the revenue comes from, it\u2019s a combination of the above. We\u2019ve had new users that come into the system, both Brightree and MatrixCare there is churn out but we have net new users that come in. We have also launched some recent new modules including apps directly for patients in Brightree. And then, we also have price increases that apply to some elements of that portfolio. So, it\u2019s sort of a combination of all three that have driven that strong growth. And as we said, we think as we continue to integrate across the different out-of-hospital healthcare settings, we have the opportunity to increase the value we give the customers and therefore increase the revenue to a sustainable double-digit growth across that portfolio.","So, we\u2019re not giving a specific timeline exactly where that\u2019s going. But now that it\u2019s called out on our 10-Qs and 10K, we\u2019ll be going through very detail data on a 90-day basis as to where that growth is coming from. But I can tell you, having just had a steering committee review with both the Brightree management team and with the MatrixCare management team just this week that we have a really good portfolio of new solutions and services, and new lines of business including getting into infusion businesses from Brightree, into enteral care and diabetics and beyond. So, there is a very good portfolio ahead.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Deakin-Bell of Citi. Please go ahead. ","John Deakin-Bell","Good morning, Mick. Mick, just give us a bit more of a sense from your perspective about the mask growth in the U.S. [Technical Difficulty] over the last 12 months, it certainly looks like it accelerated versus kind of the average over the last five years. And [Technical Difficulty] declined a bit the volumes, the volumes [Technical Difficulty] 15%. Can you just give us a little more perspective from what you\u2019re seeing in terms of is that driven by the resupply? What are the key components of that elevated mask growth?","Mick Farrell","Yes. Thanks for the question, John. That allows us to talk about what we\u2019ve been doing to help our customers on masks and adherence and so on. As you noted, our U.S., Canada, Latin America growth in the quarter was very strong, was 16% constant currency in that geography. But I\u2019ll note it was also 12% in constant currency in Europe, Asia and rest of world and so a sort of global number of 15% constant currency growth across the business.","It\u2019s driven primarily by market share gains, those high strong double-digit growth there. We say the market is growing in mid to high single digits. So, at 15% growth, we\u2019re clearly taking share. So, that\u2019s one point. Secondly, what we\u2019re driving is increased adherence. As I talked at length on the prep remarks on digital health technology, we\u2019re driving upto 87% adherence on patients who set up on a ResMed device using myAir and all the Air Solutions capabilities. And so, 9 out of 10 people are staying on therapy, and so that just drives a stronger tail of the number of patients who will adhere to therapy and therefore will need masks as they get dirty and decay over time. So, that\u2019s a big part of it. So, it\u2019s the share gain, it\u2019s the adherence that we\u2019re driving and it\u2019s also getting new patients into the funnel. And we\u2019re doing a better job of identifying, engaging, enrolling patients around the world, not just by publishing the prevalence data that we just did but using the big data to partner with healthcare providers and governments and payers to show that there is a return on investments in diagnosing and treating sleep apnea patients, not only improving the quality of life of the individuals and their lives changed and lower incidence occurring disease but also directly to lower healthcare costs for government insurance and private insurance as well.","So, it\u2019s sort of a combination of all three, move people into the pipeline, the pipeline expanding through adherence and also ResMed gaining its share of that pipeline through the mask innovation.","Operator","Your next question comes from Saul Hadassin of UBS. Please go ahead. ","Saul Hadassin","Maybe could I just ask, resupply seems to be a very strong driver of growth in the U.S. from masks and accessories. We\u2019ve seen the part of bundling program effectively come and go. Do you see any risks at all from a payer\u2019s perspective, the reimbursement perspective, the sustainability of funding of that product growth?","Mick Farrell","So, the key element in this is really Health Economics and Outcomes Research, right, and the acronym is HEOR. And one thing we\u2019re doing with the 4.5 billion nights of medical data we now have on sleep apnea and COPD patients is partnering up with healthcare systems. You saw our data with Kaiser Permanente Group in California, which is where we published the 87% adherence data. Obviously we don\u2019t share all the partnerships that don\u2019t get published and what we\u2019re doing. We have talked about the latest work with Walgreens in there with Cleveland Clinic on some of our digital health applications.","The bottom line is, if you keep a patient on therapy for sleep apnea and you\u2019re investing a couple of hundred dollars per year per patient on masks, you are saving far more than that in reducing emergency room visits, additional cost for cardiovascular care, diabetes and all those that from untraded obstructive sleep apnea. So, we\u2019ve had decades now of clinical data showing this. We now have true economic data that we can show a customer, where that customer is a payer provider system like [indiscernible] with the government of Finland, and look at data in their system with their people. So, your question was, do I see resupply as a risk? No. I see resupply as an opportunity to show the return on investment for the people who are trying that. But actually this is a cost saving, a net-net cost savings over the life of that patient with their own data, retrospective and prospective.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Wheen of Evans & Partners. Please go ahead.","Steve Wheen","Hey. Good morning. I just wondered if you could go back to that settlement figure and just remind me of what the issue was. I think, this is related to that OIG issue. And does that change -- is that just an estimate at this or is it being finalized? And secondly, does it change the way you've got to run that resupply business, going forward?","Mick Farrell","Steve, I'll hand that question to Rob Douglas.","David Pendarvis","Steve, the conduct that was subject of investigation, has been laid out in our 10-Qs over time, so, if you just go back and reference that, will give you the detail that basically has sort of four different categories. How we made our resupply programs available on a trial basis was one element. There were issues about marketing programs, issues about financing and issues about making some apnea links available. So, all four of those would get wrapped into this resolution. It is a tentative resolution. And so, we are comfortable in taking the reserve now because we think it\u2019s probable that that resolution will get finalized. But that's likely only to occur, our best estimate now would be by the end of the calendar year that that will take place.","And we are pretty confident of the numbers. The 39.5 number that Brett referenced is a confident estimate of the ultimate exposure for payments to the government. The remainder of it, the fees and expenses are a little more of an estimate, but there is a pretty high confidence level that that reserve ought to be sufficient to cover all of these expenses associated with it.","Importantly, we are not going to be required in this resolution to admit any wrongdoing. In fact, we believe that we have handled ourselves appropriately. But, like in a lot of situations, you resolve matters on a consensual basis to get it behind you. And we feel it was the best resolution for our customers, our patients and for the Company and our shareholders. But going forward, we don't expect any significant changes to the way that we do business. We're going to continue to remain focused on, as Mick was saying, making resupply systems available for customers, so they can get -- patients can get adequate supplies and consumables in the future. We will still do that and in the other areas providing support to our customers and support to our patients. We don't expect any significant changes in the way we do business.","Operator","Your next question comes from Margaret Kaczor of William Blair. Please go ahead.","Margaret Kaczor","Mick, on the frontend commentary, I think you had referenced your goal of double-digit volume growth over the next several years. So, I wanted to maybe go into that a little bit more, in terms of the drivers of that growth, sleep, versus COPD versus SaaS, if you plan a similar pace of product launches, maybe that we've seen, and really when does the law of large numbers, whether it\u2019s healthcare or resupply certain impact you?","Mick Farrell","Yes. Thanks for the question, Margaret. As you know that I did talk about that in the prep remarks that the way we look at our businesses is, it\u2019s exciting, the $2.6 billion in revenue, but just as exciting, probably more exciting for the people who work here is the 100 million lives we touched, 15 million through products and now over 90 million through our services and solutions in the SaaS part of the business. So, our goal is to grow that combined portfolio double-digits in volume through 2025 and beat 250 million lives that we improve in the year 2025. So, that\u2019s sort our five-year growth plan.","We haven\u2019t split -- I mean, we have obviously internally, we haven\u2019t publicly split out exactly how the different elements of sleep apnea, respiratory care, primarily through COPD but also asthma now through Propeller and then also through the out-of-hospital software side and how each of those elements will grow. What I can say is that sort of core market of sleep apnea is growing mid to high single digits, as you saw this quarter and last quarter. We don\u2019t just accept market growth, we drive it by getting market share and getting new patients into the funnel to actually fundamentally improve that core sleep apnea market growth.","In respiratory care, we are revolutionizing the whole space there with the acquisition of Propeller. It will only take one of the three to five non-public pharma pilot trials that we\u2019re doing to go to scale for that growth of that business to improve very significantly from its current run rate. And we\u2019re betting on that happening. We have a very exciting set of partnerships with big pharma that we can only talk about at the appropriate time.","And then, the third part of our business, the combination of Brightree and MatrixCare businesses, as I said, we have a clear pathway to drive those from high single digit to double digit growth, and to sustain that over time. I mean, people want to be taken care of outside the hospital, and we have the best software systems to do that. So, there\u2019ll be secular trends moving people from the hospital to hospice, home health, skilled nursing facilities, life plan communities and so on, and ResMed will beat to improve on all of them. ","So, we\u2019re going to go across each of those portfolios and then lots of different factors over the next five years that will drive it. But we\u2019re very confident, we\u2019ll get double-digit volume growth across that portfolio.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gretel Janu of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Gretel Janu","Thanks. Good morning. So just on SG&A, you continue to lower that SG&A to sales ratio. Just wondering, like where do you see that going, how long can you continue to actually continue to lower it, and where exactly are the gains coming from?","Mick Farrell","Yes. Thanks, Gretel. I\u2018ll handle to Rob Douglas, our COO.","Rob Douglas","Yes. Thanks, Gretel. The really good thing in our volume growth business -- we were talking earlier about the volume growth, is sort of engineering leverage into the systems and process is not that hard to do, if you really focus and keep going. Obviously, our sales processes and all of our sort of systems and the way we work do need continued investment. And we can\u2019t promise we\u2019ll be getting leverage forever. But while the volume growth is strong, we\u2019ll continue to be efficient and drive that. Obviously, you did see in our organic business, we got very good leverage. And as we\u2019ve brought in the new businesses that maybe haven\u2019t had some of that sort of leverage thinking applied to them, that sort of added on quite a bit. But they have remained then huge opportunities to build leverage with some of the thinking around the process management and the continuous improvement programs that we\u2019ve got. So we\u2019ve got -- we\u2019ve still got plenty of headroom to keep driving that leverage.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Bailey of Macquarie. Your line is open.","David Bailey","Mick, just one for me. Just wondering if you could perhaps give us a sense as to the contribution of non-invasive ventilators to devices revenue for the group?","Mick Farrell","Yes. Thanks, David. We don\u2019t split it out to a granular level of detail. What I can say is, in general, if you look at sort of the growth of respiratory care in ventilation versus a sleep apnea care and the device growth, it\u2019s a little lower in respiratory care as a sort of a secular growth rate. And so, again, we don\u2019t just accept that and say well that means our non-invasive ventilators will grow slower than our sleep ap devices. But, it is something that is generally there from the secular trend.","We actually -- this last quarter and before that, David, we had really strong growth in our ventilators. We made a software upgrade. And this wasn\u2019t a cloud offer, this was actually embedded software that is within the Astral ventilator that was really well-received by customers in Europe and in the U.S. And so, we saw some pretty strong market share gains that drove good growth in devices in both Europe and in the U.S. from our ventilator side of the business. But, we don\u2019t split it out yet. I look forward to when Propeller is so successful driving the digital health side that we have to break out our respiratory care division the way that we do our SaaS division and at that point I\u2019ll be able to give you a whole lot of the color into the ventilation part of the business. But I can say, it grew well this quarter. And we think that software upgrade has more legs on it and has some more growth ahead.","Operator","Your next question comes from Anthony Petrone of Jeffries. Please go ahead.","Anthony Petrone","So, maybe just a question on -- I\u2019ll just keep it to one, on France and Japan. You mentioned that connected devices is there, the upgrades seem to be completed. So, is there an expectation France, Japan to sort of normalize after those upgrades are completed? And if so, what extent do you think the benefit can be as a tailwind as those two countries normalize on the device side? Thanks.","Mick Farrell","Yes. Thanks for the question, Anthony. That allows me to talk about that digital health upgrade in France and Japan, which was incredible to see the rate at which two countries move into digital health. As you said, we will start to normalize as we pass all the comparables of that ahead of market growth that we\u2019ve had in our rearview mirror. Look, what I\u2019d say is that by the end -- before the end of this fiscal year, we will normalize France and Japan, and really that will influence across that whole portfolio of Europe, Asia and the rest of the world that we report on. We\u2019ll start to see that whole group normalize to market growth. ","And then, hopefully, as we launch more of these digital health solutions into countries beyond France and Japan, that we\u2019ll be talking about the s-curve of innovation of digital health in Finland and in Switzerland and in Germany. I don\u2019t have announcements on any other countries beyond those two. But, I look forward sort of working through the intricacies of the other 120 countries we do business in as they embrace digital health, the same way France and Japan did. But the short answer to your question is, by the end of this fiscal year, before the end of this fiscal year, we would expect that out of U.S. device growth to normalize.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Cooper of Goldman Sachs.","Chris Cooper","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the expansion of Brightree into other areas outside OSA. Can I just ask the rationale for the three areas you\u2019ve chosen? And also, could you just confirm, this is something you\u2019re going to continue to roll out across the other areas of healthcare? And if so, over what timeframe, please? Thank you.","Mick Farrell","Yes. Thanks for the question, Chris. Brightree has an incredible cloud-based enterprise resource planning and systems planning capability for home medical equipment companies. And they've actually always been able to, from our acquisition of them over three years ago to today, serviced beyond just sleep apnea and COPD. We've been servicing patients with incontinence, diabetic and enteral at different levels. What we really decided to do was to bring our resupply capabilities that we first applied to the ResMed side of the business, which was masks, over to those other areas of business. And so, it's not really expanding Brightree\u2019s footprint in terms of which customers it goes after. It's more expanding the services that we offer.","Now, with the infusion, the growth of infusion business, that does bring some players in HME who have that -- infusion part of their business brings that into play for Brightree. But I consider it more of an adjacency. If you think about it, the core growth of Brightree is in home medical equipment provider. And everything they do can be digitized and can be put on the cloud, and that's Brightree\u2019s goal, and it was before we acquired them and it has been after we acquired them. And I'm just happy to see that we didn't just focus on sleep apnea and COPD growth for HME providers. We are actually thinking holistically about their business. And these new launches will allow Brightree to grow its very profitable part of the business, but also to serve those customers better and to bring more efficiencies to them which will help for the health of that distribution of home medical equipment in the U.S. and really help our partners grow, and it\u2019s good profitable revenue from ResMed as well. So, I\u2019d say, it is a very strong, good adjacency and a good part of our ongoing growth.","Chris Cooper","And this is a strategy you\u2019re going to continue to look to push going forward?","Mick Farrell","Yes, absolutely, Chris. We\u2019ll look to continue to find opportunities for home medical equipment providers to get efficiencies. So, if this part of the business that are analog, that are fax based, I mean, you wouldn\u2019t believe some of the opportunities for innovation are actually quite relatively simple and we have solutions. For instance, our e-fax [ph] solution to just digitize that whole space and help doctors and home care provides more easily integrate with each other, stuff that just is on the pipeline that we really have to get the solutions out there and get customers adopting those new modules. But, as I said earlier, I think we are seeing some good adoption in modules, and we have a good path to continue that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joanne Wuensch of BMO. Please go ahead.","Matt Henriksson","Yes. Hi. This is Matt Henriksson in for Joanne. My question is with regards to the partnership or the agreement with Walgreens. Could you provide a little more detail into how many patients now you\u2019re opened up to using Propeller? And then how important are these pharmacy partnerships going forward for the overall Propeller strategy?","Mick Farrell","So, thanks for the question, Matt. As I said in the prep remarks, the partnership with Propeller and Walgreens is a pilot trial, like all of our Propeller trials are in that pilot trial stage. It\u2019s exciting because it\u2019s a new place at the pharmacy for Propeller to acquire new customers into the digital health platform that we have for COPD and for asthma. So, it\u2019s not public how many pharmacies and how many patients are on that platform. But generally, with Propeller\u2019s data, when we get to the end of a pilot, we\u2019re able to publish those data to get them into the peer-reviewed press. And at that point, I\u2019ll be able to talk very liberally about those data, but I don\u2019t want to jeopardize the production or publication of those data.","But, what I can say is if you look at the data that we had with other partnerships with the Cleveland Clinic data that we did talk specifically too, a 35% reduction in the number of clinic visits or a double-digit reduction in the visits to emergency room visits, these are, depending on the size of the business, if you\u2019re a large hospital system or a large payer, these are tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars that can saved across the scalable business. And so, it\u2019s early days of pilot data. I don\u2019t want to talk too much about the numbers until we really do start to scale it. But, I think it\u2019s important to note what -- where we want to go with digital health and COPD. And the Walgreens experiment I thought was worth sharing because it\u2019s a new sort of place to find these patients that goes beyond sort of the traditional doctor. We\u2019re now talking a pharmacy clinic.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Goodsall of MST Marquee. Please go ahead.","Andrew Goodsall","Thanks very much for taking my question. Just on competitive bidding, obviously the bids are now open for \u201821. I\u2019m just trying to understand if you\u2019re saying to think about that and how you might pass yourself or what sort of thought process you might have going into that?","Mick Farrell","Yes. Thanks for your question, Andrew. We have a very sophisticated market access team looking and governance -- is looking at this. Dave, do you want to give a summary where we\u2019re with CB?","David Pendarvis","Sure. So, even though the bid windows open, it\u2019s going to be open for 90 days. And so, the main thing that our team is doing now is continuing to work along with others in the industry to educate the industry to make sure they understand new rules of bidding and how to understand, how to think about it, how to model the impact of lead item pricing on your overall portfolio of products and to make sure that our customers are in the best position they can be in to be able to go forward and bid appropriately. So, that\u2019s really the first, second and third priorities today and that will continue. We\u2019ve seen an uptick in the number of people who have visited the website, the number of people who are attending seminars as we\u2019ve gotten into the bid window opening period. So, that\u2019s the main thing that we\u2019re doing. Beyond that, we\u2019re obviously trying to make sure that our customers who are the ones, who are putting the bids in a position to do best they can and make the best estimates they can for what they can do going forward. So, we\u2019re trying to support the overall process, but we\u2019re really secondary to it. So, we\u2019ve got to be in a support role, primarily.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Low of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","David Low","Thanks very much. A bunch of questions for Brett on the restructuring charges. So, we\u2019ve seen restructuring come through for the second year in a row. Just wondering how you think about restructuring. Is this going to be something that we\u2019re likely to see on ongoing basis? And how do you distinguish between what\u2019s the restructuring charge and what falls into sort of regular SG&A and R&D costs?","Mick Farrell","Yes. Thanks, Dave. I mean, with any business, I think from time to time, it\u2019s inevitably that you have some restructuring coming through. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be something that\u2019s routine or it\u2019s necessarily going to happen all the time. I guess, we distinguish anything that\u2019s kind of logical program, it\u2019s really something that we\u2019re structurally challenging. So, the elements that we\u2019re looking at in respiratory care, we really have to look at on strategically the workforce planning and look at what capabilities we need, particularly as we move and focus more around the digital health. And you heard me talk about the Propeller and what we\u2019re doing there, and it\u2019s really making sure that we have those capabilities. So, in order to do that, really we need to look at workforce planning every now and then and strategically, if you like, make some calls, and we\u2019ve done that this quarter in respiratory care.","The other elements for the German R&D facility, which is small legacy system that we basically selected to close that down. They did good work there but we -- it is kind of subscale, we\u2019ve got -- as you know, we\u2019ve got the major hubs, Sydney, Singapore in the U.S. So, we really thought we could do that more effectively at the larger hubs. That\u2019s something that\u2019s kind of more permanent in nature, if you like.","And then, SaaS, the third element on the SaaS restructuring is really related to the integration activities, particularly around the home health and hospice segment, we\u2019re really strongly integrating that portfolio. So, again, that\u2019s something that we\u2019re doing in SaaS that I think will only happen time to time, we\u2019re really aligning strongly around HME and then around home health and hospice and then around MatrixCare with some segments such as the skilled nursing facilities. So, there again, it\u2019s really positioning that portfolio to operate technically as it can from a revenue growing perspective and also from clearly -- obviously from a cost related expected as well.","So, I think, from time to time, it\u2019s inevitable, but I don\u2019t think -- it\u2019s not necessarily going be routing. We\u2019re not going to have these every quarter, for example.","Operator","Your last question comes from Sean Laaman of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Sean Laaman","Good morning, Mick. Mick, I\u2019m wondering if could tease out a comment on the rate of Brightree users buying other Brightree users during the quarter, and was that an issue?","Mick Farrell","Thanks for the question, Sean. Looking at U.S. home medical equipment channel, there\u2019s many thousands of providers, and Brightree has a very strong double-digit share of those many thousands of providers, and there has been over time and will continue to be M&A. And so, yes, during the quarter, there was M&A I\u2019m sure. I can\u2019t think of a particular example in my head but I'm sure there were examples of Brightree -- accounts who\u2019ve used Brightree service acquiring other accounts who use Brightree. As you know, we generally charge that business on a per user per time period methodology. And so in general, if there two accounts come together, it could be neutral to revenue. Now, there can be some efficiencies, or it could have been one of those businesses using more modules or less modules. And so there could be many factors that either increase or decrease the revenue from the account during that process. But, it\u2019s something that\u2019s there, it\u2019s part of the business. I'd say less of an impact on things like churn, where you just have people -- new people coming in and people switching to other solutions or turning off some of automated solutions. But, it\u2019s part of that business and we've managed that over the history, three plus years we\u2019ve managed Brightree and the entity and the team there managed it for their last 10 years that they\u2019ve been in business as well. So, it\u2019s part of the equation but it\u2019s not something that's new and it\u2019s not something that we're unable to manage. And I think you saw during the quarter strong single digit growth that we were able to do well and we thing we can even do better from there.","Operator","We are now at the one hour mark.

There are also other members of the management team present that will be available to answer questions.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mick Farrell. Mick, please go ahead.","Mick Farrell","Great. Thanks, John, and thank you all for joining us today. As usual, I\u2019ll review the highlights of our fiscal Q3 and then I\u2019ll hand the call over to Brett to go through the quarter in more detail.","So, first, the financial summary. Global revenue in the third quarter of fiscal \u201814 grew 4% year-on-year to $398 million. That is up 3% on a constant currency basis. America\u2019s revenue was flat on a year-over-year basis at $216 million. Europe, Asia and rest of world headline revenue increased 8% for the quarter to $182 million, which is 6% growth in constant currency terms.","Net income for the quarter increased 6% to $90 million. GAAP EPS increased by 9% to $0.63 per share for the quarter, while hybrid earnings per share which excludes the amortization of intangibles was $0.64 per share. This bottom line result demonstrates strong global operating performance from our global team.","Now, let me review the operating results in a little more detail. We look at our sales performance in the Americas in the context of year-on-year, as well as sequential quarterly results.","Last year in Q3 of fiscal \u201813, we grew Americas revenue by 13%. Given this tough comparable and challenging market conditions in the U.S., keeping our topline flat on a year-over-year basis was a good result. Also, I\u2019d like to note that we grew the Americas revenue sequentially by 5% or around $9 million from Q2 to Q3.","By category, in the Americas, revenue from masks grew by 2%. Flow generators declined by 2% year-over-year. We were up against very tough prior comparisons in the flow generator category, which grew at 21% during Q3 of last fiscal year. It\u2019s important to note that both of these categories on a sequential basis were an uptick from Q2 to Q3.","U.S. market dynamics began to improve in Q3, although the environment is still evolving. New patient growth while still subdued is continuing and importantly, resupply to the installed base of patients is also growing.","We continue to promote resupply and a nationwide research study we commissioned recently confirmed that resupply programs work. They provide better care for the patient and better results for the homecare provider and better outcomes for the payer. Our customers are also beginning to see stability in their businesses.","As they adjust to the U.S. reimbursement changes from competitive bidding that went into effect in July last year for Medicaid patients in CB2. Many customers are growing back to -- getting back to growing patient volumes. These leading indicators tell us that the U.S. market is starting to stabilize.","In January, just 90 days ago, in our Q2 call, we said that, we were going to adjust our pricing in response to competitive activity, particularly in the U.S. market and that played out during the quarter. We regained share during the quarter, although pricing adjustments were an offset to those volume gains, resulting in a flat quarter in revenue terms for the Americas.","The U.S. market remains a highly competitive dynamic and going forward, we are going to make sure we are appropriately positioned for revenue growth as the competitive environment develops.","We\u2019ll continue to use our innovation and our value propositions across the categories, including products, services and solutions to shape the variables that drive product preference and purchasing decisions.","Our sales results for combined Europe and Asia-Pac and rest of world were led by constant currency growth in the mask category of 14%. The flow generator category across Europe, Asia-Pac and rest of world was 2%.","We see upside for growth in this flow generator category going forward, with the launch of our respiratory care platform in these regions. And I\u2019ll talk a little bit more about that in a few minutes.","Europe delivered another quarter of very solid revenue growth in Q3 as it did in Q2. Our wholesale businesses did particularly well in major markets France, Germany and the U.K., as well as across our European dealer network, which includes the emerging Eastern European acquisitions that we talked about last quarter Poland and the Czech Republic.","Our teams in Europe are well-positioned for the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. We remained on track with our previously announced product introduction plans. We launched the AirFit P10 as promised during the last quarter and that product is selling very well in the U.S. It is just launching as we speak into Europe and Asia-Pacific.","During our last conference call, we promised to deliver two additional new masks to the market this fiscal year. We delivered on that promise this week, with the launch of two more AirFit branded mask offerings.","The first, the AirFit F10, where F stands for full-face is the lightest full-face mask on the market. The AirFit N10, where N stands for nasal mask, is a new patient-preferred nasal mask that is highly unobtrusive and allows patients to have clear line of sight.","These products deliver what patients want most, a light, comfortable, unobtrusive mask that is easy to use. Our pre-launch testing demonstrated that patients prefer these new mask offerings to those currently on the market and we expect physicians and providers will like them too. We\u2019re launching both of these new masks during Q1 -- during Q4 in the U.S. and most other geographies and we will continue the launch throughout Q1 in fiscal \u201815.","In the flow generator category, we\u2019re delivering on our commitment as we said and are moving forward to full commercial launch for our new respiratory care platform, the Astral.","The Astral is a new life support ventilation system that has competitive advantages in size and weight and it\u2019s being very well received by patients and providers during the controlled product launch that we\u2019ve been conducting in Europe during Q3.","This product solution will enrich life for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD and neuromuscular disease. We are now ready to move to full commercial launch this quarter in most of our European and Asia-Pacific markets.","We already have a strong homecare ventilation presence in these regions with a channel that\u2019s ready to go and the Astral will complement our existing respiratory care product offerings. We are in process for FDA clearance. Our 510(k) is submitted in the U.S. and we hope to launch in the U.S. later this calendar year.","The hard work of our research and development teams is bearing fruit this quarter, with the multiple product launches across the globe running on schedule. And the strength of our design capability was recently validated when both the Astral and the AirFit P10 were awarded Red Dot Design awards.","This is a global prestigious international product design competition, in fact, the largest design competition in the world and these two awards join our award from a few years ago. I think it was 2010 when we received the Red Dot for the S9 platform.","Our clinical research continues to demonstrate the wide-ranging impact of sleep-disordered breathing on a variety of chronic conditions. I want to highlight three recent publications in this space before we go to Brett and then Q&A.","First, on the clinical development front, there have been several recent studies suggesting intriguing links between sleep-disordered breathing and cancer. A pair of studies from 2012 and 2013 suggested an association between sleep apnea and increased risk of cancer incidence and mortality.","Here in 2014 already, just earlier this month, Dr. Sina Gharib and his colleagues published a study in sleep, concluding that effective therapy of OSA with CPAP is associated with alterations in circulating leukocyte gene expression.","They suggested potential novel mechanisms linking OSA with cancer-related pathways. It\u2019s too early to understand the workings of the relationship between obstructive sleep apnea and cancer malignancy or the interactions of CPAP therapy with cancer progression definitively. However, these early investigations confirm the systemic impact of sleep-disordered breathing and the potential benefits offered by our therapies to patients in this category.","Second, in a more commercially-oriented study, Dr. Julian Guest and his colleagues are publishing a study in May and it\u2019s already online in the journal Diabetes Care. They are reporting on a resident-sponsored U.K. based study on a cost and outcomes data over a five-year period, treating patients with type 2 diabetes and concomitant obstructive sleep apnea.","This study concluded that initiating treatment with CPAP in OSA patients with type 2 diabetes leads to significantly lower blood pressure and better control over the diabetes and it affords a cost-effective use of healthcare resources. So it improved outcomes and at better costs.","Third and on the healthcare informatics front, the upcoming American Thoracic Society or ATS 2014 meeting, which will be here in San Diego next month, will feature a presentation demonstrating that our U-Sleep automated adherence and compliance program achieved positive patient outcomes with significant reductions in labor.","The abstract of this presentation is already available online on the ATS website, so it\u2019s in the public domain and it shows that in a randomized trial, with one group receiving standard care, another group receiving standard care plus help with our adherence system called U-Sleep.","The U-Sleep cohort achieved 83% adherence, whereas the standard care group achieved 73% adherence. The U-Sleep system also produced a 59% reduction in labor, that\u2019s 5-9, 59% reduction in labor for those improved outcomes.","This is a validated example of the solutions we bring to our customers to promote not only superior patient outcomes, but also improved customer efficiency and thinking about both the healthcare clinical outcomes and the healthcare economics of the channel.","So, finally in conclusion, we remain focused on the long run. Our markets remain under-penetrated and our patient solutions provide symptomatic relief for those on therapy, while slowing the progression of important chronic diseases, while additionally saving money for the entire healthcare system. We have the right solutions. We have the right people. We have the right approach to succeed. We\u2019re confident that we will continue to do so.","So, now I will turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Brett. Brett, over to you.","Brett Sandercock","Great. Thanks, Mick. Revenue for the March quarter was $397.8 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter, in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 3%. Income from operations for the quarter was $104.7 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter and net income for the quarter was $90 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share were $0.63 for the quarter, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter.","Gross margin for the March quarter was 63.3%, an increase of 90 basis points compared to Q3 FY13. On a year-on-year basis, our gross margin benefited from manufacturing improvements, favorable product mix and favorable currency movements, partially offset by ASP declines.","Looking forward, we expect our gross margin to be in the range of 61% to 63% assuming current exchange rates. Additionally, we continue to execute on initiatives targeting at improving our global manufacturing supply chain and logistics cost structures.","SG&A expenses for the quarter were $115.1 million, an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 7%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.9% compared to the year ago figure of 28.6%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the vicinity of 29% for fiscal year 2014.","R&D expenses for the quarter were $29.5 million, a decrease of 5% over the prior year quarter, in constant currency terms R&D expenses increased by 7%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 7.4%, compared to the year ago figure of 8.1%.","Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for fiscal year 2014. This reflects an ongoing commitment to investing in a diverse product pipeline.","Amortization of acquired intangibles was $2.5 million for the quarter, while stock based compensation expense for the quarter was $11.2 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.3% compared to the prior year quarter effective tax rate of 21.4%. We currently estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2014 will be in the vicinity of 21%.","Turning now to revenue in more detail. Overall sales in the Americas were $216.1 million, consistent with the prior year quarter. Sales outside the Americas totaled $181.7 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas increased by 6% over the prior year quarter.","Breaking out revenue between product segments. In the Americas, flow generator sales were $93.9 million, a decrease of 2% over the prior year quarter, while masks and other sales were $122.2 million, an increase of 2% over the prior year quarter. For revenue outside the Americas, flow generator sales were $118.8 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms an increase of 2%.","Masks and other sales were $62.9 million, an increase of 17% over the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms an increase of 14%. Globally, in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 1% while masks and other increased by 6%. Cash flow from operations was $101.1 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management.","Capital expenditure for the quarter was $17.8 million, while depreciation and amortization for the March quarter totaled $17.2 million. Our share buyback continues to play a major role in our capital management program.","During the quarter, we repurchased 1.64 million shares for consideration of $72.5 million. At the end of March, we had approximately 19.1 million shares remaining under our authorized buyback program. In addition to the share buyback, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, consistent with our previously advised dividend policy.","Our balance sheet remains strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $543 million, while at March 31, total assets stood at $2.4 billion and net equity was $1.7 billion.","I\u2019ll now hand the call back to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from David Stanton from CLSA. Please go ahead.","David Stanton - CLSA","Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my call. I wonder if -- I\u2019ve got two questions, please. Firstly on bundling, we\u2019ve been hearing stories about the fact that there perhaps might be bundling from competitive bidding coming. I\u2019d like some color on that. And then just one for Brett on gross margin going forward, you\u2019ve guided to 61% to 63%. I presume that\u2019s for FY \u201814. Can you give us some color about why the guidance is down for gross margin? Thank you.","Mick Farrell","David, thanks for the question. I\u2019ll take the first part. I\u2019ll hand the second to Brett. Bundling at CMS, yes, we don\u2019t know where CMS is going with this. They have introduced a discussion item and asking for providers and other physicians in the industry to give feedback.","There are two ways to look at this. If CMS does decide to implement bundling, ResMed is not only ready, willing, but also able, to respond to a market like that because we already are in one.","In France, we have a bundling model where providers are paid a fixed amount per member, per month to look after patients on sleep apnea therapy. And we work with them. There are certain minima in terms of the number of masks that they have to provide the number of visits, they have to provide the number of tubing, accessories and filters and interaction with the patients. So our assumption is that CMS, if they did go forward, the bundling approach would have such minima in their programs.","Looking at it from another angle. There was a recent OIG report that looked at the replenishment rates that are currently there for CMS patients in the U.S. And what it found was for the vast majority of patients they are well under half the maxima requirements by the different category units for existing competitive bidding programs.","So we don\u2019t think its way up on the radar. And in response to that OIG report, CMS decided to stay with the current system. So from our perspective, we\u2019d be ready to go with either a bundled model or a not-bundled model. It will be interesting to see where providers land on this but I think that no matter where the market goes, we\u2019ll be prepared to move with it on that front.","Brett, do you want to take the second part of the question regarding gross margin?","Brett Sandercock","Yes. Thanks, Mick. On the gross margin front, we sort of ticked down a little bit. And look, it really is a reflection of some of the ASP declines that we\u2019ve seen recently. And I think that had some impact on our margin in Q3. And we just down-ticked a little bit in terms of margin guidance to account for that.","And the other factor, I suppose, that\u2019s been helping us out over the last little while has been some FX benefit, particularly with the depreciation in the Aussie dollar. That\u2019s flattened out somewhat now. So those FX benefits, I think, were certainly far less than what we\u2019ve experienced in the past, particularly if you look at it on a sequential basis. So they are kind of those two are the underlying drivers of the slight decline expected in the margin.","David Stanton - CLSA","So -- and just to confirm that\u2019s an overall -- that 61% to 63%, that\u2019s an overall number for the rest of FY \u201814 or \u201814, sorry?","Brett Sandercock","Yeah. This is -- as you know, Dave, a lot of moving parts on the margin. So it gets more difficult to predict, but that is, yeah, that is more a Q4 short-term prediction on the margin.","David Stanton - CLSA","","Okay. So that\u2019s Q4. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Clair from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","David Clair - Piper Jaffray","Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess the first one is just on pricing. You mentioned in the commentary that you have done some pricing adjustments. Are these largely done at this point?","Mick Farrell","Sure, David. Well, pricing is an interaction between us and our customers on a day-to-day basis. It\u2019s a supply-and-demand interaction that goes on. If you are asking specifically whether the effect of CB2, particularly on our U.S. market, is playing out, then I think the answer is yes. We\u2019re nine months into the play-out of CB2 within the U.S. market and we\u2019re 12 months into when the prices were announced for CB2 in the U.S. market.","So clearly, our customers have known about this for 12 months in terms of the new pricing. We\u2019ve been working for them over the last nine months. And I think, clearly, in the last quarter, we sent a strong signal to our customers that we\u2019re here to work with you. But I\u2019d like to make the point that we\u2019re here to work with them on two fronts. We\u2019re here to work with them on pricing and terms, but we\u2019re also here to work with them on business efficiency.","So we have the ResMed online store which provides HME partners with an automatic access to order 24\/7, 365 from ResMed. We have electronic data interchange, which not only large nationals, but now a number of the regionals are getting involved with.","We have EasyCare Online, which is an informatics platform available to all our customers. And many, many more patients every day get connected with EasyCare Online. And our providers find it\u2019s a great way to track adherence, drive adherence and measure outcomes.","And finally U-Sleep. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, if you\u2019ve got a trend 10% increase in adherence and you\u2019ve got the opportunity to lower labor costs by 59% by partnering with ResMed then is it all about $1 on the upfront price or is it about $5 saving in the net present value, over a 12, 24 month time period with the patient? So we\u2019re looking at pricing in multiple variants. David, what was your second question?","David Clair - Piper Jaffray","My second question is just -- you described -- it sounds like the U.S. environment is stable to improving. Do you have any metrics you can provide on patient volumes or I guess any color you could provide would be great?","Mick Farrell","Yeah, I\u2019ll ask Jim Hollingshead, our President of the Americas, to address the U.S. market.","Jim Hollingshead","Yeah. I think stable to improving is probably the right way to describe it, David. We don\u2019t have -- as you guys know, on these calls, we don\u2019t have perfect data on underlying market demand. We piece it together, just like you guys did too.","What we\u2019re seeing is really decent patient volume growth. Our general sense is that, as CB2 has stabilized and the Medicare contracts have shifted, a number of the accounts that won Medicare -- a number of our customers that won Medicare contracts are actually seeing growth in volume. The customers who lost Medicare contracts have in many cases, gone out and worked on referrals that would allow them to capture commercial pay patients.","And so you\u2019re seeing some movement in both directions on that front. We think patient growth remains pretty good, both for new patients and also for resupply. So, overall, that trend is, I think, fairly solid in the U.S. market.","David Clair - Piper Jaffray","And then just one last one, if I can sneak it in here. In terms of the AirFit mask launches that are going on right now, do you expect these to carry a price premium to the older masks?","Mick Farrell","Well, traditionally, David, we\u2019ve priced our new masks in line with the products that are currently in market. I mean clearly, we all know that reimbursements generally are moving in a downward trajectory. And so we need to be able to take cost out of the system by business efficiency, but then be able to ensure pricing is relatively stable. So in general, we\u2019ve kept pricing in parity with our new masks with those in the market, or very close to.","And that\u2019s the plan not only for the P10 as you mentioned, the pillows mask, but also for the AirFit N10, the nasal mask and the AirFit F10. The full trilogy now of AirFit masks are in the market and we\u2019re really excited about their potential. But pricing is going to be pretty much on par.","David Clair - Piper Jaffray","","Great. Thank you.","Mick Farrell","Thanks David.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Prior from Bank of America. Please go ahead","Matthew Prior - Bank of America","Yeah good morning guys. Just two questions, both in relation to rest of world flow gen, if I can. Mick, just in terms of the strong comments you made in regards to Europe, if I can just ask any color around France in particular, given that change to informatics regulations as of October. What you\u2019ve seen there; whether that\u2019s helped you in terms of patient compliance or the business model?","And then secondly, just given the 4% growth number out of rest of world flow gen, that still remains somewhat depressed versus prior year. Can you give us some sense as to whether Japan is still dragging there or ex-Europe, what\u2019s going on in terms of rest of world flow gen? Thanks.","Mick Farrell","So, I\u2019ll have a go at the France side. And then I\u2019ll ask Rob Douglas, our President and COO, to talk about Japan. I mean the short answer on France is we don\u2019t break out rest of world, as you know, Matt, into detail. And certainly, we don\u2019t break out Europe and then we don\u2019t break out France on the flow gen front.","But I can talk to you qualitatively about what\u2019s happening in France, which is a very important market for us. The head of the group that looks at regulatory approval and pricing for this market for us in France established a differential reimbursement model for devices that have wireless capability and devices that don\u2019t have wireless capability. And it was a planned, sequential, phased differential between the two different types of product categories.","That was put into place in October last year and has been running for four months. There have been some court appeals by some patient groups and some folks who were involved in the industry that have slowed down the response on that. And that is still in the court for deciding what is the best approach.","From the payer front and from the patient front, we think enabling and liberating the data from the bedside table for the payer, for the patient and for the provider is the best thing. And we think that\u2019s where it\u2019s going to land. Having said that, while this has been in play, we have certainly been able to not only sell our device systems but also our EasyCare Online system, which was ready to go October 1, 2013, when that was put in play.","So we are prepared. We\u2019re already working with our home care providers in France to make that work. And we see good signals ahead as that plays out in France. But I want to say that that play is well beyond just the country of France. We think that will apply not only in France and Germany and the U.K., but also across all of Western Europe and has high potential in that space.","Rob, do you want to address the Japan question?","Rob Douglas","Sure, Matt. Japan remains a lumpy market for us. It\u2019s basically a good market with good reimbursement and really good focus on patient care. But how the -- in terms of specific ordering patterns of our customers and the way their managing their fleet, that type of thing it remains a lumpy market. It hasn\u2019t been a strong quarter for us in Japan.","Matthew Prior - Bank of America","Great. Thanks, guys. And if I can just have one more in terms of the U.S., in particular, on CPAP, Mick, you mentioned last quarter that the price competition was particularly focused in the CPAP category. Have you seen that bleed into APAP at all, in terms of discounting pressure?","Mick Farrell","Matt, we don\u2019t -- as we said on the last call, we don\u2019t go into details on pricing across the whole category of flow gens and certainly won\u2019t go into details on individual categories. But as a summary statement, pricing impacts have been across the board on categories.","And what we\u2019re doing is appropriately pricing across SKUs but across customers, across segments, across geographies for appropriate pricing, to ensure solid volume gain and long-term good revenue growth. And to signal to our customers that we\u2019re therefore doing CB2, but also that we are there for you to drive business efficiency, as well as looking at the upfront pricing.","Matthew Prior - Bank of America","Great, understood. Thanks, guys.","Mick Farrell","Thanks Matt.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bruce Du from CBA. Please go ahead.","Bruce Du - CBA","Yes, can you hear me?","Mick Farrell","Yes. You must have been on mute.","Bruce Du - CBA","Yes. Okay. Great. I just had a question in relation to the masks. And specifically around your experience in terms of the AirFit P10, whether you are predominantly seeing that growth in new patients, or you are seeing actual conversions from existing patients. Given my understanding, obviously, is that historically patients have been quite sticky on masks and you guys obviously would have a benefit if you can convert those patients given the fewer parts in a lot of masks and whatnot. But just could you talk to your experience, in terms of converting the North American patients or whether or not the growth dynamic there is mainly existing versus new patients?","Mick Farrell","Thanks, Bruce. Well, you\u2019re right in that. It is quite sticky. Like a great pair of jeans or a pair shoes that you love, patients tend to stick to the existing product, even when they go for the new purchase and that trend has remained. The AirFit P10, which we launched in January, is now in day 90 in the U.S. market. And as we said earlier, is just launching into Europe and Asia-Pacific, as we speak here in Q4.","So talking about the U.S. these last 90 days, we\u2019re sort of starting that S-curve of penetration of a fantastic new product. I actually personally use the AirFit P10 every night. I wore it last night. And it is an unobtrusive, light and very comfortable mask. And it\u2019s particularly -- its diffusion of the air is so comfortable for the bed partner, that we do expect great success from it. But we expect that success primarily with the new patients.","Bruce Du - CBA","Okay. Great. And just I guess, you referenced before the GAO report, just wondering, obviously one of the things that data point showed was quite a significant consolidation in terms of the market share of the four largest distributors. Is that pretty consistent with what you\u2019re seeing in the Round 2 regions thus far as well?","Mick Farrell","Bruce, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll get the gist of your question. Can you ask it one more time and then Jim and I will have a go at getting to it?","Bruce Du - CBA","It was just in relation to I guess the Round 1, the GAO report recently released showed the concentration of market share in the Round I areas of the four largest DMEs in the U.S. had increased quite considerably over the first 12 months of Round I. I was just wondering whether or not you had seen, I guess a similar pattern evolving the Round 2 regions thus far?","Mick Farrell","Dave, why don\u2019t you -- David Pendarvis, our Chief Administrative Officer and Global General Counsel.","David Pendarvis","Sure. So, Bruce, I\u2019m pretty familiar with that report. And obviously, it was based on some early data, Round 2 of competitive bidding, a much bigger chunk of the overall U.S. market. And as Jim was saying earlier, while we\u2019re seeing things play out in terms of market share shifts in the winners for Medicare patients and also in terms of the commercial patients shifting, it\u2019s probably too early to say whether there\u2019s any significant consolidation along the lines that that report found in Medicare, so just early days. You could posit that it would be the case, but we haven\u2019t seen it yet.","Bruce Du - CBA","Okay. Thank you.","Brett Sandercock","Thanks Bruce.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Matson from Needham & Company. Please go ahead.","Michael Matson - Needham & Company","Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I was just curious about -- with your pricing adjustments, the timing of that. I know you discussed it on your last conference call. But that was already a few months into the March quarter. So is that something that started kind of at the very beginning of the calendar year?","Or was it something that was kind of done mid-quarter? Because I guess your gross margin guidance for the fourth quarter kind of -- fiscal fourth quarter, kind of implies that there\u2019s some additional declines coming in gross margin. So, maybe you could just clarify that for me?","Mick Farrell","Yes. So, Mike, the call that we did was actually in January, so we were in month one of Q3 when we made the call. And we said, we were going to appropriately price to ensure volume gains and revenue gains. And also, as I\u2019ve been focusing on this call, about the efficiency gains that we can provide, the solutions we can give to our HME providers.","I would say, those discussions happened throughout the quarter. With well north of 4,000 customers in the U.S. and you think, globally, you are in the tens of thousands of customers this is something that happens throughout a daily basis, a weekly basis, as we interact with our customers. So, clearly, the spread is throughout the quarter.","Brett\u2019s guidance of $0.61 to $0.63 I think is solid. It takes into account what we have done and have seen and what we expect to see here in Q4. So it all makes sense. And it all makes sense for ensuring we\u2019re appropriately priced, we have got the appropriate terms and we focus on the efficiencies we can provide by talking to customers and providing that value to them.","Michael Matson - Needham & Company","And just so that I get it clearly here, the bulk of these adjustments are -- have already taken place, as of the end of the March quarter? Is that a fair statement? I know you are always having these discussions, but I guess this was kind of a bigger than normal type of cycle that you went through here so?","Mick Farrell","Yes, look, clearly, Mike, there are many factors involved in the supply-demand, our activity, competitive activity, changes in the market. But yeah, as I said earlier, given that we\u2019re 12 months into the pricing of CB2 within the U.S., nine months into the play-out of how it hits the P&L for our U.S. based customers, that being the largest impact change that\u2019s happened on the reimbursement front, I think your assumption is right. The bulk of the impact is there and our guidance going forward is that we\u2019re going to work with our customers to make sure it happens. And we\u2019ll be flexible, based on the needs of the market.","Michael Matson - Needham & Company","Okay. Thanks. And then just one question on the Astral family of products. Is that a completely new product category that you\u2019re entering? Or is that sort of a redesign of an existing product line that you already had?","Mick Farrell","So, I will hand over to Geoff Neilson, our President of the Respiratory Care business.","Geoff Neilson","So that\u2019s a completely new life support product platform. And we do have life-support products through our Elisee and VS lines available in rest of world, but we haven\u2019t brought these products to the U.S. market. So this will be a new product line in the U.S. market. We estimate the global market for that product -- the available market for that product to be around $200 million something and evenly split between the U.S. and Europe. So we\u2019ve got that upside for bringing that product to U.S.","Michael Matson - Needham & Company","Okay. Thanks. And then just one final question on the flow generator business. I know in the past few years you had been seeing a really nice mix shift towards some of the auto setting and bi-levels. And some of that, I guess, was being driven by the move toward home testing. So, are you still seeing that mix shift happening in that part of your business?","Mick Farrell","Mike, we are. Home sleep testing, we are tracking very closely. And on a trailing 12-month basis, between 35% and 40% of U.S. diagnosis and these last 12 months were through home sleep testing. With the prior authorization and the focus of insurance companies on this space, the needle continues to tick up on that. And as you look forward the next 6, 12 months, we\u2019ll be looking at 40% to 45%, approaching 50%, of diagnosis in the home sleep testing front in that timeframe.","So we think we know that that will start to move up and we know that that will drive a mix shift from CPAP to APAP on a continuing basis. We also think the introduction of products like the Astral with its large $200 million addressable market, globally and then you add all the other respiratory care ventilators that we have in our pipeline and will continue to introduce. There\u2019s a lot of upside on the flow generator front in terms of positive mix shift for us.","Michael Matson - Needham & Company","All right. Thanks a lot.","Mick Farrell","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley","Thank you and good morning. Just a couple of quick ones for me, perhaps for Brett; relates to FX. Just if you could give us, Brett, a bit of a guide on the benefits seen in COGS from movements in FX. And secondly, what hedge gains were there, or might there have been in the other income line?","Brett Sandercock","Yeah. Sure, Sean. I\u2019ll do it a few different ways. If you just looked at it sequentially Q2 to Q3, we didn\u2019t see any FX benefit at all come through. It was pretty neutral. We\u2019re still getting some of the benefits coming through if you look at it on a year-on-year basis, so that was in the order of 100 basis points year-on-year was benefiting us, but neutral on a sequential basis. So that was the impact there. And then the other part of that question, Sean?","Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley","The hedge gains in the other income line?","Brett Sandercock","Yeah, that was in the other income. It was in the order of a few million dollars.","Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley","","Perfect. That\u2019s all I have. Thanks, Brett.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Andrew from William Blair. Please go ahead.","Ben Andrew - William Blair","Good afternoon, guys. So, I guess a couple questions for us. Can you give us maybe some other examples of things that suggest to you that the market is stabilizing? Are you seeing promotions decline? Are you seeing kind of quarter-on-quarter pricing changes normalize? Maybe just talk a little bit more about those specific examples in the marketplace.","Mick Farrell","Thanks for the question, Ben. I\u2019ll address some and hand to Jim for some other early indicators here. We talked about this at J.P. Morgan and we\u2019ve talked about it since, but we\u2019re seeing primary care physician\u2019s visits start to pick up. We\u2019re seeing referrals from those primary care physicians related to sleep specifically, whether they are referrals to a sleep lab for a PSG, or to home sleep testing, IDTF type models increase.","So the needles on both of those are moving up. There\u2019s publicly available data from the payers and there\u2019s some from CMS. And there is some private data that we were able to access from talking to some of the private payers. All of those show the needles are ticking up in terms of patient volumes. So the leading indicators on referrals and on the reimbursement are starting to tick up. And those indicate for us, that the stability in the U.S. market is starting to come back and volume growth is picking up.","We also saw volume growth for ourselves during the quarter. We\u2019re not going to go specifically into that because we\u2019re not releasing our ASPs. And so if we give you the volume gains, you\u2019ll be able to reverse calculate that. And we don\u2019t want to do that for competitive reasons. But we know the volumes are starting to stabilize and starting to pick up, not just through the early indicators, but through many interactions we have with our customers. Jim, any more color to add there?","Jim Hollingshead","I think it\u2019s a great question, Ben and it\u2019s difficult to point to concrete thing. But I guess I would point to two or three things. The first one is just to reiterate what Mick just said. Volume growth is strong and volume growth was stronger in Q3 than it had been over the previous couple of quarters, I would say. So that\u2019s a good indication. The topic of conversation with our customers is shifting. Every customer is different and there\u2019s thousands of customers that are different size and different business mixes.","But the conversations we are having now tend to be more about how do I stabilize my own product mix? How do I do X, Y and Z, to drive profitability? That\u2019s a really different topic of conversation than it was, say, right after rates went into effect. And so you can see our customers have worked through some of the chaos that they faced with reimbursement changes and are now stabilizing their own business models and they\u2019re asking different questions.","And we tend to be working with them on things like business efficiency more than we were, say, two quarters ago. And then I\u2019d say, the kind of tone and tenor in the market, just the sort of qualitative feel in the market. This is a very qualitative thing, but I\u2019d say the vibe is a bit better. Nobody is happy about reimbursement rates. None of our customers are and we are not. That continues to be a tough pill to swallow. But the tone and tenor has improved in our conversations with customers and just generally on the market.","Ben Andrew - William Blair","","Okay. And then I guess another question of the two, for me would be to Mick. And if you take the gross margin trends, where the currency is at, you\u2019ve given us pretty specific guidance relative to the fourth quarter, if you will of your fiscal year. If we flow that into \u201815, is that stable? Or is that going to take another step lower, because of the move of some currency as we roll that in?","Mick Farrell","Yeah, Ben. As you know, there are multiple factors that go into gross margin from COGS reductions, mix shifts and exchanges between the euro and the U.S. dollar, the euro and the Aussie and the U.S. dollar and the Aussie. We\u2019ve been able to achieve some fantastic efficiencies through what we\u2019re doing in our Singapore plant and growing there.","We\u2019re doing some great things on the S9 platform in some of the masks that have been out there for a while. But at the same time, we\u2019re introducing new products, which can have an impact on that. Our primary focus is on ensuring topline growth and making sure that goes through. In gross margin, as you saw in this quarter and our guidance for Q4, can be a tool to help us ensure that we continue to have good revenue growth.","So, I know, Ben, you are sort of asking me to posit FY \u201815 GM. We don\u2019t do that. We put it out 90 days and we give that guidance of 61% to 63% that Brett just did, because that\u2019s the sort of time horizon that we think we can predict it on, in a useful manner. So, Q4, 61% to 63%. We\u2019re solid with that. And then in 90 days, we\u2019ll get in touch regarding Q1 for FY \u201815.","Ben Andrew - William Blair","Okay. And maybe just another way of looking at that, is the balance of interests here between volume growth ticking back up? Is your share beginning to tick back up, as you\u2019ve made these adjustments to price, or is share really kind of stabilizing? Even just qualitatively on masks and\/or generators would be helpful? Thanks. ","Mick Farrell","Yeah. Look, I\u2019ll just talk to it generally. I would say our share not only is stabilized, but probably we took a little bit of share when you think about the global scale. And we think that\u2019s the right position for us to be as the market leader. Thanks, Ben.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies","Hi. Thanks gentlemen. I guess, Mick, to just follow up on the market share comments that you just threw out there. I mean, was that specific -- it sounds like you\u2019ve put in a new pricing strategy here in the U.S. and then had sort an effect on market share shifts. So, specifically in the U.S., did those price changes result in a share gain, say, amongst your large DME customers, Lincare, Apria and Rotech, for instance, or did you see more share gains on smaller customers? Just trying to get a sense of how that played out in the quarter.","Mick Farrell","Thanks for the question, Anthony. We don\u2019t go into the detailed share across the categories, certainly not by individual customer type. But qualitatively and generally, looking at the U.S. market specifically, we think -- what we said 90 days ago is that we\u2019re going to appropriately price to ensure that ResMed remains the market leader and ensures providing business efficiency for our customers. We executed on that in the last 90 days and I do think we got some volume share gain.","And clearly, there were some price concessions that were a part of that. But more importantly were the hooks we put into our customers for the long-term, which is we\u2019re working with you, we\u2019re partnering with you and we\u2019re going to help you lower your costs. So it\u2019s a high value for you, the patient and ultimately the payer, who will save as we keep these patients out of hospital and in the home. But, no, we won\u2019t go into further detail than that.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies","Sure. No, fair enough. And maybe just with this new pricing strategy within the U.S. and it seems amongst the competitors, I mean, is there a way where to sort of look out and sort of judge timing-wise, where -- not necessarily it\u2019s a floor, but it goes back to where the normal was, which I think, if we go back a couple of years ago, it was normal to see 4% to 5% price declines in the industry. It seems like it\u2019s more than that now, certainly in the U.S. But is there a time where it gets back to normalization? And then just one quick follow-up on CMS audits. Thanks.","Mick Farrell","Yeah. Anthony, so if you look back at the last five, even 10 years, there are step changes and then there are settling, slow gradient changes that have happened in our industry. Clearly, we have had a step change. I\u2019m not going to go into specifics of percentages and year-on-year, as we talked about 90 days ago. That doesn\u2019t make sense for competitive reasons. But qualitatively thinking about it, there are step changes that happened and that has happened.","Do we expect that stability after a step change? Yes. Are we working towards that? Yes. Would our customers like it? I actually think yes, because stability in this market, now that CB2 has been digested and planning forward now, which is for how do we get to the $40 million to $60 million Americans, right? We\u2019re talking about the U.S. market, $40 million to $60 million Americans that have sleep disordered breathing. Remember we\u2019ve only got $6 million of them diagnosed and treated. It\u2019s going to happen through stability in the investments in working with primary care physicians; working with patient awareness to drive the patients through to the channel. We\u2019re starting to see that stability, starting to see the needle pop up and we\u2019re going to continue to do that. So your third, sneak question there, Anthony, was regard to?","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies","Yeah, I apologize. Just we attended Spring Medtrade and there was just this whole focus on CMS audits of DMEs. I\u2019m just wondering if you have an opinion on that and how that just sort of shaking out? Thanks again.","Mick Farrell","Yeah. Thanks, Anthony. I\u2019ll hand that to Jim.","Jim Hollingshead","Yeah, we think that the audit rate and the procedure for audit is a huge burden on our customers. And we would prefer to see Medicare get their act together.","Mick Farrell","Fair enough. Thanks, Anthony.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Goodsall from UBS. Please go ahead.","Andrew Goodsall - UBS","Thanks very much guys actually, that was a question I had. That was the hot topic we found at Medtrade, as well. And I guess Jim answered that just in terms of the intensity there, I guess they would the intensity they -- I guess you would expect to grow. I guess what my question was, is anything that impacting sales? And is there anything you can do. I know you\u2019ve spoken to U-Sleep to help with DMEs through that audit process?","Mick Farrell","Actually, we\u2019ve seen some stability. Look, I\u2019m not as close to it as Jim, so I\u2019ll let him answer it in a second. From where I\u2019ve seen it and certainly as you look at American Association for Homecare and a lot of the providers now getting on Capitol Hill and working with CMS to understand how to solve this. They are certainly focusing on -- audits are important, because if there\u2019s fraud abuse, you need to catch it and move it out. But you can\u2019t have the one bad apple spoil the whole barrel.","And clearly, that\u2019s the message from the providers. And clearly, nine, 12 months into these changes, I think even CMS and the auditors are starting to realize that changing the game and ensuring these patients stay out of hospital is the right thing for the U.S. healthcare system; and particularly, Medicare going through all the changes it\u2019s going through right now and all the patients coming in with the Affordable Care Act. So as we look towards it, we actually see some stability rather than growing of the audits, in terms of how they are looking at it. But, Jim, I don\u2019t know if you have any color there.","Jim Hollingshead","So what I would say is we have very little we can do about Medicare and how they\u2019re doing audits. So it\u2019s a burden on our customers because, as you guys know, there\u2019s a big backlog in audits and Medicare is not processing them, in many cases, in a timely fashion. And that hurts our customers\u2019 cash flow, because their payments get held up.","And so, it is a hot topic. And it\u2019s understandable that it\u2019s a hot topic. We don\u2019t see any measurable, direct impact on sales, because patients come in the door and they need to get set up and DMEs will set them up. But it\u2019s frustrating for us to watch what our customers have to go through in that regulatory environment that is actually not operating efficiently, right. So, I think it\u2019s a positive that there\u2019s a spotlight put on it. So it\u2019s something that\u2019s been raised and I think it has been raised also at the Congressional level. Now it\u2019s gotten some scrutiny and the OIG has looked at it and so on. So, hopefully, there will be a resolution.","I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to get more intense before it gets better. But, as I said, I think it would be better if Medicare could find a way to relieve that, especially the backlog. It\u2019s completely appropriate for Medicare to be policing what DMEs do, what -- in any space that they are reimbursing and making sure that there\u2019s no fraud and abuse and that patients are being treated appropriately. But to place an extra burden in terms of volume of audits and then not be able to process them within their own guidelines is arguably unfair and needs to be corrected.","Mick Farrell","I guess the follow-on there is just from a technology front; is there anything that you can bring to the table I guess going forward that might help them with the informatics and the documentation they need to provide here?","Jim Hollingshead","","I think we\u2019re looking at a range of solutions that are business process automation solutions. Every flow point, every business flow point for our customers is an area under scrutiny. And with some areas in development, we\u2019re not going to talk about our product roadmap for competitive reasons.","Andrew Goodsall - UBS","Sure.","Mick Farrell","Thanks for your questions, Andrew.","Andrew Goodsall - UBS","Perfect. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ian Abbott from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs","Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Firstly, just looking at the sequentially -- a question for Brett -- looking at the impact of FX on gross margin, heading into Q4. I know it\u2019s been quite volatile over the last few months. Can you perhaps give a bit of color as to what that impact will be?","Brett Sandercock","Yeah. I think going into Q4 -- look, I\u2019d estimate we\u2019re at probably a slight positive for us, probably in the order of 30 basis points on a sequential basis. It will probably eat a little bit. The currency has been jumping around a lot likely; it\u2019s pretty volatile. So I think that you\u2019d probably see a small benefit in Q4. And then on a sequential basis, you kind of lose that, I think, going forward into Q1. But it\u2019s nothing like what we were getting over the 12 months year-on-year period. It is starting to certainly flatten out.","Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then my second question is on the accounts receivable. That seemed to go up quite significantly during that balanced state. Is there anything driving that? And would you think that would normalize going forward?","Brett Sandercock","Revenues are up sequentially and the receivables would be up. If I look at the days sales, that\u2019s pretty much in our -- how we look at it, pretty much in our historical range that we look at, Ian. So it might be an uptick in absolute terms, but I think when you look at DSOs, that it looks in the range.","Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs","Great. Okay. Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Wheen from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Steve Wheen - JPMorgan","Yeah, good morning. And I just wanted to ask about the new product launches that you have. What sort of impact they -- you could expect to see on the gross margin, from perhaps efficiencies in manufacturing processes?","Mick Farrell","Well, so, we\u2019ve launched the AirFit P10, the AirFit N10, the AirFit F10, as well as the Astral, so it\u2019s quite a complex set of products to talk to. Rob, do you want to have a go? ","Robert Douglas","Yes. I mean, again, Steve, we don\u2019t break out all the details of this. But, generally, our policy with our R&D and our product teams is to continually improve products by making them simpler, less parts and better supplier relationships. Obviously, as you introduce new products, you then restart on an experience curve, which you then start putting on continuous improvements onto and that will ramp down.","And then as we go up the learning curve, building initial launch volumes and all of that type of thing, it\u2019s quite a complex thing. So there\u2019s many factors at play here. And then net of it is -- the intent of our product program is to drive cost out of the products and keep trying to improve them and make them better in many parameters. And we expect to see that continuing.","Steve Wheen - JPMorgan","Okay. And just also in the gross margin, we\u2019ve been seeing that - this perhaps is a question for Brett that mix shift advantage from CPAP to APAP. Has that largely run out now, that we\u2019re -- I would say, probably to move into that sort of shift? And are we more, now, just particularly in this quarter, seeing mix shift advantages just because masks will be greater than flow generators?","Brett Sandercock","Yes, Steve. I think, look at over the last few years, you can probably -- that shift, or mix shift impact, has probably moderated overtime either time. I think it\u2019s still up and it\u2019s moderated to some extent. But I think some of the other new generation platforms such as Astral and so on -- as we get through that, as we get deeper into FY \u201815, I think some of those will be supportive of product mix and then supportive of gross margin as well. But it\u2019s really early -- as Rob said, it\u2019s really early days in the launch. We have three new mask products. We have the brand-new Astral platform. And we do certainly see, as we work through a lot of the margin expansion initiatives, that we can drive those costs, over the next 12 months as our experience increases on these new products and certainly think we can get some upside there, Whether that plays out in manufacturing efficiencies and product mix, I think there areas there that are certainly providing potential for us in my view.","Steve Wheen - JPMorgan","And so I guess and more specifically to the quarter, was there quite an advantage, just given that very strong mask growth rate from a mix shift perspective?","Brett Sandercock","You know what? If I looked at it -- so if I look at it year-on-year, we still had a strong. If f you like, we still had product mix benefits flowing through and that was meaningful. If you look at it purely sequentially, it was more of much smaller -- it was a much smaller impact.","Steve Wheen - JPMorgan","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Andrew Hanover - BMO Capital Markets","Thanks for taking our questions. This is Andrew Hanover in for Joanne Wuensch. I just wanted to ask a couple, or one, strategic question. And that is in relation to Japan and what will it take to get Japan on more steady footing?","Mick Farrell","Andrew, I will hand that question to Rob Douglas. ","Robert Douglas","So, on Japan, it\u2019s a long project for us. It\u2019s always been a lumpy market. And quite frankly, that\u2019s just the way structure -- the way that our customers are structured and the way they run their business. For us, it means it\u2019s a very efficient market. There\u2019s only a small number of customers. They are running these large businesses. It\u2019s good market for us, because we don\u2019t need a large team to service it, but we do have the downside of this lumpiness.","So we don\u2019t see that type of structure changing at all. In a sense, some of that lumpiness will continue. Our view of the Japan market is that underlying it, it\u2019s actually still quite underpenetrated. And so our efforts are generally around either providing clinical evidence of the benefit of our products in Japan, or driving demand and patient awareness in the medical system there to drive patients in. That\u2019s got to be offset by relationships with the reimbursement authorities in Japan, so that -- or the funding can all add up to that, as well, But that\u2019s been an ongoing project and we\u2019ll keep on with that strategy.","Andrew Hanover - BMO Capital Markets","Great. And actually one more question and it\u2019s in relation to diagnostic testing. Back in October, you said that approximately 35% of diagnostic tests were being performed home -- via home sleep testing. And it was supposed get to 40% to 45% in the U.S. over the next 12 months. Just wanted to get a perspective or an update on that. Thank you.","Mick Farrell","Yeah. So, Andrew, I just said a little earlier in the Q&A that we\u2019re a little north of that 35% from October. We\u2019re now looking at 35% to 40%, so the needle is still moving up. It\u2019s not moving up as fast as it was, but it\u2019s moving up in that sort of 5% increments over those two quarters.","As we look forward towards October, at the end of this year, we still think it will be at that 40% to 45% area. And even by the end of the calendar year, that 45% might tick-up a little and start to approach 50%. But it\u2019s payer-by-payer; it\u2019s group-by-group. And it has really been driven by the payer authorities working with their sleep physicians and the home sleep testing as well as the sleep labs, to ensure that patients can get through on therapy.","Moving to a scaled one, allowing the mix shift from CPAP to APAP, we see that trend continuing to play out. Jim, do you want to provide some more color? ","Jim Hollingshead","Yeah, I\u2019d just add a couple of interesting tidbits on that. The first one is that our data show that, right now, roughly 60% of sleep labs are doing home sleep testing. And that\u2019s pretty dramatic movement over the last several months. Many sleep labs were trying to avoid doing home sleep testing, but now roughly 60% are engaged in home sleep testing. And the other thing that\u2019s quite interesting in our dataset with sleep labs -- sleep labs that do actively engage with home sleep testing actually end up doing more overall volume, including in-lab overnight volume. And so both of those things suggest that home sleep testing adoption will continue to move forward. Now that sleep labs are realizing that it\u2019s in their interest to do it as well.","Operator","We are now at the one-hour mark. So I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell for his final remarks. ","Mick Farrell","Great. Thanks, John. As always, I\u2019d like to thank all of you on this conference call for your interest and your support of ResMed. Most importantly, I\u2019d like to thank the global ResMed team, providing solutions in over 100 countries, for your focus on changing the lives of millions of patients with every breath.

My name is Adrienne and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Agnes, you may begin.","Agnes Lee","Thank you, Adrienne. And thank you for attending ResMed's live webcast. Joining me on the call today are Mick Farrell, our CEO and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release, it can be found on our website at investor.resmed.com.","I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the Company, corporate strategy and performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in filings made by ResMed with the SEC.","I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell.","Mick Farrell","Thanks, Agnes and thank you to our shareholders who are joining us on today's investor call as we provide an overview of our Q3 fiscal year 2015 results. I'm pleased to report that we continued to make excellent progress from new product launches in our core sleep disorder breathing market. We also saw solid progress in our cardiology and respiratory care markets during the quarter.","In these opening remarks, I'll discuss our high-level top and bottom line results, our progress in healthcare informatics and the early trajectory of our latest product and solution launches globally. Finally, I'll cover progress against our longer-term three horizons growth strategy. Then I'll turn the call over to Brett in Sydney, our CFO to walk you through our financial results in greater detail.","As you saw in our press release, our global business achieved double-digit revenue growth of 13% on a constant currency basis during the quarter. Including currency headwinds, our global growth was 6% on a year-on-year basis in U.S. dollars.","We saw strength in our Americas group, with continued double-digit growth in the region, driven by robust sales growth in flow generators as well as high-single-digit constant currency growth in our combined European and Asia-Pacific region. These results were fueled by the success of new product launches in sleep apnea and respiratory care markets, including both COPD and neuromuscular disease states.","Looking at the bottom line, our diluted earnings per share was $0.65 on a non-GAAP basis. EPS was $0.64 on a GAAP basis. In the Americas, we had strong performance in Q3 sales, with the commercial team there driving 16% year-on-year growth. We're particularly pleased with flow generator growth in the region which was over 40%. This exceptional result was driven by the ongoing successful rollout of our Astral, our AirSense 10 and our AirCurve 10 platforms.","Customers continue to see the value proposition of our healthcare informatics platform that we have branded Air Solutions. This platform continues to drive our flow generator success. The strong flow generator sales were partially offset by lower mask sales.","On that front, we're still facing annualization of price adjustments that we made from January through to June in 2014. In addition, we're facing a tough competitive environment in the mask category. However, we're confident that we will return to positive growth in the mask and accessory category as we move forward.","Moving on to our combined European and Asia-Pacific region, we grew at a very solid 9% on a constant currency basis in the quarter. After we account for the strong currency headwinds, particularly from the declining euro and the strong U.S. dollar, headline growth declined by 6% for the combined Europe and Asia-Pacific region. We saw strong sales growth from flow generators in Europe associated with our new product launches as well as steady growth in masks in the region.","With the latest launch of our AirCurve 10 bilevel flow generator platform in Europe, we continue to add to the broad suite of launches with solid multiyear product life cycles.","There continues to be strong interest in respiratory care and cardiorespiratory opportunities across the European region. We have seen good adoption of our Astral platform in Europe and we're excited about future opportunities as we combine Astral with our healthcare informatics solutions.","We continued to work with our European and Asia-Pac teams to develop treatment pathways that facilitate standard-of-care protocols, including both pulmonary and cardiology physician groups in both hospital and home care environments. As an important component of our SERVE-HF clinical trial, we're investing in cardiology awareness, cardiology screening and cardiology diagnostic referral infrastructure to the pulmonary folks in the European region and beyond. I will discuss SERVE HF in more detail later on in these remarks.","In Asia-Pac, we're continuing to execute on our strategies for longer-term growth while working across a variety of mask and market delivery channels. In addition, we had strong double-digit growth in key emerging market countries, particularly China, as we continue to build for the future in those markets.","Let me spend a few moments reviewing some of the background behind our progress in informatics. As outlined earlier, we call our healthcare informatics ecosystem Air Solutions. Air Solutions is providing significant quantifiable value to our customers, leading to discretionary share gains in flow generators sales.","More importantly, Air Solutions use liberating data to help patients, physicians, providers, government and private payers and other partners in the healthcare delivery channel. We're seeing the results of our innovation, even though it is just over seven months since the launch of our first AirSense 10 product. Customers have recognized the value of Air Solutions, an end-to-end system that can help them one, lower costs; two, drive efficiencies; three, increase patient adherence; and four, improve patient care.","During the quarter, we further enhanced the Air Solutions ecosystem through the integration of our AirView software with leading healthcare informatics partners. We also announced the acquisition of Jaysec. Jaysec is a provider of Internet-based software solutions for our home medical equipment customers. This acquisition allows us to deliver automated, streamlined business solutions, such as mask and accessory resupply systems, that are both cost effective and drive efficiencies for our HME partners. We're offering all Jaysec products to all customers.","We see many opportunities to enhance and expand our informatics solution as the broader healthcare industry continues to move towards connected care models. We will use our newest core competence in healthcare informatics to drive channel efficiencies, to unlock cost savings and most importantly, to improve patient outcomes.","Let me drill into the detail of our new product launches just a little. We launched the AirCurve 10 in the U.S. in December. And although it is still early days, we had good uptake and excellent customer feedback in this, our first full quarter of sales.","We also launched the AirCurve 10 in Europe during Q3. This included an important new device, the AirCurve CS PaceWave. PaceWave is our brand name for our proprietary minute ventilation-targeted adaptive servo-ventilation therapy.","The acronym for this algorithm is MVASV. But I think that PaceWave is easier to remember. Our PaceWave algorithm is unique and highly protected with patents and other intellectual property. As part of the AirCurve 10 launch, we added Air Solutions, our cloud-based software solutions technology, to our bilevel, our noninvasive ventilation and our adaptive servo-ventilation platforms. The combination of the AirCurve 10 CS PaceWave with our Air Solutions platform is particularly powerful, given the hospitalization rates and the severity of disease for patients who suffer from heart failure and concomitant sleep apnea.","For our mask and accessories category, the market remains stable, but competitive. As I stated earlier, we're confident that we will return to solid growth in the mask and accessory category as we move forward.","Now I would like to take a broader longer-term view and spend some time talking about progress against our global three horizons growth strategy. In our first horizon of growth which includes our core sleep apnea market, we have continued to drive healthcare informatics solutions that meet our customers' needs for efficiency, patient adherence and improved outcomes.","Our recent acquisition of Jaysec and completing our integration with leading informatics partners are good milestones in that journey. We're taking advantage of future opportunities to grow even more connected care solutions with customers through the AirCurve 10 launch.","Reimbursement remains relatively stable across our geographies, including the U.S. Last week, our U.S. customers welcomed positive news as Obama signed the doc fix bill which added anti-fraud provisions to competitive bidding. This change requires binding bids and proof that a DME or HME is licensed in the state that it is providing products to customers.","Although this legislation does not impact current bidding rounds, it will have a positive impact on future recompete rounds. The bottom line is that this should improve the quality of bidders to ensure that they deliver good service to patients and it should improve the stability of the channel. On the legal front, we won an injunction against a Chinese-based competitor in Germany during February. The Munich District Court upheld its injunction that prohibits the sale or distribution of that company's masks that infringe our patents.","At ResMed, we're committed to protecting our world-leading respiratory medical innovation and we will defend our more than 5000 patents and designs so that we can continue to innovate and continue to change millions of lives as we move forward. We will continue to take action to enforce our intellectual property and to defend our significant investment in research and development.","Our global R&D investment is holding strong, at approximately 7% of our revenues, with a focus on pioneering clinical research, world-leading biomedical engineering and cutting-edge healthcare informatics.","Moving on to our second horizon of growth, we're making solid progress on two fronts, our respiratory care market as well as our emerging markets growth. The European respiratory care business is growing from the strong base that we have developed over the last decade and more. In the U.S., we continue to build our respiratory care channels and our strength in those channels. There is a very long runway ahead for COPD and neuromuscular disease patients to be helped by our Astral life-support ventilator and our other offerings.","The Astral platform allows patient care to take place in the home rather than in the hospital, providing better quality of life for patients, including caregivers and loved ones and simultaneously taking costs out of strained healthcare systems.","On the geographic expansion component of horizon two, we continue to make progress in our emerging markets, with solid double-digit growth this quarter. We've increased our investment in these markets and are executing on our long term strategies in China, India, Brazil, as well as Eastern Europe., where there are great opportunities to improve patient outcomes and reduce costs across these emerging markets.","Our third horizon of growth focuses on cardiorespiratory conditions, with an emphasis on central sleep apnea and Cheyne-Stokes respiration, particularly in heart failure patients. There is growing momentum in the heart failure and sleep apnea space and we continue to facilitate strong partnerships between cardiologists and critical care and pulmonary physicians.","There have been a number of new studies this quarter that continue to build a connection between heart failure and SDB, including obstructive sleep apnea, central sleep apnea and Cheyne-Stokes respiration. At the American College of Cardiology, or ACC, meeting here in San Diego, we sponsored two posters on sleep disordered breathing in patients with chronic heart failure. One of the posters with final data from nearly 7000 patients in Germany showed that 46% of patients with stable chronic heart failure had moderate to severe SDB, AHI north of 15. That's almost every second patient that walks in the cardiologists' door.","The second poster from Thomas Jefferson University suggested that treating SDB in chronic heart failure patients may reduce hospital admission and hospital readmission rates. In addition, Ohio State University research has published a study in January showing that patients with untreated sleep apnea have worse prognosis for mortality after they have been discharged from the hospital for acute heart failure.","The data suggests that those that had their sleep apnea treated with PAP therapy improved survival rates, approximately to rates that were similar to patients who had heart failure with minimal or no sleep apnea. This study supports the work that we're doing on our SERVE-HF and our CAT-HF clinical trials. Focusing now on those trials. Our SERVE-HF trial in Europe and Australia is going well. In fact, data collection has been occurring at a faster pace during these last three months.","As a result, we're now expecting presentation of the SERVE-HF data by the primary investigators to occur before the end of calendar year 2015. This is slightly ahead of the timeline that we discussed on our Q2 call.","For our CAT-HF clinical trial in the U.S., we still expect that the CAT-HF results will be available during calendar year 2017. As a reminder, SERVE-HF is powered to show changes in mortality and morbidity in heart failure patients with CSA, while CAT-HF is powered show improvements in global cardiovascular outcomes. Both trials lead to a potential change in guiding principles and standard-of-care for heart failure patients.","It is important to note that both studies use ResMed's proprietary minute ventilation-targeted adaptive servo-ventilation technology which the acronym again is MVASV, that we have branded PaceWave. We will continue to provide updates as significant milestones are reached in both of these important and pioneering clinical trials. We remain active on the capital management front, including share buybacks and dividends. You will hear more about these actions in Q3 from Brett in a couple of minutes.","Additionally, we continue to look at M&A opportunities that are aligned with our long term three horizon growth strategy and assets that we can leverage, manage better than the current owners and enhance long term shareholder value.","Let me close with this. We're excited about our long term outlook and our three horizons growth strategy. We're progressing on our journey to change 20 million lives by 2020 in both sleep and broader respiratory medicine. We're executing well to that plan.","With that, I will turn the care over to Brett in Sydney for a more detailed review of our Q3 financials. Brett?","Brett Sandercock","Great. Thank you, Mick. As Mick has noted, our revenue for the March quarter was $422.5 million, an increase of 6% over the prior-year quarter. And in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 13%. Movements in exchange rates, predominantly a weaker euro relative to the U.S. dollar, negatively impacted revenue by approximately $28.5 million in the third quarter.","At a geographic level, overall sales in the Americas were $250.9 million, an increase of 16% over the prior-year quarter. Sales in Europe and Asia-Pacific totaled $171.6 million, a decrease of 6% over the prior-year quarter. But in constant currency terms, sales in Europe and Asia-Pacific increased by 9% over the prior-year quarter.","Breaking out revenue between product segment, Americas' flow generators sales were $133.1 million, an increase of 42% over the prior-year quarter. While masks and other sales were $117.8 million, a decrease of 4% over the prior-year quarter.","For revenue in Europe and Asia-Pacific, flow generator sales were $115.9 million, a decrease of 2% over the prior-year quarter. And in constant currency terms, an increase of 13%. Masks and other sales were $55.7 million, a decrease of 11% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 3%. Globally in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 26%, while masks and other decreased by 1% over the prior-year quarter.","Gross margins for the March quarter were 59.5%, lower than guidance essentially due to larger-than-expected depreciation of the euro during the quarter and outperformance on Americas flow generator growth. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin contracted by 380 basis points, reflecting declines in average selling prices, unfavorable product mix, unfavorable geographic mix and adverse currency movements.","Looking forward in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we expect gross margin to be broadly consistent with Q3, being in the range of 59% to 60%, assuming current exchange rates. Gross margin drivers, like currency fluctuations and geographic and product mix could swing this range further if they move beyond their expectations.","We do expect to see some traction in late Q4 from our cost-out programs for the AirSense platform and should see ongoing benefits from our cost-out programs, including procurement, production and logistics improvements reflected in our fiscal year 2016 gross margin.","Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $116.3 million, an increase of 1% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 10%, primarily due to higher variable employee compensation, the impact of recent acquisitions and the release of contingent consideration in the prior-year quarter. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 27.5% compared to the year-ago figure of 28.9%.","Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 27% to 28% in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. R&D expenses for the quarter were $27 million, a decrease of 8% over the prior-year quarter. But on a constant currency basis, an increase of 4%. This increase largely reflects incremental investment in the areas of healthcare informatics and cardiology. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.4% compared to the year-ago figure of 7.4%.","Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. This reflects our ongoing commitment to investing in our diverse product pipeline, informatics solutions and clinical trials, but also a benefit of the weaker Australian dollar, in which the majority of our R&D is denominated.","Amortization of acquired intangibles was $2.2 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $11.7 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.4%. We estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2015 will be in the range of 20% to 21%.","Net income for the quarter was $91 million, an increase of 1% over the prior-year quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.64, an increase of 2% over the prior-year quarter. Foreign exchange movements negatively impacted third-quarter earnings by $0.02 per share, reflecting the impact from the weaker euro, partially offset by the weaker Australian dollar.","Cash flow from operations was $90.9 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and a modest increase in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $10.6 million, while depreciation and amortization for the March quarter totaled $17.9 million. We've continued to be active on the capital management front and our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share. And during the quarter, we repurchased 300,000 shares for consideration of $20.3 million.","For the first nine months of fiscal year 2015, we have repurchased 1.8 million shares for consideration of $96.7 million. At the end of March, we had approximately 16.5 million shares remaining under our authorized share repurchase program. To-date in fiscal year 2015, we have returned 92% of free cash flow to our shareholders via dividends and repurchases. And over the last five years, we have returned 98% free cash flow to our shareholders via dividends and repurchases.","Our balance sheet remains very strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $406 million. And at March 31, total assets were $2.3 billion and net equity was $1.5 billion.","And with that, I will hand the call back to Agnes.","Agnes Lee","Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A. And we ask that everyone limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question only. If you have additional questions after that, please get back into the queue. Adrienne, we're now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Andrew Goodsall from UBS. Please go ahead.","Andrew Goodsall","I was just going to perhaps focus on masks. Just trying to sort of understand when we might expect -- or what internally you're seeing yourself doing when we might expect, I guess, that to sort of show up in the numbers in terms of recovery against, perhaps, when you moved your prices last year. And perhaps just a comment on the percentage conversion you might be seeing of your flow generators in the mask conversion -- why that's up perhaps a little higher?","Mick Farrell","That question allows us to talk a little bit about the mask side. And we're expecting to return to positive growth, not just in the Americas, but globally, to continue good trends we have outside the Americas. The mask category continues to be competitive Andrew, but stable. We'll be annualizing those price declines that we made a year ago, January through June of 2014, through January through June 2015. So we're over the halfway point, but there is still some sort of time to -- as we went customer by customer, region by region, for those to annualize.","So as we look forward, we will get back to positive growth. And we have a strong mask portfolio and a good pipeline to follow beyond that.","Andrew Goodsall","And is it reasonable to sort of expect that you're achieving some level of, I guess, conversion along with the flow generator with your bundling or looking to sell the solution as a combined solution?","Mick Farrell","Andrew, there is some halo effect, certainly when you walk in with the value proposition of the AirSense 10 and the Air Solutions. And as you saw, stellar growth of 42% year-on-year in the Americas there. You've obviously got a sales force with a lot of interest from their customers. And it allows conversations to start, obviously, about other parts of the business, like ventilation, like respiratory care and like masks.","So I do think there are some halo effects that come from that. But I think some of the more important factors are the fact that we're annualizing the January to June price adjustments. The market is competitive and our team is getting back on the front foot in that category while winning very strongly in some other categories.","Operator","And the next question comes from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Please go ahead.","Margaret Kaczor","Couple ones from me. Can you maybe comment on U.S. generator growth which clearly accelerated this quarter. How sustainable is that? And are you seeing a similar growth rate that you saw in AirSense 10 last quarter or is that also accelerating?","Mick Farrell","Margaret, I'll take the first part of that question and I'll hand to Jim Hollingshead, President of the Americas, for the second one. Clearly, with a number like that that we probably haven't seen since 2006, 2007 of 42% growth for the quarter year-on-year in flow generators in the Americas, you're not just growing with the market. You're clearly taking some share.","So to the extent that there is market share taking, that can happen for a period of time and then that period of time ends. But we do think that there's strong growth in the core U.S. market and, frankly, in our core global markets in the sleep disorder breathing space. And we expect that to continue, because we're vastly underpenetrated in developed markets as well as our developing and emerging markets.","Jim, would you like to add any more color that?","Jim Hollingshead","Sure, Mick. Thanks. And thanks for the question, Margaret. We think that the flow gen growth represents not just the fact that the AirSense 10 platform and the AirCurve 10 platform are really strong products in their own right as flow gens and bilevels, but also the recognition on the part of our customers of the value of the all-in solution that we're offering.","So both of those platforms have onboard communications, but it goes beyond just having an onboard modem. It allows our customers to drive efficiencies into their businesses through the use of our solution software platform. So the number of features related to our software that are driving efficiencies in our customers' business and we think we have a very clear advantage with the overall offer in the market right now that customers are taking advantage of.","Margaret Kaczor","Okay. So you guys are seeing kind of similar or maybe accelerating growth in AirSense as kind of the way that I read maybe that answer. And then Brett, can you walk us through the gross margins this quarter? You guys broadly talked about FX. Which currencies are most important? And then just to make sure, the price declines that you guys cited in the press release are really year over year versus sequential.","Brett Sandercock","On the gross margin, it's all the margin drivers, essentially, but I think it's happened for long time is really mostly sort of headwinds for us this time around. So we had, obviously, year-on-year your currency impact was negative for us.","That's really being driven by the euro which has declined quite significantly, as I think everybody knows. We do get some offset for the Aussie dollar weakening, but to some extent, that's to the lag the quarter before it turns up in margin.","So I do expect -- well, all things being equal on currency which is probably a big assumption, but I do expect with that Aussie weakness, some of that benefit will flow through into Q4 for us. We haven't seen that in Q3, but we do cop up front, if you like, that euro falls straightaway. So I think that's something that will help us going into Q4. But then you have other -- the product mix and geographic mix and really that's kind of driven by flow gen outperformance in the U.S.. So you've got that geographic impact and that product mix impact. And they've been negative for us as well.","And really, even on the sort of optimization of production and manufacturing, something that we have a really good track record on, really haven't been able to focus on that just at the moment. We've really been looking to make sure that we meet demand in the marketplace. And obviously take for granted that we absolutely don't compromise on quality either, but what we have had to do is probably just delay a little bit on the cost-out programs. We're obviously getting on to those now and I think we'll see some benefit there.","There are other things, like we've been running with much higher air freight than we typically would. Again, that's really a consequence of meeting demand, particularly on that flow gen growth number that you saw. So there is just a number of factors. A lot of those are kind of first-class problems to have. And the ones in the cost side though, they are under our control and we'll absolutely get on top of those.","Margaret Kaczor","Is there anything that you can quantify in that in terms of the FX impact this quarter?","Brett Sandercock","Yes. If you looked at -- yes, I mean, the year-on-year -- without -- I don't get too granular, but it's quite meaningful, as it's north of 50 basis points negative.","Operator","And your next question comes from Steve Wheen from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Steve Wheen","Just a follow-up question on the gross margin. Brett, there is a lot of I guess, things that you can do going forward. I was just surprised to see your guidance for the fourth quarter be very much the same as third quarter. So can you tell us what is sort of holding you back on that front?","Brett Sandercock","I guess just looking at what we're seeing in terms of product and geographic trends, okay which it probably tend to be negative on that. But offsetting that, I think we'll see some benefit from the weaker Aussie and we will start to see some of our cost-out program gain some traction. So when you look at it, we have some -- going forward, looks like we have some negative drivers, if you like and then there is some positive ones. And there is a question of what the timing is like and how they balance up.","And when I looked at it, I think in that kind of short term, where we broadly consistent with where we're in Q3, when we look forward and we look at some of the things that are coming through, if you think of the AirCurve on the bilevels, if you think of Astral and as we build that market in the U.S., clearly, those sort of products will be supportive of the margin. I think we'll get some momentum on our cost-out programs; that will be supportive of the margin.","So you can see some of these shorter-term headwinds, I think, will certainly abate. And then some of them, I think, will turn positive for us. Yes, if you look forward, I think optimistic on the margin, but at the moment, we're dealing with quite a few headwinds. But notwithstanding those, I think the margin is in pretty good shape.","Steve Wheen","And could you just sort of provide some comment on some of the rest-of-world markets, maybe France, Germany and Japan? Perhaps most interest in Japan as to -- that's obviously been quite historically lumpy. What your experience was in the latest quarter for that region?","Mick Farrell","Steve, that's great question. I'll hand to Rob Douglas, our President and Chief Operating Officer, to talk through those.","Rob Douglas","Thanks, Steve. So Japan, yes, is historically lumpy. It had a pretty good quarter this quarter with the products getting good take up going well. We continue to have excellent relationships with our customers and we stay in close touch. And the market there is very stable and moving along well, but will continue to be lumpy through the ordering patterns.","Europe had a pretty good quarter as well. France performed well. There is still the debate going on in France over the telemonitoring, where for a while the rules were very supportive of telemonitoring and many, many telemonitored units were in the market there. But at the moment, it's still in a sort of a government legal case while they decide what their future policy is going to be, but the market there is again, stable and moving along well. And Germany is also moving well, both our home care business has been winning business and also our wholesale business there is working well. So Germany is moving well.","Call out a highlight -- the UK has been very strong and some of our market development programs there are really gaining traction. And the basic fundamentals of the benefit of treating sleep apnea is so well understood in the healthcare system there that we're seeing good progress.","Operator","And your next question comes from Chris Kallos from Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Chris Kallos","Brett, just to clarify, the adverse product mix in the U.S., you are suggesting that the success of the flow generators being a low-margin product has impacted the margin. Is that clear -- is that what you're saying?","Brett Sandercock","Yes, that's correct.","Chris Kallos","And just the other question I had was just can we get an update on Astral? How that's tracking?","Brett Sandercock","Sure, Chris. We'll take a broader view on that. Astral has had a good two or three quarters of runway in our European markets. And in those markets, Chris, we have more than a decade of established partnerships on the pulmonary critical care discharge from the hospital to home care environment. So Astral is seeing very good success and as Rob just sort of went into detail a little bit around France, Germany, UK and beyond in Western Europe.","In the U.S. market, we launched it later. We launched it sort of in the August-September time frame. And in the U.S. market particularly, we're still developing the respiratory care channel and our strength and capability to sell into that. Having said that, we have many thousands of customers in the U.S. and all of them are now aware that ResMed has a life support ventilator, that it's called Astral and that it has some great benefits, such as giving freedom back to patients or the battery that can extend up to 24 hours away from home. So giving freedom back to their patients.","So we think there are some great sort of unique selling propositions around it which will give us over the coming fiscal quarters and fiscal years, frankly, an opportunity to grow that business in that geography. So we're excited about Astral as a long term sustainable opportunity for us to drive high-margin flow generator growth.","Operator","Next your question comes from Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Sean Laaman","Guys, I'm wondering if you can just talk about the pricing strategy on U.S. devices, particularly compared to the prior corresponding period. Thanks.","Jim Hollingshead","Sean, we haven't made any dramatic changes to our pricing strategy. The biggest thing we're seeing in pricing in the U.S., as we've discussed on the call, is the grandfathering in of some changes we made to our pricing approach last year at this time. So we're still working through some of the pricing changes we made during Q3 and Q4 of last year and that's grandfathering through. But other than that, we haven't made any dramatic changes to pricing.","Sean Laaman","And just one follow-up. Were there any sort of lumpy contracts in the U.S. device business sort of won or lost during the quarter compared to the prior corresponding period? Thanks.","Mick Farrell","But we don't go into details on a customer basis. It just doesn't make sense to go into that level of detail for competitive reasons on a public conference call like this. Thanks for the question, but we really can't answer that.","Operator","And your next question comes from Mike Matson from Needham. Please go ahead.","Mike Matson","I guess I just wanted to go back to the gross margin. I know you mentioned the various factors that affected it, but I was just wondering -- if one, if you could quantify those. I know some of my other companies will talk about specific basis point impacts for currency, pricing, etcetera.","And if you can't get into that level of detail, can you at least kind of prioritize them and tell us which ones -- what had the greatest, the least impact on the gross margin?","Brett Sandercock","Mike, we don't get quite as granular as that, but on those ones that I've mentioned, they all had -- if you looked at it year-on-year, they all had meaningful impact on the gross margin. Clearly, a mention on the FX impact which was quite large and then product and geographic mix had a quite large impact as well. And then [indiscernible] declines year-on-year also that we've been discussing. All of them were kind of meaningful contributors to that gross margin decline.","Mike Matson","Okay. But would you say pricing -- I mean, I think investors are going to be concerned about pricing. And given these other factors, just wondering if you could -- was the pricing kind of equivalent to these other things? Was it more; was it less than the other factors taken individually?","Brett Sandercock","They are all meaningful and not -- there wasn't any particular one that overwhelmed the rest, let me put it that way, that were kind of all there in the mix which is really unusual for us to have almost all of them as a headwind. So it's not like any of them were completely driving it, but when you take them as a sum total, then that adds up to quite a large contraction that we saw.","Mike Matson","Okay. And then just on the SERVE-HF clinical data. So when that comes out, assuming data is strong and positive, how do we think about -- think through the impact of that on your business, on your flow generators? I guess it would ultimately translate into sales of the -- I can't think of the name it of now -- but the SV product. MSV or whatever it's called product.","And what's the timing of that? Do you expect that to kind of pick up immediately? Pick up just in Europe first? Do you have to get some additional indications approved through the FDA in the U.S. before you can really market it for the heart failure patient population, etcetera?","Mick Farrell","SERVE-HF is a multiyear journey for us going back a number of years. And we expect that sort of first publication of the trial results before the end of the calendar year. You know, that's almost the starting gun that would go off on a long journey, Mike. And there are multiple outcomes in a trial like this. There is the outcome that could improve cardiovascular outcomes. There's an outcome that could improve bigger things, like morbidity or mortality in intention and trade versus per protocol analyses.","And so many analyses that the primary investigators will have to do from when they crack the code all the way through to when they present the results and then later publish them in a peer reviewed published journal. So there's a long lead time.","To your point, it will benefit the business. Mike, I find the easier brand to remember is PaceWave. So the PaceWave product will be picking up from that. And studies both used PaceWave SERVE-HF and the CAT-HF. So we're excited to have that sort of proprietary technology included in the trial. But it's a long journey from there. And so you won't see an immediate inflection point the day of presentation at whichever cardiology conference it may be. What you'll see is the starting gun go off on a marathon opportunity for us which goes over multiple quarters and multiple years.","And really, a lot of it comes down to changing standard-of-care country by country, hospital by hospital, payer by payer and, frankly, cardiology and pulmonary group by cardiology and pulmonary group and getting them to partner across hospitals and we see it as a great long term opportunity for us.","Mike Matson","Okay. And just in the U.S., is there anything from a regulatory standpoint you're going to need to do once that data is out? Or can you just go ahead and begin to target the U.S. heart failure market as well?","Mick Farrell","Well, in the U.S., our indication for use to treat central sleep apnea, periodic breathing and Cheyne-Stokes respiration. So we'll be focusing on that in the U.S. In other markets in different parts of the world, there will be different approaches of working with cardiology groups. But in the U.S., it will be focused on what we do in treating these very severe types of sleep disorder breathing amongst chronic disease patients.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Stanton from CLSA. Please go ahead.","David Stanton","I wonder if you could give us an update on your views in terms of overall market growth rates in the U.S. and Europe? Where do think that's accelerating from the 4% to 6% that you previously talked about, given the strong growth that we've seen in this quarter and previous quarters as well. That's my first question. Thanks.","Mick Farrell","David, look, it's really hard being the only public company that sort of talks on a 90-day cycle here about growth rates to get details of the market growth rates. We talk about it in the mid-single digits in the U.S. and Western Europe. I think there certainly are regions and countries where you're getting double-digit growth, mostly in the emerging markets. We talked earlier about China, India, Brazil and Eastern Europe, where we're really partnering with our channel and focusing on growth in those areas.","And then you get some opportunities, like we have with Air Solutions and what it has driven in great value to customers. And you get some share gains as part of that as well.","Has market growth tipped up a little because we're moving to connected care models and we're partnering with integrated delivery networks and accountable care organizations? I would say it's a little early for that traction to have started to really move the market in growth. I think that's more of a longer-term story, as you look out sort of one year, three years, five years, where you'll start to see us be able to influence market growth by the great solutions we're providing to take patients out of hospitals, put them in homes and save money for broken healthcare systems.","So I think we're still sort of looking in that mid-single-digit range. But again, it's blurry and there's a lot of multiple data sources to get to that.","David Stanton","And I guess my follow-up to that is as it is getting a little bit closer, can you give us sort of your views on where you see the introduction of the third round of competitive bidding in the U.S. for next year? What that will do, perhaps in your eyes to those market growth rates? Thanks very much.","Mick Farrell","So I'll hand that question to Dave Pendarvis, our Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel.","Dave Pendarvis","CB3, as it's been announced, is pretty much a known quantity now, so that's a good thing. There's stability and predictability in the market for our U.S. customers. They now know that in January of 2016, there begins a phased process that runs through the middle of the year, where reimbursement will be adjusted. There's still some questions about rural adjustments, where there can be a 110% of the national rates.","But by and large, CB3 should be predictable and therefore, business planning can occur with customers knowing what the reimbursement is they're going to face. And without there being a reduction in the number of authorized customers or authorized suppliers in a region, we don't expect the kind of disruption that we saw in the second round of competitive bidding.","I'm not sure that that would have a significant impact on growth rates. Obviously, the patients are getting diagnosed and that reimbursement for diagnosis isn't changing. I think our best guess would be that the growth rates would stay roughly the same in those markets that are affected by the third round of competitive bidding.","Operator","And your next question comes from William Dunlop from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","William Dunlop","I just wanted to get a little bit more color around the level of competition you're seeing in masks?","Mick Farrell","Sure, William. Masks are multiple categories. You have the full-face masks, you have nasal pillows and then you have nasal masks. And in each of those subcategories, there are multiple players in multiple countries competing with their own innovation.","What I can tell you is that it is a competitive game. And we're innovating incredibly well and some of our competitors are doing a reasonable job, too. And what that allows is good competition in a market, healthy competition in a market and the opportunity for us and our competitors to present those opportunities to patients, to HME providers and to clinicians and get them excited about what we have.","So as you go through each of the categories and you go through each of the countries, you win in some categories and in some countries and then you don't win for a while in some categories and countries. But over the long term, what we've showed at ResMed that of the 7% of our revenues that we invest in research and development, we put a good chunk of that into world-leading mask and patient interface, more generally and accessory research.","And we have, I would say, across countries and across the categories some world-leading innovation that's doing very well and more in the pipeline. As I said, we're going to get back to positive growth in our major geographies and around the world on that. And we're confident about that.","William Dunlop","And just following on from that, last quarter, you mentioned that you think you probably took market share sequentially in masks. Would you be able to comment on what you think market share did in this quarter? And just finally, are you able to elaborate more on the pipeline that you just mentioned?","Mick Farrell","I'll take the second part first. And the answer to that is no. We're not going to go into details on the pipeline. And I'll hand the first part of the question to Jim to talk about relative share that you might've seen, particularly in the U.S. geography.","Jim Hollingshead","Yes, I mean, it's a typical member to get to, market share, because there's not terrific data. But based upon what we see in the market, we think the shares are relatively stable and probably we took a little bit of share on the margin in the quarter, but it's very, very difficult to estimate. So if you went with stable shares, you probably wouldn't be far off.","William Dunlop","So that implies that the mask market in the U.S. is perhaps going backwards, if you took a little bit of share in the quarter?","Mick Farrell","Well you know, you got the difference between unit share and then you've got revenue share. And you've got pricing and many factors into that, William. So one of the things that we've said on these calls is we're not going to go into details of year-on-year price deltas. And so if we start to talk about volumes and exactly where that's at, then everyone can reverse engineer the pricing, including competitors or others who may be reading the transcript or listening to this call. William, I appreciate where you're going in the drill down, but I think we're going to have to go to the next question.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And the next question comes from David Low from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","David Low","Brett, if I could just start with a quick one on other income line. I was wondering if you could talk what's in that? Is it largely FX hedge gain?","Brett Sandercock","Yes, the majority of that is some FX hedge gains and that was largely around our other euro hedging structures, yes.","David Low","And just the only other one I had was with the very strong sales growth you saw in the U.S. devices. Just wondering if you are on backorder or whether you've been able to fully supply those orders?","Mick Farrell","No, David, we're off backorder in the U.S.. Flow generators and that's a really good thing. The downside of that, as Brett said is that we're doing a lot more air freight than we would like at this time. And so as we start to -- and Brett and Don and the team in Sydney are really getting the factory there, both there and in Singapore, moving.","So we will expect to start to move from air freight to sea freight. And as Brett said earlier, to start those cost-out programs over the coming quarters to get us back on track there. But no, we were not on backorder this quarter which is a good thing.","Operator","And the next question comes from Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Anthony Petrone","Maybe to focus in on U.S. flow gens as well. Just trying to get a sense of AirCurve in the quarter or were there any large stocking orders on the bilevels in the quarter? I know it was launched late last quarter, so was just wondering the extent of the impact in this quarter? And then a follow-up.","Mick Farrell","Jim, do you want to take the question about the orders? Do you know how it impacted inventory-wise or replacements?","Jim Hollingshead","It's not something we have perfect visibility into, but I didn't see anything unusual in the quarter in terms of stocking orders. The year got off to a really good start since its launch and so it's on a really good growth and adoption ramp. And we think we're taking share in that category as well as in APAP and CPAP. But we didn't see anything unusual.","Mick Farrell","Yes, I think what you saw last quarter was a good ramp up of the AirSense 10. And what you saw this quarter was a good ramp up of the AirCurve 10 combined with ongoing ramp up of the AirSense 10. You have the addition of Astral, mainly in Europe, but starting to happen in the U.S. geography, Anthony.","Anthony Petrone","And then the second one is on CHF. And just trying to get a sense of how this plays out potentially into 2016, specifically from an operational standpoint. So I would imagine some of the R&D expenses will fall off when SERVE-HF is done. So is that the case? And will that be completely offset by reinvestments into the marketing efforts for SERVE-HF or is that a net benefit?","Mick Farrell","Yes, good question about SERVE-HF. And as we start to complete that study, what you should realize is usually when these studies go out, there are a number of follow-on publications that look to analyze the data that we've collected over these 5 years to 7 years from different angles to produce different things. And so I would expect ongoing analysis and research, certainly on the buyer statistician side and analysis of the data from investigators and workers on the study.","Yes, but certainly the day-to-day recruitment of patients does slow down as you move off those studies. But one thing about ResMed, Anthony, is that we take a long term view and we invest for the long term. And so the growing needs and opportunities for us in healthcare informatics, for instance, are an area that we're investing in and we'll continue to ramp up our investment.","The growing opportunities to develop channels and research around COPD and the mortality rate that you saw in the current line study that we talked about two quarters ago, where you have a 76% relative reduction in mortality for COPD patients treated with noninvasive ventilation.","I mean, there are so many opportunities for research in the COPD side that I wouldn't -- if I was running your model for FY '16, I wouldn't be pulling out R&D dollars for ResMed. I would say ResMed is going to reinvest and keep that sort of 5 year, 10 year, 15 year view that clinical research drives market development, drives market growth and drives value for patients. And that's something that we focus on for the long term.","Operator","And your next question comes from Saul Hadassin from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Saul Hadassin","Brett, just a question on operating cash flow. I think I heard you right. You mentioned for the quarter, it was around $91 million or $90.9 million. Just wondering if you could give us what that might have been in constant currency or what the FX impact was? Because that looks like it's down fairly materially on the PCP. And just a follow-up to that question is just what's happening on the receivables side in terms of trading terms? That would be great. Thanks.","Brett Sandercock","Yes, I'll take the first one on receivables on the sort of -- our days sales and trading terms, they were pretty consistent with where they've been kind of this time last year and over the last few quarters. So I think that's been pretty stable. On the operating cash flow front, yes, it's down on PCP. But around the euro and the decline and so on, that would certainly hurt us a little bit on the cash flow front. But you've got to be a bit cautious, because they are 90 day snapshots on the cash flow.","I think I prefer to look at it more of a longer-term trend on the cash flow. So PCP was down a little bit. I think overall, the cash flow remains quite strong, although yes, probably hurt a little bit on the FX front.","Operator","And your next question comes from Craig Collie from Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Craig Collie","Two for me. The first, just trying to get a sense of the sustainability of the very impressive flow gen growth number. Mick, could you perhaps give us a little bit of flavor as to the waitings of some of the separate drivers, in particular share gains from, I guess, new patients being diagnosed with sleep apnea versus the installed base upgrading versus perhaps bilevels and cardiorespiratory cells?","Mick Farrell","Yes, I mean, to the comments I made earlier, clearly, a number of 42% in the U.S. geography, given the large base we have there, is exceptional. And it's exceptionally good, but it is exceptional and it did include a big chunk of share gain that we would know. To delve out exactly what was market growth versus share gain growth, I'll leave the mathematics of that up to you and the other experts on the call.","But as I look to the sustainability of the long term underlying growth there, I think it is there in that good solid mid-single-digit market growth that we talked about. The difference between AirSense 10 which is in its third quarter, I guess, of real moving up that S-curve of launch and AirCurve 10 which is just finishing its first full quarter and then you add in Astral which is got, for the U.S. market, a much longer penetration curve to go, you can sort of get into some pretty complex calculations as to exactly what shares they'll be. What we're focused on is really the long term, Craig. We're absolutely taking share in sleep disorder breathing, but more importantly than that, we're switching the industry to focus on healthcare informatics as a value play.","That taking data to the cloud is not enough. You have to then take that data and provide solutions for your customers, to take cost out of the channel, to get efficiencies. And for patients, physicians and providers to all get real-time data so that they can make their businesses better, make the patients better and improve outcomes and so it's sort of a long term gain versus, for us, let's analyze the 90 days and look at it.","And I think what the milestone of that 42% says the long term game is the right game and it's got some capability. And we should double down our investment in that space.","Craig Collie","And then just lastly, any updates on a potential pilot for bundling?","Mick Farrell","So I'll hand that question to Dave Pendarvis to talk about bundling associated with CB for future rounds.","Dave Pendarvis","It's really been no news on that front. So you know, the situation remains that there is an initial proposal from CMS, that they suggested they might run a bundling pilot. There are no more details on what that pilot might look like, when, if at all, it would go into effect. And we've just heard nothing else. So really no developments on that front.","Operator","Yes, we will now turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.","Mick Farrell","Great. Well, thanks, Adrienne. In closing, I would like to thank the more than 4000 strong ResMed team from around the world for their continued commitment to changing millions of lives, literally with every breath. We certainly remain inspired by our long term aspiration of changing 20 million lives by 2020. Thanks for your time today. We hope to see many of you at our ResMed Investor Day which we're holding this June 2015 in San Francisco. More details from Agnes on that later.","Agnes Lee","Yes. And thank you all for joining us again today. If there are any additional questions, please feel free to contact me.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Senior Director of Investor Relations.

We believe that these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in filings made by ResMed with the SEC.","I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell.","Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Agnes. And thank you to all of our shareholders who are joining us on today's investor call as we provide an overview of our fiscal Q1 2016 quarterly results.","We have started the year with very strong sales growth in both our sleep apnea business and our respiratory care business. In my remarks, I'll discuss our top and bottom line results, some regional highlights from our global business, as well as an overview of the progress that we have made against our ResMed 2020 strategy. After that, as usual, I will hand over to Brett to walk you through the financial results in greater detail.","Once again, this quarter, our global team achieved double-digit top line revenue growth on a constant currency of 15%. We saw strength in the Americas region with robust double-digit growth, and we achieved solid steady growth our combined EMEA and APAC group. These global results were fueled by the success of our new product and solutions launches in both our sleep apnea and our respiratory care businesses.","Looking at the bottom line, our diluted EPS was $0.58 on a non-GAAP basis. EPS was $0.57 on a GAAP basis. We have been balancing our investment growth opportunities whilst carefully managing our growth in R&D and SG&A. We gained operating leverage this quarter, as both R&D as well as SG&A grew at a lower rate than our top line revenue.","We are on track to further increase operating leverage throughout fiscal year 2016 and we are executing on our plans to improve gross margin, driving further efficiency improvements in both manufacturing and supply chain costs, as I outlined last quarter.","We have a lot of runway left for ongoing growth of our high margin product businesses, including the AirCurve 10 bilevel platform and our Astral life support ventilation platform. As we look forward over the coming fiscal quarters and the fiscal year, we will further leverage our automated informatics solutions to drive ongoing mask and accessories resupply growth.","Now for some regional highlights. In the Americas region, we had a very strong sales performance in Q1, with our team driving north of 20% growth on a year-on-year basis. Flow generator growth was 39%, reflecting the ongoing success of our AirSense 10, AirCurve 10, and our Astral platforms, as well as our end-to-end Healthcare Informatics solutions. Mask and accessories grew at 9% during the quarter in the Americas. Pricing continues to be stable in the mask categories. We continue to expect positive mask and accessories growth throughout fiscal year 2016.","Moving on to our combined EMEA and APAC group, we grew at 5% on a constant currency basis in the quarter. We saw strong sales growth from flow generators and our mask and accessory businesses in the EMEA and APAC group. Clearly, the SERVE-HF results and our contraindication for ASV in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and predominant central sleep apnea patients was a headwind. ASV sales in Europe were more affected than we had predicted. However, it is important to note that ASV sales in APAC and the U.S. were significantly less affected than in Europe.","We have not seen any impact beyond our ASV sales for patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction in predominant central sleep apnea. This is consistent with the conclusions from the New England Journal of Medicine publication and the commentary from key opinion leaders in The Lancet, in CHEST, and in the Blue journal, all stating that the data from the study should not be extrapolated beyond the treatment group. It just makes good sense.","APAC sales were strong in the quarter and we continue to see robust growth across all of our high growth markets this quarter, including China. We announced earlier this month that we have now completed the acquisition of Curative Medical. This partnership of our ResMed China business and the Curative Medical team provides us with a leading market share position in China and a separate brand with innovative products that are developed and manufactured in China for China. This acquisition will allow us to expand both the sleep apnea and respiratory care markets in China and beyond.","Now I'd like to talk more about our progress against our ResMed 2020 Three Horizons Growth Strategy. Earlier this month, ResMed was a platinum sponsor for the annual meeting of AdvaMed, the Advanced Medical Technology Association, and the meeting was held right here in San Diego.","AdvaMed is the world's largest med tech association and its conference is the most important in the med tech industry globally. One of the main themes of AdvaMed 2015 was the increasing importance of digital health for medical devices and connected care for patients.","ResMed has been at the very forefront of healthcare informatics innovation for over a decade. We are leading and driving this trend for our industry. Just over one year after the launch of the Air Solutions Platform and the AirSense 10 and the AirCurve 10, we have well over 1 million patients with cloud-connected medical devices sitting on their bedside tables. As these devices provide daily updates to the cloud, it allows ResMed to provide actionable information for patients, physicians, providers and for payers.","We have built an industry-leading core competency in healthcare informatics allowing us to provide the best value with market-leading solutions that improve operational efficiency, improve patient adherence and improve long-term outcomes for patients.","Our customers clearly understand the value proposition of ResMed's Air Solutions. Most of the time, we cannot talk publicly about these results, but one of our customers has allowed us to report on their increased staff efficiency and accelerated business growth after adopting Air Solutions from ResMed. Based on their own data, this customer is saving 80 labor hours per month, reducing the number of unreached patients by more than 85% and increasing the number of new patient setups by 55% on a year-over-year basis. These results are a big part of why so many customers are partnering with ResMed.","We have many other examples of customer success using our healthcare informatics solutions. U-Sleep is the ResMed-branded cloud-based application that monitors patient adherence and automatically identifies and triages which patients need the most help so that a homecare provider can proactively address issues and provide better care.","In a previous investor call, I talked about a study presented at the American Thoracic Society in which a U-Sleep customer saw patient adherence increase from 73% to 83% along with a 59% decrease in their labor costs. To prove that this was not a one-time, one-customer event, let me provide an overview of a study just published in the Journal of Sleep and Sleep Disorders Research. This study showed that by using adherence coaching from U-Sleep, the customer was able to increase compliance from 60% using standard adherence monitoring up to 87% using the automated compliance monitoring capabilities of our U-Sleep solution.","In addition to this 27% increase in the number of adherent patients on therapy, the customer staff was able to set up 83% more patients at the same labor cost. This is clearly a very significant operating efficiency improvement for our customer. The acquisitions of Jaysec and CareTouch have added new capabilities to our end-to-end solution that we call ResMed ReSupply. This capability provides automated resupply solutions for our customers so that they can efficiently manage mask and accessory resupply to patients through automated text, email or interactive voice response, with a multilingual call center backing up the solution live, if necessary.","We have seen great success with the Air Solutions platform and devices, and we will continue to build our healthcare informatics capabilities so that we can drive channel efficiencies, unlock cost savings, drive appropriate growth in masks and accessories provision to patients, and, ultimately, improve long-term patient outcomes.","In the second horizon of our ResMed 2020 growth strategy, we see opportunities to leverage the healthcare informatics strength from our sleep apnea business directly into our adjacent respiratory care businesses. We are already taking AirCurve 10 data to the cloud, and you will hear more from us on this front as we move forward. Watch this space.","We are expanding our presence in the U.S. respiratory care market and building on our strong presence in Europe for both our life support ventilation solutions, and our non-invasive ventilation solutions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and neuromuscular disease.","Another growth vector under our second horizon of growth is our ongoing investments in high growth market geographies. With the completion of the Curative Medical acquisition, we are now the market share leader in the sleep apnea and respiratory care market in China. We are extremely well-positioned for sustained long-term growth, with two strategically aligned, yet operationally independent teams targeting different, yet fast-growing customer segments within the China market. We continue to invest in high growth markets like China, India, Brazil, and Eastern Europe. In each geography, we provide and drive long-term strategies to improve patient outcomes and reduce overall system healthcare costs within each individual country, proving on that promise with hard data.","Finally, let's review our third horizon of growth. Let me first spend a few moments talking about SERVE-HF. As you all know, ResMed put patient safety first and foremost. It was the most important priority when we announced the preliminary study results from SERVE back in May, many months before the study was eventually published.","As we had expected, the SERVE-HF study was published in The New England Journal of Medicine quite recently. The study's primary investigators presented results at the European Society of Cardiology and at the European Respiratory Society conferences. The results of the study, the safety signal, and the contraindication remain unchanged from May.","It is worth noting that our ASV business in other market segments has been unaffected in these last five months since the SERVE-HF announcement. These other segments include treatment-emergent central sleep apnea, time-management-induced central sleep apnea, and post-traumatic stress disorder-related uses of ASV. These all remain strong market segments in the U.S., and we are working on expanding these applications further through Europe and Asia Pacific.","Our third horizon of growth includes a number of cardio-respiratory treatment opportunities, including atrial fibrillation, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and chronic disease management opportunities in cardiology. These are very exciting longer-term opportunities that we will speak more about later.","Returning to our quarterly results, we remain active on the capital management front. In this quarter, we bought back 1.2 million shares in addition to funding our dividend. Through September 30, our stock repurchase program has returned to shareholders a total of $1.5 billion. It's your cash and we think you should get it back.","We continue to look for potential acquisitions where three key criteria are met; one, the business is aligned with our long-term strategy; two, we can leverage the asset to increase ResMed's shareholder value; and three, that there is a cultural fit between the acquisition target business and ResMed's team. We hit all of these three criteria solidly with the Curative Medical acquisition, and we will continue to refresh our acquisition radar screen with further growth opportunities as we look forward.","At ResMed, we are the global leaders in sleep apnea and respiratory medicine, not just in market share but, more importantly, in products and informatics solutions innovation, as well as in service, channel, and market innovation. We remain very excited as we build the road ahead for our industry, for our partners, and, most importantly, for many, many millions of patients around the world.","With that, I will turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Brett, for a more detailed review of our Q1 financials. Brett?","Brett A. Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer","Great. Thanks, Mick. Revenue for the September quarter was $411.6 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter, where in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 15%. Movements in exchange rates, predominantly a weaker euro relative to the U.S. dollar, negatively impacted revenue by approximately $26.8 million in the first quarter.","At a geographic level, overall sales in the Americas were $254.1 million, an increase of 23% over the prior-year quarter. Sales in combined EMEA and APAC group totaled $157.5 million, a decrease of 9% over the prior-year quarter. However, in constant currency terms, sales in combined EMEA and APAC group increased by 5% over the prior-year quarter.","Breaking out revenue between product segments. Americas' flow generator sales were $132.1 million, an increase of 39% over the prior-year quarter. Masks and other sales were $122 million, an increase of 9% over the prior-year quarter. For revenue in the combined EMEA and APAC group, flow generator sales were $107.5 million, a decrease of 10% over the prior-year quarter or, in constant currency terms, an increase of 5%. Masks and other sales were $50 million, a decrease of 8% over the prior-year quarter or, in constant currency terms, an increase of 7%.","Globally, in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 20% while masks and other increased by 9% over the prior-year quarter. Gross margin for the September quarter was 58%. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin contracted by 440 basis points, reflecting an unfavorable product mix, declines in average selling prices, an unfavorable geographic mix, and adverse currency movements.","Looking forward, in fiscal year 2016, we still expect gross margin to be in the range of 57% to 60%, assuming current exchange rates. If gross margin drivers like currency fluctuation and geographic and product mix move beyond their expectations, they could swing this range further.","As we discussed last quarter, we expect to progressively see the benefits from our cost out programs, including procurement, production, and logistics improvements, reflected in our fiscal year 2016 gross margin. In particular, in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, we expect to see a benefit from a normalized sea\/air freight mix and from the recent depreciation of the Australian dollar.","Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $111.1 million, an increase of 1% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 11%, primarily due to higher employee compensation and the impact of recent acquisitions.","SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 27% compared to the year-ago figure of 29.1%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 26% to 27% for fiscal year 2016.","R&D expenses for the quarter were $27.2 million, a decrease of 9% over the prior-year quarter, but on a constant currency basis, an increase of 12%. This increase largely reflects incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.6% compared to the year-ago figure of 7.9%.","Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% in fiscal year 2016. This reflects our ongoing commitment to investing in our diverse product pipeline, including informatics solutions, but also the benefit of the weaker Australian dollar in which the majority of our R&D is denominated.","Amortization of acquired intangibles was $2.3 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $12.4 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.1%, compared to 18.3% in the prior-year quarter. You may recall in the prior-year tax rate, this was favorably impacted by a net tax benefit of $3.2 million, arising from the conclusion of a long-running German tax audit. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2016 will be in the range of 19% to 20%.","Operating profit for the quarter was $98 million, an increase of 4% over the prior-year quarter. However, net income for the quarter declined by 3% to $80.4 million as a result of foreign currency hedging losses and lower interest income.","Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.57, a decrease of 2% over the prior-year quarter. Overall, foreign exchange movements negatively impacted first quarter earnings by $0.01 per share, reflecting the impact from the weaker euro, largely offset by the weaker Australian dollar. On a constant currency basis, diluted earnings per share were consistent with the prior-year quarter.","Cash flow from operations was $122.1 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and an improvement in net working capital balances. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $16.4 million, while depreciation\/amortization for the September quarter totaled $18.4 million.","We have continued to be active on the capital management front. Our board of directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share. Additionally, during the quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares for the consideration of $62 million. At the end of September, we had approximately 14.3 million shares remaining under our authorized share repurchase program.","In October, we announced the closing of the Curative acquisition. We have not disclosed the financial terms of the transaction. The acquisition has been funded by utilizing our existing cash balances, and the entity will be included in our consolidated results in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016.","For the rolling 12 months ended September 30, we have returned 92% of free cash flow to shareholders for our dividends and repurchases. And over the last five years, we have returned 99% of free cash flow to our shareholders via dividends and repurchases.","Our balance sheet remains very strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $321 million. And at September 30, total assets stood at $2.3 billion and net equity was $1.5 billion.","And with that, I will hand the call back to Agnes.","Agnes Lee - Senior Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A, and we ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question only. If you have additional questions after that, please get back into the queue.","Melissa, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And the first question comes from the line of Ian Abbott with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs (Australia) Pty Ltd.","Yes. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could perhaps talk through the guidance a little bit. There's been some changes. So I think at the full year result you talked about an SG&A range of 27% to 28%. That's come down by 100 basis points. And the tax rate guidance has also come down by 100 basis points as well. I'm just wondering what's changed in the last three months to see those things come down.","Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Brett, do you want to have a go at that?","Brett A. Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I'll take that, Mick. Thanks. Yeah, Ian, that's right, we have guided that down a little in SG&A. As Mick mentioned, we've been focused on the operating leverage throughout the group and we do think we can achieve that through fiscal year 2016.","So with some of the plans we have, we do believe that we can bring that down a little and provide some operating leverage there. So on the SG&A front, we feel confident we should bring that guidance down where we see some improvements we're planning throughout the year.","On the effective tax rate, it moves around a bit with geographic mix. If you look at last year's sort of full-year underlying tax rate, it was sort of around that 19.5% level. So it's kind of in that range. So we just brought that down a tad just based on where we see the forecast going out.","Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs (Australia) Pty Ltd.","Okay. And then in a similar vein, you mentioned the gross margin. You kept that guidance the same, but you did sort of flag that various movements could see you go out of the range. It is a very wide range and this result was pretty much in the middle of the range. I'm just wondering what sort of things could drive it materially outside that range.","Brett A. Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer","We did widen that a little bit, Ian, really because there's, if you look at it over the last year or so, quite a bit of volatility on exchange rates. For example, you're seeing the Aussie come down something like 7%, 8%, which is quite significant. Now I'm not suggesting that that's going to happen again this year, but, as you know, anything is possible.","And we're also seeing some pretty significant movements or some big outperformance on flow generators, particularly in the U.S. So I suppose as a caveat, there's always quite a bit of volatility around the gross margin. It's probably the hardest number to predict. So we widened that out a little bit.","I think as we get through the course of the fiscal year, we can probably get some more confidence on sort of the band or how wide that is. But at this stage early in the fiscal, we've left it as is. But I have said there that certainly on the things such as freight, where we are normalizing that now, certainly doing a lot less air freight as we have the inventories at levels that we think are appropriate. That's certainly going to help us into Q2.","And, as you know, the Aussie dollar has depreciated more recently. There's about a quarter's lag on that, so we don't really see that benefit until Q2. But that benefit will be meaningful as well going into Q2. I guess some of the headwinds we're facing are kind of abating a little bit, and so we should be able to see some improvements throughout fiscal year 2016.","Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs (Australia) Pty Ltd.","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Taylor with Barclays. Your line is open.","Matt C. Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could give us any qualitative commentary on what helped the mask growth this quarter. I mean, you had, I guess, a little bit of easier comp, but certainly saw some acceleration there. If you could talk about any products or trends or pull-through, things that might help us to understand how the mask growth could progress.","Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks for the question, Matt. Yeah, that allows us to talk about the mask business in total. I mean, what we've seen over the last three quarters is clearly some good growth turnaround and success in masks. It's not driven by brand new products; it's more driven by us focusing on partnering with our customers around understanding resupply.","And as I said in the prepared remarks, we've invested a lot these last 12 months in getting well over 1 million bedside tables with 100% cloud-connected devices that now enable us to have information on patients. And we're able to take those data to the cloud and contact patients and encourage them and drive patient adherence and work with our HME providers in the U.S. and with our other partners in other countries around the world to give patients appropriate access to masks and accessories as they need them over the time of their therapy. And I think you're just seeing the very start of the roadmap of us working on those informatics systems and leveraging them to drive mask and accessories resupply, but I think that's been a factor in the equation.","As you said, the comp was not incredibly difficult. And so having 9% growth in the Americas over the comp is somewhat a result of that comp. But I think it's more due to the fact that we're focused on resupply, we're partnering with our customers on it and we're really establishing tools and capabilities that are automated, scalable and replicable. And so that gives us a long runway throughout the fiscal year to be able to drive resupply in masks and accessories.","Matt C. Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. And just to follow up on that, could you give us any metrics that you're tracking or some kind of a guidepost on resupply to help us understand the improvements you've made and maybe where you could go? I don't know if it's masks per year or how you think about it? And then you mentioned price was stable in masks. Any changes outside the U.S.? I think your comment was on the Americas.","Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I'll hand the first part of the question to Jim Hollingshead, who's probably closer to the business and any metrics we're looking at from the resupply, but we may or may not want to release that.","James Hollingshead - President-Americas","I don't think we'd want to talk about metrics that we put on the resupply business. I think what I'd add to Mick's comments about the Americas market, in particular on masks, is that we've been talking for several months about the pricing strategy we made a while ago. And those pricing changes have now annualized, so one of the things that allowed us to show a better revenue growth number this quarter was the pricing has really stabilized for us.","We're the mask market leader both in the Americas and globally. In particular, our Air Fit range is very well positioned. And so we continue to enjoy good volume growth just in the mask business with patients getting \u2013 new patients getting masks. And then, with the efforts we made in automating resupply and driving resupply, we've enjoyed the growth on the back end of that, but I don't think we want to get into sort of ratios and metrics on that at this point.","Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And maybe the second part of the question, which focused beyond the U.S., the global aspects, Rob Douglas, our COO, any thoughts on that?","Robert A. Douglas - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, Matt. Globally, the masks are performing well. The AirFit range is a very strong mask range, and we are very competitive with those masks. Our teams work hard with our customers and they've got strong relationships around the world. And we're confident those masks are going to keep performing strongly.","Matt C. Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sean Laaman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley (Australia) Ltd.","Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Just wondering if we could get a bit of a guide on device growth ex-ASV, if possible.","Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sean, I don't think we're going to release a new metric on this earnings call. I mean, the bottom line is, as we said in May, less than 7% of our global business is in the ASV side of the business, and it's obviously reduced from that over these last sort of 150 days. The growth that we saw \u2013 pretty phenomenal growth of 39% in the Americas, flow generators, and on a constant currency basis, 5% growth of flow generators in EMEA and APAC combined \u2013 was driven really by the new launch of the AirSense 10 and the AirCurve 10 and the Astral. And so those have been driving the growth.","Europe clearly had a bit of a headwind due to the contraindication for heart failure patients with a reduced ejection fraction and predominant central sleep apnea, where we issued that contraindication. But as I also said in the prepared remarks, we really have not seen any impact on ASV beyond that in the other market segments, if you like, that we sell the product in. So it's been pretty steady in that.","But, Sean, yeah, I don't want to start breaking out ASV and non-ASV mask growth for competitive reasons, and also just for the fact of \u2013 we've got quite a lot of runway left on those product launches, and I want to just look at the macro numbers as they come out.","Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley (Australia) Ltd.","Sure, Mick. Thanks. Can I just squeeze one more in? Just to clarify, with respect to mask pricing in the U.S., is that fully lapped yet, or is it a next quarter event when it's fully lapped, the reduction in mask pricing?","Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So, Sean, yeah, you're referring to, I think, the January through June 2014 price changes, which have now lapped because we passed \u2013 we lapped the June 2015 timeframe. So we are now fully lapped on those ASP reductions and we're back to sort of steady, as we said, pretty steady mask pricing.","And we're seeing often our competitors out there competing on value of what the masks can achieve in terms of patient fit, quiet, comfort, first time fit and patient acceptance.","Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley (Australia) Ltd.","Great, Mick. Thanks. That's all I had. Appreciate your time.","Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thanks, Sean.","Operator","Your next question comes from Suraj Kalia with Northland Securities. Your line is open. Suraj, your line is open.","Your next question comes from Will Dunlop with Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","William Dunlop - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just wondering if you can please talk to the different market growth you're seeing in the U.S. between flow gens and masks. Do you think the market for both categories is growing at a slightly decent rate? And if so, what are some of the trends that are driving that\/ Thank you.","Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I'll start at a high level and then hand over to Jim maybe for some detail. Globally, we see the sleep apnea market in general growing in the mid-single digits. As you saw from these numbers, we don't accept market growth. We drive ResMed growth and we want to meet or beat those market growth numbers. And so we were able to beat across our businesses, able to beat both mid-single-digit numbers in flow generators and in masks.","The commentary I'd make before handing to Jim is that the high flow generator numbers we saw particularly in the Americas were driven by new product launches, and a lot of that was share gain based upon the value prop of the Informatics systems, the air solutions that I talked about in the prepared remarks. So, less to do with the differential between flow gens and masks, they are more to do with the value prop of air solutions.","But, Jim, any more color from the rest of the market, the Americas market?","James Hollingshead - President-Americas","Yeah, I think that's spot on. I think the difference you see in the numbers is we've, on a longstanding basis, been the mask market leader. But with the AirSense 10 and AirCurve 10, we've taken significant market share over the last several months since the launch of both of those product lines. And that's due both to the fact that those product platforms, just as products, as flow generators, are outstanding products.","But really it's about, as Mick has just said and said in his opening comments, it's about the all-in solutions offer, the Air Solutions platform is driving significant revenue growth in business efficiencies for our customers, and they're recognizing that. And as they continue to recognize that and adopt the overall Air Solutions platform, they're of necessity buying more of our flow generators to enjoy those benefits. So really there's not a separate growth number behind those two product categories. The underlying market growth is the same, we're just taking more share in flow gen.","William Dunlop - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks. And are you seeing any change in the way private insurers are funding or reimbursing CPAP in terms of moving from a fee-for-product model to perhaps a capitation or a per-patient model? Thanks.","Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Look, the U.S. market particularly is evolving from a fee-for-service market to really a value-driven or a fee-for-value driven market as a whole. And you're seeing more models like the Kaiser Permanente model, the Intermountain Healthcare model, the Geisinger model start to come into play. And the government is trying to replicate those really solid private company payer provider models with its accountable-care organization or ACO models and its IDN models.","And we are very good partners with Kaiser, with Intermountain Health, and with Geisinger. But also with the governments of the United Kingdom, the governments of Sweden, the governments of Norway, the governments of Finland, where a payer provider model has been in place for many decades. Since World War II, almost all of Western Europe adopted socialized medicine systems, public health care. And we've been working for the last 25 years with systems of fee-for-value or providing value models. And so we're very used to that type of environment. So the U.S. is undergoing an evolution. Are we a part of that evolution? And I think the informatics capability that we have, the ability to take data to the cloud and share it with patients to drive adherence is amazing, to take costs out of the system for the providers is very valuable.","But the data to do population health management for a payer or a payer-provider is an opportunity through our data exchanges that we are really just starting to extrapolate. So I think your question is probably a little bit ahead of the curve as to where the value is, but we are working with systems in this new payer-provider, fee-for-value model. And we're actually really excited about that transition because our market shares are incredibly strong across Western Europe and we think we can do that in all the payer-provider models that are out there.","William Dunlop - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you.","Unknown Speaker","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Victor Windeyer with Citi. Your line is open.","Victor Windeyer - Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd.","Hi, guys. Thanks. Well, I just wanted to ask a few things related to the ASV product. So you drew out that the pullback in Europe has been a little bit larger, a little harder than you had expected, and that Asia and Americas were in line with your expectations. I just wonder with Asia given the high use of ASV in the high (39:12) population, first, you had with the positive reimbursement in that location. Do you expect further pullback in Japan as awareness of SERVE-HF results close out through there? And then is the Curative Medical acquisition and revenue and associated gross profit enough to offset that should that occur?","And then in terms of the preserved ejection fraction population that you mentioned, what's happening with the CAT-HF study given the mixed population of that enrolled patient population there?","Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Victor. Well, that was a great way to get three questions in one, so I'll try to address all of that, Vic. Yeah. The first part of your question was about the ASV impact being more in Europe and less in Americas and Asia. And I think part of the genesis of your question or the core of the question, kernel of the question was, is it just that the communication is taking time to get from Europe to Asia or Europe to the Americas, and the answer to that is an emphatic no.","We have, in all the 100 countries we do business in, been incredibly proactive in working with the physician groups, directly writing letters to physician groups and to physicians, working with our providers to contact all physicians and let everybody know about the field safety notice, and that was in the month of May, so north of five months ago now.","And so that information has been available not only at all the international societies, but in national societies, in all the countries we do business in, and particularly the major ones. So, really, it's not a result of \u2013 the fact that there's been less impact in Asia and Americas is not a result that the communication hasn't gone out there. It's a result of the fact that there was, frankly, less heart failure referrals into our ASV business in those countries. Particularly if you look at the U.S., it was primarily at our business year in the U.S. that was driven by complex sleep apnea or treatment-emergent central sleep apnea driven by opioid-induced central sleep apnea and driven by PTSD, where ASV was used in those applications. And so, there was just less of the business that was coming from cardiology referrals, and so that just wasn't impacted.","Within Japan \u2013 you mentioned Japan specifically \u2013 the use of ASV in Japan is focused on an acute basis in the hospital. And these data were based on longitudinal data in the home with no data at all about acute effect, and there have been some studies with mutual outcomes on safety but some positive outcomes on some heart failure indicator results, such as ejection fraction and others. And so, the use in Japan has sort of continued on an acute basis because it's a different application. And I don't think that will be affected by SERVE-HF and their ongoing work with Japanese researchers in the field to keep proving their safety but also the efficacy of the product in that area.","The next part of your question was Curative. Is Curative going to materially offset some of this ASV decline that we're seeing in different parts of the world. I'll hand to Rob. Rob is leading the charge on the Curative integration.","Robert A. Douglas - President & Chief Operating Officer","Sure. So, Vic, the Curative acquisition was part of our Three Horizons Strategy, specifically in the second horizon. Talking about positioning ourselves to grow in these markets that look like they're going to be very high growth markets, we only completed the acquisition at the beginning of October, so we're about three weeks into it at the moment.","I could say it's going very well at the moment. We're just at the CMEF, China Medical Equipment, today. It's a huge medical equipment fair in China. And we had \u2013 showing off our strategy as strategically aligned but operationally independent, we had ResMed and Curative side by side in booths but strongly showing their respective brands, and we're seeing reaction in that market to the two brands that's appropriate for what we look like. So at this stage, we're very confident that that program is going to go well.","Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And the third part of your question, Vic, was to do with HFpEF, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and our CAT-HF study. The CAT-HF study is really a pilot study now. We've closed off enrollment and we're going to follow through on all the patients and collect the data from that and likely publish those data as a pilot trial for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction work that we may do in the future.","I think between atrial fibrillation, to some extent coronary artery disease in a number of markets, and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction may remain exciting, cardio-respiratory conditions that we are looking at. Given what happened in there, we're unlikely to do a five-year $50 million study in each of these three areas.","What we're likely to do is partner with payer providers like those I mentioned earlier or governments or small payer-provider groups to run pilot trials to show improved outcomes and improved reduction in hospitalizations on a commercialized basis. So you run pilots that you get commercially paid for that can produce clinical data that may or may not get published but allows you to expand the model. And that's sort of where we're thinking for those three areas. So that includes HFpEF, AF and CAD.","Victor Windeyer - Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd.","Okay. Thanks very much for that. I just as my follow-up, I'll just ask, is there any evidence that the result from an acute hospitalized heart failure population will be different from the population that's been studied in SERVE?","Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, there is, Vic, some indication of that. There was a study published called SAVIOR that was run out of Japan that showed a neutral safety signal but some positive data on the clinical aspects, such as ejection fraction, fluid in the lungs and length of stay in hospital. And so there's some clinical publications in that area on acute HF. You'll likely see more coming out from the Japanese researchers on that front over time.","Victor Windeyer - Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd.","Okay. Terrific. Thanks very much. Just on masks, you talked of steady state. We're now at steady state in the U.S. Does that mean we can think of high-single digit mask growth as we look forward?","Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Vic, you're jumping to five questions here now, but I'll answer it and then we'll move on. The masks growth that we saw in the U.S. of 9% this quarter was clearly very solid. Look, the market is growing in the sort of mid-single digits range. We look to meet or beat that. And as I said in the prepared remarks, we're planning for positive mask and accessories growth throughout the year and we're excited and looking forward to that.","Thanks a lot for your questions, Vic.","Victor Windeyer - Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd.","Okay. Thank you. Bye.","Operator","As a reminder, please limit your question to one and one follow-up. Your next question comes from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Your line is open.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Good afternoon, guys. So first maybe, Mick, if you can talk about what gives you guys confidence that you can really grow generators now in the face of a potential competitive launch from Respironics. If you guys have seen anything in the field and maybe some of those guys coming back to Air Solutions that have trialed that or if (47:04) is active in that HCIT-based device yet.","Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Margaret. Yeah, clearly, we have seen launch from one of our competitors. The other one you mentioned hasn't launched an HCIT product yet or a cloud-connected sleep apnea product yet and we don't expect in the short term. I'm going to start out by saying it's a huge compliment I think to our innovation and our leadership in the field that our competitors are talking about and starting to follow us into cloud-connected sleep apnea devices.","We think it's (47:44-48:07) right way to go, we think that the value we extracted, like I talked about, we can improve outcomes and lower costs for the channel and take out waste and inefficiency and get patients more on therapy and follow up with them more to provide appropriate mask and accessories. So I just think as an industry, it's a really good thing that we're all moving to compete on value and drive healthcare informatics-driven sleep apnea solutions.","Look, clearly maintaining a 39% Americas growth in flow generators in a market where, as I said, it's growing at mid-single digits, it's unrealistic to stay at those types of levels and I don't think you or any of the other sell-side analysts, Margaret, have numbers at that exact 39% sort of rate. But clearly our goal is to not only lock in the share that we already got, but to continue to meet or beat market growth rates, which means by taking share. So that really comes down to is our value proposition better than the competition.","And from what we've seen of the first competitor to launch their cloud-connected devices is that, frankly, they're not 100% cloud connected. It's got three SKUs of widgets that you need to plug in with three different connectivity modules, which is SKUs for the HMEs to manage. It's not 100% cloud-connected out of the gate in that the DME or the HME or the patient has to take some action to provide the connectivity to the cloud.","So we think while it's following us in the strategic direction, some of the tactical implementations are not as good as ours. And, really importantly, even when you are connected, it comes down to then competition of whose cloud is better. And I think our healthcare informatics capability on Air Solutions is clearly the leader now. And we intend to maintain that leadership by regular updates, regular value that we provide to both patients, to providers, to physicians and to payers. So we're really excited about the new basis of competition of the industry. It's changed from being just smaller, quieter, more comfortable to smaller, quieter, more comfortable and more connected and then better connected. So we look forward to that, Margaret.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. And then for my follow-up, Brett, you talked about maybe seeing more of a shift to a normalization for air\/sea freight next quarter. So how far along were you guys this past quarter? Did you see any benefit from those cost-outs? Thanks.","Brett A. Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, Margaret, the programs are in place in a number of initiatives that the team is working on for sure and have got back to that in earnest. We're sort of over that hump of making sure we matched our supply with demand, so we're through all that and we're working through. Typically, what we do with the new platforms is then drive a pretty solid cost-out program on that new platform. So we're now in the throes of doing that. You probably \u2013 maybe a little bit but really, I think more of that will flow through over the course of 2016. And it will be, as I said earlier, it will be more progressive throughout the year, I think.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Wheen with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Steve D. Wheen - JPMorgan Securities (Australia) Ltd.","Yes. Good morning. Just a question on gross margin again. Brett, in the past because of that one quarter lag, you've kind of indicated as to what sort of basis-point improvement we might see from FX in the next quarter. Is that something you could comment on today?","Brett A. Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I mean, the sequential impact there if \u2013 and I'm going to caveat this because the exchange rate is moving around all the time \u2013 but if you looked at it on the current exchange rate, it's \u2013 probably the sequential benefit of the weaker Aussie \u2013 it's in the order of 50 basis points, give or take. It's that sort of quantum.","Steve D. Wheen - JPMorgan Securities (Australia) Ltd.","Okay. And then as part of your gross margin commentary. You indicated that mix shift obviously was going against you but also ASP declined. Could you just provide some more color as to where those declines were being felt and what the drivers were?","Brett A. Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I mean, it's not \u2013 we're not giving a lot of granularity around ASP, obviously, from a competitive perspective and so on. But as Mick and Jim mentioned earlier, we've kind of let through \u2013 some of those more kind of acute adjustments we were facing on pricing, we're through that now, so it's very much more of a kind of a typical or historical type marketplace in terms of pricing. So there's still, year-on-year, still an element of declines in selling prices and so on, but they're certainly, in today's environment, much less acute than what we were facing back 12 months ago, for example. So let me say it's kind of a more of a kind of historical normal state of play.","Steve D. Wheen - JPMorgan Securities (Australia) Ltd.","Okay. That's great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Goodsall with UBS. Your line is open.","Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.","Thanks very much, guys. I was just going to talk to the SG&A. Obviously, up 11% constant currency, and you mentioned some investment in, I guess, emerging markets. Just trying to get a sense of that investment, whether there's much or so in your established markets like EU, and I guess the sort of payback period you're looking for with that investment, I guess, to grow those markets.","Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Good question, Andrew. I'll hand it to Rob Douglas.","Robert A. Douglas - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. So, obviously, Andrew, you know we've made some acquisitions in Australia last year, which were a bit of a change in our market model, and that's going very well for us. And then obviously the Curative that we talked about.","But sort of on a case-by-case basis, our strategy is we will continue to invest locally for the local market development as appropriate, and we've got very strong teams around there. And then we're sort of challenging that with trying to get efficiency with common core processes that let us leverage really the key product range through there.","Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.","Terrific. And I guess just a quick follow-up. I know it's been a bit of mention around your competitor's entry to the market. I guess we're expecting that to take place at Medtrade this coming week. Just trying to understand if you've got particular strategies or variations that you bring to the market, I guess, just as a response or to coincide with those events.","Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good question, Andrew. Clearly, this is a public conference call. So if we have strategies, tactics, and plans to compete with a very clearly known 12-month anticipated product launch, it's not something we'd go through on the earnings call here. But look, the bottom line is, of course, we're ready for competition in this space.","As I sort of talked to on the response to Margaret earlier, we're quite complimented and excited about the fact that the new base of the competition is healthcare informatics and how good your cloud is. And we're really excited about how strong Air Solutions is, and the value that we provide.","How well we have done, frankly, the last 12 months of getting north of a million devices out there, connected to the cloud and providing value to those customers. And we know that they've seen the value. Of course they're going to try and sample a new product out there. And we do think that the share we've gained will be something that we build upon because of the value that we're providing. But it's a competitive game and we look forward to it and we're ready for it.","Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.","I know it's adding to the question, probably wasn't phrased particularly well. But I guess the feedback we're getting with the cloud is quite a sticky proposition in a way it wasn't in the past. The flow generator, I guess, just sort of seeing how much you think that gives you a bit of a stronger defense than what you might have had in the past.","Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Look, I think the value is incredible. I mean, I talked about in the last call, 59% labor cost savings. I talked about on this call, 83% more patient setup with the same labor cost. I mean, these numbers are incredible and these are just the ones that customers have said that it's okay for us to talk about because they're in markets where they sort of have stronger control and they're comfortable sharing those data. The ones in competitive markets are getting similar results and don't want to share the data. Jim, I mean, you're closer to the business on this. Do you want to share any further anecdotes?","James Hollingshead - President-Americas","Yeah, I think it's a really good question, Andrew. We feel very confident that we have a superior offer. We're getting what you might term a lot of customer loyalty off of the offer because of the value that it's driving. The device is a better device. It's simpler to use. It's simpler to set up. It has a very elegant and reliable cloud connection built into it, so it's not complex to get a connection to the cloud; and then our software offerings are the only offerings on the market that are proven to increase compliance and therefore increase revenue and to lower costs. And so we feel very confident.","As Mick said, it's actually good for the market for the basis of competition in sleep apnea to shift towards health informatics because it provides end-to-end care for patients. It will provide better bang for the buck for the entire healthcare system. And it puts us in a very good position because we've enjoyed more than a year long lead in that now, and we'll continue to press that lead, so we feel very confident.","Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.","Terrific. Thank you.","Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Stanton with CLSA. Your line is open.","David Stanton - CLSA Australia Pty Ltd.","Thanks very much for taking my questions and good afternoon. You said, Mick, in your prepared remarks that you had the highest market share globally. I'd be very interested to know what you think your market share is and how you derive that number. That's my first question.","Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, David. Absolutely willing and happy to say that we are the market share leader. I don't want to go \u2013 we're in 100 countries, and I don't want to go into individual countries or individual market shares within any of those individual countries. But as you've seen these really, really strong high double-digit growth numbers over these last four quarters in flow generators and look at the number of devices that we've sold and the market share and your assessment of the market. I think you'd be pretty confident, and pretty much every sell-side analyst out there would be pretty confident that we're the market share leader in not only flow generators, but also in masks globally. But we don't sort of want to go into the details of it, David, for competitive reasons.","Look, the main thing about market leadership is not just the market share leadership but the fact that you're innovating better and driving value. And I think one of the core parts of this is providing value for the end users in this whole system, who are the patients. We provide the smallest, quietest, most comfortable, and most connected care altogether to patients, and I think that's what's really driving our growth and leadership. And frankly, it's a challenge for us and anyone else playing in the field to continue to do that. And that's what the game is going to be going forward, providing that long term value to patients.","David Stanton - CLSA Australia Pty Ltd.","Thank you. And I wonder if you could give us an update, basically following on from previous questions, can you give us an idea of the replenishment, the mask replenishment environment in the U.S. in terms of payers? Are payers more or less willing to see mask replenishment than perhaps they were even a year or two years ago? Thanks very much.","Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Thanks, David. Replenishment is a really important part of sleep apnea care because the masks do degrade over time and become more leaky. And to have a patient on sleep apnea care \u2013 for a payer who is following it properly, a payer provider who is following it properly, the investment of $100-odd on a mask every six months to keep a patient out of hospital where a visit to a hospital can cost $2,000 to $3,000 to $5,000 just walking in the door and spending one day there.","The return on investment for our payer providers who are really following this model closely amongst their sleep apnea patients, their COPD patients, their neuromuscular disease patients, their (1:01:08) patients, the ROI is a no-brainer when you've got the data. I think our informatics solutions are allowing us to have the data to provide the payer-providers and show that ROI.","And so, I think you are transitioning from sort of a world of utilization management, where people just think of unit costs in a fee-for-service world, to a world of care management where people are thinking about holistic costs to the patient and what it costs to not provide the diabetes supplies or to not provide the hypertensive meds or to not provide the sleep apnea mask. And it's saying, I'm going to cut back on diabetes supplies to save myself money when then the diabetic is back in the hospital or to cut back on the number of masks and, therefore, have the sleep apnea patients show up at the hospital is sort of a 1980s way of looking at things in the utilization management front.","So I think we are seeing that transition and I think that the payers are really moving to that world of ACOs and payer-providers and looking to mimic the model of those successful payer-providers. But it's a transition world and we are playing in both the fee-for-service world and in the care management world and balancing between the two very carefully.","Operator","We are now at the one-hour mark, so I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.","Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, thanks a lot, Melissa. And thanks for all the good questions. In closing, I want to thank the more than 4,000 strong ResMed team from around the world for their continued commitment to changing the lives of literally millions of patients with every breath. I'm very proud of what this team has accomplished in creating the market-leading innovation in connected care and healthcare informatics solutions in our medical devices. And we remain focused on our long-term goal of changing 20 million patient lives by 2020.","Thanks a lot and we'll talk to you all in 90 days.","Operator","This concludes ResMed's first quarter fiscal year 2016 earnings live webcast.

My name is Chris, and I'll be your conference operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I'll now turn the call over to Amy Wakeham, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. You may begin.","Amy Wakeham - ResMed Inc.","Great. Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us and welcome to ResMed's first quarter fiscal year 2019 earnings call. As Chris said, this call is being webcast live and the replay along with a copy of the press release and our updated Investor Presentation will be available on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website.","I'd like to highlight that we have made a few enhancements to our press release this quarter. We've summarized key information to make it easier to locate and analyze. We have provided some additional commentary regarding our results and we've included supplemental revenue information, which had previously been posted separately to our website. We hope these changes are helpful as you analyze our results. We're always looking to improve our disclosure and welcome any feedback you may have.","Joining me on the call today to discuss our quarterly results are Mick Farrell, our CEO; and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of management will be available during the Q&A portion of the call following our prepared remarks.","During our call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures. For reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, please see the notes to the financial statements in today's earnings release. As a reminder, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, expectations about ResMed's future performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions; however, our actual results may differ. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements.","I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks, Amy, and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today, as we review results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. On today's call, I will review top level financial results, some business highlights and a few key announcements from the quarter. Then, I'll hand the call over to Brett, who will walk you through our financial results in more detail.","So, first, the top level financial results, we started the new fiscal year right where we left off the old one with another quarter of strong and balanced performance across our portfolio. My personal thanks go out to our global team. It is the hard work and dedication of more than 6,000 ResMedians that has allowed us to continue to deliver these strong results.","Global revenue grew by double digits, 12% headline and 13% on a constant currency basis. Our ongoing focus on business efficiencies as well as tech investments has resulted in continued bottom line improvements, with non-GAAP net income improving 23% year-over-year. These efforts at the top line and the bottom line resulted in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.81. So that is 23% growth in Q1 EPS versus this time last year.","So now some business highlights across our global fleet and our global respiratory care business. So, turning to a discussion about business operations, let's start with these core businesses. We are the world's leading connected health and digital health technology company with well over 8 million patients supported by our cloud-based patient management system called AirView and well over 6 million patients with 100% cloud connectable devices that are available for remote daily monitoring. Over the past 12 months, we have improved their lives by delivering physical products to over 14 million people, delivering products to treat their sleep apnea and\/or their chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. And we are well on our way to achieving our long-term goal of changing 20 million lives by 2020.","Our digital health technology is turning big data into actionable insights for patients, physicians, homecare providers and beyond. We now have over 3 billion nights of medical sleep and medical COPD data in the cloud and the growth is exponential. Everything we do supports our ambition to help the more than 936 million people worldwide, who suffocate every night with sleep apnea and the over 400 million people worldwide, who suffer from lung disease. As we seek to treat their chronic diseases and help them, really importantly stay out of hospital, with a high quality of life in their own home.","Our efforts to improve market access by communicating the clinical and economic efficacy of our solutions with payors, payor providers and governments are achieving results in geographies around the world. There have been significant changes over the past 12 to 18 months in digital health reimbursement in the United States, in France, and in Japan. This is not random and this is just the beginning. Based on the smaller, quieter and more comfortable technology, within our AirSense 10 and AirCurve 10 platforms and the digital health and connected health solutions of our cloud based Air Solutions platform, we continue to take share with device sales that remain very strong.","Last quarter, we discussed the proposed rule issued by CMS regarding changes to logistics and pricing methodologies under the competitive bidding program in the U.S. We expect the final rule to come out sometime in early to mid-November. Based on our assessment of what is happening in Washington D.C., our key takeaway points remain the same. One, we believe the changes overall will be a net positive for patients, the home care provider industry, and for ResMed. And two, we are pleased that CMS is sincerely listening to industry advocates and seems to be responding to our concerns and the concerns that we have for patients and the community.","On the devices side of our business, we delivered another solid quarter with year over year global constant currency growth of 14% powered by strong growth of 20% in Europe, Asia and the rest of world, and solid 9% growth in the United States, Canada and Latin America geographies. During August, we introduced an upgrade to our Astral life support ventilator platform and have seen good adoption since the launch of that Astral platform. This is now added and compounded to the digital health powered growth of the AirSense 10 and AirCurve 10 devices. The controlled product launch of our Mobi portable oxygen concentrator is going very well and we expect to move to a full product launch next quarter as we lock down our go to market model. We are working in full partnership with our HME customers to grow this category.","We think that's the best strategy and the one that helps not only home care providers but most importantly the patients. We continue to build device \u2013 our market share as healthcare providers and physicians around the world are choosing ResMed devices not just for their intrinsic designed in quality but also for the sustainable value proposition of the digital health solutions we offer as part of our ecosystem.","These solutions are literally upgraded every few weeks as new versions of AirView, myAir, the Brightree platform and HEALTHCAREfirst cloud-based software are released. We will continue to evolve and enhance our solutions to meet ongoing patient, physician, payor, and home care provider needs. We believe this will continue to drive future ResMed success.","The masks and accessories side of our business grew 10% in constant currency globally during the quarter, led by a very strong demand in the U.S., Canada and Latin America geographies which grew at 11% on a constant currency basis. We are seeing continued good traction with our AirFit F20 on the full face side and our AirFit N20 on the nasal side across all geographies.","During the quarter, we launched our brand new AirFit F30, an amazing innovation in the minimal-contact full face mask category. It's our first play in this category of product. With the F30, we have expanded our mask portfolio to offer even more options for home care providers and ultimately for the very needs of individual patients. By keeping our innovation laser-focused on under-met and unmet customer needs, we will achieve continued growth of ResMed masks throughout fiscal year 2019 and beyond.","So, let's now turn to a discussion of our Software as a Service global business. This business continues its trajectory of growth with revenue up 25% year-on-year driven by continued expansion of Brightree, but also incremental contribution from the acquisition of HEALTHCAREfirst, which closed early in Q1.","We are revolutionizing healthcare delivery through a smart connected ecosystem that provides superior outcomes for patients and for homecare providers. We have been working on some pretty important enhancements of our out-of-hospital medical software business over the last few years.","Let me cover some recent highlights in the last few quarters. We recently commenced a controlled launch of our Brightree Advanced Analytics platform. This data analytics platform leverages advanced analytics technology and filtering capabilities to offer a scalable data solution for homecare providers. We help customers better manage their business from an aggregate perspective and also provide the ability to easily drill down into the details to drive business efficiency. Ultimately, this will free up cash flow and clinician time, which will lead to better patient care.","We also recently introduced two new apps for customers. First, the BrightreeCARE app for home health and hospice aides, as well as the Patient Hub app, which is designed for home medical equipment providers. The BrightreeCARE app enables home health and hospice aides to easily document their visits in the home on their own smart device without having to carry additional equipment. This provides mobility, flexibility and efficiency to our customers. We think it's going to help drive home health and hospice market share growth for our Brightree franchise.","Patient Hub is a patient engagement app that automates and simplifies how HME providers connect with their patients into one secure platform. This effectively eliminates the need for multiple Web portals and sign-ons and consolidates all patient interactions including appointment reminders, insurance updates, order placement, and delivery status. By improving ease of engagement and automation, the Patient Hub app empowers care providers, frees up resources and creates opportunities to accelerate cash flow for our HME customers.","We will continue to invest in these and other technologies to expand our Software-as-a Service portfolio offering. There will be strong ongoing organic growth as well as opportunities for acquisition-driven growth within the United States and also certain geographies that we're looking at in Europe and in Asia.","Now let's discuss the progress we have made executing on our global business excellence initiatives across the organization. We have delivered yet another quarter of double-digit net operating profit improvement. That's the fifth quarter in a row. We are pleased to again drive operating leverage to improve the bottom line of our business.","Non-GAAP income from operations improved 26% in the quarter, combining solid revenue growth and stable gross margin with disciplined investment in SG&A, which grew by just 4% in constant currency in the quarter and research and development investments, which grew at 8% in constant currency during the quarter. I want to reemphasize that our business excellence initiatives are about the long term, working more efficiently, leveraging new tech tools, improving global processes, and working smarter. We are taking a disciplined and thoughtful approach and we will continue to invest in R&D for our business and deliver strong organic growth and operating leverage. We have proven that these two value growth engines, organic growth and operating leverage, are not mutually exclusive.","Before I turn the call over to Brett, let me close with this. We have had a great start to the new fiscal year and we are well-positioned to grow throughout FY 2019 and beyond. The continued success of our current mask and device portfolio along with the solid pipeline of new products and enhanced connected health solutions for sleep apnea, COPD and out of hospital medical software markets give us confidence in ongoing momentum as we move throughout the year.","We have positioned the company for the long-term, driving top- and bottom-line growth into 2020 and beyond as we execute on our strategy to continue to lead the med tech field in digital health to create value with connected health and to achieve what we call our Triple Aim, which is: one, to slow chronic disease progression; two, to reduce overall healthcare system costs; and three, most importantly to improve the outcomes and quality of life for the ultimate customer in our industry, our patients.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brett in Sydney for his remarks. And then, we will go to Q&A. Brett?","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the September quarter was $588.3 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter, or in constant currency terms revenue increased by 13%.","Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, our sales in U.S., Canada and Latin American countries were $326.4 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia and other markets totaled $214.4 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales in combined Europe, Asia and other markets increased by 16% over the prior year quarter.","Breaking out revenue between product segments, U.S., Canada and Latin America device sales were $172.4 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $154 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter. For revenue in Europe, Asia and other markets, device sales were $151.7 million, an increase of 18% over the prior year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 20%.","Masks and other sales were $62.7 million, an increase of 3% over the prior year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 6%. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 14%, while masks and other sales increased by 10% over the prior year quarter. Software-as-a-Service revenue for the first quarter was $47.5 million, an increase of 25% over the prior year quarter. This includes the contribution from our HEALTHCAREfirst acquisition that closed on July 6.","Excluding HEALTHCAREfirst, Software-as-a-Service revenue grew in the high single digits. As you heard from Mick earlier, we've recently introduced several new SaaS offerings and expect future growth opportunities over the coming quarters and fiscal years based on our expanded platforms and our ongoing innovations.","During the rest of my commentary today, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles and tax-related expenses associated with U.S. tax reforms. The prior year comparable excludes amortization of acquired intangibles. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our first quarter earnings press release.","Our gross margin for the September quarter was 58.3% compared with 58.4% during the same quarter in the prior year. Our margin was essentially consistent with prior year and reflects typical declines in average selling prices, largely offset by manufacturing and procurement efficiencies. On a sequential basis, our gross margin improved by 20 basis points over Q4 FY 2018. Assuming current exchange rates and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margin for fiscal year 2019 to be broadly consistent with our Q1 FY 2019 gross margin.","Moving on to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $147.3 million, an increase of 2% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 4%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 25% compared to the 27.5% that we reported in the prior year quarter. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be within the range of 24% to 25% for fiscal year 2019.","R&D expenses for the quarter was $38.8 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter, or on a constant currency basis an increase of 8%. This increase reflects incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.6% as compared with 7.1% in the prior year. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be within the range of 6% to 7% for fiscal year 2019.","Amortization of the acquired intangibles was $12.9 million for the quarter, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $12.5 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $157 million, an increase of 26% over the prior year quarter; while non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $116.3 million, an increase of 23% over the prior year quarter.","Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.81, an increase of 23% over the prior year quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.73. Foreign exchange movements negatively impacted first quarter earnings by $0.01 per share, reflecting the unfavorable impact from the weaker euro relative to the U.S. dollar, which were partially offset by the weaker Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.","On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rates for the September quarter was 23.9%; while on a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.4%. We continue to estimate that our fiscal year 2019 effective tax rate will be in the range of 22% to 24%.","Cash flow from operations during the first quarter was $48.1 million. This included tax payments of $125 million in the current quarter, compared to $30.2 million in the same period of the prior year. Excluding the tax payments, our cash flow from operations was $173.1 million, reflecting strong underlying earnings and improved working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $13 million. Depreciation and amortization for the September quarter totaled $30.4 million. And during the quarter, we paid dividends of $52.8 million.","Our board of directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share, and we continued our share buyback during the September quarter and repurchased 200,000 shares for consideration of $22.8 million.","During the quarter, we also completed the acquisition of HEALTHCAREfirst, for cash consideration of $126.3 million. With respect to our recently announced joint venture with Verily, we have now received all required regulatory approvals and expect to commence operations during our second quarter. We will provide an update of the likely operating costs associated with the JV in our second quarter earnings call. At September 30, we have $530 million in gross debt and $299 million in net debt. Our balance sheet remained strong with modest debt levels. At September 30, total assets were $3.1 billion and net equity was $1.9 billion.","And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy.","Amy Wakeham - ResMed Inc.","Great. Thanks, Brett. Let's now turn to the Q&A portion. I'd like to remind everyone to limit yourself to one question. If you do have additional questions, please feel free to hop back into the queue. Chris, we're now ready to go ahead and start the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Chris Cooper with Goldman Sachs is online with a question.","Chris Cooper - Goldman Sachs Australia Pty Ltd.","Hi. Good morning, good afternoon. I'll state my one question. Just on European masks please, I think the 6% number that we saw was just a little bit larger than we've seen lately, and I appreciate you have potentially a pretty strong comp. I'll be just curious to hear if you could talk to some of the drivers around what's driven that number and specifically as well, I'll be curious to hear if you could comment on what sort of impact you've seen in terms of share from your competitors' full face mask that was launched, I guess, back in April now. Thank you.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah, thanks for the question, Chris. And yeah, we're really quite proud of the global and constant currency growth, the 10% on masks, 11% in U.S. and Canada, 6% in Europe, Asia and others is maybe just around sort of the market growth range. I think our comp was around the sort of 10%, 15% from a year ago quarter. And so as you noted there was a very, very strong comp there.","Look, we've just launched new masks into this marketplace. The QuietAir technology was launched just maybe six plus months ago. The F30 is only just hitting global markets at this point. And so, Europe tends to take longer for technologies to permeate through the different countries and each different countries have different reimbursement models. It's not the United States of Europe. So, we have to work through sort of the 26 models of reimbursement and how masks are provided there.","I do think there's opportunity to drive more resupply of masks throughout many of our European countries, and so there's systemic and digital health driven methodologies that we can use to drive the whole market number up there. But if you're asking if I'd like to see 6% be closer to 10%, the answer is absolutely. Do I think it's a good quarter from our European team with 20% growth on devices and 6% growth on masks? Absolutely. But I know there's room for improvement there, and we'll certainly be working with Tim Hoyes and (00:26:04) the global team and the Western European, Northern European and Eastern European leaders to make sure that we can move that number up as we move forward throughout FY 2019 and beyond.","(00:26:17)","Chris Cooper - Goldman Sachs Australia Pty Ltd.","...just to clarify, I mean, it's more of a \u2013 the fact that the market growth exceeds beyond that level, you're not seeing yourself lose any momentum to your new competitors?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. I don't think we're losing share in the European marketplace. I think there's opportunities to grow that market growth number, but I don't think we're losing share at that point, but I think we should be taking share with the F30 and the QuietAir technology. And so I'd like to see that number push closer to the double digits, Chris.","Chris Cooper - Goldman Sachs Australia Pty Ltd.","Okay. Thank you.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks for your question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Wong Pan with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Craig Wong Pan - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia)","Hi. Just wanted to ask about your rest of world device growth, I mean, that was quite strong. Could you just talk to what are the main drivers behind that?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah, Craig, good question. So that's the 20% Europe, Asia and other markets growth. Yeah, incredibly strong. We did see continued benefits in countries like France as we see the digital health technology and reimbursement changes that have happened there and there's a good strong tail to that upgrade, if you like, from non-cloud connectable to cloud connectable devices across France. But I'm going to tell you across the other 25 countries in Europe and across many of the countries in Asia, we saw just a really strong quarter in our device business. It's powered by the digital health technology. As I talked about in the prepared remarks, you've seen actual reimbursement changes in the U.S. and in France and in Japan and certainly they're providing some power behind the growth, but in many other countries where reimbursement hasn't yet caught up to the technology, the technology itself is lowering the setup cost of our therapy by 50% and improving the adherence rate from industry standard, 50%, 60% like pharmaceutical medicines up to 80%, 87% in some of the published data that we have out there. So that's the real power behind it, and we think there's a lot of legs to it.","Certainly, some elements like the upgrade from non-cloud connectable to connectable has a time limit to it, but the digital health tail of lowering costs and improving adherence, which improves outcomes, we think has a much longer runway, and so we're excited about that opportunity to continue our Europe, Asia and global growth in devices.","Craig Wong Pan - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia)","Okay. Sorry, can I just clarify on France, I thought last quarter you were mentioning that that sort of benefit from digital health devices was easing off, but it sounds like that's kind of ramped up again, would that be correct?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","No, it hasn't ramped up again. It just hasn't eased off as quickly and you know I think that \u2013 as I said I think that tail is longer than we had thought 90 days ago and probably has a little bit more to run in it and \u2013 but it's not just that one country, right, there's 199 others outside of the U.S. and France that we sell into. And I think the point I'm trying to make is it's \u2013 many of the others starting to power up around digital health not just on reimbursement driven ones like that country like France, but on the \u2013 just the core economic and efficacy value prop that we get from the digital health technology that we have now in the AirSense 10 and on the AirCurve 10 and in some of the ventilation platforms as well.","Craig Wong Pan - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia)","Great. Thanks.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks, Craig.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with BMO Securities. Your line is open.","Matthew Henriksson - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yes, hi. This is Matt Henriksson in for Joanne. With \u2013 related to Brightree, the high-single-digits organic growth rate, it's kind of a slowdown from what you guys were reporting in fiscal 2018? Is that kind of a one quarter blip or is the high-single-digit growth rate kind of a go-forward rate?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Matt, and that's a really good question. As you noted, yeah, high-single-digits from Brightree but 25% from Brightree plus HEALTHCAREfirst and the other SaaS platforms. Look, it's the first quarter that we were integrating HEALTHCAREfirst. And so we have a team in home health and hospice at Brightree working on integration of those two platforms and in the core HME platform at Brightree. Our team was just at Medtrade this quarter and they've launched, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, brand new apps and some other value props that I think can help add not only more users, but more value per user opportunities as we go throughout fiscal 2019.","So do I think that high-single-digits can go back to low-double-digits on the core Brightree? Absolutely. And there's probably three reasons for that. One, as I talked about in competitive bidding we're seeing that landscape really settle out so that people can focus on efficiency versus sort of some of the other aspects of declining reimbursement over the last seven years.","Two, with all the changes over the last seven years in the HME industry, there's just a need for more and more efficiencies. And three, as I mentioned, some of these new solutions we're bringing into play. So, for those three reasons, I'm very confident that we can start to get that double-digit growth out of the core Brightree platform, while also integrating HEALTHCAREfirst and tying our home health and hospice value props together as we grow in the HME industry.","Matthew Henriksson - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you for the color.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sean Laaman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.","Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Mick, you mentioned that the Mobi will go into a full product release this quarter. I don't know if you're able to give us some flavor or detail around what your strategy is there and maybe some feedback from the customer base to see what they want to see from such a product.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah, Sean, just to clarify, I said next quarter. So, we're going to go to full product launch during our Q3, which is our January to March quarter.","Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.","Got it.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","But Rob Douglas is here. Rob, do you want to give a little more clarity on to Mobi and our go-to-market model?","Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.","Sure. Sure, Sean. We've been experimenting with our controlled product launch throughout the year. It's been slow and steady progress. The customers using it and we've selected them carefully, really liked the product and it's working well. We're seeing really good field performance from it, and we're very happy with it. Mick and I both have been in the factory in Singapore seeing it being built, and we're very, very proud of the systems that we've got there and we think we've got an extremely high quality product.","As we've said many times, our go-to-market strategy really involves supporting our HME provider customers to access patients and to get this treatment on the patients in the most effective way and those are really the things we've been looking at closely in the preps for the full launch. And as Mick said, we're well on hand with preparations for full launch starting in the next quarter, in Q3.","Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.","Right. Thanks, Rob. And maybe just a quick one for Brett, just to check looking at the balance sheet that stepped down in tax payable, so the issue on cash flow from ops is now in the rear vision mirror, is that correct?","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah, that paid the payable on the balance sheet, we essentially paid that or a lot of that through this quarter, Sean. You saw that come through the cash flow.","Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.","Great. Thanks, Brett, and that's all I have.","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Okay.","Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.","Thank you, Mick.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks, Sean.","Operator","Your next question is from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Your line is open.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. The one thing that we're happened to notice since the last few years, your increase in SG&A as a percentage of total sales the fourth quarter relative to the fourth tends to go up, and this is kind of relatively flat, maybe down a little bit. So, can you walk us through any potential changes this quarter outside of ResMed 3.0? And then as we look forward is 4% growth in dollars currency neutral the right number, or will that change given the recent top-line growth that you've seen of 13%?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah, Margaret, thanks for the question. Yeah, that allows us to talk about the business excellence and the operating excellence programs that we've been putting into place. And clearly, yeah, as you saw in Q1 with the 4% growth in SG&A year-on-year, we really are focused on making sure we don't just work harder, but we work smarter and we have better global processes.","We take some of the amazing sort of tech-driven healthcare and tech-driven solutions that we've given to our customers and apply them internally. And so we're looking at tech-driven solutions in systems and softwares within our company to allow us to throw process and technology at a problem not just say we need to hire 20 more people to solve that problem. And so I think our team has got very sophisticated on this and we had some great results.","As you know, we don't give detailed quarter-to-quarter guidance on exactly what we're going to do in terms of year-on-year growth. But we're going to keep that SG&A as a percentage of revenue in the bounds that Brett said in his prepared remarks. And I'd love to do better than that, but that's the sort of guidance that we're going to give and stick to. What we saw in this quarter was excellent performance from our team. We've got 6,000 people selling in 120 countries and selling a lot more and selling a lot smarter, and I love the results and we want to do more of the above.","Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC","And just as a quick follow-up to one your other comments, Mick, you had mentioned M&A within the SaaS ex-U.S. and Europe and Asia is kind of geographic targets perhaps. So maybe you can describe kind of what attributes you guys are looking for and should we assume that those targets are going to be focused on your largest geographies or maybe smaller that are good fits that you can expand into other geographies? Thanks.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah, thanks, Margaret, that's a good follow-up. It allows us to talk about the M&A strategy in that global SaaS business. So you know as you heard, Margaret, and many others on our Investor Day where we had a drill-down from Raj Sodhi, who's the global President of our SaaS business. He's the global President of our SaaS business and a lot of the focus has been on Brightree, which is U.S. focused and HEALTHCAREfirst, which is U.S. focused. We do sell in 120 other countries and we're clearly looking for opportunities outside there.","I'm not going to signal because it's a competitive market exactly what geographies and what sectors we're looking at outside. I do just want to let our investor base know that we are looking at that opportunity. And we are also looking within the United States. Look, as you saw in the quarter incredible organic growth, right. I mean, 25% across just Brightree and HEALTHCAREfirst and all the tuck-ins we've put in there, we think that opportunity is there within the U.S.; and for ResMed, we think we have the right to be the world's leading provider of out-of-hospital medical software. We've done it in HME. We're doing it really well in home health and hospice verticals, and there are other verticals in the out-of-hospital care sector that we think can help within the U.S. geography and beyond.","So, Margaret, without getting really specific, that's what I was talking to, and as we look at M&A, it's got to meet three criteria: Number one, it's got to fit our global strategy; two, it's got to make sense on the numbers and fit our financial strategy; and three, it's got to be a strong cultural fit. It has to be a fit between us and the management team and that we're going to work together and work better together and provide some growth to each other and sharing across the platform. So that's how we look at M&A. Thanks for the questions, Margaret.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lyanne Harrison with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Lyanne, if you're speaking, you're on mute. Okay, Chris. Let's go to the next question.","Lyanne Harrison - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hello.","(00:38:52)","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Oh, no, here's Lyanne.","Lyanne Harrison - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Oh, here we go. Sorry about that. I'm just \u2013 I have a question around your operating leverage and with your gross margins for this quarter. Can you shed some light in terms of what sort of operating leverage mechanisms were in place to help counter your ASP reductions?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah, absolutely. I'll hand that \u2013 it's a good question, Lyanne. I'll hand that question to Brett Sandercock, our CFO.","Lyanne Harrison - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Mick. Yeah, Lyanne. We've got, I mean it's probably where \u2013 we've got quite a large program in place, I guess, which is kind of cost out programs or initiatives around efficiencies and improvements in processes, improvements in procurement or logistics, which basically we look at, I mean, we look at it well over time, but on a monthly basis and pretty formalized in terms of making sure we have a good pipeline of opportunities that we've always got.","And then, looking and seeing and make sure that we're executing on those pipeline of opportunities as well. So quite sophisticated in what we do to make sure that we can operate it efficiently as we can. And clearly, if we can do that, that supports the gross margin and offsets as you can see this quarter, essentially offsets some typical ASP decline. So, that can be around a lot, I mean it can be around improvements to production, routing and selling that would improve, for example, recoveries that we make on the back of growing volumes or it could be around procurement and working even more closely nowadays with suppliers to make sure we can get the products not just as cheaply as we can but kind of as smart as we can in terms of the components and kind of what they can offer us and we try to build that into our prices as well.","The kind of, I guess, quite \u2013 it gets more sophisticated in terms of how you're partnering and that's tended to help us in driving out some cost as well and there's no silver bullet. It's a number of programs and a number of opportunities that we have to work on essentially day in and day out. But, I guess, it's almost part of our DNA to make sure we could deliver on those and that's \u2013 and we don't hold back. There's not an endpoint, it's just an ongoing process. And so that's basically what the team works on particularly on the operations side.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, Brett, also just to add in there Lyanne, we're running really an innovation-driven growth company and we're investing to grow the company, but we've got a really solid base of a lot of existing patients and existing business.","So, a lot of our sort of leverage strategies around improving efficiencies in those core parts of the business, enabling the investments in innovation to really start driving new and more efficient ways to go to market, and then that feeds on itself going that way. But we're really getting leverage by investing appropriately in the growth areas and getting more efficient in the existing areas.","Lyanne Harrison - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just to follow-up on that, you mentioned there was an improvement in logistics costs as well. Have you seen your logistic costs increase with the rising fuel cost?","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Well I mean I think that might start to manifest, but it's not \u2013 I don't \u2013 it will be a cost impact for us but I don't think it would be significant for us. I mean, it's certainly there. I don't want to discount it completely but it's not \u2013 it wouldn't be like a huge component of costs for us.","Lyanne Harrison - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Goodsall with MST Marquee. Your line is open.","Andrew Goodsall - MST Marquee","Thanks very much for taking my question. Just on U.S. masks, the 11% was a good number on \u2013 a very good number actually on tough comps. Just trying to get a sense whether you're seeing the acceleration of your resupply growth in that number?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah, that's a good question Andrew. I mean certainly, we have seen some good success of the QuietAir technology that has been in there now two and a half quarters and then the brand new launch of the F30 out the gate may have had some impact, but Jim Hollingshead who is the President of our Global Sleep Business might have some commentary as to the resupply.","James Hollingshead - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah, hi, Andrew. There are a couple of things going on in the North America market. The first one is, the mask portfolio, our product mix is performing very well. So the F20 is performing very well, the N20 is performing very well and so our position with new patients is very strong. But resupply is also doing well and what we've seen over the last several quarters is an increasing adoption of automated resupply platforms by HMEs in the market. And so I think we're getting growth on both sides of it, both new patient and resupply.","Andrew Goodsall - MST Marquee","That's terrific. And just picking up on that question on ASP, I'm guessing that with your GM being flat it's primarily driven by devices up 14%, masks up 10%. Just trying to think, going forward, whether that maybe brings about any change in your GMs for your devices?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah, look certainly the portable oxygen concentrator market is closer to the gross margin profile of the CPAP range versus that you'd find in a full face mask or a Software as a Service solution and so yeah, we think it's fantastic gross profit dollar contribution that we can achieve from the portable oxygen concentrator market that it will be in a lower gross margin percentage dollar. We still think it's a great market to go after because of the 400 million patients worldwide, who suffer from lung disease, how they want to get out of their home and be untethered from that liquid oxygen, POCs provide a great opportunity and ResMed with our experience in digital health and what we can do when we not only give great quality oxygen and portability and reliability in the Mobi, but then also in the future bring our digital health capabilities to bear, we think it's a great market to go after. So, yeah, you'll see both of those, growth in gross profit dollars, some impact on the gross margin percentage, but certainly ResMed investing in a strong strategic area, in a chronic disease that needs our help and we can help keep these patients out of hospital and happily in their home or in the park playing with their grandkids with lung disease and our ResMed Mobi.","Andrew Goodsall - MST Marquee","Great. So, it's a more absolute growth as opposed to sort of margin leverage through that I guess, through that change in mix.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Great. Thanks (00:45:49).","Andrew Goodsall - MST Marquee","Yeah.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Correct.","Andrew Goodsall - MST Marquee","Thank you.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks for your questions, Andrew.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Low with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.","Thanks very much. Mick, just picking up on your comment about resupply in markets outside the U.S., so just wondering if you could give us some \u2013 any metrics at all in terms of where the bigger European markets are at versus the U.S. so we could perhaps get some sense of the opportunity there?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah, David. Look and I know you've followed our stock for many years and so, it's not new news to you that the resupply rate is stronger in the U.S. than in Western Europe and Asia. One thing we're finding as we now are expanding our digital health capability and empowering patients worldwide, now 6 million to 8million patients worldwide with their digital health data is that when patients get control of their data and get control of their healthcare, they demand more things. And one of the things they demand is a clean mask.","And I personally use a device and if you're not changing your mask every three months or worse six months, the thing gets incredibly visually in need of replacement. And I think if you look at the average replacement in the U.S. it's around two masks per year on average in some data that was public on that front. We think it could be more than that. If you empower patients with the ability to access different models to get resupply. We're working on that in Brightree and in ResMed Resupply and Brightree Connect. But we also think for the other 120 countries we do business in, there's an opportunity to empower patients with their data, empower patients with an opportunity to have access to more masks on an annual basis. And I'm looking at Jim Hollingshead here, our President of our Global Sleep Business. I mean, Jim you know resupply outside the U.S. is something we've been looking at for a long period of time. Digital health gives us an opportunity, right?","James Hollingshead - ResMed, Inc.","Digital health certainly drives it and I think patients definitely want clean masks and resupply mask. And by the way, I'll throw \u2013 I'll add to that point that recent research shows that when a patient is resupplied, they're more adherent, right. And so, we're seeing more and more evidence for that and I think that that's starting to influence more and more physicians worldwide. But if you think about Europe and resupply, you've got this massive variety of payment models. I mean, we wouldn't have time to go through them all on the call.","But what you are seeing is pretty steady resupply in most of those markets. And in some cases patients are getting resupplied because the hospital system has trouble doing it, just has trouble executing on it. And so, you'll \u2013 in certain countries, more and more we're providing that kind of service on behalf of the hospital system. I mean, that's a very different model from the U.S. where you've got a fee-for-service resupply that's driving demand. In certain countries in Europe, a hospital system wants to give the patient a mask just administratively can't do it. And so, that's one of the ways we're driving resupply in different European markets.","David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.","But, so it would seem that it would be fair to say that the resupply rates across, let's pick the three or four biggest European markets, are significantly lower than the U.S. perhaps only half?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","They are low. We haven't gone into sort of the quantitative on that. And I don't think there's been any like external research public that I can talk to on that David. But clearly outside the U.S. the resupply rates are lower. The bottom line is patient demand is there. And as Jim said, even sometimes the channel partner and the patient want to deliver, they just don't know how and haven't got the capability to do it. ResMed has the capability to do it and we've proven that in a number of international markets outside the U.S. And what I was talking to on the answer earlier was that we plan to rev up those capabilities and really help our customers, the patients, and the providers provide better care. And as Jim said, that leads to better adherence and lower cost for the healthcare system.","David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.","Great. Thanks for that. Could I just squeeze one other in? Brett, we've worried a little bit about legal costs and that having an impact on the operating leverage. I was wondering if you could just talk to what we \u2013 what came through in the quarter past and what we should expect for the year ahead. Thanks.","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, David, it's been, I guess, our legal cases and so on have been ongoing for a while now. So it's more or less built into the run rate. And, I mean, it can vary around a little bit quarter-to-quarter but I wouldn't expect it \u2013 it's sort of built into the run rate, so I wouldn't expect that to significantly spike through the year or anything like that. Leading up to court cases and so on, it can increase a little. But I don't think it would be particularly meaningful in any quarter at least that's what our expectation is at this stage. It's more or less built into the run rate that we've seen over the last year or two.","David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.","Yeah. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Stanton with CLSA. Your line is open.","David Stanton - CLSA Australia Pty Ltd.","Thanks very much for taking my question. Just in terms of the business acquisition you made in the quarter of $126 million, firstly, I missed the name of it and second, did that lead to any profit contribution for the quarter please? And if so, can you give us some color around that? Thank you.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah, David. The acquisition was HEALTHCAREfirst. So, it's a Software as a Service provider for home health, so home nursing and hospice providers within the U.S. geography, a really exciting business that did contribute in the quarter as we talked about to driving the 25% year-on-year growth in our Software as a Service global business. Brett, do you want to talk a little bit to the other parts of David's question as to impact on profitability during the quarter or not going into too much further detail there?","Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, I can. It's a nice acquisition, but it's not a large one as such. So, it's not \u2013 we wouldn't get that granular on that Dave, but we did, I think last call or the call before I think we sort of said that the revenue from that was about $28 million or $29 million something like that. So, that will kind of size it for you. Obviously some profit contributions, but on the size of our business, I guess, kind of quarterly fairly de minimis. But from a portfolio standpoint, our SaaS business, quite exciting space and we're seeing good growth opportunities there. So, we do think that's strong, strategically, just a small contribution initially, but we do think that should give us a nice growth trajectory.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Just to add on to that David, the home health and hospice category or vertical if you like that HEALTHCAREfirst sells into, Brightree also sells into that. So, we've got those two teams integrating and working together to drive, as Brett said, good ongoing organic growth as we look forward in the coming quarters and fiscal years within that home health and hospice vertical which we think is underserved, for this great software and there's a lot of opportunity to grow.","David Stanton - CLSA Australia Pty Ltd.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Saul Hadassin with UBS. Your line is open.","Saul Hadassin - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.","Good morning, good afternoon, Mick. Thanks for taking my question. Mick, just looking at the 14% devices growth, strong growth globally, can you give any color or talk to how the non-invasive ventilation part of your business is going relative to the core sleep, CPAP part of the business?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. So as you know we don't break out the particular AirCurve 10 versus the AirSense 10 aspect of that and we don't break out the Astral and we just launched the Mobi. But the vast majority of the sales are in the sleep side of the business as you know that's what the company was founded on, it's our core business. I'm really excited by the new software upgrade to Astral and it's really starting to come out of the gate well. But it's not a strong \u2013 wasn't a strong material contributor in the quarter. We do think, as we look forward, that the AirCurve 10 and Astral life support ventilator and the Mobi, those three together in our respiratory care vertical will really start to contribute.","And I look forward to the earnings call when I'm breaking them out and going through them in detail because it's material to the global business. But at this point, we don't break them out to that level of detail but I appreciate your question. And yeah, certainly that 14% global number it really \u2013 as I said in the prepared remarks, it really talks to the economic value proposition of the digital health. People are choosing our devices and we're taking share even three plus four years out on some of these platforms because the software isn't four years out, it was updated two weeks ago, four weeks ago and it'll be upgraded every month this coming 12 months. So, that's sort of the picture there, Saul, but appreciate your question. Sorry, I can't go into more granular detail for you.","Saul Hadassin - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.","Not after breakout of revenues by device type, but just more interested in whether the growth in the contribution of whatever revenue it was for the non-invasive platform within the space is on par with what you see in sort of the core sleep therapies, is it materially lower, higher just that type of comment.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah, no. It's on par and in the future has the potential to be well ahead of given the under-met opportunity particularly in portable oxygen concentrators that are digitally powered and I think in the NIV space. I mean you look at the clinical data that we presented over the last number of quarters showing that we can reduce hospitalizations, reduce costs and really improve the lives of these COPD patients. I think NIV is particularly in the U.S. and non-sort of Western European geographies completely underpenetrated versus its opportunity in the COPD space. So, I think there is an opportunity for it to be materially above, but in Q1, it was pretty much in line with the growth across the other businesses.","Saul Hadassin - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.","Thank you.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks Saul.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gretel Janu with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Gretel Janu - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd.","Thanks very much. So just in rest of world you've had reimbursement changes in France, Japan, South Korea over the last 12 months. Just wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on where you are in terms of discussions for the other reimbursements \u2013 like potential reimbursement changes in other rest of world markets, do you anticipate any changes in the next 6 to 12 months?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah, Gretel. It's a great question. And yeah, certainly we saw the digital health changes for doctors in Japan, we saw the digital health changes for home care providers in France and we saw for the first time in the history of the country actual reimbursement for CPAP as a treatment for sleep apnea in South Korea that we talked about last quarter. So, those are all three really good wins.","Our global market access team is incredibly focused on this as we look at the 120 countries we do business in and how to help governments understand that CPAP therapy saves money and improves lives and improves outcomes and quality of lives. And so, we are in all countries \u2013 I think if you just take the example of the French reimbursement changes, our French team have been talking for three to five years with the French Ministry for Health (sic) [Ministry for Solidarity and Health] (00:57:41) to show the return on investment of the digital health initiatives. And so, when that reimbursement change came, it wasn't a surprise to us. It was a lot of hard work to get it to that point and change. But predicting when governments will put good policy behind great opportunities to save money and improve the lives of their constituents is a bet that I'm not willing to put out there or predict which country will be next. But I promise, Gretel, that as soon as we see the changes come that we'll report them here on our quarterly call and let you know how it works. Jim, that team works really closely with your global sleep team, any further color on that?","James Hollingshead - ResMed, Inc.","We talked a little bit about this at Investors Day. I think that the global market access team continues to work on multiple fronts to get payors and government entities to see the positive return on finding and treating the sleep apnea patient. But as Mick said earlier, the digital health platform creates value for care providers with or without reimbursement, right. So, we're seeing the growth of the business and the growth of treatment of patients with the digital care platforms of Air Solutions and the AirSense 10 and AirCurve 10 devices because it creates value for the care provider. We're continuing to chase reimbursement wherever we can because we think we have a very strong story to tell about health economics, but the digital care platforms create a lot of value in their own right.","Gretel Janu - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd.","Thanks for your time.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Thanks for your questions, Gretel.","Operator","Our last question comes from David Bailey with Macquarie. Your line is open.","David Bailey - Macquarie Securities (Australia) Ltd.","Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the Mobi, just wondering if there's anything you can point to in relation to differentiation relative to other products in the market. Can't \u2013 I haven't really been able to see much by way of product specifications. But just wondering if there's anything you can talk to in relation to either weight, battery life, et cetera that would set you apart from the other offerings in the POC space?","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah, that's a great question David and a really exciting space. Rob, do you want to go into some of the details of how we're going to show value in those specs, but also the go-to-market?","Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.","Sure. Yes, David we haven't really made a lot of publicity to you all around the specs of Mobi, because I actually don't think that's sort of the right way of looking at it. The issue here on these POC devices is really getting the right balance of features that make it the most usable product. So, we've got a really good battery life. We've got a great weight and a really good oxygen output that lets people be mobile and to use a device with confidence.","If you just pick one parameter and say it's stronger in this and stronger in that, it's actually not really getting the point of how we think competition should be operating in this market. So, we've got a great product configuration with a really good optimal trade-off. We think it's the optimal trade-off of the specs. And as we said before, we're really pursuing go-to-market strategy with the support and a way for us to support our HME partners really in countries around the world. And so, I know it's still a watch this space program, but we're really taking a disciplined approach to launching the product.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah, David the only thing I'd add on there is I think partnering with your channel particularly one \u2013 we had two decades, three decades of working with our channel in the sleep space to partner with them in the respiratory care space we think is the right strategy.","We don't think some of our competitors are competing with the channel in this space and I just don't think it's a smart strategy. I think you want to partner with a channel and really drive value to that end user patient. The ultimate customer here is the patient. We have to find the best way to get them and our channel has such great ability to reach sleep apnea patients and COPD patients in the past. They've often been the ones to provide liquid oxygen. They should be the ones to provide portable oxygen. And so I think the go-to-market strategy will differentiate us more than others. But David, watch this space, we'll talk to you in 90, in 180, in 360 days about how the Mobi rollout goes and I think we'll start to see that really pick up.","David Bailey - Macquarie Securities (Australia) Ltd.","That's great. Thanks.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for your questions, David.","Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.","And so we've now reached the hour mark.

Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements.","I'd like to now turn the call over to Mick.","Michael Farrell","Thanks Amy and thank you to all our shareholders for joining us today as we review results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2019. On today's call, I will review top level financial results, some business highlights, our ResMed 2025 strategy, and a few key milestones from the quarter. Then I'll hand the call over to Brett, who will walk you through our financial results in further detail.","First, the top level financial results. We achieved another quarter of strong revenue growth, up 9% constant currency or up 10% on a non-GAAP basis globally. Even as we observed the expected impact on European and Asian device sales as our customers completed the cloud connected device upgrade programs in France and Japan.","We delivered strong operating leverage and we achieved non-GAAP operating profit growth of 15% year-over-year. We continue to maintain fiscal discipline and invest to grow the business for the long-term.","Let me provide a few highlights across our global sleep apnea and global respiratory care businesses. It has been nearly four and a half years since we launched the AirSense 10 device platform and the Air Solutions cloud-based software platform.","As we've discussed before, we are upgrading the capability of our software systems, including myAir and AirView with new features every two to four weeks. Based on this customer value, we continue to grow our device market share in the quarter as healthcare providers and physicians and patients are choosing ResMed due to the fact that these digital health solutions improved both business and patient outcomes.","We are leading the industry with digital health technology, supporting well over 9 million patients within AirView, our cloud-based patient management system, and more than 8 million 100% cloud connectable devices now in the market.","Over the past 12 months, we have improved the lives of well over 40 million people by delivering sleep apnea and COPD treatment products. We are pioneering the path forward as we utilize digital health technology to turn big data into actionable insights for patients, for physicians, for homecare providers, for payers, and beyond. We now have over 3.5 billion nights of sleep apnea and COPD treatment data in the cloud and that growth continues to be exponential.","Using advanced analytics, we are focusing on developing solutions to get optimal healthcare to the right patient when it is needed. Everything we do supports our ambition to help the more than 936 million people worldwide who suffocate every night with sleep apnea and then nearly 400 million people worldwide who suffer from chronic lung disease.","As we expand our digital health platforms, one of our goals has been to take the success we have had with myAir and AirView within our sleep apnea vertical and replicate that within our respiratory care business.","We have made good progress with cloud connectable AirCurve devices for non-invasive ventilation and Astral devices with cloud connectable options for life support ventilation. We needed to add digital health solutions for inhaled pharmaceutical for COPD that are utilized in the earlier stages of COPD disease progression in the medical devices and that also constitute more of the treatment cost than the medical devices.","To this exact point, during the quarter, we announced the acquisition of Propeller Health and the deal was closed just a few weeks ago. Propeller's digital health solutions helps people and their doctors better manage COPD and asthma.","Propeller has a sophisticated digital health platform that leverages small sensors that are attached to the pharmaceutical inhalers along with the cloud-based software system and cloud-based mobile app that automatically tracks medication use and provides personalized feedback as well as insights to the individual.","Propeller has critically validated solutions that have demonstrated a 58% improvement in medication adherence, a 48% increase in symptom-free days, and a 53% reduction in emergency room visits to the hospital. These are astounding data and we cannot wait to scale these relations with our new pharmaceutical partners.","Propeller's ability to support people in Stage II and Stage III COPD are very complementary to our existing suite of cloud connectable ventilators for those patients with Stage III and Stage IV COPD. The combination is powerful. We are now even better positioned to become the global leader in digital health for COPD and help people as they manage this important progressive and expensive chronic disease.","Propeller has been an incredibly successful company to-date and we continue to operate as a standalone entity. We have retained the extremely dedicated management team and we expect their momentum with pharmaceutical company customers to continue.","ResMed brings long-term financial stability and has proven itself as a company that can operate digital health systems at scale and across a global portfolio of countries. Propeller and ResMed, we are going to be powerful partners together. This partnership completes an important piece of the puzzle for the ResMed 2025 strategy, providing a clear roadmap for global leadership in digital health for COPD.","Switching back now to talk about our core operations. On the devices side of our business, we achieved 7% growth in The United States, Canada, and Latin America. Including the impact of the completion of digital health upgrade systems in France and Japan, our global growth in devices was 3% on a constant currency basis.","While we have been thrilled with the digital health reimbursement changes in France and Japan during 2018 and they will have great long-term benefits of increased adherence in mask sales in those geographies, we expect that the impact in France and Japan will be present for the next few quarters.","We will then return to market growth in devices within France and Japan and above market growth within those geographies after that. Outside of these two countries, our device growth was strong during the quarter and we expect that to continue as we move forward.","Last quarter, we discussed that Mobi, our new portable oxygen concentrator would move to a full product launch sometime in our third quarter and we made that official launch just earlier this month.","We are working in full partnership with our home medical equipment customers to help grow this category and we are excited to bring the product to market that optimizes the balances of key features such as size, weight, and oxygen output.","We believe that this product best meets the needs of oxygen users who want to be more mobile and enjoy healthy active lives outside their homes. Customers will vote with their wallets and we expect that not only this POC category will grow, but also ResMed will grow its share within the POC category. Although it will take a quite a while for this business category to be material next to our core sleep apnea in ventilation device businesses.","The masks and accessory side of our business grew at 10% in constant currency on a global basis during the quarter. The U.S. Canada and Latin America geographies grew at 11% in masks and accessories.","We are continuing to see great traction with two of our flagship products in this category, the AirFit F20 in the full-face category and the AirFit N20 in the nasal category. We are seeing strong growth across all geographies for these two masks.","Last quarter, we also launched the AirFit F30, an exciting innovation and what we are calling the minimal contact full-face mask category. Initial customer feedback on the F30 is incredibly positive and we have a lot of runway ahead for this product.","Earlier just this week, we announced the broad availability of our newest mask, the AirFit N30i. This is an important addition to our portfolio in what we are calling that tube-up design nasal mask category.","With the N30i, we have further expanded our mask portfolio to offer even more options to homecare providers and ultimately for the varying needs of individual therapy uses. We remain focused on driving innovation to meet underserved and unmet customer needs. The F20 and F30 as well as the N20 and N30i form a powerful portfolio to address these customer needs.","Let's turn now to a discussion of our Software-as-a-Service business. We announced and closed the $750 million acquisition of MatrixCare during the quarter. MatrixCare is an incredibly fast growing and profitable business that brings ResMed into a number of new verticals within the out-of-hospital healthcare software space, including skilled nursing facilities, senior living facilities, life plan communities, and beyond. We also completed a technology tuck-in acquisition called Apacheta, which will help drive increased growth in our core Brightree software business.","The Software-as-a-Service portfolio continues its trajectory of excellent growth with revenue up 63% year-on-year, driven by continued expansion of Brightree and the full quarter contribution from HEALTHCAREfirst along with partial quarter contributions from MatrixCare and Apacheta.","We have a vision to transform out-of-hospital healthcare and these acquisitions have established ResMed as a strategic player in the best position to do so. We have a proven track record of transforming our market through SaaS-based software and solutions and we have demonstrated success and experience with Brightree these last three years.","We now offer software solutions across an even broader portfolio of out-of-hospital healthcare settings from home medical equipment to home health to hospice to skilled nursing facilities to senior living to private duty and beyond.","We are helping our customers in each of these care settings to be the most efficient that they can be to ultimately better serve people and keep them out of hospital and in a low cost, higher quality care setting, often in their own home.","Together with our customers and partners, we are revolutionizing how our healthcare is delivered and received, leveraging an ecosystem of integrated digital solutions and services. The ultimate goal is to help the person seamlessly move between care settings that they can have optimal care and optimal quality of life wherever they're living.","In parallel to help individuals, we will drive superior outcomes for their physicians, payers, and their providers. We have built a portfolio, now it's up to our team to integrate our technology and business workflows, and ultimately, to execute and deliver on this promise.","Now, I'd like to spend a little time talking about our global business excellence programs. We have a dedicated team of over 6,500 ResMedians that delivered another quarter of double-digit net operating profit. This is now the sixth quarter in a row of driving operating leverage.","A key benefit of this operating leverage is that it provides us the flexibility to invest money back into our innovation teams so that they can help us drive sustainable long-term revenue growth.","Non-GAAP income from operations improved 15% in the quarter combining revenue growth and expanded gross margin with disciplined investments in SG&A as well as in R&D. We are taking a controlled and thoughtful approach to manage the business for the long-term. We continue to invest in our business to deliver strong organic growth.","Before I turn the call over to Brett, I'd like to discuss briefly the ResMed 2025 strategy. As we look at the macroeconomic environment in healthcare, the burden of chronic disease is increasing. We have an aging population; nearly 9% of the world's population is age 65 or older. And by 2050, that number will almost double to 17%. So, that will be 1.6 billion people over age 65 around the world. We all know healthcare costs are growing and there aren't enough doctors to treat the people who need to be treated today.","Couple of these data with issues such as the pain points of getting the right care to the right patient at the right time, delivering care in lower cost settings, and challenges with interoperability, documentation, and data availability.","It's a global health care crisis. But on the microeconomic side and within our sphere of influence, which is in digital health for sleep apnea, digital health for COPD, and out-of-hospital healthcare software, we believe these are problems that ResMed can help solve.","At the highest level, the mission of our ResMed 2025 strategy is to impact and improve 250 million lives in out-of-hospital healthcare. Our purpose is to empower people to live healthier, happier, and high-quality lives in the comfort of their own home.","Our advantage comes from our focus on tech-driven integrated care from sleep apnea and COPD awareness, to diagnosis, to treatment and then ongoing therapy and healthcare management with digital health solutions.","Our joint venture with Verily is an example of partnering to drive identification, engagement, and enrollment of sleep apnea patients early in their journey. We will help more and more of the 936 million people worldwide who suffocate with sleep apnea each night to find a better pathway to therapy, leveraging partners, and partnerships such as this.","Let me close with this. We have delivered another solid quarter and we are well-positioned for continued success throughout 2019 and beyond. The continued traction of our diversified and growing mask and device portfolio along with an expanded and expanding pipeline of new products and enhanced digital health solutions to sleep apnea, COPD, and the out-of-hospital medical software markets give us confidence in ongoing momentum for our business.","We're applying ResMed's growth and innovation in the key chronic diseases of sleep apnea and COPD, as well as innovation in software for out-of-hospital healthcare. We have positioned the company for the long-term, driving top and bottom-line growth into 2025 and beyond. By enabling better care, we are improving quality of life, reducing the impact of chronic disease, and lowering the costs for consumers and healthcare systems around the world.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brett for his remarks and then we'll open up the line for Q&A session. Brett, over to you.","Brett Sandercock","Great. Thanks Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2019. As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the December quarter was $651.1 million, an increase of 8% over the prior quarter or in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 9%.","Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Software-as-a-Service business, our sales in U.S., Canada, and Latin American countries were $358.5 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter.","Sales in Europe, Asia, and other markets totaled $229.4 million, a decrease of 2% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, sales in combined Europe, Asia, and other markets increased by 1% over the prior quarter.","Breaking out revenue between product segments; U.S., Canada, and Latin America device sales were $186.5 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $172 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter.","For revenue in Europe, Asia, and other markets, device sales were $156.2 million, a decrease of 4% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, a 2% decrease. Masks and other sales were $73.2 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, an increase of 8%. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 3%, while masks and other sales increased by 10% over the prior year quarter.","Software-as-a-Service segment revenue for the second quarter was $63.3 million, an increase of 63% over the prior quarter. This includes revenue from our Brightree, HEALTHCAREfirst and MatrixCare businesses. Note that MatrixCare acquisition closed on November 13, 2018. So, we had recognized MatrixCare revenue and expenses in Q2 FY 2019 from this date.","During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles, acquisition-related expenses, a purchase accounting fair value adjustment to MatrixCare preferred revenue, and tax-related expenses associated with U.S. tax reforms.","In the prior year comparable, this excludes amortization acquired intangibles and tax-related expenses associated with U.S. tax reform. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release.","Our gross margin for December quarter was 68.9%. Excluding the MatrixCare purchase accounting deferred revenue fair value adjustment, our gross margin for the December quarter was 59.1% compared with 58.2% in the prior year quarter and 58.3% in Q1 FY 2019.","Compared to the prior year, our adjusted gross margin increased by 90 basis points, predominantly attributable to manufacturing efficiencies, favorable product mix, and the MatrixCare acquisition, partially offset by declines in average selling prices. Excluding the deferred revenue fair value adjustment, the MatrixCare acquisition was accretive to our gross margin by approximately 30 basis points.","Assuming current exchange rates and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margin for second half of fiscal year 2019 to be broadly consistent with our Q2 FY 2019 gross margin.","Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $161.6 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 8%.","Excluding acquisitions, SG&A expenses increased by 4% on a constant currency basis. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 24.8% compared to the 25.2% that we reported in the prior year quarter.","Looking forward, subject to currency movements and taking into account our recent acquisitions, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be broadly in the range of 25% for the second half of fiscal year 2019.","R&D expenses for the quarter were $43.1 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 9%. Excluding acquisitions, R&D expenses decreased by 1%, reflecting lower clinical trial expenses in the current quarter relative to the prior year period. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.6% compared with 6.8% in the prior year quarter.","Looking forward, subject to currency movement and taking into account our recent acquisitions, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for the second half of fiscal year 2019.","Amortization of acquired intangibles was $16.8 million for the quarter, an increase of 40% over the prior year quarter, reflecting the impact from our recent acquisitions. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $12.5 million.","Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $181.1 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter, while non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $144.5 million consistent with prior year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1 consistent with the prior year quarter; while GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.86.","Foreign exchange movements positively impacted second quarter earnings by $0.01 per share, reflecting the favorable impacts from the weaker Australian dollar, which were, however, substantially offset by the weaker euro.","On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the December quarter was 14.5%, while on a non-GAAP basis; our effective tax rate for the quarter was 14.9%. Both our GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rates benefited from our higher than usual tax benefit of $13.1 million associated with employee share-based payments transactions during the quarter.","Excluding this benefit, our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter would have been 22.4%. We continue to estimate that our effective tax rate for the second half of fiscal year 2019 will be in the range of 22% to 24%.","Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $129.5 million, reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $18.4 million. Depreciation and amortization for the December quarter totaled $36 million. And during the quarter, we paid dividends of $52.8 million.","Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share. Given our recent acquisition, we have suspended our share buyback program. Consequently, we did not repurchase any shares in the December quarter.","During the quarter, we completed our acquisition of MatrixCare for consideration of $750 million. The acquisition is accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share with an initial quarterly incremental benefit of approximately $0.01 per share to the second half of FY 2019.","Additionally, on January 7, 2019, we closed on our previously announced acquisition of Propeller Health in consideration of $225 million. We now expect Propeller Health to have a diluted impact on our quarterly non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.02 to $0.03 per quarter for the second half of FY 2019. Associated with these acquisitions, we also incurred acquisition-related expenses of $6.1 million in the December quarter.","Our joint venture with Verily commenced operations during the quarter and we contributed an initial $25 million in cash to the joint venture entity. We recorded equity losses of $3.4 million in our income statement in the December quarter associated with the joint venture. We expect to record approximately $7 million of equity losses each quarter in the second half of FY 2019 associated with the joint venture operations.","Given the recent acquisition activity, I would like to update you on our expected increase in net interest expense. For the second half of FY 2019, we expect to record net interest expense of approximately $14 million per quarter, reflecting our increased debt position as a result of our recent acquisitions.","At December 31, we have $1.2 billion in gross debt and $1.05 billion in net debt. Our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels. At December 31, total assets were $3.9 billion and net equity was $2 billion.","And with that, I will hand the call back to Amy.","Amy Wakeham","Great. Thanks Brett. We will now turn to the Q&A portion of the call. I'd like to remind everyone to limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, please feel free to get back into the queue.","Chris, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Your first question is from David Stanton with CLSA. Your line is open.","David Stanton","Thank you very much and thanks for taking my question. I guess just wanted to talk a little bit more about the acquisition of Propeller Health and just run through the synergies between Propeller and the base business. I know you talked to that to some extent, I wonder if you could then outline and give a little bit more color, please. Thank you.","Michael Farrell","Yes, David, it's a really good question. So, as I said in the prep remarks, Propeller is really that missing puzzle piece. When you think about digital health for COPD, for lung disease, medical devices in total constitute about 15% of the total cost and 85% of the costs is in the pharmaceutical side.","Now, clearly, we're not getting into the manufacturing or distribution of pharmaceuticals, but what Propeller does allow ResMed to do is to participate in the digital health that every time someone clicks and takes a puff on their inhaler, a sensor sends data to the cloud that either chronic or acute medicine has been taken for that COPD patient.","So, this gets us to a digital health portfolio that covers all the way from Stage II lung disease through to Stage IV lung disease. And as we build and we've talked about building a digital health portfolio to -- the true aim here is to improve quality of life, keep patient in the home, especially out of the hospital, you need to be across that whole portfolio.","So, we're just really excited. Propeller Health has relationships with GSK, with Boehringer Ingelheim, and they are working on all the major COPD pharmaceutical companies and forming partnerships with them.","And ResMed brings to the party a number of things. We've have operated digital health at scale across our sleep business and we're going to do that here in respiratory care. We operate in 120 countries worldwide and have digital health in many, many countries worldwide, and we're going to help Propeller with that. And we're really supportive of the management team. They are very linked to ResMed's culture, which is focused on patient, keeping them out of hospital and improving care.","So, as we look forward to Propeller over the coming a year, two or three, you're going to start to see ResMed create digital health solutions for COPD that are going to change and bend the cost curve of hospitals and healthcare systems, and particularly, for the patients themselves. And -- so we're really excited to have this part of the team.","David Stanton","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Steve Wheen with Evans & Partners. Your line is open.","Steve Wheen","Yes, good morning. This is for Brett. Just wanted to talk about the gross margin and trying to break down a bit. Obviously, lots of moving parts here. You gave us the MatrixCare contribution, are we able to try and take out the different components? In particular, I wanted to look at FX in the quarter? And what that might look like going forward given the quite of big ships more recently?","And then previously you have mentioned what sort of manufacturing efficiencies contributing to the gross margin, so any color there would be great.","Brett Sandercock","Sure Steve. I mean FX for the quarter year-on-year was not -- was pretty small, it's probably in the range of 20 basis points. I'm going to call that MatrixCare and the other kind of contributed equally meaningful will be manufacturing efficiencies and also favorable product mix. So, we're starting to see that come through particularly with our performance in masks. So, that's certainly helping.","On the manufacturing pharm efficiencies, procurement, and so on, I think things are improving kind of cycle-times and production efficiencies over time, but I think we're also benefiting now from pretty good volumes coming through and pretty good recoveries on the production side of things, incremental volumes kind of hitting up to Singapore as well and we're getting some scale benefits there. The combination of those factors I think are leading to some good manufacturing efficiencies that have been flowing through over the last few quarters.","Steve Wheen","Okay. And FX then going into future periods, is that likely to be a driver as well?","Brett Sandercock","So, currently where we are in terms of euro, if I look forward and just look at it sequentially, I think we still get a small benefit; it's probably only going to 10 to 20 basis point mark unless you saw obviously waiting from wherever at. The currency wherever they are now, I would estimate probably sort of 10 to 20 basis points tailwind for us sequentially.","Steve Wheen","Okay, got it. And just finally on the -- just wanted some clarification on equity accounted losses. Could you just repeat the future quarter impact, didn't quite catch that? And then where is that coming from? What particular acquisition is driving those debt equity?","Brett Sandercock","Yes. Sure. That's our Verily joint venture. So, we need to take out in terms of debt accounting losses associated with debt equity. For this quarter, it was $3.4 million and I estimate for the next few quarters, I would say, Q3 and Q4, that will be around $7 million per quarter.","Steve Wheen","Okay. And does that turnaround or what's driving that loss?","Brett Sandercock","The JV at the moment is thing about more of a kind of a startup phase if you like. So, it will be kind of expenses that are coming through initially. Obviously, that JV was quite pretty high, I guess, in terms of what it can do; particularly being able to, let's call it, the $936 million patients out there. I think about it is as being able to identify with those, information is engaged with those patients, many of those patients on therapy. So, kind of think about it like that as pretty big opportunities there, but at this stage, the JV is exploring those and obviously, they will pay some money to do that initially. Yes, ultimately, we expect that to turnaround for sure.","Operator","Your next question is from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Your line is open.","Margaret Kaczor","Hey, good afternoon folks. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up a little bit on some of the growth outside of the Americas and specifically, maybe outside of France and Japan. So, if you guys can provide any kind of color underlying demand, any potential competitive changes, any catalysts that maybe we should look out for? And then as you kind of look at that growth outlook going forward, what could drive it above or below the results that you guys reported this past quarter in total? Thanks.","Michael Farrell","Thanks Margaret, that's a good question. So, looking at our rest of the world market growth, I just want to make this point right up front. The patient growth in terms of the growth in both France and Japan and all the other countries we do business in, has been very good during this quarter and we expect be continued in strong growth as we look forward throughout FY 2019 and beyond. So, patient growth is really strong.","We did have well above market growth in the last number of quarters as we had the digital health and connected health upgrades in France and Japan. And as we said last quarter and the quarter before on this call and in Q&A, we expect that that impact to change and then that's present in those numbers.","So we're saying for the next few quarters, France and Japan will be slow for a couple of quarters and then we'll get back to market growth and then ahead of market growth through the fact that we now have an installed base of digital health devices out there that should drive greater adherence and therefore greater use of masks and accessories within France and Japan and beyond.","So, in terms of the other -- during the quarter the growth in other markets outside France and Japan and U.S. and Canada, we saw excellent growth. We are not going to go through individually exactly what we saw in different countries in Western Europe and Asia-Pacific, but we saw really good underlying growth on the device and on the masks side. So, look we are very excited about our global growth in devices as we look forward not just rather fiscal year, but into next fiscal year.","Margaret Kaczor","And any specific commentary as it relates to the growth profiles in the next year, two years, where excluding the tax that can help accelerate the growth or whatever have it go down? Thanks.","Michael Farrell","Yes, we don't see it's going down. I mean look, we know the global growth in this market is in the mid to high-single digits. ResMed has never really excited that. As you saw over the last fiscal year or two, rest of the world market, we're driving digital market; country-by-country we've seen some great growth within those countries.","So, what happened in France and Japan, we hope to happen to the other 120 countries we are working and where we get a chance to upgrade platforms towards a digital health side because it's a real step change for the industry. But no that mid to high single-digit global growth we expect to continue for the future and for ResMed to not just accept that, but to drive ahead of it.","Brett was just explaining the investments in Verily. Well, that's about finding ways to identifying guidance people to bend that growth curve to a higher and higher grade, and we've got multiple investments, Sleep School Labs, Verily, and a number of other partnerships with payers, providers, even governments to drive that forward.","So, Margaret in the global growth is in that mid to high-single-digits, but our goal just within sleep is to drive ahead of that. As we add on digital health and COPD and then you add on the Software-as-service-Side, can ResMed drive well above that market growth, absolutely, we have proven that over the last five years and we'll plan to do that as we go towards our 2025 strategy that I outlined in the prep remarks.","Operator","Your next question is from Lyanne Harrison with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Lyanne Harrison","Hi, thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to understand a little bit about just Software-as-a-Service business and I know you mentioned there was something like 60% growth overall business. Can you sort of shed some color on the underlying Brightree growth? And what are your expectations going forward into subsequent quarters?","Michael Farrell","Yes. Thanks. That's a good question. Yes, clearly, the 63% growth for the quarter included organic and inorganic growth in those businesses. And we are now moving towards the point where Software-as-a-Service has become big enough to become a segment that we're going to talk about going forward. So, I'm happy to talk about it in a little more detail.","So, yes, 63% growth for the quarter, including Brightree along with HEALTHCAREfirst, MatrixCare, and Apacheta. So, very solid growth. Within each of those businesses, they had different organic growth profiles. Without going into very, very low levels of detail, the Brightree core business grew in that sort of mid to high single-digits area and obviously with the Brightree management team.","We had a Board meeting earlier, this week and we are looking throughout the next four, six, eight quarters and they have a very strong path way back to double-digit growth of their business, leveraging the Apacheta technology, but also some really innovative solutions.","They have a new apps for patients that they lines around the conference call with MedTrade and some of these improvements lead to incredible benefit for our home medical equipment customers and therefore allow Brightree to grow not only their share, but their share of accounts within that share. So, I see really a good profile of double-digit growth across our Software-as-a-Service platform on an organic basis as we look forward over the coming fiscal years. ","Operator","Your next question is from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Anthony Petrone","Thanks and good evening and good afternoon everyone. May be just staying on Software-as-a-Service, couple of questions there and then just one on France and Japan. So, on Software-as-a-Service, I guess, is there any way to actually give the kind of contribution on the MatrixCare and Apacheta in the quarter?","But more importantly as we look into 2019, the remainder of the year, obviously that 63% overall versus mid-single-digit for core Brightree is notable. So, can you give maybe a little bit more color on how to layer those two in as we progress through fiscal 2019? And then I have a follow-up.","Michael Farrell","Yes. Sure. Yes, clearly, that 63% number is inorganic and organic. Anthony, we don't give detailed guidance across our home businesses. So, therefore, we are not going to give detailed guidance within that sector.","But as you're thinking sort of across and modeling out that portfolio, it's going to be solid double-digit growth in that Software-as-a-Service entity throughout the coming four quarters. And then as you get to an organic basis and you look at just very solid double-digit and very high margin growth from new additions like MatrixCare, I think you can model out a very strong growth of that whole portfolio.","And our goal is actually not just to have these businesses managed as they are, which are great separate entities growing well organically. But some of the best benefits are going to come from interoperability of people moving from care setting to care setting and that we'll be able to get benefit from customers who have people who are in the skilled nursing facilities then move to home health and hospice and back and forth.","And so we don't expect to just have these entities manage good individual double-digit growth, high-margin growth businesses, but something that ResMed managing now is strategic, the biggest portfolio of out-of-hospital software that we will be able to grow across that portfolio. We've got really strong plans as I outlined towards our 2025 strategy to be the global leader in there.","Operator","Your next question is from Gretel Janu with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Gretel Janu","Thanks very much. So just a question on the R&D spend. I was wondering if you can split out how much of that is for data and improving that cloud connected offering. And if you expect it, like, you have given slightly higher guidance going forward than previously, is that because of the data spend?","Michael Farrell","Brett, do you want to have a first go at that and I can cover up on maybe some of our -- the strategically where we're investing in those funds?","Brett Sandercock","Yes, sure. Yes, so, I mean, we wouldn't flag it across the whole portfolio, Gretel, but we, obviously, we've been in quite a bit in the SaaS area as well and R&D there. And if you look at the guidance where I push that R&D as a percentage of revenue, it's going up a little bit. That really reflects the acquisition and reflects really the percentage of revenue. Typically the SaaS businesses would spend more on R&D as a percentage of revenue. So, I did that to take the guidance to reflect that.","Operator","Your next question is from Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joanne Wuensch","Hi, good afternoon. A couple of questions. When you say that Japan and France is going to continue to be a headwind for the next couple of quarters and then the segment will return to market growth, what's market growth?","Michael Farrell","So, Joanne, market growth is mid to high single-digits, right, for the global sleep apnea business and so we don't split that out country-by-country, but we do sort of talk about the devices side towards the mid-single-digits part and the masks side as towards that high single-digit part.","And that's market growth, if you just wait for these patients to show up at a doctor's clinic or a sleep lab. As you know, Joanne, you've been following us for a number of years; we're investing very heavily in geographies for identification, engagement, and enrollment. Not just through our new partnerships, but through our awareness programs and driving patients in. And so we plan to beat that in every country we're in, but market growth is in that mid to high single-digits if you just wait for the patients to show up.","Operator","Your next question is from John Deakin-Bell with Citigroup. Your line is open.","John Deakin-Bell","Good morning. My question is just on the U.S. mask growth, plus 11% is quite a strong quarter. You didn't talk about the -- on a ReSupply contract that you put in place, which we spoke about last quarter. Can you just give us an update on whether there's been an expansion of that in the last quarter? Or whether it's really just on a mask launches that have given such a strong U.S. mask growth?","Michael Farrell","Yes, look, it really was great growth across U.S., Canada, and Latin America. I'll hand Jim Hollingshead, the President of our Sleep business. Do you want to talk about mask growth in the U.S., Canada, and Latin America?","Jim Hollingshead","John thanks for the question. Mask growth, I think, is driven by a couple of things. One is the new product launches are very strong, doing very well everywhere we launch them. And we're getting great feedback both from our HME and healthcare provider customers globally, and also from patients. So, the new launch is doing very well.","And then ReSupply continued at a very healthy clip. We don't break up those numbers and we don't talk about specific ReSupply contracts, for example, but we're happy both in new product and in ongoing ReSupply.","Operator","Your next question is from Andrew Goodsall with MST Marquee. Your line is open.","Andrew Goodsall","Thanks very much for taking my question. Just, obviously, post-quarter you've launched Mobi. Just trying to understand the go-to-market strategy, you say we earned the pilot that you were looking at warranty and finance options?","Michael Farrell","Yes, Andrew. So, look, we launched Mobi, a full product launch, really excited about the business. Rob, do you want to talk a little about -- Rob, our COO.","Rob Douglas","Yes. So, Andrew, we ran the controlled product launch for a fair bit at the back end of last year. January 8, we announced a full market launch. So, it's early days in terms of the full market launch.","Our go-to-market strategy, as we said, we think the best way to go to market is utilizing the capabilities of our existing partners, the home medical equipment providers in the industry. They're the ones with the close contacts with the patients and access. And we continue to work closely with those players in the market and we think that, as we said, will be an excellent approach.","We're actually not copying anyone else's strategy to market. We do have ideas around the challenges around reimbursement and the challenges around funding these products there. But we probably wouldn't put them out on the call. That will be developed and build through the relationships that we have in the market.","But in summary, we're very happy with the early days and we're happy with the product performance as well.","Operator","Your next question is from Craig Wong-Pan with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Craig Wong-Pan","Hi there. My question is on rest of the world mask. I was wondering, have the new mask that you released last year, so it's not the AirFit N30i, have those masks released last year been launched in all your rest of the world market or is there still markets to release those mask in?","Michael Farrell","Yes, thanks for the question, Craig. And yes, every geography is different in the speed and rate at which the product is approved and released passed on to distributors, presented to patients, doctors, and the whole ecosystem.","And so in the U.S., it tends to be a little faster. So, we literally just launched a product, I think you're talking about the N30i. That press release went out this week. So, we just launched that within the U.S. And so that has had zero traction in the other countries around the world. It's just out. And so we'll start to see that pick up over time in terms of a material impact on ResMed over the coming quarters. But you'd expect to see, in the U.S., some early payers on that.","I think when you said existing mask; maybe you're referring to the N20 and F20 masks that I also talked about in my prep remarks. Yes, they are available globally and have had traction. And they led to -- contributed to that 10% global growth within the masks category that we saw on a constant currency basis. It was 11% within U.S., Canada, and Latin America. It was also a very strong 8% within the other markets, but you don't have every country in the world at full speed on the N20, the F20, and the F30 as yet. They launched and they're driving up in those markets, but it's progressing at scale as they get introduced to distributors, to doctors and to the market.","So, look, the way I'd summarize it there, Craig, is that there's a long runway ahead for our growth in markets outside the U.S., Canada, and Latin America and also along growth within those geographies for different reasons and a different, sort of, flap speeds.","Operator","Your next question is from Chris Cooper with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Chris Cooper","Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. So, can I just come back to Brightree, please? So, if I understood you correctly, last quarter you'd launched a set of new modules and functionality and you had expected Brightree to pick up in the second quarter.","But if anything, it does sound like you've kind of slowed sequentially down to, sort of, this mid to high-single-digit level that you talked about. So, not really clear from your comments today what's been developed proprietary on an organic basis in the way that you talked last quarter. Can you just help us understand that?","Michael Farrell","Yes, Chris. And so what we expected last quarter -- so you show modules, so I think during the last quarter we were at MedTrade and so we were showing models to people. They get experience with them. They've got to be adopted by the respiratory therapist. They've got to be adopted by the doctors. If it's on the GoScript side, they've got to be adopted by patients for this new app that we have for patients. And so it's not an immediate effect. And so if you introduce a product this quarter, you don't get an immediate bump next quarter. This is a monthly recurring revenue, quarterly recurring revenue business. So, it's -- once you have a customer, it's very easy to keep them. Once you have a new product, you've got to take time to get customers to adopt it. And so there's an adoption cycle there.","So, what I said earlier in the prep remarks and in previous questions is that, I think, to get from that, sort of, single-digits back to strong double-digit growth within Core Brightree business is something that the team has a plan. And they're going to execute to it and I have a strong confidence in it. I'm not saying March 31st is the day that'll happen, but December 31st, absolutely, we'll start to see those products be adopted and put through there.","So, it's sort of the speed at which these things get adopted in Software-as-a-Service isn't a 90-day cycle. It's more a 180 or 365-day cycle. And then you increase the users, the number of users and you increase the cost per user, and the revenue comes along with that.","But it all comes with the value of those products. And the reason it's a long sales cycle is you've got to get the solution in there. You've got to prove the value to customers and then they have to increase the number of users and grow their share. So, it's maybe a longer cycle than if you thought we were talking about a 90-day turn for a new product. It's more on the 180, 360-day term.","Operator","Your next question is from Suraj Kalia with Northland Securities. Your line is open.","Suraj Kalia","Good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Mick, quickly, let me ask a very high-level question. The math indicates over the last three years -- three-plus years, you'll have spent close to $2 billion. And that is approximately give or take $250 million in topline numbers that have been added on. I know some haven't been disclosed, but that's essentially what the rough math has indicated.","I guess, my question is the impact on growth -- the impact on gross margins, we can decipher that. How do you look on your acquisition strategy? When does the law of diminishing return set in? And what metrics are you using internally to say, you know what we have packed on enough, I think, so we need to digest it. If you could give us a sense of that that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking my question.","Michael Farrell","Yes, thanks for the questions, Suraj. Yes, clearly, we've invested, including Brightree and MatrixCare line, $1.5 billion of investment into our Software-as-a-Service vertical and we're actually really excited about that.","The acquisition is driven by three things. Number one is our strategy to be the world leader in digital health in sleep apnea and in digital health for COPD and in out-of-hospital software, and to be the best at all those.","As I said actually at JPMorgan earlier this month and have continued to talk about, as we launch our 2025 strategy, I think we've assembled a very strong portfolio of out-of-hospital software assets. And so we do plan to drive more integration, leverage, and interoperability to provide great value to customers in that out-of-hospital space to grow that business. So, we're really excited about the growth of that business.","What you didn't mention is the Propeller investment, which actually isn't in that software side, but it's in the digital health of COPD side. If you're the CEO of hospital or you are the Health Minister looking at your top five diseases, COPD is number one, two or three in the chronic diseases you need to address. And so I think that is a strategic investment that Propeller is not providing immediate revenue right there, working on their revenue models with the pharmaceutical companies and establishing what those are in terms of driving adherence to those medications. But the outcome that could happen to global healthcare systems and the savings we could have is absolutely dramatic.","And so we don't just look at it on a financial basis to say, okay, we invested $1.5 billion, that's enough. We'll get the return on that. We say, have we built the world's best digital health solution for sleep apnea? Yes. Let's keep driving that and keep growing that. Can we build the world's best digital health solution for COPD with Propeller in our core ventilation cloud connected assets? Yes. So, Richie and his team is going to execute on that.","And can we, in the Software-as-a-Service side, be able to have the world's -- at least for now, the U.S. is best system, software system for out-of-hospital software care? Yes. And so we're driving growth on that. We are going to get a strong financial return from those. And I think you've seen that over the last three years. With Brightree, we've done well, and we've got a position to grow that Core growth back. We're going to even add on to that with MatrixCare and with Propeller and with Apacheta.","Operator","Your next question is from David Low with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.","David Low","Thanks very much. Just, look, my question is really along the same lines, but could you talk a little bit about what Apacheta is? And then sort of a bigger picture perspective, do you have plans to -- for further acquisitions or are you really in a digestion stage now? Thanks.","Michael Farrell","So, I'll hand to Rob to talk about the functionality of Apacheta within -- and how it drives Core Brightree growth. And then, Brett, you can maybe answer the other part of David's question.","Rob Douglas","Well, so, just a bit of background. Apacheta has been a long-time partner of Brightree and they had been working closely together. And they had a really good solution, really supporting the logistics of the HME customers and how they manage deliveries and getting our people into the right environment in the home, and just that part of the HME business has a real support. And so that becomes a very good module of Brightree.","And we felt that having Brightree being able to control the development agenda in that business, the R&D agenda in it and integrating it better with the other Brightree modules, we could incrementally add value to the whole Brightree offering. So, that's an exciting add-on module, if you like, for Brightree. Brett, in terms of scope and the size of it?","Brett Sandercock","Yes, I mean, it's a kind of a classic within the SaaS business on that stage. So, it's pretty deminimus at the moment, but I think the real attraction for us is the capability enhancement for the Brightree offerings and really being able to run that kind of capability, let's call it module, through Brightree's potential customer base and existing customer base.","So, I think from those classic assets, it's worth much more in our hands rather than standalone. So, we think, yes, a really good type of technology capability acquisition for us. But in terms of revenue profit, it'd be pretty deminimus at the moment.","Operator","Our last question comes from Sean Laaman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Sean Laaman","Good morning and thank you for taking my question. With the new U.S. bid rates in place, I don't know, Mick, if you can give us a bit of color around pricing in the market and where you think ultimately Fed rates will go with the new rules in place? Thanks.","Michael Farrell","Yes, thanks for the question Sean. And yes, the new U.S. bid rates in there and they actually had a Consumer Price Index increase, the couple of percentage points for our customers, which is really good relief for our U.S. customers after a number of years of different interactions with CMS.","Look, the pricing environment is incredibly steady. It's in a very steady and stable environment. We are working with our large, small, regional, and mom-and-pop customers. Having solutions like Brightree and working with our customers on scalable solutions to contact their patients, to deliver to their patients, and to manage their businesses, I think we've been able to, as an industry, take a lot of cost out of the delivery of sleep apnea and COPD therapy within U.S. geography.","And therefore, we've been able to have a much steadier pricing environment this last year or two than the year or two maybe before that. And as we look forward, we expect that to continue or even get slightly better with, for the first time, in a decade, really, price increases for consumer price index within the CMS space.","Operator","We are now at the one-hour mark, so I'll turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.","Michael Farrell","Great. Well, thanks, Chris and thanks to our global team, 6,500 ResMedians, who sometimes listen to this call as well as our investors. You guys have been helping people with digital health solutions for sleep apnea, COPD, and out-of-hospital healthcare that has just changed the market and we look forward to continuing to do that. We'll talk with you again in 90 days and I'll hand back to Amy.","Amy Wakeham","Sounds good. Thanks Mick. Thank you again, everyone, for joining us today.

My name is Larissa, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Senior Director of Investor Relations at ResMed. Agnes, you may begin.","Agnes Lee","Thank you, Larissa, and thank you for attending ResMed's live earnings webcast. Joining me on the call today is Mick Farrell, our Chief Executive Officer; and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call.","If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release, it can be found on our website at investor.resmed.com. We have also posted an updated investor deck, which may be found on the Events and Presentation section of the company's Investor Relations website.","I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company, corporate strategy, and performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors which could also cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in filings made by ResMed with the SEC.","I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell.","Michael J. Farrell","Thanks, Agnes, and thank you to everyone who is joining us today as we provide an overview of our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2014 results. I'll review the market dynamics, provide an update on product launches and review progress against our Three Horizons growth strategy. Then I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Brett, to walk you through our financial results in greater detail.","To briefly review the highlights, Q4 revenue was flat on a year-on-year basis and declined 1% excluding currency impacts. Non-GAAP earnings per share grew 3% for the quarter to $0.64. Non-GAAP EPS, excluding amortization of intangibles, was $0.66.","Our revenue was lower than anticipated during Q4, primarily due to headwinds in our U.S. sales. This was offset by very strong growth in Europe, particularly, as well as in Asia.","Before I discuss our Americas results in more detail, I'd like to emphasize that we believe that our performance in the U.S. will improve over the coming fiscal year, and there are 3 reasons for this.","One, the U.S. market structure is stabilizing as we anniversary the second round of competitive bidding with patient referral volume starting to grow. Two, the pricing adjustments that we put in place during Q3 will begin and continue to wash through the comparisons. And three, the change in buying behavior that we saw from some U.S. customers in Q4 to move away from end-of-quarter bulk deals to a more consistent ordering pattern should continue.","This latter point is good for us in the medium to long term as it steadies the supply chain for our customers, our suppliers and for our global operations team. However, it clearly had a negative short-term impact that we saw in Q4 in the U.S. numbers.","In terms of the factors that we control, our ResMed team will continue to execute on our strategy of launching new products, services and solutions that provide exceptional value for our customers. I remain confident in the more than 4,000-strong ResMed team, our global growth and our ability to execute to our long-term strategy.","Okay. Let me drill down into our U.S. sales in 2 categories: first, our flow generator category; and second, our masks and accessories category. We have seen continued stabilization in the underlying market trends with patient referrals and growth in volumes and referrals to diagnostic channels in our flow generator category. However, flow generator and the accompanying mask revenues softened at the end of Q4.","There were 2 key reasons for this: one, the change in buying behavior that we noted previously in some large U.S. customers; and two, industry rumors circulated during the quarter regarding a predicted launch of a new ResMed sleep flow generator on July 1. There was actually a particular date that was part of the rumor.","Since we are past that date, it was clearly a false rumor. In fact, we're 30 days past it. But nevertheless, it caused some customers to hold off on ordering from ResMed during the fourth quarter. Consistent with our past approach to this topic, we have not given a timeline and we do not intend to discuss the details of our plans for our next-generation sleep flow generator platforms. And we are ready -- and when we are ready for full commercial launch, we will issue a press release. And before that, we will talk to our sales team so that they can talk to customers, whether they be physicians, providers or technicians.","Looking at the masks and accessories category. Sales were lower in the quarter compared to Q4 2013 due to 3 factors: one, variations in customer-buying behavior, as we just talked about; and two, the continued year-over-year impact of new pricing structures that we introduced during Q3, as we also just talked about; and three, the transition to our new generation of masks, the AirFit series.","So as we regain market share and ramp-up on the AirFit series, that is part of the complication. Specifically, we have seen good adoption of our AirFit P10 product in the pillows category since its launch in January. Additionally, we just launched the AirFit N10 and the AirFit F10, respectively, in the nasal and full-face categories during the fourth quarter. So our results for Q4 only include partial quarter sales for those products.","We expect that the F10 and the N10 will ramp-up swiftly over the next few quarters, and they have had a very solid start. Physician, HME customer and patient feedback has been excellent on the whole AirFit series: the P10, the N10 and the F10. It's important to note in this mask category that we have a relatively high comparable growth hurdle from Q4 fiscal '13, which was tough to overcome, especially with the brand-new ramp-up of the F10 and the N10.","As you may remember from our call last October, we promised to launch 3 new mask systems during the back half of fiscal '14, and we have delivered on that promise. With the global launch now of the AirFit family of masks, ResMed continues to lead in product innovation, particularly in this mask category. We have quieter, lighter, less-obtrusive and easier-to-fit masks than ever before. We expect the mask product categories to perform very well in fiscal '15.","On the diagnostics front, we continue to see an increase in home sleep testing, and we expect that trend to continue as sleep labs expand their diagnostic options. North of 60% of sleep labs now offer home sleep testing in addition to polysomnography, and approximately 40% of U.S. diagnoses in the last 12 months were through home sleep testing as insurers and insurance company colleagues continue to drive that trend.","Finally, on the Americas. We are seeing strong traction of our healthcare informatics offerings. EasyCare Online continues to expand its reach, and U-Sleep is rapidly increasing its penetration of accounts.","U-Sleep's core value proposition is to increase patient adherence while also lowering HME labor costs by up to 60%. In a fast [ph] competitive bidding world, this type of cost reduction and efficiency improvement is a necessity for our home care provider customers. The ability for U-Sleep to text, email and to use interactive voice response, or IVR, has been well received by patients and helps coach them on their treatment journey. The net result is increased adherence, which is good for everyone in the supply chain and the value chain. The bottom line, the improving market conditions, new product flow and informatics solutions should enable us to significantly improve our Americas sales as we move through fiscal year 2015.","Moving on now to sales outside of the Americas. Our Europe and Asia-Pacific regions were bright spots in the quarter, especially with respiratory care and cardiology sales. Growth in these regions, particularly strong in Europe, partially offset our Americas performance, bringing us to a flat global headline result.","The benefit of having around 50% of our revenue outside the U.S., particularly in tough times like this in the U.S., was well exhibited during fiscal year '14 and especially during Q4. We launched the Astral life support ventilator in Europe and Asia during the quarter. Although it is still very early in the life cycle of the life support ventilator, the Astral has demonstrated very good traction during Q4. Astral is ramping up even faster than we expected, and its value proposition in this platform has been presented to physicians, providers and patients across the regions.","Customer demand is growing very rapidly, and we are ramping up our operational ability to deal with that increased demand. We are excited about the prospects for this platform in FY '15 globally.","Our gross margins came in at the high end of our expectations in the fourth quarter. We continue to manage the key parts of the P&L that are in our control, including initiatives to lower product costs and COGS and to leverage our global manufacturing and supply chain capabilities.","Now I'd like to spend some time talking about the progress against our Three Horizons growth strategy. We're continuing to innovate in our First Horizon, which is focused on our core sleep-disorder breathing business.","During the fourth quarter, we completed a detailed review and then made changes within our commercial and R&D teams to do 2 things: one, to better align those resources and teams with our strategy; and two, to further increase the efficiency of our overall business and SG&A. Brett will go into further details regarding the restructuring charge we took during Q4 as part of those changes.","Additionally in our First Horizon, we have been taking actions to enforce our intellectual property throughout the fiscal year. During the fourth quarter specifically, we incurred significant SG&A legal costs as 2 of those cases went to trial. Those efforts also produced some early wins on the legal front. We don't like to be in court. We prefer to be in the design labs and talking to customers, but we like it even less when we believe our competitors are copying our inventions and infringing our intellectual property.","When we are in court, we like to have some battle victories, even if they're a smaller part of a larger campaign. These last few weeks have seen 2 victories for ResMed over a small Taipei-based competitor. The first win was in the U.S. in the International Trade Commission, where the ITC ruled that, despite a redesign of its iCH CPAP device, the Taiwanese device manufacturer continued to infringe ResMed's humidification patents. Also in Germany, we won a permanent injunction against the same manufacturer, prohibiting sales of infringing headgear used on 2 of its mask systems. The judgment was entered by the Regional District Court in Munich, is appealable and covers the entire jurisdiction of Germany.","In today's more dynamic and competitive market, we're committed to innovating and providing solutions to our customers while improving patient outcomes and reducing costs for global healthcare systems. We invest 7% to 8% of our revenue back into R&D, and we're choosing to defend that innovation in court to ensure that we can continue to have the ability to innovate and, ultimately, make life better for millions and millions of untreated sleep apnea patients.","We're also making progress against our Second Horizon of growth, which includes both the respiratory care market and new geographic market expansion opportunities. With the full product launch of our new Life Support Ventilator, Astral, in both Europe and Asia, we executed against that plan during Q4. Also during the fourth quarter, we received FDA clearance for the Astral for the U.S. market, and we are expecting to execute that launch before the end of this calendar year.","On the geographic expansion side, we continue to make progress in our emerging markets, and we had strong growth this quarter in these geographies, particularly in the countries of Brazil, India and China. We intend to remain focused on geographic expansion to drive growth within these countries and also other important emerging markets.","Our Third Horizon of growth focuses on cardiorespiratory and other new market opportunities. SERVE-HF, our 1,325-patient clinical trial in heart failure has now been fully enrolled for 15 months. Our partners in SERVE are focused on event-driven data collection in the clinical trial size. We currently expect the first publication from this study during calendar year 2016. As this is a completely blinded trial, we will not know the results until the first part of the study is released late calendar year 2015. We will continue to provide updates as significant milestones are reached.","During the quarter, I visited Professor Martin Cowie, who is the Cardiologist, Principal Investigator of SERVE-HF based in London at the Brompton.","In summary, the clinical trial appears to be running very smoothly from a logistics perspective, which is a very good sign at this stage of a large clinical trial.","Also from Europe on the clinical front, there has been some recent encouraging data on the use of noninvasive ventilation and its impacts on mortality for COPD patients. In this study recently published in Lancet, Dr. Thomas K\u00f6hnlein and colleagues found that the long-term use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation for patients with hypercapnic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease showed a substantial improvement in both survival and quality of life.","With the use of effective noninvasive ventilation, 1-year mortality was 12%. This compares to 33% in the control group, leading to a relative mortality reduction of 76%. This is quite an astounding result from the largest study of its kind. This augurs well for future growth of our respiratory care business.","During the quarter and for the full year, we have continued to generate strong cash flow, and we maintain our commitment to return that cash to shareholders. We have just declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 a share, which represents a 12% increase from the previously declared quarterly dividend of $0.25. This is the second consecutive increase since we began paying a dividend in September 2012.","In addition, we ended the year having repurchased 4.4 million shares at a cost of approximately $208 million for the year. We plan to continue with a strong capital management campaign for fiscal year 2015.","At a broader level for fiscal year 2015, we are expecting to see top line constant currency revenue growth improvements as we continue to drive innovation with the launch of the new products in both our core sleep and our new and emerging respiratory care markets. The sleep disorder breathing markets remain underpenetrated with continued growth in patient volumes. Clearly, short-term market conditions in the U.S. are tough right now, and we will continue to carefully manage our expenses in that geography while appropriately funding our long-term growth initiatives globally.","In the U.S. market, we are seeing the annualization of CB2, which is the biggest round of competitive bidding, and this augurs well for ongoing channel stability and patient volume growth in the U.S. In the Europe and Asian regions, patient volume growth has been strong in Q4, and we expect it to remain so throughout fiscal year 2015.","Here at ResMed, we lead the industry with innovative product offerings, and we see ample opportunity to drive revenue growth through solid execution of those new product launches. The solutions will bring value to our customers in FY '15. We will reduce costs for broken healthcare systems that badly need our help and also improve the lives and the quality of life for millions and millions of undiagnosed patients of sleep-disordered breathing, COPD and cardiorespiratory disease.","We have exciting plans for fiscal year 2015 with new products, services and solutions. In fact, I would say that we have the most-exciting product pipeline that I have seen in the last 14 years here at ResMed and probably in our 25 years of existence. Our team can't wait to bring that value to customers globally.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brett.","Brett A. Sandercock","Great. Thanks, Mick. As Mick has noted, revenue for the June quarter was $415.2 million, consistent with the prior year quarter. In constant-currency terms, revenue decreased by 1%.","At a more detailed level, overall sales in the Americas were $214.9 million, a decrease of 7% over the prior year quarter. Sales outside the Americas totaled $200.3 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. In constant-currency terms, sales outside the Americas increased by 5% over the prior year quarter.","Breaking out revenue between product segments. Americas flow generator sales were $99.3 million, a decrease of 5% over the prior year quarter, reflecting continued pricing pressures in a tough prior year comparable. Masks and other sales were $115.6 million, a decrease of 8% over the prior year quarter, reflecting very competitive environment. We expect an improvement in our mask trajectory in fiscal year 2015, as our recently launched masks continue to gain traction in the market.","For revenue outside the Americas, flow generator sales were $136 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter or in constant-currency terms, an increase of 6%. Masks and other sales were $64.3 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter, and in constant-currency terms, an increase of 4%.","Globally, in constant-currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 1%, while masks and other decreased by 4%.","Before I move to the P&L commentary, I would like to take a moment to walk you through the charges that were excluded in our non-GAAP earnings per share. We have excluded the impacts of the restructuring charge this quarter and the onetime Sydney University charge in the prior year quarter. As a result, non-GAAP income from operations for the quarter was $104.8 million, a decrease of 6% over the prior year quarter. And non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $92 million, an increase of 1% over the prior year quarter.","Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.64, an increase of 3% over the prior year quarter. Our non-GAAP earnings per share, excluding amortization of acquired intangibles, was $0.66 for the quarter.","Now on a GAAP basis, net income for the quarter was $87.7 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.61. Gross margin for the June quarter was 62.9%, down sequentially from Q3 FY '14.","On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin benefited from favorable foreign currency movements, a favorable geographic mix, and manufacturing and supply chain improvements, partially offset by ASP declines. For fiscal year 2015, we expect our gross margin to be in the range of 61% to 63%, assuming current exchange rates. We continue to focus on initiatives targeted at improving our global manufacturing, supply chain and logistics cost structures.","Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $122.2 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter. In constant-currency terms, SG&A expenses also increased by 6%, primarily due to higher legal expenses associated with patent litigation. Excluding these legal expenses, SG&A expenses increased by approximately 3% year-over-year. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 29.4% compared to the year-ago figure of 27.8%.","Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 28% to 29% for fiscal year 2015. R&D expenses for the quarter were $31.8 million, an increase of 1% over the prior year quarter or 3% in constant-currency terms. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7.7% compared to the year-ago figure of 7.6%.","Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to continue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for fiscal year 2015. This reflects our ongoing commitment to investing in our diverse product pipeline, informatics solutions and clinical trials consistent with our strategy.","During the quarter, we incurred a restructure charge of $6.3 million, resulting from the reorganization of our commercial and research and development teams, primarily in our Sydney and San Diego locations. The restructure charge included severance payments made to employees. This is a discrete charge, and we've expensed the full amount of $6.3 million in our fourth quarter results.","Amortization of acquired intangibles was $2.4 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $10.8 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.7%. The lower tax rate this quarter reflects the tax benefit from the restructure charge and the ongoing benefit of lower effective tax rate associated with our Singapore manufacturing operations.","Excluding the impact of the restructure charge, our full year effective tax rate was 20.1%, and we currently estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2015 will be in the vicinity of 21%.","Cash flow from operations was $115.6 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $18.5 million, while depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $19.8 million.","Our share repurchases continue to play a major role in our capital management program. During the quarter, we repurchased 800,000 shares, a consideration of $40.4 million, and we ended fiscal year 2014 having repurchased 4.4 million shares for a total consideration of $208 million. This represented approximately 3.1% of total shares outstanding.","At the end of June, we had approximately 18.3 million shares remaining under our authorized share repurchase program. In addition to our share repurchases, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share. This represents a 12% increase over our previously declared dividend and demonstrates our commitment to delivering shareholder returns through our capital management program. Indeed, as of fiscal year 2014, we returned 110% of our free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We expect to continue to maintain an active share repurchase program in fiscal year 2015.","Our balance sheet remains very strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $605 million. At June 30, total assets stood at $2.4 billion and net equity was $1.8 billion.","And with that, I'll hand the call back to Agnes.","Agnes Lee","Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Larissa, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Andrew Goodsall from UBS.","Andrew Goodsall - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I'm going to assume that you won't [indiscernible] grab the new product. So perhaps, I can just ask the extent to which you think the deferrals impact -- impacted in the quarter in anticipation of that product. And if I can just throw a tricky one in just quickly ask just also the impact of FX on gross margin or masks on -- just what influenced the gross margin increase as well.","Michael J. Farrell","Thanks for the question, Andrew. I'll take the first part of the question and, Brett, you'll take the second. Very hard to understand exactly the extent to which the circulating rumors impacted our flow generator sales in the Americas. It was really just in the U.S. and just from a couple of competitors. But it was reasonably broad spread. It wasn't just 1 territory or 2 territories. I know some executives were traveling in the field during the quarter who told me they heard it from every customer, and so it was pretty broad. Understanding the depth of that impact and how it specifically hits our numbers in terms of flow generator growth in Q4 is very hard to say. The good news is that our news from the field is that patient volumes as the channel has stabilized now with the annualization of CB2, that the patient volumes are there. And so, therefore, a missed sale in Q4 should lead to, throughout fiscal '15, as the inventories were quiet and patients continue to come through the channel that we start to get those back. It won't be immediate, but Andrew, I'm sorry, it's just very hard to quantify exactly what the impact of it would be, but it was there. It was probably, slightly material in some aspects in terms of the U.S. sales. Brett, you want to take the second half of the question?","Brett A. Sandercock","Yes, sure. Andrew, yes, on FX on gross margin, year-on-year, it was in the order of 150 basis points favorable for us. If you looked at it more on a sequential basis, it was a benefit of around 30 basis points for us. And then currencies where they are just on a -- if you look at Q1 like going forward, it would probably have a -- we'll have a headwind of around, probably, 30 to 40 basis points going into Q1. Yes.","Andrew Goodsall - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And to what extent do you think your AirFit 10 mask sales picked that margin up as well?","Brett A. Sandercock","It's just -- it'd be pretty small, really, Andrew. I mean, they only just came through in the quarter. So really, at the early stages of traction in those new masks. So I think that'll manifest more through FY '15.","Operator","The next question is from Ben Andrew from William Blair.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So let's talk about masks in the U.S. And you guys have high market share, obviously, you're a juicy target even with the great new products coming through. This is not a great mask number. What happened there? I mean, because obviously, you're still selling the older mask through the bulk of the quarter, and then the new one is starting to roll out, but what are you seeing competitively there? You mentioned bulk versus kind of regular way, but maybe just give us a little bit more flavor on U.S. masks.","Michael J. Farrell","Yes, Ben. So, I mean, there are 3 factors that affected U.S. masks. One, is the variations in customer-buying behavior, right? Moving from a bulk order to a throughout the year type of steady behavior, which is tough short-term better in the long term. Two, there's the impact of the Q3 pricing reductions that we put in place, so they'll need to roll through the comparisons over a 12-month period of time in terms of the pricing impact. And three, there's the impact of the transition to our new masks. We've just launched the N10 in the nasal space and the F10 in the full-face space, literally during the quarter, so you only got a half-quarter of sales or so from those 2 products in the category. So they're the 3 major effects. You mentioned the fourth effect, which is there in terms of the competitive dynamic. And there are some reasonable masks from our competitors. They're not as good as ours, but we do compete out there, and it's a tough market at times, but we think that with the product portfolio that we've just launched, this AirFit series that over FY '15, we have very strong possibilities for not only maintaining but growing share and rising with the market there.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I guess I'll stick to one follow-up and just ask directly, did pricing get worse in the fourth quarter versus third quarter? Or was it the same? And do you think you gained or lost share in masks in the fourth quarter in the U.S.?","Michael J. Farrell","Well, that was technically 2 follow-up questions, Ben. But I think that the price changes that we put into place in Q3 were reasonably effective and, probably, just went broader to more customers during Q4 so relatively stable on the price side from Q3 to Q4. Obviously, on a year-on-year basis, there was a significant price relief for our customers that, of course, we don't quantify now on these calls. To your question about market share, it's very hard by each category to get the details of market share in categories. What I can say is that it's early in the ramp curve of the N10 and F10, so my conjecture would be that the N10 and F10 have a lot more runway to get market share over FY '15. And that if there's any market share gain in Q4, it would have been in the pillows category. If there were any stresses, it would have been in the nasal and full-face category. But that's sort of just based on the timing of those product launches and where they are. And thanks for the 3 questions, Ben.","Operator","Our next question is from David Low from Deutsche Bank.","David Low - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Mick, could I just start with the [indiscernible], just get you to perhaps talk to us about change. Then, I guess, the question that comes out of that is if you've seen a hit in Q4, presumably, we start to see a benefit, particularly in the first quarter when things are typically a little weaker.","Michael J. Farrell","David, you were a little light at the start of that question. Could you repeat the whole question? I couldn't quite hear you.","David Low - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Let me try again. So the change in buying patterns that you talked about with major customers, I just want to understand what changed, and then, therefore, what the impact's going to be in the future. Most notably, it seems to me that Q4 is the strong quarter when there is a lot of deals done towards the end of the period. So presumably, we see some benefit from this changed pattern, particularly in Q1. Is that reasonable?","Michael J. Farrell","So good question, David, so more granularity on the changing buyer behavior. So what we're referring to is that, sometimes, during the quarters, whether it's Q1, Q2 or Q3, but particularly in Q4, there are larger bulk purchases by, usually, larger customers towards the end of the quarter. And we saw those throughout fiscal year '14, Q1, 2 and 3 but not in Q4. And I mean, the difference between missing or hitting on the U.S. sales could be 3 or 4 deals to sort of make up that difference. And if you think about 4 deals of in that sort of $3 million to $5 million range, you can start to see those types of numbers adding up. The question of why those deals didn't happen in Q4 and why the customers are choosing probably to have a lower inventory stake or a more-efficient operation, I think the answer is that they've all faced the reality now of 12 months of -- in particularly in the U.S. market, 12 months of competitive bidding round 2 impact. And everybody in the space is looking for efficiency, for supply chain efficiency, for ordering efficiency and for making sure that their -- that operations are delivered to patients, but they don't have excess inventory. So I think it was part of that, and it came to a head in Q4. I don't think the wash-through is a 90-day wash-through. I think the wash-through on an inventory supply chain, when you start to look at it as more a 365-day timeframe. It's total conjecture because I don't know the details of the operations of the 5,000 customers in the U.S. or even the top 50 to that great level of detail. But my conversations with top customers in the U.S. are that they're looking for operational efficiency. They're looking to take costs out. For instance, that's why U-Sleep has been so popular not only in Q4 but throughout the whole year because people say if I can increase adherence by 10 percentage points and take labor costs out by 60%, that's the technology I need. So I'll start using then: EDI technologies, just-in-time delivery, dropships to patients. All these types of things are being used by our customers. So there -- that's sort of the summary of that 50,000 feet of changes in buying behavior. And I just don't have the granularity on a 10-, 45-, 90-day scale, but my best guess is that it's a 365-day sort of adjustment that you'd have if you're running a large business on that front.","David Low - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just one follow-up then. Brett, the legal cost looks to me like sort of close to $4 million based on the comments you made about growth in SG&A. What should we expect going forward? Are we going to see further legal costs of that magnitude in Q1, Q2? Or is it going to come down?","Brett A. Sandercock","I mean, to some extent, it depends on timing of court cases, trials and so on. I mean, there'll be -- you can expect there'll be some continuation of litigation costs through FY '15. I mean, the main thing is we're committed to protecting our patents in the marketplace and our innovation. So we'll continue to do that. And if that means we spend some money on litigation from time to time, then we'll certainly do that. There'll be some come through. It was -- this quarter, we did have a court case, which was kind of happening in that quarter, so it probably popped it a little bit. You could expect some base litigation, I think, will continue for next few quarters.","Operator","Our next question is from Saul Hadassin from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Saul Hadassin - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a quick question on U-Sleep if I could. There's been some discussion more recently about the compatibility of some of the other manufactured devices across that platform. Can you just clarify, Mick, whether all manufactured products are still compatible with the U-Sleep product?","Michael J. Farrell","Yes. So I think the question is whether U-Sleep is compatible with all manufacturers' products, and the answer is yes. The technology is perfectly capable of taking data from all manufacturers who are able to get data to the cloud that can interface with an API that can be accepted by our product, which is all the major manufacturers' capabilities. So U-Sleep is perfectly technically capable.","Saul Hadassin - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. Just a follow-up. So you published that study quite recently, the abstract about the labor cost base. Can you talk to how effective that's been in terms of driving some higher U-Sleep subscriptions?","Michael J. Farrell","Yes. Look, without going -- because we don't go into detail of individual customers, but what I can tell you is that, that presentation at the American Thoracic Society from the main stage and then some posters and some follow-up with customers created some great buzz amongst key opinion leader physicians because they see that the world of telemedicine is coming. Digitized data is here to stay, and that efficiency is needed for our global healthcare system. So the key opinion leaders are on board. Specifically, as we talk to customers, particularly in the U.S. with all the price pressures they've had, particularly from CMS, they're really looking, as I said earlier, for efficiency tools. And the data in that study were 59% reduction in total labor costs. And if you're running your P&L and you look at what that reduction on that line is, even if you halve it, say, that was a clinical study, in practice, I'm only going to get half of that. It's a huge potential cost savings for customers. So what we've seen is a lot of customers asking about it. Our territory managers and our corporate account managers are talking to customers about it every day, and we're seeing good uptake from those customers who are doing pilots and trials. Obviously, it's sort of an S curve of penetration for anything, whether it's a mask, a software product or a new platform. But a software platform, when it goes, it can go pretty fast because it's very scalable and it's digital, and that's how it's designed. We're very excited. It's early days, but we're very excited about U-Sleep and the value it can bring to our channel, particularly the providers but also the patients. Patients just love being coached and engaged on their therapy. And moving adherence from 73% to 83%, as was shown in that study, may not sound like much, 10 percentage points, but for 7 out of 10 to 8 out of 10, that's a big needle move when you look at what pharmaceutical compliance rates are in the 50s and 60s at best with all the coaching materials they had. The difference is that we have electromechanical device that we can send data to the cloud, and we can coach that patient on what actually happened not whether we think they took the pill or opened the cap. So we're pretty excited about U-Sleep and its penetration, and we can give updates as we go through FY '15.","Operator","The next question is from Eric Fong from Bank of America.","Eric Fong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Mick, can I ask for an update on the Japanese market? And as my follow-up, can I confirm whether you are assuming the same level of market discounting in FY '14 as was in FY -- sorry, FY '15 as was in FY '14 in respect of your gross margin guidance?","Michael J. Farrell","Sure. Rob, do you want to take the question on Japan, maybe both the questions. Rob?","Robert Douglas","Sure. The -- in Japan, as we've constantly said, Japan does stay a lumpy market given the business structure of our few customers there. This quarter, we had a pretty good run at it, and the business goes there. And Japan remains a very, very good market for us with good patient reimbursement and a good opportunity because we think we can still get a lot more patients in that market. In particular, our cardiology products continue to do very well there. Sorry, Eric, your second question on pricing, could you repeat what you said?","Eric Fong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It was on gross margin guidance. So are you assuming the same level of market discounting in FY '15 as was in FY '14, the guidance of 61% to 63%?","Brett A. Sandercock","Yes. Maybe I can take that, Eric. On the gross margin, yes, I mean, we're guiding 61% to 63%. If you look at the price and if you look at it year-on-year, certainly, with the pricing or some of the adjustments we've made in Q3 that'll wash through Q4, and you're seeing that year-on-year impact, that year-on-year impact that will still be with us through, if you like, the first half Q1, Q2. So we'll still see those year-on-year price declines if you like. And then -- but when you look at the second half and a lot of that would sort of anniversary in terms of some of those adjustments. So now we're not going to make any predictions on where pricing might head that far into the future. But think of it at that first half, we got a wash-through. Second half might be kind of more normal with the caveat that, that's going to be unpredictable, really.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Wheen from JPMorgan.","Steven David Wheen - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just wanted to get you to clarify that restructuring charge of $6.3 million, where that fits and whether or not there's any likelihood of ongoing restructuring charges going into fiscal '15.","Michael J. Farrell","Brett?","Brett A. Sandercock","Yes. Steven, by where that fits, what do you mean","[indiscernible] ?","Steven David Wheen - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So what sort of -- just where -- what line item would we be looking up if we were trying to normalize that.","Brett A. Sandercock","Yes, so it would be -- it's a combination around SG&A and R&D, probably a little more skewed on the SG&A side for that if you're thinking about that. And at the moment, I mean, it's important for us to keep looking at making sure we're doing things as efficiently as we can. It's important for us to make sure our resource allocation is really focused on achieving strategic objectives. So we'll do that. But at this -- right at the moment, we've not -- there's no plans on the table for further restructuring. But we need -- yes, we need to continue to make sure we're operating the business as efficiently as we can.","Steven David Wheen - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, okay. And just back to that comment on Japan, Rob, if -- there was some issue with one particular distributor that had sort of slowed down quite significantly. Have you got any update on the way they're seeing that market and whether or not they're sort of back to sort of full run rate?","Robert Douglas","Yes. Look, Steve, we don't really want to break out customer by customer data, and Japan's interesting because there's only a few of them as we said. But pretty well, I'd stick with what I was saying, that the underlying business remains pretty strong. We had talked to some issues around -- similar with other markets around inventory policies and stuff like that, but we think that the business will go forward on a pretty steady basis. And the patient flow's really solid there, so that creates the underlying demand for the products.","Operator","Our next question is from Alex Smith from Citigroup.","Alexander Evans Smith - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","You mentioned in the U.S., the patient volumes are there. Can you give us an estimate of what you think's going on at the market level in terms of market growth rates in terms of volume?","Michael J. Farrell","Thanks, Alex. I'll hand that question to Jim.","James Hollingshead","Yes. Alex, we think that patient growth rates are about in line with where they've been. We haven't seen a big dropoff in patient diagnostics in any way. We don't actually name the percentage growth rate on this call anymore. We stopped doing that a couple of quarters ago, but we haven't seen any measurable decline in patient volumes in the U.S.","Alexander Evans Smith - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And I guess as a follow-up, so really, the dynamics you're seeing are around price and share. You're not really seeing a huge change to underlying demand.","Michael J. Farrell","Yes, it's the flow-through of the Q3 price changes. It's the changing in the buying behaviors of customers from more bulk to more steady and some of the channel changes that have happened throughout competitive bidding round 2 that have impacted, all together, those 3 factors have impacted the U.S. growth results there in Q4.","Operator","Our next question is from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets.","Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Two questions really. One is you talk about revenue next year being greater than this year. Could you ballpark what greater means? And then my second question is CMS has introduced a pilot program for bundling products. Could you please comment on that?","Michael J. Farrell","Sure. Thanks, Joanne. I'll take the first part, and then Dave Pendarvis can take the second part regarding CMS. Yes, Joanne, we don't give guidance with regard to revenue. We are going to improve. Globally, we're going to improve in the Americas for FY '15 because the macro conditions are going to get better. CB2 is done, which is the largest round of competitive bidding. We're going to wash through the pricing changes from Q3. We're going to work with customers to take waste out, including moving from more bulk to more day-to-day sales as best we can, and we're going to manage that volatility. So with all of that, we know the needle is going to normalize, and we're going to move the needle in the right direction. Dave, you want to take the second part of the question, which is with regard to the CMS pilots that they're looking at?","David Pendarvis","Sure, Mick. Yes, thanks, Joanne. The -- it's a little hard to tell at the moment. What we've got is a proposed rule from CMS, which hasn't become a final rule. And the proposed rule itself is proposing pilots in about, I think, it's 16 markets as part of competitive bidding 3. Of course, the timing of the third round of competitive bidding is itself part of a proposed rule. It's not final yet, but assuming all these things go through, it would be sometime in 2016 that they would start piloting in some of the CB3 regions of some form of bundling. We don't know what form that'll take. And depending upon how it goes, we'll, obviously, react to it and help our customers operate with that kind of a model. So it's long ways off, remains to be seen how the final rules come out and then how the pilots come out. But we're familiar with bundling as it operates in different markets throughout the world. So we're confident that we'll be able to work with our customers and work through it as it gets rolled out and look forward to the pilots.","Operator","The next question is from David Clair from Piper Jaffray.","David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","So the first one I just want to see, is there any way to quantify the change in buying behavior on the U.S. flow gen and mask results? And then if I'm hearing you right, you think that this will take a year to normalize?","Michael J. Farrell","Yes. So David, difficult to quantify the exact one, and you're going to need a handful of customers to talk about changing a $3 million to $5 million end of quarter buying to others to have an impact. So we don't -- my answer to the question of how long it will take to wash through that changing in buying behavior, I don't know if it will be a rapid deployment of their sort of efficiency approaches and they can get it done in a 90-, 180-day period, or if it'll be a little bit beyond that. The 365 is the absolute outlier, right, because then it's annualized. It has to be less than that. The answer is we just don't know. It's -- how long is a piece of string on that? So you're asking me to quantify something that I -- it's dependent upon the psychology of the customer, and it's very hard to go. What we're doing with our U.S. customers is partnering with them across the board. Solutions like U-Sleep that we talked about to bring efficiency, products like Astral. When we launched this life support ventilator, which is the first life support ventilator we've ever launched in the U.S. market, during this calendar year, we're going to be bringing to them choice. The first time they've had choice in life support ventilation, and they're screaming for it. And we can't wait to bring that for them. And so we think that will bring some faster orders and maybe some upfront stocking orders as they need to stock, to train their staff and get them up to speed on a great life support ventilator. So there's so many factors, including the new masks and how quickly they roll up and what inventory's needed on those, but understanding the exact inventory policies of even the top 10, 50, 100 customers, let alone, the 5,000 in the U.S., is very difficult. So that's why, David, getting a specific quantification of the days of inventory rolled through on average across the customer base is just very difficult. I was sort of giving you the guardrails between 90 and 360. The answer is I don't know exactly where it'll be within that.","David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then just as a follow-up here, the reorganization, so what exactly did this entail? Why are you doing it now? And will there be any kind of disruption?","Michael J. Farrell","Yes. Jim, you want to take that?","James Hollingshead","Yes. Well, I can speak to the Americas reorganization. Really, the way to think about what we did in the Americas was to align with the strategy. And so without getting into great detail, we made some changes and some additions to the sales force in preparation for the launch of Astral. And then we made some changes to align across some business aisles [ph]. So we've done some things to better align the marketing organization and also to create better alignment between sales and marketing. So it was, obviously, a lot of, if you will, effectiveness moves and alignment with strategy there. In doing that, we also took the opportunity to look for efficiencies.","Michael J. Farrell","Don Darkin, do you -- Don, do you want to talk a little bit to some of R&D restructuring that we did and how that positions us for the future?","Donald Darkin","Yes, so we basically just shifted a few people around to really try and reshape the organization for some of the approaches we're moving into going forward. So apart from some minor reductions in some areas, we've -- we're reshaping and creating some new areas for targeting going forward.","Michael J. Farrell","So I mean, look, David, in net, we're talking less than 1% to 2% or around 1% to 2% of our global workforce here, not a huge amount. But it was important for us to refocus our team towards the strategy and to where we need to be in 2015 and towards our Three Horizons growth strategy. And so it was really around aligning our SG&A and aligning our R&D around those long-term strategies and making sure the long-term bets are all accounted for, and some short-term efficiencies can be gained where we no longer need to expand assets and resources.","Operator","Our next question is from Bruce Du from CBA.","Bruce Du - Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Research Division","I just had a question around pricing. I guess it's more specifically to masks. You mentioned that you haven't really seen sort of a change from Q3 to Q4, but you're offering the sort of broader -- discounts more broadly. What are you seeing with regard to the pricing behavior of your competitors in 4Q? Have they changed much at all from Q3 to Q4? And do you anticipate yourselves potentially having to move again? Or has it been relatively stable?","Michael J. Farrell","Yes. Look, I think some of the competitive moves were more in Q1 and Q2 from our major competitors in the U.S. market associated around competitive bidding round 2. And our moves in Q3 were a response to maintain our appropriate premium over our competitors in that space, and so it was steady. Predicting what's going to happen in FY '15, I will predict there will be some price competition, but what I predict is when we launch our Astral product, which is the second of its kind, right, it'll be 1 of only 2 players in that market that price will not be the issue. It'll be about efficiency, long-term cost of ownership, the value and efficiency for the customer and the value to the patient of that life support ventilator. In our new masks, where you're able to get first-time fit and easier to fit and easy to use, those values become very important when you're looking at the full P&L of managing your HME business. So price is there, will always be there. Our job and job of our R&D teams, the job of our marketing teams is to produce and then position and then provide through the sales team that value to customers so that they can get the efficiency. And we're going to do that throughout FY '15.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ian Abbott from Goldman Sachs.","Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I had a question around your -- on the balance sheet. The days sales outstanding seems to have gone up again, and I was perhaps a little bit surprised to see that go up given you've talked about some -- in absence of sort of end-of-quarter sales. So I just wonder if you can reconcile that for me.","Michael J. Farrell","Brett?","Brett A. Sandercock","Yes. Ian, that's, I mean, in particular in the U.S., there's some longer payment terms, I think, that are out in the market nowadays, really, on competitive response from us. And you'll see -- and obviously, that sort of doesn't manifest straight away but will build up over time. So you're seeing a little bit of that coming through in the days sales outstanding but not really -- it's kind of not really a factor or relation to some of the ordering cycles. It's really something that was put in place a while ago that then starts to manifest in days sales outstanding.","Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And as a follow-up, could I ask around some of the higher-end products? I'm not sure if you mentioned on the call whether the shift just from CPAP to APAP is still ongoing and also some of the high-end products in the bilevel segment, just how they've performed during the quarter and what the outlook for those is.","Michael J. Farrell","Yes. So we alluded to it a little in the prepared remarks. Ian, you're the first question on it. But the home sleep testing is now at 40% when you look at a trailing 12-month period of all U.S. diagnoses, 60% being polysomnography. It's being driven by the insurers and specialty benefits managers and others associated with insurance companies driving that switch, and the channel is responding. When home sleep testing increases, it does almost directly impact the shift that is continuing between CPAP to APAP. And so we're continuing to see the APAP category increasing, and that did continue during the quarter. We didn't see any big major changes in Q4 for bilevel, pretty steady as a sort of -- as a percentage of total sales through there. The impact on all of them was the changing in buying behavior, the pricing and all the macro effects impact across all those segments. But within the individual CPAP versus APAP categories, we are seeing a positive mix shift from CPAP to APAP continuing, bilevels being steady. And as we launch the Astral life support ventilator, we will open up a brand-new category for us at the really highest end of the spectrum in terms of value and margin and value all the way through to the COPD patient, the neuromuscular disease patient that it might treat.","Operator","Our next question is from Anthony Petrone from Jefferies.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just a little bit, Mick, on the DME ordering patterns. Is there any, maybe, clarity you can give around all those long-term supply agreements where they've committed to purchase commitments? Or are they just in a position now where they're ordering based on their needs? And then one quick follow-up.","Michael J. Farrell","All right. I'll hand that to Jim regarding U.S. DME purchasing patterns.","James Hollingshead","Yes. I'd -- thanks, Anthony, for the question. This is going to sound like a bit of a clich\u00e9, but every customer is different. And so what we're seeing is a wide range of behaviors. We've got customers who are getting more aggressive about managing their own inventory balances. We have a wide range of different types of agreements. And so it's actually very difficult to characterize in the context and the way you framed it. But I think we can say that we did see, at the end of the quarter, a change in behavior with some of our customers in -- being more reluctant to do larger deals. And I do think that, that is hand-in-hand with some of the anticipation that's out in the market based on the rumor that was spread by one of our competitors that we were launching a product platform imminently. So those 2 things were connected. But it's very, very difficult to say because of the variety of behavior across the customer base.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up for Mick. Is -- previously you spoke on consolidation within the U.S. of DMEs, and that number was sort of in -- close to 8,000 and coming down a bit. You characterized that number lower. So I'm just wondering are we mostly kind of complete with consolidation in your view. Or is there still a little bit more to go?","Michael J. Farrell","Yes. Anthony, it's a good question, and it's hard to know the exact answer to it. I mean, we sold to more than 5,000 customers during Q4 just in the U.S. As Rob was talking to earlier, I can count on my right hand, less -- half of it the number of Japanese customers. And so yes, it's north of 5,000. Will there be more consolidation? I will expect some further mergers and acquisitions activity within the DME channel. I think quite a lot of it was pre-CB2 and during CB2. I think now it's almost the survival of the fittest. Those who have got through this year and have still got their cash flow and still got operating businesses and good relationships with referring doctors and good relationships with the patients who are members of their sort of portfolio, that they have the opportunity continue to do that. We're going to partner with all our customers: the small, the mom and pop, the medium regionals, the large regionals and the nationals. And we are helping all of them with efficiency. A lot of the tools we provide, such as U-Sleep, can apply to a customer across that spectrum. So we don't have to be a large customer to use it. Some of the others have sort of electronic data interchange and interfacing with their billing capability. We can do with -- through partnerships with some of the small guys and directly with some of the larger ones. So whatever the opportunity to bring value to all those segments of customers, we're looking at doing it. But to answer your question directly, do we expect further consolidation? Yes. Do we think it'll be dramatic? Probably not. Probably an ongoing quarter-by-quarter consolidation of them without a major step-change.","Operator","We are now at the 1-hour mark. I'll turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.","Michael J. Farrell","Well, great. In closing, I'd like to thank the more than 4,000 ResMed employees, who sometimes listen to this call, around the world, for their contribution to the world-leading respiratory medical inventions that position us for the future. And we're going to continue to execute against our Three Horizons growth, and we're very excited about the product pipeline that you guys have developed and we get to launch during fiscal year '15. Our global team continues to be more than ever focused on changing the lives of millions of patients with every breath. Agnes?","Agnes Lee","Yes.

Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2012 ResMed, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Chris, and I will be your conference moderator for today. [Operator Instructions]","The company has asked me to address certain matters: First, ResMed does not authorize the recording of any portion of this conference for any purpose. Second, during the conference call, ResMed may make forward-looking statements, such as projections of future revenue earnings, new product development or new markets for the company's products. These statements are made under the Safe Harbor Provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from the forward-looking statements.","These factors are discussed in ResMed's SEC filings, such as forms 10-Q and 10-K, which you may access through the company's website at www.resmed.com.","With that said, I would like to turn the call over to Dr. Peter Farrell, ResMed's Chairman and CEO. Dr. Farrell, please go ahead, sir.","Peter C. Farrell","Thank you, Chris, and thanks, everyone, for joining.","I'll begin as usual with some summary remarks, and then turn the call over to Brett Sandercock for some more granularity on the finances.  And we will then do some Q&A.","First, the financial summary. We finished with another extremely solid quarter and fiscal year. Global revenues in the fourth quarter of 2012 grew 9% to $372 million, up 13% on a constant currency basis.","Revenues in the Americas grew 13% year-over-year to $207 million. And ROW revenues increased by 3% or 13% in constant currency terms to $165 million.  This represents our 70th consecutive quarter in which we've grown the top line since we went public.","I don't believe there are too many companies in that category that can boast a record like that. But we'll get some more granularity on that for those who are interested.","For fiscal 2012, we reported revenues of approximately $1.4 billion, up 10% year-over-year and earnings per share of $1.71, up 19% year-over-year.  We believe that superior product quality continues to drive our growth.","Net income for the quarter increased 31% to $77 million, while GAAP EPS increased a robust 43% to a record $0.53 for this quarter. Excluding amortization of acquired intangibles, EPS was a record $0.54.","With respect to product performance, let me start with masks. All mask categories showed strong growth. And we continue to take market share, particularly with the Mirage nasal mask, which is thus far proving to be a seeming game changer.","Accessories also grew strongly, as both large and small HMEs and DMEs are becoming more systematic about resupply and delivery of replenishment supplies to the patients who need them.","Our global growth in Flow Generators this quarter was primarily driven by the high-end devices. Strong sales reflect the benefits of having all of our PAP devices configured on the smaller, quieter and more appealing S9 platform.","In the Americas the S9 AutoSet and the VPAP Adapt, which is an adaptive servo-ventilator did particularly well.","Growth in the Flow Generator segment was also driven by a positive mix shift from basic CPAP to APAP due to the ongoing growth of home sleep testing, as well as, we believe, physician preference to put patients on the AutoSet, which provides more flexible therapy, improves patient comfort and appears to enhance compliance.","The new EasyCare Online Compliance Management system continues to be well received, and we expect to see some solid ongoing uptake from existing, as well as new accounts.","Products and programs which provide superior therapy and better compliance are what bring the most value to the patients, customers and service providers. In other words, across the whole food chain.","Europe continues to be challenging due to difficult macroeconomic environment, although sales were relatively strong in both Germany and the U.K. Despite this challenging economic climate, bilevel, AutoSets CS, which is also our version of the adaptive servo-ventilator in the rest of the world, and the Stellar products all did well in this quarter.","We also believe that great opportunities exist in Europe to address the connection between sleep-disordered breathing and various  comorbidities, such as heart disease, diabetes and so on, as well as occupational health and the more compelling economic case and the more -- and the more and more compelling economic case for treating sleep apnea in general.","There's also a great deal more focus on compliance, which certainly positions us well with our high-quality products.","The Asia Pacific region also had a solid quarter, particularly in the Japanese market, due to strong sales in sleep, as well as our bilevel and respiratory product portfolio, which also did very well.","Of interest, cardiologists are adopting adaptive servo-ventilation, with some bigger in Japan. In fact, some cardiologists are actually using ASV even in patients without frank sleep-disordered breathing. And as they have noted, an improvement in various chronic heart failure parameters, particularly ejection fraction. Emerging markets like India, China and the Middle East also did very well this quarter.","Ventilation sales of Stellar 100 and 150 continue to grow, especially in Europe, Latin America and Asia and again, more particularly in Japan.","Of note, the Stellar 150 includes iVAPS, which is a new automatic bilevel mode. iVAPS is also included in the new S9-based VPAP ST and the ST-A products. These are launching this quarter.","VPAP ST-A with iVAPS has FDA clearance for respiratory insufficiency. The launch of this product on the S9 platform is significant, as we have actually skipped a generation in this segment in going from the S9 platform, which is a lot more bulky to the much smaller S9 platform.","On the home sleep testing front, commercial payers continue to introduce the requirement of pre-authorization for intended PSG sleep test. United joined the club in July. And as a result, by the end of summer, 2\/3 -- more than 2\/3 of covered lives will need pre-authorization to polysomnography.","We estimate that in -- we estimated that in 2011, about 50% of all sleep tests were HST, and we expect to see at least 25% of all sleep tests being HST-derived by the end of this calendar year. And we continue to see a steady increase in the number of sleep labs involved in HST, which is up to close to 30%.","We're also participating in primary care physician awareness initiatives as HST continues to advance, with PCPs becoming more involved and interested in sleep apnea diagnosis.","A few weeks ago, we acquired an innovative data services technology provider, known as Umbian, headquartered in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Umbian offers a comprehensive patient compliance management solution called U-Sleep, which monitors CPAP devices and provides a suite of interactive follow-up services for health care providers.","For HME providers, usually there's an effective tool to reduce cost and improve business efficiency. U-Sleep supports CPAP devices from the leading CPAP manufacturers so that usage data can be consolidated and viewed from one software platform. This technology is able to assess a patient's compliance using a flexible set of rules that have been set up for that specific individual and provide immediate notification of compliance outcomes via e-mail, phone or if the provider prefers, text messages.","U-Sleep's simple yet powerful design also provides multiple reporting options tied to the varying needs of HME providers.","One of the biggest issues facing HMEs is competitive bidding and concomitant pricing pressures. By providing a scalable solution for compliance outreach, we are taking a significant step in supporting our HME partners to drive efficiencies and cost reduction in their businesses.","Customers use products from a range of manufacturers. And this is one of the strengths of the U-Sleep platform. U-Sleep will continue to transfer compliance data from therapy devices manufactured by other companies.","On the clinical front, the flow of data substantiating the connection between sleep-disordered breathing and chronic diseases continues to materialize.","Just to summarize a few of the newest findings. Sleep disorders are associated with the following: One, a higher risk of dying from cancer with the risk correlated with the severity of the disease; diabetic peripheral neuropathy, a debilitating disease, which causes severe pain in the hands and feet; three, frequent co-morbidity with polycystic ovary syndrome, a hormonal disorder which affects up to 10% of women of childbearing age; four, poor prognosis in chronic heart failure. But with the treatment of the sleep-disordered breathing with nocturnal ventilation the outcomes are significantly improved. Let's see, six, untreated central sleep apnea and heart failure readmission to hospital. This is particularly significant since it turned out that central sleep apnea was by far and away the most significant parameter, which was involved with the readmission of patients with chronic heart failure to the hospital. This suggests a wonderful opportunity for our adaptive servo-ventilator products. And finally, there's double the risk -- if the patient has sleep-disordered breathing, there is double the risk of retinal vein occlusion.","In summary, this suggests that sleep-disordered breathing is involved with a multitude of diseases, and treatment of the disorder really ought to be part of any standard of care, just like one would take blood pressure.","Finally, a study has just been published in Population Health Management on the cost savings associated with an education campaign on the diagnosis and management of sleep-disordered breathing. The primary objective was to determine if medical expenses of members enrolled in the not-for-profit U.S.-based Union Pacific Railroad Employes Health Systems health plan were reduced after implementing a low-cost, patient-focused education program on sleep-disordered breathing.","Based on the retrospective analysis of medical claims data, the campaign was associated with a 145% increase in the uptake of PAP therapy by members with sleep-disordered breathing. And within 2 years after initiating the program, the use of PAP therapy was associated with almost $5 million in differential savings and overall medical costs, lower inpatient hospital costs and fewer hospital admissions than those members with sleep-disordered breathing who did not receive therapy.","These findings suggest that the sleep-disordered breathing education campaign can improve health care outcomes and result in substantial savings through for the health care plan.","All of the peer-reviewed literature continues to make it abundantly clear that untreated sleep-disordered breathing is at best seriously debilitating and costly to the health care system and at worst life threatening. These findings add to the continuing mounting evidence connecting serious health disorders to untreated sleep-disordered breathing and point to the necessity of making the diagnosis and treatment of SDB, as I've just said, a standard of care in all medical practice.","Now I'll turn the call over to Brett to provide more granularity on the financials, and then we'll take your questions. Brett?","Brett A. Sandercock","All right. Thanks, Peter.  Revenue for the June quarter was $371.9 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. Unfavorable currency movements reduced our fourth quarter revenues by approximately $14.6 million. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 13%.","Income from operations for the quarter was $89.7 million, an increase of 35% over the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter was $76.8 million, an increase of 31% over the prior year quarter.","Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.53, an increase of 43% over the prior year quarter.","Gross margins for the June quarter was 60.9%, up sequentially from Q3 FY '12. On a sequential basis, our gross margin continued to benefit from a favorable product mix and manufacturing efficiencies. Looking forward, we expect our gross margin to be in the range of 59% to 61%, assuming current exchange rates.","We continue to execute on initiatives targeted at improving our global manufacturing supply chain and logistics cost structures.","SG&A expenses for the quarter were $105.9 million, an increase of 3% over the prior year quarter. Or in constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 9%.","SG&A expenses, as a percentage of revenue, improved 28.5% compared to the year ago figure of 29.9%.","Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A, as a percentage of revenue, to be in the range of 29% for the fiscal year 2013.","R&D expenses for the quarter were $27.9 million, an increase of 3% over the prior year quarter.","In constant currency terms, R&D expenses increased by 10%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7.5% compared to the year-ago figure of 7.9%.","Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 8% for fiscal year 2013, reflecting the strong Australian dollar and continued investment in our product pipeline.","Amortization of acquired intangibles was $2.9 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $8.1 million.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22% compared to the prior year quarter effective tax rate of 24.3%.","The lower tax rate reflects the benefit of lower effective tax rates in our Singapore and Australian operations. For the full year, our effective tax rate was 23.2%, and we currently estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2013 will be in the vicinity of 22%.","Turning now to revenue in more detail. Overall sales in the Americas were $207.4 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. Sales outside the Americas totaled $164.5 million, an increase of 3% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas increased by 13% over the prior year quarter.","Breaking out revenue between product segments. In the Americas, Flow Generator sales were $90.2 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter, reflecting strong growth in our APAP devices.","Masks and other sales were $117.2 million, an increase of 17% over the prior year quarter, underpinned by strong contributions across our mask product range and continued growth in accessories.","Revenue outside the Americas, Flow Generator sales were $110.8 million, an increase of 2% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, an increase of 12%.","Masks and other sales were $53.7 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, an increase of 15%.","Globally, in constant currency terms, Flow Generator sales increased by 10%, while masks and other increased by 16%. Cash flow from operations was $97 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management.","Capital expenditure for the quarter was $12.1 million. Depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $22.4 million. Cash flow from operations for fiscal year 2012 was a record $383.2 million, an increase of 35% over the prior year.","Our share buyback continues to play a major role in our capital management program. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares for consideration of 89 million. For fiscal year 2012, we repurchased 13.6 million shares for consideration of 391.2 million. The 38.6 million shares purchased in fiscal year 2012 represents approximately 9.3% of our diluted shares outstanding. At the end of June, we had approximately 8.8 million shares remaining under our authorized buyback program.","And in addition to our share buyback, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share, consistent with our previously advised dividend policy.","We ended the fiscal year financially and operationally in excellent shape. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $559 million. And at June 30, total assets stood at $2.1 billion and net equity was $1.6 billion.","I will now hand the call back to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first comes from the line of Dan Hurren with UBS.","Dan Hurren - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I just wanted to -- actually, first question just you mentioned a new product being added to the S9 range. I miss some of the details there. Could you just fly through that?","Peter C. Farrell","Those are Dan -- well the VPAP ST and the VPAP ST-A are bilevel units are now in the S9 platform. So initially, we did the CPAPs. But now we're putting all products, including the adaptive servo-ventilator into the S9 platform. So it's much more appealing, it's smaller, it's quieter and we're pretty excited now that we've got everything. And we're just launching the ST and the ST-A this quarter.","Dan Hurren - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Understood. Look, just one of the other big issue that's obviously been going around, there's been a lot of discussion about competitive bidding, the impact on the company. Some of the discussion around the industry is that ResMed, in fact -- ResMed are looking to partner with some of the HMEs. There might actually be some volume offsets here. Could you sort of give us a bit of a run-through on what you think the competitive bidding impact is?","Peter C. Farrell","Well, let me just make a few comments, and I'll turn it to Mick for some further comment. The competitive bidding, if you look at our business, the impact is total revenues, the exposure is about 10% of the revenues. So I'll call it $140 million. But the interesting thing, as I've said in a previous earnings call, we have no significant impact on ASPs. And bear in mind, this is all and I guess stating the obvious, it's all CMS. And so the private payers have already dealt with this on ASPs. And if you like, they're ahead of CMS. But we don't see it as a significant factor at all. And I think you, in fact, Dan, have actually written about this. So private payers are not impacted. It's only CMS. And we're continuing to support our customers through a variety of resources to enable them to incorporate the latest Medicare requirements. But it's -- we don't -- it's just not -- it seems to spook people out in the marketplace, for some reason, the analysts in particular. But it doesn't spook us. And I don't know whether -- Mick, do you want to add anything to that?","Michael J. Farrell","No, I just confirm 3 points on competitive bidding. Number one, as you noted, it's 20% to 25% of our U.S. business, but that's 10% to 12% of our global business. Number two, in the first 9 cities, we're in a real-time experiment here. We're in month 14 of that, and we haven't seen a material impact on us. In fact, we've maintained or grown share with the customers who were the winners. And that the winners, third point, have scale. They are large companies that we either have electronic data interchange or some ways of finding efficiencies in the system. So that would take cost out of the system of delivering to patients. So they're the 3 points I'll make on that, Dan?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets.","Jacob Messina","It's Jacob Messina in for Joanne. Just quickly wanted to ask a little bit about -- more about Umbian, if you could. The U-Sleep, How it fits with EasyCare, how it fits with the franchise, how it will be marketed, that kind of thing.","Peter C. Farrell","Well, I'm going to flip that question to Don Darkin, who is President of the Strategic Business Unit for Sleep. Because Don is the guy who negotiated the purchase and the earner. So, Don, over to you to make a comment?","Donald Darkin","Thanks. So what we're doing here is pulling in a compliance software package, which actually is sort of adjunct to the EasyCare online solution that we've just launched. So what we're seeing here is that with that program and the program we just launched, it will become a much easier solution for HMEs and providers where we intend to take costs out and allow these guys to focus on their business, while this program will manage the compliance end of the patient.","Jacob Messina","Okay, great. And should we assume that the revenue impact is immaterial and dilution is immaterial as well?","Donald Darkin","At this case -- at this time, yes, absolutely. It's immaterial to us.","Peter C. Farrell","The maximum would be $0.01 a share and it probably won't even get to that. And a year out, it will be accretive.","Jacob Messina","And then maybe just quickly on the med tech tax. If you had any further update on how it will impact you all? And how you might handle it?","Peter C. Farrell","Well, there hasn't been any greater clarification in that space. And as far as we're concerned, we're making the assumption that it may well impact -- we're not sure about this, but it might impact the dental appliance area, the Narval products. But they're almost an immaterial part of our business at this point. So therefore, it doesn't affect current numbers at all. And maybe some of the hospital-based products, Stellar 100, 150 perhaps might accrue, but we're talking, 2.3%. But again, it's not really a material amount. Now if it affects all the products, you can do the math there. That is 2.3%. But there's a lot more water that's going to flow onto the bridge in this space. And we're not, at this point -- we're more concerned about Obamacare, which is a shambles in our view than the tax itself and maybe it won't even be implemented with a bit of luck.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Michael Matson with Mizuho Securities.","Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","So just to clarify what you said on the medical device tax there. So that's not in the guidance for SG&A that was given earlier in the call, correct?","Brett A. Sandercock","Yes. Michael, it's Brett here. Yes, that's correct. I mean, it's still -- as Peter said, it's just too uncertain for us to know what -- which within our portfolio what products are in or out. We certainly think we'll get a clearer view of that when the final regulations come out. I think we expect them sometime in September. But there's even -- I mean, even within the industry and peers and so on, there's even conjecture about where does the medical device tax sit, does it sit in COGS, SG&A, where is it going to sit. So even that's not perfectly clear right now. But I think as we get to September, we'll get the final regulations. I think we'll certainly have some more clarity around that for you.","Peter C. Farrell","But Michael, we are reasonably sure, at least our internal tax guy has checked with a lot of sources. We think it's -- and again, we need clarification, as Brett said, but we think it's -- the impact is going to be fairly minimal for us that is.","Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","And that's -- is that because the products are essentially considered to be sold at retail to patients? Or...","Peter C. Farrell","Yes. We think of it -- it does impact, as I said, the dental end of our business, which of course is not material at this point. We're planning on making it material, of course and also any hospital-based products. That's as far as we're reading the 2 at least. And we're fairly comfortable with that.","Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Okay, all right. So just moving on. I mean, you got the question on competitive bidding, but I guess the other Medicare change is this the resupply policy where the HMEs now have to sort of somehow verify that the equipment is no longer functioning before they can replace it, I guess, for masks and tubing and things like that. So what is your expectation of the impact, if any, that, that will have on your mask and accessories business?","Peter C. Farrell","Well, I think it's a sensible approach by the government. I mean, it's -- if people aren't using it, you shouldn't be sending masks out. So I think that most people are just -- it's going to make them become more systematic and make sure that the patient needs it. But frankly, we think this is really a storm in a teacup. We are seeing less than 2 masks a year being used per device as it stands and the -- and CMS allows 4. So we're not even pushing the side. It's not a boundary condition for us. So I would say it's not something that we're the least bit concerned about. And I think it's tightening up the system and I think it's sensible that this is being done. But, Mick, do you want to make a comment?","Michael J. Farrell","Yes, Michael, it's Mick here. I would just add 2 points that firstly, this is just an opportunity for us to support our customers. It's only 20% of their business, so 25% of their business that's affected just the Medicare component. But it gives us a chance to talk to them about resupply, which has a lot of runway left for growth. And secondly, the customers that we're talking with over these last couple of months since this reasonably nebulous legislation came out is that they've swiftly added into their IVRs or their call center scripts and their documentation, steps that are necessary to show that it's nonfunctional in the replacement process. So that's been the chance. The good business conversations, we think, there's growth left. And our customers are responding swiftly and efficiently. And we think it's probably a good thing for us long-term to start thinking this way.","Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Okay. I guess just one more question and I'll be done. The -- you mentioned that the PCP is taking a bigger role and it's something that seems -- does seem to be happening with home testing. How do you view that? And do you think that's a good thing or bad thing? And since they're served somewhat outside of your call point, I mean, how do you ensure that those patients are ending up with ResMed equipment when you've been calling on the sleep labs to kind of convincing them to write out branded prescriptions. But if it's really dictated by a primary care doctor, then it may leave it more in sort of the hands of the HME as to what type of equipment they end up with?","Peter C. Farrell","Yes. Look, that's a good question. Years ago, we were working with Philips within Respironics in order to educate PCPs about the existence of sleep-disordered breathing. That program has now stopped, all the primary care physicians, not all of them. But most of them, the bulk of them understand sleep-disordered breathing. And what they are left familiar with is the connection with signs and symptoms of the various co-morbidities that they're dealing with. And if you look at this area, and as I said, this should be -- sleep testing should be standard of care, you couldn't produce enough sleep physicians in 100 years to deal with the patients that have sleep-disordered breathing. We think internally, the prevalence of adults is that's at some level of an AHI greater than 5 is close to 30%.  I mean, Susan Redline at Harvard is using a figure of 25%. The Canadians are using a figure of 26%. In short, it is impossible for the sleep infrastructure to handle the numbers of patients. So we, in fact, have to market to the PCPs. The question is how do you do it? And the easiest way to do it is through social media. And so we're working on a number of initiatives in this space. We've worked with the Joslin Clinic at Harvard to try to educate PCPs about the fact that nearly 80% of patients with type 2 diabetes, whose first call point are the internist PCPs family physicians and so forth. So it's kind of a long-term play if you like, Michael.  We're well and truly into it. We're targeting them. And it sort of -- the analogy is with asthma and diabetes without worrying about the SDB and diabetes. If every asthmatic patient had to see a respirologist, or every diabetic patient had to see an endocrinologist, the system would simply freeze. And given the prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing, which is roughly 3x what it is for asthma and diabetes. We absolutely have to educate the PCPs. The good news is we're finding now, with the push towards pre-authorization with HST going to AutoSet. I just mentioned that the end of last year, it was 15% going to 25%. I think it will be, this time, next year, could even be 50%, because United is going to run the program out in November. And you're going to see some -- a really big acceleration of HST to APAP. This is a much easier route for -- you don't have to be a sleep physician to understand HST and the use of AutoSet. So we are very encouraged about the information we've got back thus far. A lot of work, a lot of water that flow into this, a lot of work to do. But we think this is a perfect area to focus on. Again, Mick, do you want to say something?","Michael J. Farrell","The only thing I'd add is that in terms of influencing ResMed brand, I think is where you're also asking, Michael, that we're working with sleep physician key opinion leaders from Harvard and Stanford, but also in regional groups around the country. And we have very strong relationships with the sleep physicians in terms of influencing towards not only the awareness of sleep apnea but that ResMed's products and services are ideally treated to keep the patient adherent, which is the big message. And we're also, in addition to that, doing some e-learning approaches with both the primary care physicians and train the trainer approaches with HME sales forces. So reaching the 250,000 primary care physicians can be done through social media, e-learning and by leveraging key opinion leader sources is what I'd add to what you just heard there.","Peter C. Farrell","And without sort of beating a dead horse here, just to add a little bit of more flavor, with the PCPs, we're seeing -- it's almost a bifurcation. There may be many more phenotypes as we get more information back. But you have the PCPs that are kind of interested in doing the HST, not necessarily in putting the patients on treatment, that would be done by, as you correctly pointed out, by the -- currently, both the DMEs or the HMEs. But they would end up with a $50 or something around that order. And then there are the PCPs that actually don't want to get involved, and they are using the IDTFs. So in other words, if they recognize the patient needs help, they can just sort of say, \"Well, here, listen, why don't you go and we'll give you a list of IDTFs, and you can pick a geographically close one or one with a national footprint.\" But we're seeing roughly that. And there'll be more clarity over the next few months in that area, maybe over the next 6 months.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair.","Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I wanted to touch base on a couple of things, following up on of the earlier question. Peter, I know you're under 2 masks per year on average for patients. Can you talk about the typical experience in terms of when a mask actually wears out, how it does? And is that 2x or 3x a year for a compliant patient? Or is it the 1.6x that you all are getting at this point? And I know that's not necessarily why people are getting the mask today. But do you think there could be a transitional issue as we go through this that needs new requirements? And just kind of talk about those 2 points, if you would.","Peter C. Farrell","Well, Ben, it's like asking how long is a piece a string, what causes a mask to wear out. Again, if -- I mean, there are all sorts reasons. The dog gets it, puts a hole in it, and it leaks or the patient has a particularly oily face and the material itself breaks down. All sorts of reasons, some people are very, very careful, they clean their mask, they look after it and so on and so forth. So there's all sorts of things that can happen out there. But our average is of the order -- it's a little a shade under 2, and that's all we can really say about that. But, Don, you might want to make a comment there. But it's really the DMEs and the HMEs working with the patients.  And it's up to them to do it. We just don't get involved with that.","Donald Darkin","Yes. I agree with Peter, Ben. It's a very difficult area to really understand. It's very patient-specific, and you get quite a variability in the numbers. But generally, it's sitting around that 1.5 plus. And I think as people understand the importance of compliance and understand the importance of getting good, comfortable, effective masks, then they'll start to realize that, that number might creep up a little bit, but obviously it's a slow process at this point.","Peter C. Farrell","And I'll hazard a guess here. Ben, that with the switch to HST, and I really think that's going to accelerate. There are different views with -- even within ResMed about that. I'm -- you can call me optimistic, I just think it's going to really pick up hugely. It's going to be adopted fairly rapidly. And with that, the patients are going to be going on to AutoSet. And the beauty of the AutoSet is you get really good, solid information on mask leak and how the patient is doing.  And it gives the HMEs and the DMEs the opportunity to say, hey, listen, you seem -- your treatment seems to be suboptimal. It could be the mask and ask them to check their mask or even bring the stuff in, and we'll take a look at it. So I think were going to see that number creeping up.","Donald Darkin","I thought -- just add one more thing there. I think as patients become more aware of the disease, are more aware of the importance of compliance for themselves, they will take control of that mask number as well, and I believe that will drive it even higher.","Peter C. Farrell","And so it would be consumer-driven.","Donald Darkin","Exactly.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ian Abbott with Goldman Sachs.","Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk about the buyback. I think this year was a record year for shares bought back, just wondering how you're thinking about that looking forward.","Peter C. Farrell","Yes. Well, I'll trade that one to Brett -- I mean, as you know, we've got an active program with 3.6 million shares into it. There's another 8.8 million shares approved. Basically, we think it's based on our feelings -- more than feelings, based on our projections. We think it's just damn good value. Brett, do you want to add any more flavor to that?","Brett A. Sandercock","Yes. It's Brett. We'll continue with the buyback. I think at this stage, we expect the buyback -- to buy back a minimum of stock to at least offset dilution from employee equity grants. So as you look at last year, that would be roughly 2 million shares. So I suppose that would be the starting point. But as Peter said, we'll -- that will be a starting point and likely to be more than that. But we have now the dividend as well that we'll be paying on a quarterly basis. But I don't think it's an either\/or, I think we'll both do the dividend and continue with the share buyback as well.","Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","But is it -- so it's unlikely to be as strong as it was this year at around 30 million shares?","Brett A. Sandercock","Yes. I mean, it was pretty significant this year.   I mean, that's getting to quite a significant proportion of our shares that we did buy back. So I think with the context of the dividend now being paid, you'd probably expect that wouldn't be quite as aggressive as what we had done this year.","Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","But is it fair to assume the share count might fall again?","Brett A. Sandercock","Yes, I think so. Well, I think you could definitely predict that.","Peter C. Farrell","Definitely. You can pick a number, I mean.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Low with Deutsche Bank.","Nicholas  Cameron - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Nick Cameron, going for David Low. Brett,  perhaps just a couple of quick questions to you and then one for Dr. Farrell. Firstly, Brett, Singapore manufacturing, just roughly what percentage does that represent now and how much more have you got to go there?","Brett A. Sandercock","Yes. On the Singapore manufacturing, it's probably roughly at the 50% -- about 50% of the production in Singapore now. And we've always said that, that -- what's happening there is incremental production continues to flow up to Singapore. We've also started heavy manufacturing in Malaysia as well now. So we have a small operation in Malaysia to really supplement that Singapore operation now. So it's 50%, and you expect over time that percentage will climb.","Nicholas  Cameron - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And just quickly on the payout ratio implied by this result, can we sort of expect that going forward? Or is it a flat $0.17?","David Pendarvis","Well, it's -- well, I mean, the board will determine the dividend policy. And at this stage, let me say, it's $0.17 a quarter.","Nicholas  Cameron - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, no problem. And then, for Dr. Farrell, if he may. I just want to get your feeling on how you're seeing compliance in the eyes of the payers at the moment on some of the product side. So I just wanted to see what your thoughts are on that. And what it is, you think, they're looking for and will ultimately come up with in the end?","Peter C. Farrell","Well, I think people are recognizing that compliance is the ace in the whole. If you don't get compliance, everybody loses. In other words, a machine that's bought and gets stuck in a cupboard, you don't get replenishment and so on, so that's all obvious. But I would put it more strategically. What we do know is that patients have significantly improved quality of life. We also know -- and the data, I was referring to it in my initial comments, I mean, you've got the co-morbidities are not just heart disease and diabetes, it's peripheral neuropathy, it's cancer and so on and so forth. So it actually, treatment -- compliant treatment prevents disease progression. And we also have a significant amount of data internally. And there was a recent report about a year ago from McKinsey, which is on the Harvard website -- the Harvard Sleep Medicine website, showing that there's a return on investment in the first year for treating patients, and that is with a reduction in inpatient and outpatient services. So it's kind of like the holy grail, improve quality of life, reduce costs and stopping the progression of disease. People are becoming more and more aware of that aspect. And so compliance is the holy grail in itself for the patient. It's a holy grail, if you are compliant, for the reasons I just mentioned. I think that word is getting out, and it's -- the CMS -- actually the government did something senseful, it's sort of hard to believe, it's not often you see that. But by requiring this 90 days with 30 days continuous use, that's the CMS, this is forcing the DMEs and the HMEs to look very, very seriously at compliance because they don't get paid if the patient isn't compliant. So we've seen in some of the bigger customers, compliance sub-50 going to mid-70s. So we're seeing and maybe that's reflected also in the incredible growth that we're seeing in our replenishment program. It's getting better and better. And of course the other side of the coin is that our products are better and better. I mean, you've got much more like 75 gram masks, machines that are about a kilogram, 24 decibels, I mean, they're quiet, they're small, they're appealing and they're so much, so much easier to use. So everything is moving in the right direction. The technology is, the knowledge of the -- both the consumer and the physician, the improvements in technology and so forth. So we are seeing -- now I couldn't give you specific numbers, but I would say -- well I can give you a specific number, but it's not based on hard-nosed data, but it's somewhere around the mid-70s at one year. And once the patients are on after first month, we're seeing, even the first couple of weeks, we're seeing that, that's the way it tends to continue.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone with Jefferies.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got few number questions for Brett and then a few for Dr. Farrell and the rest of the team. So Brett, just on the FX overall, given the rising shift of manufacturing to Singapore and later down onto Malaysia. Do we still have a 6-month lag as it relates to shifts in the Australian dollar versus the U.S. dollar?","Brett A. Sandercock","Yes. I mean, we're still -- still a decent chunk of those costs are in the manufacturing front. So we're still -- yes, it would be probably just overauarter. You could rule of thumb probably a quarter delay. Now we've -- if you look at inventory turnover for us now, it has improved quite a bit over the last few years. So I think the rule of thumb would be on about a quarter's lag on impact from the Aussie dollar.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then just to stay on that, is about 30% of R&D still local in Australia? And does that still play the one quarter lag as well further down the P&L?","Brett A. Sandercock","Yes. I mean, so the majority -- much more than that, the majority of the R&D is undertaken here in Australia. But that impact we feel straight away through normal translation. So you'll see that whatever the average rate is for the quarter, that would be reflected in our R&D spend.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And Dr. Farrell, one product question. In late July, CareFusion actually announced a Class I recall of its EnVe Ventilator. And about a year ago, I guess ResMed and CareFusion now have the distribution relationship with the Stellar 100 and 150. So I'm wondering, due to that recall, do you see an incremental opportunity for Stellar 100 and 150?","Peter C. Farrell","I'm going to give that one to Geoff Neilson. I don't know what Geoff's about to say. But I think it's almost no impact as far as -- from where I see it. But, Geoff?","Geoff Neilson","They're playing in different segments in the hospitals. So really, it's not going to have any impact.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","All right, perfect. And then last one for me and I'll get back in. Just to go back to competitive bidding. Fully understanding your comments that you're not seeing any impact, but as we look into the beginning of 2013 when the program actually gets extended, not so much that there'll be a permanent impact on the part of DMEs to sort of reposition how they negotiate with manufacturers.  But do you envision any initial knee-jerk reaction as you move into and get up to 90 MSAs? And to that respect should we expect to -- maybe a moderation from low double-digit growth into the back end of '13?","Peter C. Farrell","Anthony, sort of reiterating what I've said there. We -- the first 9 MSAs we, sort of if anything, it was a slightly -- and it sounds bizarre, slightly positive impact on ASPs. We're not quite sure why that is. But let's say it had -- it virtually had no impact. We don't see -- and we've looked at this pretty carefully because people seem to be spooked by it. But our data show that it is not really having any impact at all. Now that could change, but I don't see it. We just don't see it.  And again, it's 10% -- it's of the order of 10% of our total global revenues. So -- but I mean, we don't even see it impacting that 10%. The other people do apparently, but we just don't. And we are talking about real data, not guesses.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of David Stanton with Nomura.","David Stanton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I wonder if you could give us an update on growth rates in the U.S. for bilevels and APAP compared to the overall machine growth rate? That's my first question.","Peter C. Farrell","David, we don't give that sort of granularity. What we have said is that we're incredibly encouraged by our -- but since the bilevels have been put into the S9 platform, we're seeing some very encouraging growth, very encouraging. And as I just said, we're releasing the VPAP ST and the VPAP ST-A in -- also in the S9 platform, and we expect to see that being received positively. The other thing I mentioned is the HST-driven switch -- lastly, HST-driven switch too, what I said. And we expect that to continue and we're expecting in fact another 100% increase in HST, and the obvious way to go is to put patients on auto-setting devices. So we expect to see a modest to very poor growth in the low-end CPAPs and quite good growth in the high-end CPAPs. And bilevels and AutoSets, we see continuing to grow.","David Stanton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Great. And could you give us -- as my final question, give us an update on what you think market growth rates are at present in the U.S. and EU? Are you guys gaining share, I guess, is my ultimate question.","Peter C. Farrell","Yes. Well you would say -- so we haven't changed our view on where we are with growth rates. It's 6% to 8%, and pretty much worldwide. Maybe it's a little higher in Asia Pac because it's starting from a lower base. So you might be able to say 8% to 10% in Asia Pac, possibly a little higher in China or in India, but it's not reached a point where it's hugely material for us just yet. But 6% to 8%, for the bulk of our business, that is Europe and the U.S. And as you saw, our constant currency growth was 13%, so that would be suggestive of market share gains. And the rate of growth for both devices, 9% in the U.S. for devices and 13% for masks. That would suggest that we're doing nicely.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Louisa Abdo.","Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is actually Matt Prior. Peter, if I could ask -- and maybe if Ann is on the line or if you want to pick this one to Brett. But with rest of world growth being so strong and we had anticipated the Japan would kick back in this quarter. Can you talk a little bit about Europe versus Japan? And specifically, I guess is the margin better in Asia? Or -- sorry, your business in Asia, I should say. And is the margin better in Asia than it is versus Europe? And is that one of the reasons why we saw a slightly better GM than I think the market was looking for this quarter?","Peter C. Farrell","Well, Asia Pac had been soft for a couple of quarters and it's come back full steam, whether it was the tsunami, some of that was in there, psychological issues, if you like. Asia Pac has now good growth back on stream. And we -- I referred to the challenging economic climate in Europe, I mean. However, despite that, Germany was extremely encouraging. The U.K. almost hit it out of the ballpark. But you've got obviously huge challenges in Spain, Italy and France, where there's ASP pressures. But we grew constant currency, 13% in Europe, which was pretty damn good and significantly higher than that in Asia Pac. With respect to margins, we don't really get down to talking about -- I will say slightly better margins in Asia Pac. But it's not something that is of great importance to us. I don't know whether -- Brett, do you want to add to that or Rob?","Brett A. Sandercock","Yes, thanks. The only thing I'd say on that is, Matt, is geographic mix wasn't really a driver of the margin. So that probably pretty much answers it.","Peter C. Farrell","Rob is going to add something.","Robert Douglas","Just to the -- markets in Asia Pac are generally higher in product. So they are -- that supports the margins a little bit and also some of the smaller Norther European countries did very well as well, so it's a mixed bag there, but netted out really good.","Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. Just one follow-up question and given I know Geoff is on the call. Geoff, if I can talk to you on ventilation just given that there was reference to mix in that positive U.S. Flow Gen number. I think, and obviously you already talked to some extent about the CareFusion relationship on the call, but certainly to the 9% number we saw for U.S. Flow Gen, do you see, I guess, the Stellar and ventilation contributing to that yet at somewhat of a meaningful level? Or are we still waiting for the ventilation market for ResMed in the U.S. to take flight? And I guess the final point to that is do you see competitive bidding, the medical device tax, Obamacare, slowing down any of the kind of hospital purchase decisions around ventilation products over the next 1 or 2 quarters before it really gets a head of steam?","Geoff Neilson","Okay. First of all on Stellar, globally, it's been growing very well. In the U.S., it's still in early days with CareFusion. We are seeing growth, but it's off a small base. And as far as all the other macroeconomic things, ResMed's presence in the hospital is small and not material at the moment. We obviously have plans to grow that. And so these issues aren't material at the moment.","Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. I'm sorry, Peter, if I can ask just one last one? Linde's acquisition of Lincare, that was a fairly big event for the sector given that we are in the midst of, as you talked about, competitive bidding concerns. Does that reinforce, I guess, your view that currently Linde doesn't see big concerns around competitive bidding because they're making acquisitions like they have with Lincare?","Peter C. Farrell","All right. You've taken the words out of my mouth. It was a very decent premium that Lincare got, so $41 a share or whatever. It's a very decent -- I mean, premium. So clearly, Linde is seeing competitive bidding as being, I would say, a nonissue. I mean, they paid big bucks. And as far as the impact upon us, I mean, we can only go on what's written in the press releases and so forth. We haven't had any in-depth discussion with either Linde or Lincare management on this. But the press releases say that they're going to be run separately. And John Byrnes, the CEO of Lincare is still in the saddle. And so we treat -- they're both big customers, but we treat it as business as usual.","So good luck to Lincare and the boys. And you've said it yourself, competitive bidding doesn't seem to have much of an impact on what could be considered a very, very generous premium.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Saul Hadassin with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Saul Hadassin - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a question on Europe. Just wondering if you can provide any granularity or detail around the contribution of ventilation growth versus pure CPAP growth just in that specific market?","Peter C. Farrell","We've always done reasonably well in the ventilation space in Europe, France and so forth. France was, as I said, was a little soft. There are price pressures occurring there. I -- there's nothing really that stands out. Geoff, do you want to comment on?","Geoff Neilson","I think and particularly in the noninvasive ventilation area, we're seeing strong growth both with our ST devices and with Stellar devices. And the life support products are holding their own, but mostly the growth is in NIV area, which is -- where the growth in ventilation is actually occurring.","Saul Hadassin - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","All right. And just one last question back to the U.S.. Just this shift from lower-end CPAP to APAP, it's something you guys have been talking about for quite a long time. I'm just wondering how much room there still is for that mix shift effect within your portfolio as a percentage of, I guess, not asking for data on percentage split between the 2. But over how long do you think this trend will continue to play out for your specific business?","Peter C. Farrell","Well, we think it's -- the potential is there for it to accelerate. And the reason being the push to HST is building up an an incredible storm, if you like -- or maybe slightly less than a storm. But it's happening. And growing at 50% per annum, this is going to be reflected in more switching to AutoSet. It's happening. So -- and how long will it continue? I see it continuing for several years.","Michael J. Farrell","So one -- this is Mick here. One proxy to look at is the fact that we're 15% switched to home sleep testing from PSG, and we expect that to continue. So there's 85% of the runway left in terms of the potential switch from PSG to HST. So that could be a proxy metric you could look at -- to that as a suggestion.","Peter C. Farrell","Well, at the end of this year, we expect that to be 75%. But that's still a fair chunk...","Michael J. Farrell","Still lot of runway.","Peter C. Farrell","Fair -- yes, a lot of runway.","Operator","And we have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dr. Farrell for any closing remarks.","Peter C. Farrell","Well, thank you, Chris. I think we've said enough and we'll let people go. Those that are still on the -- and I guess the final thing I'd like to say is to just thank all the ResMed employees for doing another outstanding job. We have a great team of people. And I just want to publicly thank all our employees. So thanks, guys. See you next time, as they say.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you so much for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."]}}
