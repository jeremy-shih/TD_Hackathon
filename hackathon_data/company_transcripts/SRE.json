As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead.","Richard Vaccari","Good morning, and welcome to Sempra Energy's second quarter 2015 financial presentation. A live webcast to this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section.","With us today are several members of our management team: Mark Snell, President; Joe Householder, Chief Financial Officer; Martha Wyrsch, General Counsel; Trevor Mihalik, Chief Accounting Officer; Dennis Arriola, Chief Executive Officer of SoCalGas; Steve Davis, President of SDG&E; and Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es, President of Sempra LNG.","Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q.","It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and that we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our second quarter 2015 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures.","I'd also like to note that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, August 4, 2015, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.","With that, please turn to slide four, and let me hand the call over to Mark.","Mark Snell","Thanks, Rick. To start off, I want to mention that Debbie is not joining us today. She had a medical issue with her left eye that required attention and treatment this morning. She apologizes for not being able to make the call, but we all realized health issues come first. I'll be filling in for her today. And so now, we'll get on with the call.","Our financial performance for the second quarter was very strong. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter adjusted earnings of $260 million or $1.03 per share. As you may recall, these figures include the impact from applying seasonality to the SoCalGas revenues in 2015. While this change does not affect full-year earnings for SoCalGas that results in almost all of their earnings being reported in the first quarter and fourth quarter of the year. Specifically, the impact from seasonality was $48 million of lower earnings this quarter, and $65 million of higher earnings year-to-date. Given our solid financial results in both the first quarter and second quarter, we are on track to achieve our 2015 adjusted earning guidance.","Today, I'd also like to emphasize that just six months into the first year of our current five-year plan, we have already secured by new projects that are additional to the base plan we presented at the March Analyst Conference. At U.S. gas and power, we have added two new solar projects at our Mesquite facility in Arizona, this adds to the Black Oak Getty wind project we announced last quarter. In Mexico, IEnova was awarded another CFE pipeline project in July. And last week, IEnova agreed to purchase PEMEX's 50% equity interest in IEnova-PEMEX joint venture.","In addition, we're working on the steps needed to advance our potential LNG projects, which could extend growth beyond 2019. And our California utilities have made headway on the GRC and rate reform initiatives.","We are all really pleased, with our progress, and will discuss our development projects in more detail as we proceed. First, let me begin with a regulatory and operational update, including a discussion of our progress in achieving our base plan. Please turn to slide five.","Our California utilities are making steady progress on their general rate case applications. Since our last call, we have completed evidentiary hearings, and are well situated to receive a timely decision. Briefs are due in August and September with the draft decision scheduled for year end. After participating in the hearing process, we believe our recommendations make a compelling case in support of the state\u2019s priorities around safety and reliability. Please turn to slide six.","Turning to one of FDG&Es highest priorities, the CPUC approved a final decision on rate reform in July. The decision implements electric rates that are more fair and sustainable. We provide a summary in the appendix, but key outcomes of the decision include, a reduction in the number of tiers, from four down to two, and annual reduction and rate differentials between the lowest and highest tiers, minimum monthly bills and a process to study and implement time of use rates.","The decision directs all the state\u2019s electric utilities to implement initial changes, no later than November 1, 2015. Yesterday, net energy metering tariff proposals were also filed by all parties. Once approved the tariffs will determine how customers with new distributed energy resources will pay for utility services they received. FDG&E's suggested tariffs would apply to all new net energy metering customers by 2017. Though we expect a final decision by year-end, it could extend into the next year.","Let's now go to slide seven for an update on base plant projects and our other businesses. We're really executing well on our five-year plan. Since our last earnings call, two more projects are in service. In Mexico, the 155 megawatt ESJ wind project reached commercial operations in June and in the U.S. 1.2 Bcf per day of east-to-west capacity on the REX pipeline, was placed into service over this last weekend.","In addition, we closed the sale of the remaining block of the Mesquite power plant in the second quarter. We received $347 million in net cash proceeds and recorded a $36 million after tax gain on the sale. As discussed last quarter, this gain is not included in our 2015 adjusted earning guidance.","Please turn to slide eight for update on our development opportunities. We're pleased to announce that we have secured several development opportunities this quarter that are additional to our base plan. In Mexico, IEnova was awarded a new CFE pipeline project in July. The project represents an investment of about $110 million and is expected to be in operations in the first half of 2017.","CFE has announced two more pipelines will be awarded in August and September, one of which interconnects with the pipeline we just won. Five more pipelines are scheduled to be awarded later this year. You can refer to the table in the appendix for details.","In addition, on Friday, we announced the IEnova has agreed to purchase PEMEX's 50% equity interest in their shared joint venture. The transaction is expected to close later this year. As noted in our recent press release, IEnova agreed to purchase the business for approximately $1.3 billion subject to certain terms and conditions.","IEnova and PEMEX will also maintain a 50\/50 JV for the continued joint development of the Los Ramones Norte pipeline and other future infrastructure projects. As a result of the transaction, IEnova will own 100% of six purchased assets, five of which are currently in operation. The assets are covered by long-term dollar-based contracts. The acquisition is expected to be about $0.05 accretive to Sempra Energy's earnings in 2016 growing to about $0.10 per share by 2019. IEnova expects to finance the purchase with a combination of equity and debt.","The acquisition provides several important benefits and ongoing relationship with PEMEX for future development projects, opportunities for asset optimization and expansion into areas such as the transportation and storage of refined products, and a larger platform of presence in Mexico to participate in the energy sector reform.","Moving to U.S. Gas & Power. We are pleased to announce contracts on two new renewable projects that are Mesquite Solar facility in Arizona. Mesquite Solar 2 will be a 100-megawatt project secured by a 20-year PPA. Mesquite Solar 3 will be a 150-megawatt project secured by a 25-year PPA, both PPAs are with creditworthy counterparties and we expect the projects to be in service by the end of 2016. And finally, I will note that we are working diligently to prepare our S-1 filing for Sempra Partners. Securities laws, however, prohibit us from discussing the matter further.","Let's now go to slide nine for a discussion of our LNG development process. LNG development continues to be a terrific long-term growth opportunity with very large potential for upside for Sempra. While the development process takes time and can vary between projects, we are making solid progress on all three of our liquefaction initiatives.","Since LNG development continues to be a hot topic for investors, we provided this slide to illustrate the process needed to advance the project to FID or final investment decision. Cameron Expansion is the project that is furthest along, so we use that project as an example.","But before walking you through the slide, I want to reiterate a couple of key themes. First, while projections for global LNG demand are lower than a few years ago, industry forecast continue to show large un-contracted demand post 2019. These forecasts already include competing sources of supply such as the restart of some of Japan's nuclear fleet, more coal and renewable development in Asia, growing pipeline imports into customer markets and indigenous shale gas sales.","Second, U.S. Gulf LNG projects are regarded as the most competitive source of global supply, both in cost and in flexibility. And third, we are receiving strong interest in our projects from large buyers of LNG for delivery in the 2019 and beyond timeframes.","Now moving to the graphic on this slide, we have illustrated key work streams related to project cost and design permitting, marketing and financing. You'll notice that each category is interrelated. EPC project cost estimates and lenders' consents are needed in order to finalize customer contracts, agreements with customers on tariffs and service dates and quantities are needed to finalize financing commitments. In financing terms, the regulatory approvals are needed to make the final investment decision. Completion of each of these work streams is what enables us to take a project to achieve FID. For Cameron expansion, we're targeting FID in late 2016. Our Cameron joint venture is currently permitting trains four and five, but the project could begin with one or two trains depending on total market interest.","Cameron expansion is well positioned as one of the lowest cost sources of global LNG supply. This is due to the economies of scale and adding more trains to an existing facility, the opportunity to benefit from continuous construction at the site, a simpler permitting process, an access to low-cost of capital and of course in expense of North American Gas.","Moving to other LNG development projects, we continue to actively develop the Port Arthur project and have submitted the initial filings at both DOE and FERC. Market interest in this project remains strong as it offers different off take and ownership opportunities from those available at Cameron. In June, we also announced an MOU with Woodside Petroleum to work on the feasibility of developing the project together.","For ECA we are working with the Mexican government in the development of all the regulations and conditions needed to support liquefaction and export of LNG from Mexico. We have completed a large - we have completed a number of studies on technical feasibility and market interest for this sole west coast Brownfield site. Together with PEMEX, we continue to advance the development work and are now sharing costs.","Now with that let's turn to slide 10, for a discussion of the quarterly earnings. Joe?","Joe Householder","Thank you, Mark. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $295 million or $1.17 per share. On an adjusted basis, we reported second quarter earnings of $260 million or $1.03 per share. Second quarter earnings in 2014 were $269 million or $1.08 per share. Adjusted earnings this quarter exclude two items first we recorded a $36 million after-tax gain on the sale of the remaining block of the Mesquite Power Plant. Second as I noted last quarter, we are adjusting earnings for expenses relating to the development of our pre-proposed LNG liquefaction projects. While our cash expenditures have been consistent with cost for the LNG development activities, we've undertaken thus far we have recorded $1 million of after-tax expense in the second quarter of 2015. This number reflects the fact that certain costs are being capitalized and certain other costs are being shared with our Cameron joint venture partners and PEMEX.","I also wanted to note that compared with the same period of last year, second quarter earnings now reflect the impact of seasonality in SoCalGas revenues. As Mark mentioned earlier, this impact resulted in $48 million of lower earnings this quarter and $65 million of higher earnings year-to-date.","Looking to the third quarter please be aware that we could report a loss for SoCalGas due to seasonality. You can refer to the appendix for additional detail where we illustrate 2014 SoCalGas earnings at seasonality and revenues been applied. As the appendix shows third quarter 2014 earnings would have reflected a loss in the third quarter. So there was no impact on a full year basis.","Overall, we are on track to achieving our 2015 adjusted earnings guidance given the strong financial performance we've had year-to-date. Finally, before proceeding, I want to mention that we expect to report a one-time non-cash gain next quarter, we will step up our investment to fair value related to IEnova's purchase of PEMEX's interest in their joint venture. The size of the gain has not yet been determined and is not included in our 2015 adjusted earnings guidance.","Please turn to slide 11. Individual financial results for each of our businesses could be found in this section of our presentation entitled business unit earnings. I'll address here the key drivers for our consolidated earnings this quarter. Sempra International recorded $19 million of higher earnings primarily from the Los Ramones I pipeline and a section of the Sonora pipeline in Mexico that are now in service.","SoCalGas recorded a $13 million retroactive benefit for 2012 to the first quarter of 2015 from higher rate base. Approval of this benefit by the PUC was contingent upon receiving a favorable Private Letter Ruling from the IRS which we received in April. SoCalGas also had $10 million of higher operational earnings from higher CPUC margins net of operating expenses and higher AFUDC equity earnings. Offsetting these positive factors were two items, the $48 million seasonality impact that lowered SoCalGas's 2015 earnings and $11 million of lower net investment earnings at the parent on assets in support of our retirement obligations.","Now let's conclude with slide 12. Overall, our financial and operating results for the second quarter continued to be very strong and consistent with our 2015 adjusted earnings guidance of $4.60 per share to $5 per share. Excluding the impact of seasonality in SoCalGas's revenues, our second quarter adjusted earnings increased significantly compared to the same period last year driven largely by increased operating results at both Sempra International and SoCalGas. Across the company, we have made excellent progress on our base plan and continue to capture additional development opportunities. As we look forward to the remainder of the year we are working diligently to capture more development opportunities that can provide upside to our base plan in the near term.","In addition, we'll continue to work toward advancing our LNG projects that could extend this growth beyond 2019.","With that, we'll conclude our prepared comments and stop to take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Michael Weinstein with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, good afternoon.","Joe Householder","Hi, Mike.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","It's Julien here.","Joe Householder","Hey Julien, how are you?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, not too bad. Thank you. I suppose first question here out of the gates, obviously the IEnova is a pleasant development but curious, you're providing a bridge loan but ultimately how are you thinking about your ownership stake in IEnova pro forma for the latest deal, but probably more strategically, how are you thinking about that down the line as you think about the 80%-ish you're on today?","Mark Snell","Well, I'm going to let Joe handle that question in detail, but let me just say off the bat that we are expecting to finance this at the IEnova level and even if we don't participate in this thing and I'll let Joe explain what we're thinking there but even if we didn't, it would still be accretive to us but Joe why don't you give some more details on that.","Joe Householder","Yeah. Thanks, Mark and hi Julien. Yeah, this is very important and we're studying the issue. We really like this deal and so we would like to participate in the deal. We are looking at, what the market is going to be like over the next couple of months. We've got a lot of confidence from the banks we've worked with on this transaction. And I think our current view is, we will participate in the equity offering. We know that a number of our IEnova investors want to have more liquidity. So, we've said all along that if we have a large project this would enable us to go back out to the equity markets. And so we're going to have an equity offering I believe, we will participate. What I'm currently thinking is, we have a dividend coming later this week from IEnova. It will come to our Mexican Holding company. And I think, we'll use that cash plus some other cash to participate in the offering. We haven't decided the firm amount yet, we want to see how the shares are doing and how the market is, but we definitely will participate, and as Mark said, this is going to be accretive either way.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Great. Excellent. Turning to the LNG story. Curious, you mentioned on the slides here for instance one trains or two trains at Cameron. I suppose, as it relates to the project, what's your confidence level, as it relates to one trains or two trains? And, then secondly, in terms of conversations, are you still expecting that you passively acknowledge to the Street one way or another perhaps by 4Q or 1Q next year a decision. I mean, I know, you indicate FID by second half of 2016, but just wanted to be very clear about your communication intentions?","Mark Snell","Well, with respect to trains four and trains five, we have this partnership that owns a facility, we own 50% and our partners own the other 50%. Currently through trains one, trains two, trains three our partners have all of the capacity. With respect to trains four and trains five, we have a right, Sempra has the right to 50% of that capacity, we're highly confident that we're going to be able to market that capacity and we're actively doing that now. And therefore we know that at least one of the trains will go, whether our partners decide to market that extra capacity or not is entirely up to them and we don't control that, but - Oct\u00e1vio, if you would like to comment on any of that that maybe fill in.","Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es","Sure. I think Mark covered the big topics and that is that the ownership has decided to go forward with the expansion. We have 50% of that expansion capacity roughly 4 million tons, the remaining partners have 4 million tons as well. What they're doing with their capacity, it depends whether they want to put it in the market, if it fits in their portfolio or not, we are actively pursuing it, we're encouraged by all the things we are finding in our current negotiations. And so at the end of the day, I think the slide reflects that we'll go back and say, okay, Sempra is taking on the 4 million tons that we are allotted to, if our partners say no that means that probably then one just one train will be built since there was agreement by everybody, if they market their capacity then we would have the two trains. We are permitting both trains from both the FERC and DOE.","Mark Snell","I'd add on Mark. Just to be clear, so everybody is clear on the call. The fourth train would be owned by the joint venture, so it'd be 50-50 ownership. But Oct\u00e1vio was right, we would have the capacity.","Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es","That's right, Joe.","Mark Snell","Okay.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And just to be extra clear about this, I apologize. So this would be - you would obviously still need to go and remarket your respective ownership, but I supposed at this point in time you're indicating that you intend at least move forward on train 4, is that an incremental?","Mark Snell","Yeah, what we would - I mean obviously we would not move forward if we haven't sold the capacity forward, but we're in the process of that marketing effort right now and we're pretty confident that we'll get that done.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Okay. Thank you. I'll let it be.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Neel Mitra with Tudor, Pickering.","Neel Mitra","Hi. Good afternoon.","Mark Snell","Hi, Neel.","Neel Mitra","A question on the PEMEX acquisition. Now that you have a larger stake in Mexico, especially with the pipes, are you seeing additional synergies or lateral opportunities from owning a larger stake in Mexico?","Mark Snell","Yes, I mean, in fact we're seeing two things. One, on the cost side, with us acquiring a 100% of the pipes that we're in the JV. We believe we can integrate those with the other pipes that we own and we'll definitely get some synergies out of that that would be in addition to the earnings accretion that we've so far forecasted. So we think if there is additional upside just in the operational synergies that we can achieve. But then secondly, all of the pipeline infrastructure that we're building now, we've to this point, only marketed it to the original customer that ask for it to be built mainly CFE or PEMEX. But these are open access pipes and we are announced - into market extra capacity to other users and we've just actually started working on that and we're seeing some success and getting that. So we do think there is additional upside to come from marketing additional capacity either that exist currently or that we can create through compression and we are pretty excited about that. We think that there is a growth opportunity there.","Neel Mitra","And what would be the timeline for recognizing some of the possible lateral projects? When can we first hear about it?","Joe Householder","Well, I guess, you'll first hear about it when they are announced, but for the most part, I think we're working on some of these right now and some will be probably completed before year-end.","Neel Mitra","Okay. Great. And Joe you had two good quarters. Can you say where you are within the guidance range at this point? Are you at the high end or are you in the middle? Can you comment on that?","Joe Householder","We are not going to narrow the range or talk about where we are in the guidance. You can see the year-to-date results are really strong, you can't double those because SoCalGas is $65 million ahead on the seasonality. So that will come back and then we have a few items that are in the earnings year-to-date that won't repeat. So we feel really good about where we are, but we're not going to narrow it at this point.","Neel Mitra","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steven Fleishman","Yeah, hi. I've got a few questions. First, on the two new solar projects. Can you give us any sense of the earnings benefit to those?","Mark Snell","We are not disclosing the benefits precisely, but they're 100 megawatts and 150 megawatts projects and there are consistent returns with what we've had in the past.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. And then secondly just on the MLP, which I know you can't talk about. Can you just remind when we did - when you did your base plan, my recollection is that you did not kind of assume the MLP in your financing plan.","Mark Snell","That's correct.","Steven Fleishman","At your Analyst Day.","Mark Snell","That's correct.","Steven Fleishman","Is that correct?","Mark Snell","That's correct.","Joe Householder","Yeah.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. And just is there any way to give any color on kind of how to think about that strategy just given current market conditions?","Joe Householder","The thing is we just cannot comment on the MLP at all. I just - I apologize, but that just the way the rules are and so we really can't talk about it. We'll talk about that when we do the marketing for the MLP.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. And I get that. And then finally just back that you know of the $0.05 to $0.10 of accretion on the different years, that's whether you take stock or not, are related to this deal, that range is still pretty good either way, sort of the equation.","Mark Snell","Yes. I'll let Joe.","Joe Householder","Yes. It's pretty close. I mean we've evaluated this as we've been working on this deal for a few months and actually whether we borrow money or whether we issue equity, it hardly has any impact and so the only thing that moves jut slightly is whether we participate but again it's going to be accretive either way, but I think we will - you will see us participate to some degree.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. And then one question on Cameron 4 and Cameron 5. So you can control of 4 million tons of one train. You're only going to go forward with yours if you sign long-term contracts, I assume.","Joe Householder","Correct.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. The partners have this other 4 million tons, can you - is there any way that if you kind of see the market that you could kind of take that over as well if you wanted to or is it really in their hands what to do with that?","Joe Householder","It's really in their hands. I mean I suppose something could be worked out but we have other projects too that we're developing and are part of our portfolio. So we have to evaluate it in relation to those just as they will.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. But it sounds like your conviction on moving forward what you control seems quite high.","Joe Householder","I think you could say that it is very high, yes.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. Thank you. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon","Hey, guys. Steve just asked my question, so I'm good. Thanks.","Mark Snell","Okay. Thanks, Greg.","Joe Householder","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","And we will go next to Michael Dandurand with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Dandurand","Hi, guys. Good afternoon.","Mark Snell","Hi, Michael.","Joe Householder","Hi.","Michael Dandurand","Just to - and first of all thank -appreciate the additional color on LNG, and with particular to Cameron. I just have a follow-up there as it relates to the Port Arthur. Can you just talk a little bit about what we should be looking forward there and how things are going with Woodside now involved?","Mark Snell","Well, I'll start and then I'll let Oct\u00e1vio comment on this as well, but we have an MOU with Woodside to look at the feasibility of the project. We're progressing on it. We've had lots of meetings. We're starting some of the technical analysis and starting some of the marketing of the trains. It's an excellent site. It looks like it's very promising as moving forward and I would say their commitment to it is very strong. And Oct\u00e1vio, do you want to give any other color on that?","Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es","I think you've covered the process. I would just add part of the attractiveness of Port Arthur is that it appeals to customers that may want to have equity as part of their supply strategy. It allows us and Woodside to look at options to really make Port Arthur a very low cost supplier in the LNG market, which for us is key for the success of any project out of the U.S. exports of LNG. So it's - plus this is going extremely well. There is a lot of similar objectives between us Woodside, and you're likely to see some announcements as that relationship grows and as the project continues to go forward.","Joe Householder","Yeah. And I would just add to that. I think it's important just to keep in mind that our projects, both in the Gulf and ECO as well, we are positioning them as at the very low end of the cost curve for LNG worldwide. And so we think they will be very competitive, but that doesn't - we have other Gulf Coast facilities that obviously compete with that. But in general, our facilities and the others in the Gulf region in particular, are some of the lowest cost providers of LNG that out there. And therefore they're very likely to get lifted over time.","Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es","Mike, if I may just add. One of the key elements for any buyer of LNG in the world is the reliability and the creditability of the developer. And so, we think Sempra is very well positioned with our track record, clearly Woodside is very well positioned given their track record. And so that in itself is an advantage because we'll be offering technology that's conventional that the buyers are used, that's reliable and with all kinds of the guarantees that they expect from a project of this size.","Michael Dandurand","Got it. It's very helpful. So, in less of an emphasis on the spot market, if I'm hearing that correctly?","Mark Snell","Yes.","Michael Dandurand","Got it. And then just as far as, we've seen a bit of a deterioration in the midstream arena, and I appreciate that you can't discuss the MLP directly. But just as far as the broader landscape for midstream assets out there. Are you seeing anything more attractive just from an M&A standpoint.","Mark Snell","Well, obviously we do see some attractive M&A opportunities. We just executed on one last week. So we think that - we think that we did a very good deal last weekend and we're really happy with it. So obviously with the way the landscape has been, it could be that M&A opportunities become more viable. But it's still - there still a pretty good cost advantage to developing your own projects as opposed to train to buy them in the marketplace. We see that both - we see that both in the midstream area and also in the renewables area as well, to the extent that we continue to develop our own backlog of projects, that's a much more profitable avenue for us and we're fortunate to have a pretty good backlog of projects to work on. So I think we're very well positioned for growth and growth at the lower end of the cost curve as opposed to somebody that's trying to it through acquisition.","Michael Dandurand","Got it. Very helpful. I mean the only other one I have is just on Mexico with the recent project win there. Does that help your upcoming bid with the project in August here, I'm going to put you this name, the Samalayuca.","Joe Householder","Yeah, it does. We believe the project that we just won is kind of a large header system, which will benefit us and being able to control the costs on the next project bid that's coming up. And so I don't want to go into all the details of why that is. But we do think it gives us a little bit of an advantage and we're hoping to see some success there.","Michael Dandurand","Okay. Got it. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it.","Joe Householder","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we will go next to Matt Tucker with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Matt Tucker","Hey, guys. Congrats on nice quarter and on the IEnova transaction. I just wanted to ask about that. PEMEX and IEnova highlighted the remaining JV as a platform for future product development. Just talk about little bit the opportunities you see going forward with PEMEX. And also is this model - something you could see PEMEX wanting to repeat i.e. develop and construct their project in a JV and then sell their interest?","Mark Snell","Yeah, look, I think it's a healthy development for us in the sense that PEMEX is recognizing this transaction. They repeatedly refer to it as a monetization as opposed to a sale, because they see this opportunity to build these projects that they need to have done and then once they're built, they can monetize them through a sale to us and then start on the next project and we see that or obviously we think that that's a very exciting opportunity for us. And we were very happy that they wanted to stay into this partnership arrangement with the pipeline that's currently under construction and then the considered new projects in that.","So I think we do think - we are looking at this as a source of future projects. We think it's a good model for us, it's worked well in the past. And I think the thing that that PEMEX appreciates is that they have now worked with us on these projects over the years. They've had good results, we've built good projects, they've come in pretty much on time and on budget and I think they see us as a really good partner that they can count on to deliver for them. And so that's something that we - obviously we pride ourselves on and we think that is going to lead to more projects in the future.","Joe Householder","Mark, I'd add on to that. And, Matt, I think you guys don't always see this, but Mark and I sit on the IEnova board and so we were just down there last week and we were with Debbie and we met with PEMEX and other government agencies. And it's really important, we have a very interactive ongoing relationship with IEnova. And I just want to make sure you guys all understand that.","Matt Tucker","Okay, great. And just on the California facilities, the GRCs mentioned they're going well. Can you just update us on any kind of key or contentious issues that are emerging as the process goes on. And I believe at the Analyst Day when you came out your longer term guidance, you had assumed no rate increase resulting from the GRCs, any update on how you're thinking about that assumption?","Joe Householder","Yeah, I'm going to turn this over to Dennis to give you the details. So let me just make one quick point which is - at the analyst conference and in the plan, what we assumed with respect to the GRC was just normal attrition, but I think that was just a conservative assumption to - for the planning purposes, but I think Dennis can give you some more detail on that.","Dennis Arriola","Thanks, Mark. Hi, Matt. Yeah, as Mark said in his opening comments. Things are going well. We finished our evidentiary hearings two days ahead of schedule and we're happy with the overall pace of the filings. Our witnesses from both SoCalGas and SDG&E did a great job of explaining the overall merits and details of both of our filings. And we're really optimistic that we're going to receive constructive decisions for both companies.","We can't obviously disclose anything related to any settlement discussions if we're in them. But what we can tell you, is given the strong show in that we had in our evidentiary hearings and the fact that, our filings are consistent with the priorities of the PUC which are around safety, reliability and customer service. We feel really good about potential constructive discussions with intervening parties. As it pertains to the plan that Mark talked about, you're right, what we just assumed was that, our existing attrition rates of 2.75% for both SoCalGas and SDG&E, would continue from a planning perspective but obviously we've asked for more that supports our filings. And, so far, the ORA in their reply have come back and said that, they would be looking for 3.5% attrition increases in 2017 and 2018 or both SoCalGas and SDG&E. So, having said all that, we feel really good about where we're at this point.","Matt Tucker","Great.","Mark Snell","Steven, do you have any comment on that?","Steve Davis","No, I really have nothing more to add. But, again as Dennis pointed out, we concluded our regulatory hearings and we feel very confident in the outcome of those hearings and we look forward to construct a dialogue with parties going forward.","Matt Tucker","All right. Thanks. And, then just one on the LNG side, I thought it was great that you can have the visibility to target the FID on the Cameron expansion. Any sense you can gives us for - do you have targets yet for FIDs on ECA or Port Arthur or can you give us a sense for maybe how far behind they are right now?","Mark Snell","I'll let [ph] Trevor address that.","Trevor Mihalik","Sure. Port Arthur we're probably looking at something in the late 2017, late 2018 timeframe for FID. It does take - it does require a different permitting process, it's environmental impact same as opposed to environmental assessment which takes longer. And obviously we don't have the benefit or the luxury of just a continuation of the existing EPC contract and contractor at Cameron. So that will process with a limitation to bid and what not, will take longer. So late 2017, 2018 timeframe is what we're thinking about Port Arthur. For Costa Azul as we're putting all the key elements in place from regulatory standpoint and from a commercial standpoint that might be a little later than that or at the same timeframe frankly on that one, I'm not confident enough at this point to make a prognostic as to the FID timeframe.","One of the things with respect to ECA is a lot of the regulations are still being developed. So we're not really sure exactly how to go about that process. I mean we've been working with the Mexican government on developing the regulations for LNG exports. So we're still - so to give you a firm date would be really quite difficult, but it is probably more in the Port Arthur timeframe than it is in the trains four and five timeframe.","Matt Tucker","Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks again.","Trevor Mihalik","Okay.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Faisel Khan with Citigroup.","Mark Snell","Hey, Faisel.","Faisel Khan","Hey, good afternoon. Just on the PEMEX, the accretion you guys discussed in your slide from $0.05 to $0.10. So, I guess all I've got so far in that JV is in terms of projects that you're working on are expanding with a JV is the ethane pipeline. So what else is going to sort of drive that joint venture from $0.05 to $0.10? I'm assuming loss from [indiscernible]. That's still in the JV and the same ownership presenters so that doesn't change anything that's going on there.","Well, I will let Joe address the EPS numbers.","Joe Householder","Hey, Faisel. So, most of it is the ethane project coming online but then in addition to that Mark talked a little bit about some of the synergies that we see and in an addition all the cash flow from the business would be accumulating and paying down debt or being available to provide some earnings and that's what's really driving the few cents additional as we go through the time period, but the bulk of it is ethane.","Faisel Khan","Okay. That's a pretty big uptick in earnings just from the ethane project. What's the stats of these lines in the JV, are they running at full capacity or are they - is there a room to grow that having to spend much capital?","Joe Householder","Yeah, actually as I mentioned earlier there's two things that we really didn't put into the EPS guidance, one was the efficiencies that we think we can get from running a whole system together, that's one. And then the two, there is either additional capacity in the lines or capacity that could be added relatively and expensively with compression and we're in the process of marketing some of that capacity to other users. So, other LDCs, power plants and those kinds of things and so we do think that there is upside there. We haven't put that - we haven't calculated that into our EPS estimates of accretion, but there is certainly other things that we think we can get.","Faisel Khan","Okay, got it. Makes sense. And then just on Port Arthur so the sort of relationship here are talking about with the Woodside Petroleum. So, I guess what's the timeline in terms of when you guys decide whether you're going to go forward with the joint venture and I guess therefore market the asset together or what are you guys thinking about it right now. What is the...","Joe Householder","Well, we're actually starting - we are marketing the asset right now, but I'll let Trevor give a little more detail.","Trevor Mihalik","Yeah. Let me be clear, on the marketing side of the asset clearly, we would not have engaged and pursued if we didn't find the interest so it's expert oriented. As we look through what the project now will be structured, then if it is with [indiscernible] side which obviously we hope and are confident it will be, then we together will have to develop the marketing strategy for the asset. So, that's on the marketing side. As far as, what we expect to see going forward, it's really going to be a continuation of the same process. We're looking at the feasibility. We're looking at the economics. There are hurdles that we will have to go through to make sure we go to the next stage. Are we confident we can put together a project that's low cost as it has to be? Are we confident that we can do all of the regulatory permits in all of the local issues we have to deal with?","So, those things will be a hurdle that, we will be overcoming. We're confident we can, but it's tough to give you a timeframe at this point it's very specific. I think, you will see some developments between now and at the end of the year, but I wouldn't want to commit at this point as to what those developments are.","Mark Snell","And, finally you may have missed it on the question before, but we did discuss that we're talking about FID with that project with Port Arthur sort of late 2017 all the way into late 2018 sort of that time - probably in the 2018 timeframe.","Faisel Khan","Okay, understood. Then just on the Cameron expansion just in terms of lowering the cost of the - or providing a sort of lower cost and expansion from the economies of scale. Where do you guys think, that is right now? Especially since you've seen steel cost come down and we've seen, I mean, what - like on a percentage basis like versus what you guys have outlined for this one versus what you're thinking about the expansion, is there any color you can provide on that? Thanks.","Mark Snell","Well, there is a color I could but won't. Look right now, we think we have a very competitive project. We think our costs are some of the lowest in the region. We're marketing that to our advantage and I really don't want to give any more details in that.","Faisel Khan","Okay. Got it. Fair enough. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it.","Okay.","Operator","And we will go next to Mark Barnett with Morningstar Financial Research.","Mark Barnett","Hey, good morning\/good afternoon, everyone.","Mark Snell","Hey, Mark.","Mark Barnett","Hey, you've talked a lot about the PEMEX assets and the PEMEX deal, and some of your pipeline projects and upside today. I'm just wondering given what's taken place over the past few months, six months and what not, how are you looking at the attractiveness of the generation sector in Mexico.","Mark Snell","Well, the generation clearly has been under stress in the U.S. Prices have been relatively low, but in Mexico there are going to be generation opportunities. On the renewable side, I think they will be quite good, they'll be - and obviously we're well positioned to do that and ESJ can be expanded pretty easily. But on the gas power generation side, and especially with respect to combined cycle plants, there will be opportunities to build those under contracts with CFE, but they haven't really been let that out that much in any kind of volume of [indiscernible] one and what we're - we're going to have to kind of wait and see - to see how that market develops. I think what they're doing in Mexico is actually really pretty smart, which is they're building out the gas network first. They're developing a very active gas market one that both CFE and the private sector will participate in to a great degree, and once if that, they have a robust gas market and a good supply network, then I think you'll start to see them let out the opportunities to build more power plants. But I think they definitely are staging at a little bit, and I think rightly so.","Mark Barnett","Yeah, it's definitely been a slow process. I just wonder given that you're positioned already to be a fairly large operator of the gas infrastructure, does that give you some kind of a look into where you are competitive position would be, when those kind of biz do you start to show up?","Mark Snell","Absolutely, I mean I think we are going to be very well positioned to take advantage of those, and I think - we have every intention of doing that. It's just that they have to meet our criteria for having long-term contracts and being solid investments which we expect them to be. But given our infrastructure and our knowledge of the gas pipeline network in Mexico, I think that we will be well positioned to take advantage of those offerings.","Mark Barnett","All right. Thanks.","Mark Snell","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I will turn the call back to Mark Snell for closing remarks.","Mark Snell","Well, thanks again for joining us today. If you have any follow up questions, please feel free to contact the IR team, and have a great day.","Operator","And this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you again for your participation, and have a wonderful day."],"18977":["Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) Q4 2015 Earnings Call February 26, 2016 12:00 PM ET","Executives","Richard A.

Just as a reminder today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to your host for today Mr. Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead sir.","Richard A. Vaccari - Sempra Energy","Good morning, and welcome to Sempra Energy's fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial presentation. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section.","Here in San Diego are several members of our management team, Debbie Reed, Chairman and CEO, Mark Snell, President, Joe Householder, Chief Financial Officer, Martha Wyrsch, General Counsel, Trevor Mihalik, Chief Accounting Officer, Dennis Arriola, Chief Executive Officer of SoCalGas, Jeff Martin, Chief Executive Officer of SDG&E and Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es, President of Sempra LNG.","Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K filed with the SEC.","It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and that will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures.","I'd also like to note that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, February 26, 2016 and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.","With that, please turn to slide four and let me hand the call over to Debbie.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thanks, Rick. Before discussing the quarter, I would like to say a few words about the natural gas leak at our Aliso Canyon storage facility. On February 18, the Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources or DOGGR, confirmed that the leaking well is permanently sealed. Our focus since the beginning has been on safely stopping the leak, reducing the odor from the well, reducing the amount of natural gas being emitted into the environment, working cooperatively with agencies and elected officials and supporting local residents, including providing temporary housing and air filtration system.","Now that we have stopped the leak, an independent investigation of the root cause will be conducted. I want to emphasize that providing safe and reliable service to our customers is the highest priority for SoCalGas. We will continue to work with our regulators and customers to ensure our path ahead reflects these values. Later, I will provide more information on Aliso Canyon, and Dennis and Martha are also here to address your question.","Turning to our financial performance; in 2015, we had very strong results and exceeded our adjusted earnings guidance. This morning, we reported full-year earnings of $5.37 per share, or $5.21 per share on an adjusted basis. Our 2015 results were driven largely by growth in operating earnings at our California Utilities and Sempra International.","In addition, our board approved an increase in the 2016 dividend to $3.02 per share. This payout represents an 8% annual increase and provides dividend growth that more closely aligns with the 11% annual increase in our 2015 adjusted earnings. Moreover, we are targeting annual dividend increases of 8% to 9% over the next several years, to better align our dividend growth with our projected EPS growth. Our dividend strategy is underpinned by confidence in our future cash flows and supports our commitment to return capital to our shareholders.","Regarding 2016 earnings; we have updated our assumptions, and are providing an adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.80 per share to $5.20 per share, when compared with the 2015 results, we forecast a higher effective tax rate for 2016. In part this is due to a large number of benefits recorded last year that related to the resolution of tax matters.","Also as we move into the new GRC cycle at our California utilities, we will now be providing an estimated $60 million of repair allowance tax benefits to ratepayers as part of the standard rate case true-up. In our 2016 adjusted guidance, we assume that we retain all repair allowance benefits for tax years preceding our new GRC.","Key updates and comparison to the 2016 guidance we provided at last year's Analyst Conference reflect several other factors. Notably, we include our best estimate of the GRC decision for the California utilities, based on our settlement agreement, as well as new market assumptions for commodities and foreign exchange rates that have changed considerably since last year.","Additionally, our adjusted guidance range now includes approximately $20 million to $25 million of estimated LNG development expense. Regarding transactions we announced last year, that were additive to our base plan, such as the potential PEMEX acquisition and new renewable contracts, we expect our earnings impacts to largely occur in 2017 and beyond.","Please note that our proposed GRC settlement agreement is subject to CPUC approval and we do not anticipate receiving a final decision until the second quarter. We have moved our Analyst Conference to May in order to incorporate an expected final GRC decision. And we'll provide you with our business unit guidance and longer-term projections at that time.","Overall, we are well-positioned to achieve our long-term strategy of providing earnings growth that is twice that of the average utility but with a moderate risk profile. Combined with strong anticipated growth in the dividend, we are focused on providing top-tier shareholder return.","Now, please turn to slide five. This slide summarizes the key assumptions included in our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance. I will briefly discuss each item and you can find additional detail in the appendix. First, as I mentioned earlier, this year, we include developing costs for our LNG liquefaction and related infrastructure opportunities.","In 2015, we had about $10 million of similar expense that was excluded from adjusted guidance due to uncertainty about the nature and timing of these costs. Given progress on the projects and our estimates of the spend rate and amounts capitalized and shared with partners, we now include a 2016 after-tax expense of roughly $0.08 to $0.10 per share.","Please note, however, that the vast majority of planned expenses targeted for Port Arthur and related infrastructure as we have already incurred most of the upfront costs for Cameron expansion. Going forward, we will be sharing cost for Port Arthur with our partner Woodside. We will nevertheless monitor our progress in securing market commitments and other needed approvals to advance the project. To the extent, our progress is slower than expected, we will adjust our spending accordingly.","Next, we've seen a significant decline in natural gas price forecast over the past year. Specifically, the Cal border 2016 forward curve has fallen from $3.60 in our prior guidance to $2.60 in our new adjusted guidance. The impact from this assumption is a reduction in earnings of approximately $0.05 to $0.07 per share that is associated with the LNG marketing contract from our ECA import facility in Mexico.","Third, we reduced projected earnings from the TDM power plant due to lower power prices and lower expected capacity revenue. This month IEnova decided to hold the assets for sale. The sale would complete our exit from merchant generation and allow IEnova to deploy capital and projects that provide more stable earnings. While we project approximately $0.04 to $0.06 per share of reduced earnings associated with TDM, we do not consider any potential gain or loss from the sale in our adjusted guidance.","Moving to Parent, we assume that we will use dividends from Mexico to participate in a potential IEnova equity offering. We forecast a 2016 earnings benefit from lower repatriation tax expense of between $0.08 and $0.10 per share. Offsetting this impact is an estimated $0.04 per share after-tax of higher interest expense to fund projects in our base plan.","Next, like natural gas prices we have seen exchange rate forecast moved significantly over the past year. Relative to our previous guidance, our current forecast is for the dollar to strengthen in 2016 by an additional 20% against the Chilean currency and by an additional 13% against the Peruvian currency. Projected earnings are reduced by roughly $0.09 to $0.11 per share as a result of translating South American earnings into dollars.","In Mexico, we have not previously forecast the impact of foreign currency effects. We now include in our adjusted guidance a reduction in tax expense associated with peso depreciation during 2016. Based upon the forward curve at year-end, we estimate this benefit to be approximately $0.05 to $0.07 per share. With regard to IEnova's acquisition of PEMEX, this ownership and their shared joint venture, Mexico's Competition Commission has required PEMEX to competitively auction two assets included in the original transaction.","IEnova is negotiating changes to the original agreement with PEMEX that will reflect the auction outcome among other things. Our adjusted guidance assumes that the transaction moves forward with the same assets and closes in the third quarter of 2016. Based on this timing, we assume an estimated $0.02 of accretion this year. Our adjusted guidance excludes however, any potential gain associated with the remeasurement of our investment in the joint venture.","In our Renewables business, we incorporate new forecast for wind resource and availability that reduced earnings by approximately $0.02 per share. However, our base plan now includes 328 megawatts of additional projects announced last year that are under construction. Given that these projects are expected to be in operation by the end of 2016, we expect to see the full earnings impact beginning in 2017.","Finally, for the California utilities, our prior guidance was based on a very conservative assumption that revenues would be based on our current attrition mechanism with no further adjustments. Our new adjusted guidance range includes projected earnings that are more closely aligned with the GRC settlement agreement, and our best estimate of the outcome given the record in the preceding.","Now, let's go to slide six for our business update, beginning with the California utilities. In our general rate case, we are currently expecting to see a proposed decision in March and to receive the final decision in the second quarter. As you recall, we reached a multiparty settlement agreement with the major parties in the case. Until we get a final GRC decision, we will record revenues based upon the authorized revenue requirement in 2015. When we receive the final decision, we will make an adjustment to reflect the retroactive earnings back to January 1, 2016.","Turning to Aliso Canyon; we have received confirmation from DOGGR, the California agency responsible for regulating gas storage, that the leaking well has been permanently sealed. We have approximately 15 Bcf of natural gas in the storage field and the field is stable. Moving forward, an independent engineering firm has been selected by DOGGR and the CPUC to investigate the root cause of the leak. While we do not know how long this process will take, we will cooperate on the investigation and share publicly available data.","Consistent with new rules under development, we are implementing enhanced leak detection and well inspection activities. We are also working cooperatively with all of the agencies involved to determine a path forward for the facility, which is regarded as integral to the reliability of the electric grid in California.","Reflecting the most up-to-date information, which primarily includes revised temporary relocation and well drilling expenses, we now estimate the total costs or amounts to pay (13:45) and those forecasted to be paid to be approximately $330 million. Of this amount approximately 90% is for the temporary relocation program cost to address the leak, and attempts to stop or reduce the emission. The remaining amount includes among other items, the value of lost gas and estimated cost to mitigate the GHG emissions. For the estimate, we assume the relocation period for the majority of residents ended on February 25, as they agreed upon with the City of Los Angeles. We have concluded it is probable that we will receive insurance recovery for the total amount, less retentions of $325 million.","Beyond this estimate, we cannot predict all of the potential categories or total amount of future costs that we may incur as a result of the leak. We have at least four types of insurance policies that provide in excess of $1 billion in insurance coverage. Based upon what we know today and subject to various policy limits, exclusions and conditions, we believe that our insurance should also cover the following categories not included in our estimates. Costs associated with litigation and claims by nearby residents and businesses and in some circumstances depending upon their nature and manner of assessments, fines and penalties. I refer you to our 10-K for further details.","Please turn to slide seven. In Mexico, CFE is tendering several more gas pipelines. IEnova submitted a bid for one pipeline earlier this month, is in process of submitting a bid for second and is preparing to submit a third bid in March. According to CFE estimates, the three pipelines represent an investment opportunity of almost $2 billion, and we expect award dates to occur in March and April. This spring IEnova is also preparing to participate in Mexico's first auction of renewable energy certificates. IEnova is looking at potential solar opportunities and may submit a bid to expand the ESJ wind facility with this joint venture partner InterGen.","The CFE would be the initial off taker under 15-year to 20-year contracts, and total awards could amount to 2,500 megawatt of new power generation. In our LNG business, there have been two noteworthy development. Our Cameron expansion project received its FERC environmental assessment on February 12, and we expect to receive the FERC permit in the second quarter.","Though current market conditions are not ideal, Cameron train 4 is a very competitive market offering for long-term buyers. Based on recent meetings with potential customers, we are bypassing the memorandum of understanding stage and are in negotiations for definitive 20-year sales and purchase agreement.","While our sales and purchase agreement will take longer to execute than an MoU, we are targeting the second half of 2016 for announcing customer agreements needed to launch the project. This approach provides us greater certainty on project commitments, prior to incurring large capital expenditures.","For Port Arthur, yesterday, we signed a joint development agreement with Woodside Petroleum that outlines development roles in the potential project. In addition to how we will share costs and market capacity, the agreement provides a framework for how we will work together technically to design a cost competitive plant.","Last month, I was in Australia meeting with the CEO and senior management of Woodside, and we shared the view that Port Arthur has good market prospect post 2020. Before moving on, remember that we have not incorporated additional LNG or other growth projects in our guidance. We are actively working on development opportunities across our businesses that could provide upside to both our near-term and long-term projection.","With that, please turn to slide eight and Joe will discuss our financial results. Joe?","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Thanks, Debbie. Earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $369 million. On an adjusted basis, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $370 million, or $1.47 per share. Adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter exclude $3 million of expenses related to the development of our proposed LNG liquefaction project.","In addition, in October 2015 an agreement was reached with the SONGS insurance provider for a $400 million payment associated with the failure of the replacement steam generators. Of this amount, SDG&E's share was $80 million. After reimbursement of legal fees and an allocation of $75 million of net proceeds to the ratepayers, our fourth quarter adjusted earnings exclude a $2 million after-tax adjustment to the loss on the SONGS plant closure.","Full year 2015 earnings totaled $1.349 billion, or $5.37 per share. This compares to 2014 earnings of $1.161 billion, or $4.63 per share. On an adjusted basis, 2015 earnings were $5.21 per share. Year-over-year, adjusted earnings grew 11%.","Individual financial results for each of our businesses can be found in the section of our presentation, entitled business unit earnings. I will address the key drivers for our consolidated quarterly results, now on slide nine. Compared to the prior year, fourth quarter earnings include a $48 million seasonality impact that increased earnings of SoCalGas. We call that applying seasonality to earnings of SoCalGas does not affect full year results, instead this fourth quarter variance offset seasonality impacts during the first three quarters of the year.","At Parent, we recorded $21 million of lower tax expense, primarily related to a favorable resolution of prior year's income tax matters and reduced repatriation of dividends from Mexico. The lower tax expense at Parent, along with lower effective tax rates of the California utilities were primary reasons why we exceeded our revised 2015 adjusted guidance that we gave on our third quarter call.","Third, SoCalGas recorded $16 million of higher earnings due to a higher CPUC base margin net of operating expenses and offsetting these factors was $18 million of lower tax expense in South America in 2014, as a result of Peruvian tax reform.","Now, let's conclude. So please turn to slide 10. Overall, we delivered strong financial results in 2015 and exceeded our adjusted guidance. Solid growth in operating earnings and confidence in our long-term cash flows supported our decision to raise the 2016 dividend. In order to better align our future dividend growth with projected EPS growth, we are now targeting annual dividend increases of 8% to 9% over the next several years.","Looking ahead over the next five years, we continue to anticipate earnings growth around twice the level of our utility sector average. Combined with the strong dividend growth, we aim to provide top-tier total shareholder returns.","With that, we will conclude our prepared remarks and start to take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll go first to Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Debbie, I know that it's not \u2013 in the normal course, you usually don't update your five-year earnings growth forecast until the Analyst Day. But can I take from your comments early in your presentation that you still feel like the fundamental building blocks in the prior five-year plan that drove the earnings growth you articulated last February, are still substantively in place?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Greg, I think that's an excellent way to put it actually. If I look at the fundamental building blocks, as you know, our business is based upon long-term contracted and utility asset. And when we lay out our growth rate, the key things that are driving our growth longer-term are Cameron 1 through 3, which is progressing on schedule, on budget and we expect that to come online in 2018, as we've outlined before.","Our Mexican pipelines are now, all except for three of them are actually in operation that are contracted, and so that is going quite well. And then our utility businesses and the fundamentals of our utility businesses as you can see from last year's earnings are very strong. And we would anticipate getting a rate case decision soon and one reason we want to hold off providing any numeric guidance is that we want to get that rate case decision and then be able to go through as we always do with you at the Analysts Meetings the details.","The other thing I'd just comment on is, our board felt that there is great visibility to our growth. And since it's long-term contracted in utility, they were very comfortable, setting an 8% to 9% target for our dividend increases over the next several years. And I think that is a really strong statement in our sector to be able to grow your dividend at that kind of rate.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Right. And that's up from the last articulated target of 6%, correct?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yes. We had talked before of about 6% growth rate in the dividend and now we're talking about 8% to 9% over the next several years.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Shifting gears to Aliso. You've articulated what your estimate is relative to the line items you've laid out. As we go forward here and we think about the path to understanding whether or not there will be further costs as they relate to fines or penalties. Which of the primary agencies that will be reviewing the safety, efficacy, performance of the plant? And if there were to be fines or penalties, in what categories would they potentially fall and who would be the agency that would be deciding whether or not to implement them?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Well, let me just start by saying that the key agencies that are doing the investigation are the Department of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources or DOGGR, and the CPUC. And they're now beginning the investigatory phase to see what's happening on the leak.","I'm going to refer to Martha regarding the whole scope of agencies that would be involved and how we deal with fines and penalties. I will say though that there haven't been any that have been assessed. So, it's kind of hard to estimate anything. Martha?","Martha Brown Wyrsch - Sempra Energy","Thank you, Debbie. That's correct. The DOGGR and the California PUC are the primary agencies that would be \u2013 are investigating, and would potentially fine the company for what they discover in the investigation. And as Debbie said in her remarks earlier, our insurance coverage is quite broad with the four insurance policies that we have, and we do believe that in certain circumstances and depending on the nature and manner of the assessment, that insurance should cover fines and penalties.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Last question, in the California utilities bucket of things that have changed, I just wanted to be clear on my understanding. The first thing that's changed \u2013 has changed is or one of the things that's changed is you're no longer budgeting for $60 million of repair allowance and tax benefits. But the other thing that's changed is you've updated your assumptions for to take into account what you believe the impact is of the underlying economics of the settlement. Are those the two major changes?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Greg, that's correct. As we've looked at this, we told you last March that, when \u2013 under the rate case process that when we go through the rate case process, that there will be a true-up on this repairs allowance, and that was approximately $60 million. So, our earnings would be reduced for that going into 2016 in our utilities. But then we've reached this rate case settlement and when we've laid out kind of our guidance for 2016, our assumptions are and our range is that something similar to the rate case settlement would be adopted, and that's what we would anticipate.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Let me, Debbie this is...","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","$60 million is after-tax right?","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Hey Greg, Greg...","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Sorry.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yes, because it's a tax item, but Joe wants to say something.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Yeah. Greg, this is Joe. I just want to make sure just to be clear for you and others, the $60 million was taken into account in the guidance we gave you last year for 2016. So that's not something that was new in our new introduced guidance today, but the GRC settlement was new, but the $60 million was in last year's number.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. So $60 million was baked into the February guidance number? Thank you.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Yeah. But it's important to understand because it's a difference going from 2015 to 2016. So it's a critical item to understand.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Got you. Thank you. I'll get off now. Thanks.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Okay.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","We'll move next to Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Hi, good morning. Apologize to answer. To ask a question that you probably don't want to directly answer right now, but just you're on the one hand saying the 8% to 9% -","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yes, can you hear me?","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Yeah, I can hear you now.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Now we can hear you. We honestly did not cut you off.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","We can hear you now.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","You might regret that you didn't after I ask this question. But so just on the long-term growth rate, so we have two data points today. We have twice the utility average, and we have 8% to 9% dividend growth that better aligns with long-term earnings growth. Is it fair to say the 8% to 9% is not a view of your long-term earnings growth?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yes, that's fair to say. I mean I'll answer that question. And I'll give you a \u2013 I'll use 2015 as an example. We grew 11% in 2015, we increased our dividend by 8%. So I would not link the two directly together. What I would look at is, what are the fundamentals of the growth drivers? And the fundamentals of the growth drivers are Cameron getting online on time, our utilities performing well and our Mexican pipelines being constructed and in service and all of that is going quite well.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, great. And then on the Cameron 4 update and the decision to move to directly to a contracting as opposed to an MoU, could you just maybe give a little bit more color on why you're doing that, and is that something the customers want or is that something that's better for you so you don't have to commit as much up front? I wasn't sure I understood the rationale there.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Sure. I'm going to ask Oct\u00e1vio to cover that, but what I would say is, we see it as better for us, because we do have a timeframe by which we have to commit to get Cameron in service and maintain continuous construction. So actually getting the sales and purchase agreements done and have definitive agreement is a real positive for us, so this is something we like to have in place.","Oct\u00e1vio why don't you have a talk about it from the customer perspective as well.","Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es - Sempra LNG Corp","Sure. Thank you. The reason why is because as Debbie indicated, we have a timeframe that's tight and we're trying to take advantage of the long-term pricing that we have from our EPC contractor. So going through an MoU, we'd (30:58) create an additional step that might drag that schedule. And as you know, given the way, we structure our deals on the LNG. We're not just selling cargos for a price, which would be a much easier sale. We're actually putting together deals that deal with low commodity risk and essentially long contracting capacity for the liquefaction, so we have to speak a lot to our customers about the upstream conditions, where the gas comes from, where it's delivered, how it's delivered and those tend to be more complicated sessions.","And as a result, we've all decided to go forward. It wasn't just us, the customers also decided to go that way. So the people we're talking to at this point, we've all agreed to pursue the supply purchase agreements and gas supply agreements as part of our discussions in order for later in the year to have the full commitment to take the commitments we need to make on the capital side to launch the project.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, great. And one last question on Aliso. Could you maybe just talk a little bit more about the \u2013 and I know this is hard without the root cause analysis. But one is, the potential scenarios of fixes for the future. And then I guess the second question is, it does seem like Aliso is a critical facility for reliability in California. Could you talk a little bit about that issue and this conflict with some people wanting it not to start up?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Sure. I'm going to have Dennis address that. What I will say is that the DOGGR has come out with a new set of rules that we're already implementing, and that they are very, very parallel to what we filed a few years back in our rate case for our program that's called Storage Integrity Management Program or SIMP. And so, I think that there are processes and things that we actually envisioned and already had filed for in our rate case that would allow us to safely operate this field going forward.","Dennis, do you want to address further?","Dennis V. Arriola - Southern California Gas Co.","Sure. Good morning, Steve. Yes. As Debbie talked about our SIMP program and you know at the utilities we have an acronym for everything. But we actually started on a pilot program back in 2014, even before we got an approval. And as you know, we have requested within our general rate case for additional funding for our Storage Integrity Management Program. So that, we're waiting for the final decision there.","As far as the importance of Aliso and just gas storage in general to both gas and electric reliability, I think it's been very clear with a lot of the comments by both policy and regulatory leaders, especially coming from the California Energy Commission as well as the PUC that it's vital that we have safe and reliable gas storage to support not just gas demand, but especially in the Los Angeles basin electric reliability as well.","So, we're pleased to see that even in the visit that Department of Energy, Secretary Moniz, when he came out and visited, he reemphasized the importance of making sure that obviously, the facilities are safe, but that we have been back online in order to support both gas and electric reliability. So we know that there is, as Debbie mentioned, there is a full process that's been approved by DOGGR on their comprehensive safety review, we're working very closely with them on that. There is also some legislation that's been presented that, so far is open to amendments to incorporate as a process that DOGGR has laid out. So we're optimistic that sounder minds now from a policy, regulatory and political side recognize the importance of getting Aliso back online as safely and as expeditiously as possible.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Moving on to Neel Mitra of Tudor, Pickering.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hi good morning.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Hi, Neel.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","It's been awhile since we've gotten an update on Mexico. Obviously, you have three bids coming up that are pretty important. Could you just comment on the competitive environment there, and what you're seeing and possible opportunities beyond just the CFE pipes at this point?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Sure, and I'll have Mark talk about some of the upcoming bids, but what \u2013 a couple of things I've said before and I'll say again in terms of Mexico and the key thing for us is that we have a really great set of assets in Mexico, that are expandable assets that have additional growth potential.","And so, these bids are very important to expand the infrastructure that we own there, but they are not the only way that we can grow in Mexico. And Mexico now have some pipeline bids that are going to be coming for us very soon, we've talked about the three that are out for bid right now, there will be others that will come out later this year.","Mexico is also going out for bids for about 2,500 megawatts of renewables. And we have our ESJ plant operational there, that has the availability to expand by about a 1,000 megawatt. So, we think that's a great opportunity and then at Mexico is looking at going into other areas of bidding with electric transmission and electric generation. So, there's bidding but there is also growth potential that occurs from the great asset base that we have there. Mark, do you want to talk about kind of the bids and...","Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy","Sure, Debbie. There is \u2013 as you know there is three pipelines right now that are currently under that we have submitted bids for and we're awaiting the determination. In total, it's roughly a couple of billion dollars' worth of work. We think, we're well positioned for it, but as you've seen there are \u2013 there has been some increased competition for some of these pipeline bids, but we're sticking to our kind of strategy of targeting kind of high single-digit IRRs and we're really looking to try to pick up these ones that we think fit our \u2013 that fit our profile and what we're looking for and obviously, we're interested in these at the right price.","But I think the most important thing is Debbie's point is on the opportunities around our existing pipeline footprint, which, just to remind everyone, we are the largest pipeline operator in Mexico. We're very well-positioned, not only for this new work, but to expand those opportunities and start building laterals into other industrialized areas. And so, we see the opportunity for IEnova in Mexico for continued growth.","And I think we've all seen some of the comments on PEMEX over the last few days and their desire to raise additional capital and to think about selling some of their additional assets, we're very well poised to take advantage of those opportunities, our relationships there are very strong. And so, we're very optimistic about IEnova's growth potential.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. So to summarize really basically, you believe that there's a lot of lateral opportunities just beyond the CFE pipes which you can service off of your existing infrastructure. Is that the right way to think about it?","Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy","Yes. That and also \u2013 and eventually additional capacity through compression on a lot of the lines that we currently operate.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Got it. And then moving to the GRC settlement, the extension from Q1 to Q2. Is there anything to read into that bonus depreciation, extension, et cetera? Do you feel comfortable with the settlement at this point? Or any thoughts on that?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. I mean we feel comfortable, but we're going to get a decision, proposed decision in the March timeframe. I mean that's what we're looking at. And the issue of bonus depreciation was part of the litigation in the record of the rate case and the settlement was made understanding that there was some potential for extension of that. So we think that the settlement is \u2013 we think it's likely to get adopted. And we think that we should have a decision hopefully sometime in the second quarter.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, good afternoon.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Hi Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. So just following up a little bit more on the Aliso conversation, can you elaborate a little bit more on thoughts on next steps just both from a regulatory process? But perhaps, more importantly from an operational perspective, how do you think about getting the asset back in the service? And then also, how do you think about your own investment plan in light of what may be required out of that regulatory process, and or working around any limitations on the Aliso Canyon asset itself?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah, let me just take a comment on that and then I'm going to refer to Dennis on coming back into operation. I think one thing that's quite positive is that when we filed our rate case we had actually filed for a program that would do internal inspections of wells and some of the things that has now happened on pipelines. And we filed for a program that would do that for storage facilities. And that in the rate case settlement, we ended up with two-way balancing account that would allow us to make those kinds of investments to do the review of the storage wells and go through them on a programmed planned kind of a basis, which is what we had proposed. But getting that all in place now and getting the facility operational for injection season, we've been spending a lot of time looking at how we use that program, which is basically aligned with what the Department of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources or DOGGR has kind of outlined as well. So Dennis why don't you kind of talk about what we're doing now with Aliso and all of our storage facilities there.","Dennis V. Arriola - Southern California Gas Co.","Good morning, Julien. Let me start with Aliso and it's kind of really a two-pronged approach. First is, we're, obviously, as Debbie mentioned, we're cooperating with the investigation that's being led by DOGGR and the CPUC and they have an independent expert on the outside, a company call Blade Energy Partners. And so we're supporting them and they're really driving the time schedule there. So whatever time it takes for them to do their work and to issue the report, will kind of take its own path. But as far as getting the field back into service, as I mentioned DOGGR has issued its comprehensive safety review that we're working with them on. And it's very detailed process of testing, inspecting if necessary repairs.","And as Debbie mentioned, it really does, it's very parallels, what we had put in place as far as our SIMP program and what we're doing from a pilot standpoint. So, we're working to expeditiously implement that. It's hard to tell at this point in time how long it will take us to get through all of the 115 wells. But the way that the program is put together, it does allow us once we've accomplished a minimum threshold of tests on all the wells, we can start bringing some of the wells on. We don't have to do complete work on a 100% of those. We can isolate or abandon certain wells and bring on the other wells at the same time.","So, we'll be giving further updates on that down the road, but I think the key points there is, again, policy makers, the regulators and we're very closely working with all of these. So that they understand what could happen, both here in the summer from electric reliability standpoint and from a gas standpoint. We're all really working together to make sure that Aliso and all of our gas storage facilities are safe and reliable. And they can service our customers.","We're also \u2013 there also is an emergency regulation that was put in place by DOGGR, is that applies to all gas storage facilities, not just Aliso. And so we're complying with that as well. And that includes things such as daily pressure reads, testing the wellhead valves, and some other procedures that have to be put in place. So there's a lot going on, we've got a people at all of our facilities. And we're focused on again doing this as expeditiously and as safely as possible.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Great, excellent. And just quickly following up on one of the last questions, with respect to the decision to move from an MoU to just an outright contract. Let me just be very clear about this. Your confidence level is higher incrementally or you said, obviously less ideal market backdrop, but moving in that step, I would presume to be a statement of comfort that indeed this is moving forward. But I don't want to put words in your mouth either.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. I mean there is no question that the market is tougher than it was when we signed Cameron 1 through 3. But Oct\u00e1vio has been negotiating with some very strong counterparties and they want to go to sales and purchase agreement, we want to go to sales and purchase agreement. That would allow us more comfort in starting to spend money on the facility, because it kind of lays out all the terms and as long as long you meet those terms, then they are obligated. And an MoU doesn't have that same level of obligation.","So, I think getting these sales and purchase agreement signed, would give us a lot of confidence and being able to move forward with the facility later this year. Oct\u00e1vio, do you want to add anything to that?","Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es - Sempra LNG Corp","No, I think that we're pretty much as Debbie indicated, it's good that we're moving in this direction, obviously the counterparties are using resources that are expensive, whether it's a law firms or their internal resources. So there's interest involved in this. As you know this is a facility that's not selling into the current market, it's a facility that's going to sell into market 2020 plus. And it's going to be one of the lowest, if not the lowest facility at that point in time to deliver LNG to a time where just about anyone agrees, there is going to be a shortage of supply.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Citi's Faisel Khan has our next question.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, good afternoon.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Hi, Faisel.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, Just the decision to expense some of the LNG development expenses, was that for Port Arthur or was that for Cameron's trains 4 and 5?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Most of the \u2013 the majority of the $20 million to $25 million is for Port Arthur and it's to do the work that's necessary to design enough of the facility where you can price it so you can market it. And that is engineering and legal cost and all. And then legal cost associated with the sales and purchases agreements for Cameron, and then the related facilities, the pipelines and storage and all of that integrate with that. That's what's most of the costs are. And they're expensed because those are the accounting rules, once we get contracts signed, then we would expect that this expense to not be part of our ongoing guidance, because we'll spend the funds once. And once we get contract signed then we will begin capitalization of the substantial part of the project costs.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, got you. And then in terms of as you enter into these negotiations for train 4, what are the hurdle rates you're looking at in terms of a return on capital for the project? Is it similar to the IRRs you were talking about with the Mexico pipeline that are 9% or is it higher? How do you guys look at the returns?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","We don't share that, because we're still negotiating with customers. But we always look at what our cost of capital is on a risk adjusted basis. And that we would have a reasonable return for that. So I mean, that's the way we would be looking at it, and our returns tend to be in the high-single digits, low-double digits for most of our projects so.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. And then could you remind us on the pipelines in Mexico, the tariffs are in dollar denominated terms. Is that correct, or am I or some of them in peso terms?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","In Mexico, our tariffs are in dollars, but we pay taxes in pesos. And so that's why we have the FX issue in Mexico, which usually has recently as always been in our favor in Mexico.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","So it just happens to be a coincidence that the tax benefit in Mexico offsets the currency depreciation in Chile and Peru?","Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy","It's a little more than a coincidence. There usually a some relation to currency valuations around the world, but it has been more of a one-for-one offset in the past, it has disconnected a little bit as we've moved forward.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Faisel, this is Joe, I'll just add on to Mark's comment. The FX benefit in Mexico, doesn't have to do with the tariffs, because all of these dollar denominated contracts and our dollar denominated business is really the functional currency and that's how we operate in Mexico, but we have to pay our taxes in pesos. And the Mexican tax rules require that we have FX adjustments related to our monetary assets and then taking into account inflation. And so, as these currencies kind of move in a similar direction against the U.S. dollar, we get this natural hedge, natural offset.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, I think that makes sense. And then when you talk about your guidance though for 2016, you're talking about a further depreciation in some of these currencies, or are you just looking at the forward rates? I just wanted to make sure I understood that language.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. Joe, why don't you kind of walk through that?","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Yeah, let me walk through that Faisel, because I think this is important for everybody to understand and we talk about it from time-to-time. But we have some really, really well run utilities in South America, and over time, those have done extremely well and you can look back to the early 2000s. They've done very well over time and we like those assets a lot. But they are local currency run companies and their revenues are in local currency. And so, we've seen a depreciation against the U.S. dollar because we have to translate those into dollars of about 15% to 20%, since last year's plan.","So when we did the 2016 plan last year and showed you a number, those currencies have depreciated 15% to 20%, and there's to some degree, some offset in our tariffs and they catch up over time because we have adjustments in our tariffs. But we've adjusted the revenues or the net earnings from those companies for that change in FX rates from a year ago to the ones we have now. In Mexico, the tax expense I was just referring to a moment ago that's an annual adjustment kind of it goes from what was the peso at the beginning of the year to what it's going to be at the end of the year. And I think Debbie mentioned in her remarks that we haven't had this in our planning in the past. And the reason is we're not allowed to under accounting \u2013 GAAP accounting rules, we're not allowed to kind of forecast that.","So, with this year, we put it in the plan because we know that the Mexican pesos forecasted to move about 3.5%. And so, we forecasted a change in our tax expense for that 3.5%. And so in 2016, we see a little bit of loss there. In 2015, we actually had earnings as a result of this. We had $31 million increase at Mexico and a $20 million decrease in South America, so we had $11 million plus. So again in 2013-2014, it was neutral and between 2015 and 2016 that is going to be kind of neutral. These things don't move the needle very much for us. They're pretty small.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's very clear and I appreciate that. Last question for me. On the Renewables segment, just \u2013 and this is a small number, but if I look at the topline revenues in your Table F (52:19) sort of year-over-year, they are down. I'm just trying to understand why. I know that there's a lot of stuff below the line including tax and gains on asset sale and stuff like that they tend to move the needle \u2013 tend to move the earnings. But on the top line, I would suspect that that number would be relatively stable. So I'm just trying to understand why it would be down year-over-year.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah, I'm going to have Trevor go through that.","Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy","Sure. Faisel, what's really happening there is some of that is really the assets that have been dropped into the joint venture structures. And so there is certain assets that we owned a 100% in 2014 that are now owned 50% and then are picked up through the equity method of accounting.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Got it. It makes sense. Thanks guys for the time. I appreciate it.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thanks, Faisel.","Operator","We'll move on to Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. One question on LNG, and less about your contracting and maybe more about just the broader LNG markets. I mean if you read the stuff that comes out of a lot of the economic consulting firms or other folks, they tend to talk about how the LNG market is oversupplied. And so that would imply that it would be a headwind for any new LNG development. And yet it seems with some of the things you talk about at Cameron 4 and Port Arthur that your views and your actions and potential growth are contrary to that. Just curious if you could talk a little bit about the global LNG market, what you see for the near term and what you see for the long term?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Sure, I'm going to ask Oct\u00e1vio to answer that, but what I want to ask \u2013 to raise to you, is a lot of this is a about timeframe, and that what you read about is the current LNG market is seen as being oversupplied. What you also read about is that beginning in the 2020 period, and beyond there is a need in the marketplace for more LNG. So, now part of it is the timing of these things. So, if you were having a non-contracted project coming on today, that might be a real challenge. If you have a project coming on, when there is a market need, and that market need grows over time, then that's a very different market that you're going after. So, Oct\u00e1vio, why don't talk about the broad market and then how we feel that our facilities are going to compete in that market?","Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es - Sempra LNG Corp","Again, a bit of (54:51) introduction to the timeframe issue. The one thing that we need to start looking at is the current market is oversupplied as you indicated, no discussion about that, but we also have a little problem with the current market. We have an oversupplied market and yet the spot cargoes are more expensive than the long-term pricing, which was agreed in the tight market. So market is broken in its pricing formulas, and the market is adjusting to it as we speak and will adjust for the next couple of years.","But our focus is not the current market. Our focus is 2020 as I've indicated, where you'll see that the current oversupply would we absorbed and then there is a shortage and unfortunately or fortunately, depending on your point of view, these facilities take five years, six years to come online once you decide to go forward. And as a result, we need to make decisions today to meet that demand. It is difficult to make. It's large capital investments when a lot of the big players are taking write-downs because of oil, that's the condition why the market is tough. Some of the buyers are confused by the oversupply, but our focus is not the current market.","So globally, unless you believe we're going to switch everything from gas to coal and oil which would increase our carbon footprint significantly and it seems like the winds are the other way around, if you do believe that we are going forward, not only with a continuous economic growth, but with a change to a lower carbon footprint, then gas is going to play a role not just in the current markets but in other markets that are yet to open.","One interesting statistics I heard this week at CERA Week was the fact that the lower demand from Korea and Japan was made up by increased demand in Middle East countries and therefore the demand didn't go away, and that was not there in the earlier projection. So globally, where our projects fit? We're comfortable. It is a tough market for people to make decisions when they're under significant pressure. But we think, we are offering to the market the lowest cost producing facility for 2020, and that's why the interest is there.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And I remember at one of your investor meetings, you outlined where your facilities, I think it was your last Analyst Day. You outlined where your facilities sit on a cost curve relative to other global LNG facilities. Just curious, given the fact that Port Arthur is greenfield and Cameron was brownfield, the thing that surprised us back then and still does a little bit now is that they are so close to each other on that dispatch curve in compared to some of the others. How are you thinking about, how the economics of Port Arthur as a greenfield would differ from some of the disclosures you've given previously on Cameron 1 through 3?","Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es - Sempra LNG Corp","That's a very good question and I'll be happy to bring up another topic that sometimes gets forgotten. In the economics of the \u2013 pardon me, in the Cameron based project we included $1 billion of the cost of the existing facilities which is essentially replacement value. So the economics of Cameron in that chart you saw at Analyst Day, as well as all the other charts included the value of existing facilities. And so what we're doing with Woodside and Port Arthur is looking at ways to break some of the paradigms in the industry, keep it as safe and reliable as we want it to be as the customers expect it to be, but look at ways to reduce cost.","Just like we found when we did Cameron, that we had the lower cost per ton for conventional technology of liquefaction. We have an even lower price for the expansion of Cameron for trains 4 and 5 and we expect to achieve similar results with Port Arthur. If we don't find that we can do that then, Port Arthur is not going to go away. We simply believe that the industry has to be going back to a discipline of developing the next lowest marginal cost available of supply in order to be sustainable.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you Oct\u00e1vio, much appreciated.","Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es - Sempra LNG Corp","You're welcome.","Operator","We'll go next to Feliks Kerman of Visium Asset Management.","Ashar Khan - Visium Asset Management, LP","Hi this is Ashar, how are you guys doing?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Hi, Ashar.","Ashar Khan - Visium Asset Management, LP","Debbie, I just wanted to \u2013 there's a little bit of confusion, a lot of calls going on today. But if I'm correct, I heard you say in your prepared remarks, and please correct me if I'm wrong, that the goal is still to meet or exceed previous expectations set. Is that correct?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","I'm not sure what expectations you're referring to. What we're very focused on is that the growth that we have outlined for you in our plans is long-term contracted growth or in our utility. And that what we put in our base plan is things that we already have under contract and then expected utility performance. What we expect to do is over the next five years, we expect to add projects to that. And this last year alone, we added 325 megawatts of renewables that will come online late this year. We've added or will be adding when the transaction closes the PEMEX acquisition and that was not part of our base plan a year ago.","So, our expectations are that we're not going to sit still, we're going to continue to develop and grow our business. And that what we show you though in terms of our growth is and when we get to our Analyst Conference, we will do what we always do which is the blue box and the green box. That shows you what we have contracted and what's basically in our utilities as projects approved or in our rate case. And then we show you what we're working on that could add to that growth over the five-year period of time and we'll be doing the same thing for you this year.","Ashar Khan - Visium Asset Management, LP","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go to Morningstar's Mark Barnett next.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Hi, Mark.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research","Thanks for all the comments on the LNG market today. I did want to ask one more question about Mexico. And I know that some of the pressure on PEMEX does create an opportunity in the \u2013 some of the assets they might be looking to offload. But I'm wondering if you know, you see beyond maybe this current slate of projects some headwinds just from the lower oil revenues from the Mexican government, and maybe if you could talk about how you see that balance of opportunity versus challenge?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah, I mean honestly, when you talk to our CEO in Mexico, he sees it as an opportunity, because the whole reason for a reform was to bring capital into Mexico to build the kind of infrastructure that they need for the kind of growth. And you have to realize, Mexico is going to be more competitive, the lower the energy prices are in the long term for them, that has been kind of their stumbling block on being globally competitive.","So to the degree that they can use other party's capital and that would be us, I mean, we'd like to put our capital there and as if they can build the infrastructure that reduces their energy cost that they're moving forward on that basis. And so we think that, I think it's a struggle for PEMEX, with having being reliant on oil revenues, but it's an opportunity for us to come in and build things that wouldn't otherwise be built and that are needed as part of their long term Mexican infrastructure. So, that's kind of the way we look at it. Mark do you want to?","Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy","Yeah, I would just \u2013 let me just add to that too. I think that the \u2013 when we talk about energy reforms in Mexico, I think a lot of folks are focused on the reforms at PEMEX and they haven't seen increases in production and some of the things that they expected to see from energy reform and I think that's entirely the fault of $30 oil, and very little to do with the reforms, what are coming out of the reforms is a massive amount of energy infrastructure within the company, within the country and that infrastructure is doing exactly what it's supposed to do, as Debbie said, it's lowering energy costs, bringing natural gas in the regions of the country that didn't have access to it before, it's making \u2013 it's really making a big difference on lowering electricity costs across the country, and that's working very, very well.","And to the extent that low gas or low oil prices are hindering some of the reforms at PEMEX, I think that again is creating a large opportunity for us, because it increases the need for PEMEX for capital. It gives opportunities for us to look at the assets that they are going to be putting up for sale. And so, from our perspective, I think we think that the reforms are working very much as intended, and that we will continue to benefit as being one of the best placed companies in the country to take advantage of those opportunities.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research","Okay. And with the latest round of bids, I apologize if I missed it in your comments. I mean you gave the bid dates, do you have an estimate for when you might expect the results from the bidding process?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","They were looking at \u2013 they haven't given any specific dates, but probably in the March and April timeframe, is most likely.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research","Okay. Right. That's all from me. Thanks a lot.","Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy","Thanks.","Operator","And it appears we have no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Debbie Reed for closing remarks.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Well, thanks again, for all of you joining us today, and all of your excellent questions.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead, sir.","Richard A. Vaccari","Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, we'll be discussing Sempra Energy's second quarter 2014 financial results. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section.","With us today in San Diego are several members of our management team: Debbie Reed, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Snell, President; Joe Householder, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Martha Wyrsch, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and Trevor Mihalik, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer.","Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and that we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our second quarter 2014 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. I'd also like to note that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, August 7, 2014, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.","With that, please turn to Slide 3 and let me hand the call over to Debbie.","Debra L. Reed","Thanks, Rick, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. On this call, we will discuss our second quarter financial results and provide you with key operating and regulatory updates. This morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $269 million or $1.08 per share. Together with the outlook for the second half of the year, we expect to be at or above the midpoint of our 2014 guidance.","Given our strong operating performance and success in delivering planned projects on schedule, combined with the progress we're making on capturing some of those additional development opportunities, we are on track to achieve our 9% to 11% growth rate through 2019.","Notably, our Cameron Liquefaction project has achieved several key milestones, and we expect to begin construction this year as planned. On June 19, we received our FERC order, and yesterday, we executed the financing documents and made the final investment decision with our partners.","In Mexico, IEnova is on schedule to place and service the first phases of the Sonora and Los Ramones pipelines by year-end. We are extremely proud that since January 2013, IEnova is the best performing IPO in the Americas and the second best-performing IPO worldwide.","In Peru, commissioning of the Santa Teresa Hydro project will begin this month.","In the U.S., REX East-to-West loads of 1.8 Bcf per day are now fully contracted. Also, this past week, we signed a power purchase agreement with Edison for a 94-megawatt expansion at our Copper Mountain Solar facility.","On the regulatory front, our California utilities received a positive final PSEP decision in June. We are also continuing to work on the development projects that could provide additional upside to our 5-year plan and sustain our superior growth rate. Examples include LNG, natural gas pipelines, renewables and hydro in Peru and we will talk about these projects later in the call.","Now let me hand things to Joe to discuss the second quarter results in more detail starting with Slide 4. Joe?","Joseph A. Householder","Thanks, Debbie. Sempra's second quarter consolidated earnings were $269 million or $1.08 per share. This compares to adjusted earnings of $258 million or $1.04 per share in the same quarter last year.","Moving to guidance. As Debbie just mentioned, we now expect to be at or above the midpoint of our 2014 guidance of $4.25 per share to $4.55 per share. Let me elaborate a bit on what this guidance range includes. Consistent with our development and partnership model for renewables, we include the promote we recorded on the CMS 3 project in the first quarter and the promote we will record on ESJ next quarter for the formation of these joint ventures. We also now include the $9 million additional charge we recorded in the first quarter related to the SONGS settlement agreement. However, we do not include any possible gain on the sale of the remaining block of our Mesquite combined cycle power plant, nor do we include anything for the tax reform proposals being discussed in Chile.","Before proceeding to earnings for each of the business units, I would like to also mention one timing-related factor I discussed on last quarter's call. Remember that in the first quarter of 2013, we recorded a $63 million deferred tax expense related to the IEnova IPO restructuring. In the first quarter of 2014, we recorded $12 million of estimated deferred tax expense to reflect a portion of the planned repatriation for this year. We recorded another $12 million of deferred tax expense in the second quarter of 2014. Our estimated annual tax rate reflects the recording of deferred tax expense each quarter in accordance with the full year as planned repatriation.","Now let's turn to Slide 5 for details on SDG&E. At SDG&E, earnings for the second quarter were $123 million, up from adjusted earnings of $115 million in the second quarter of 2013. We are really very pleased with this result as the increase was due primarily to higher CPUC-based margin and improved operating performance.","Please turn to Slide 6. For SoCalGas, second quarter earnings were $80 million. Compared with the second quarter of 2013, SoCalGas had $9 million in higher CPUC-based margin and improved operating results. Offsetting items included a higher tax benefit in the second quarter of last year and certain cost to our Pipeline and Safety Enhancement Plan, or PSEP. Specifically, we incurred $6 million of PSEP costs in prior periods that were denied recovery in the final PSEP decision.","Now let's move to Sempra International on Slide 7. At our South American utilities, second quarter earnings were $42 million, up from earnings of $34 million in the second quarter of 2013. The increase was due in part to higher operating earnings from growth in customers and energy sales combined with reduced costs. In addition, we had a $4 million loss in the second quarter of last year from the sale of our investments in Argentina.","For Sempra Mexico, second quarter earnings were $34 million versus earnings of $26 million in the same period last year. $11 million of AFUDC equity earnings in the second quarter largely accounts for this increase. As you will recall, we began recording AFUDC equity on the Sonora pipeline since it is an asset that has a regulated rate of return and qualifies for regulatory accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP. Partially offsetting the AFUDC earnings was the effect of foreign currency translation on deferred tax balances in the second quarter of 2013.","Now please turn to Slide 8. At Sempra U.S. Gas & Power, the Natural Gas segment earned $4 million in the second quarter of 2014. Second quarter earnings are lower this year compared with last year due primarily to mark-to-market gains on our gas storage positions in the second quarter of 2013. Second quarter earnings for the Renewable segment were $18 million versus $15 million in the same period last year. The increase is largely attributable to higher operating performance and deferred tax benefits for assets currently being placed in service.","With that, let me hand the call back to Debbie to discuss Slide 9.","Debra L. Reed","Thanks, Joe. Now we will give you an update on our major businesses starting with LNG. As I mentioned earlier, on June 19, we received the FERC order authorizing construction and operation of our Cameron Liquefaction project. In July, FERC provided Cameron with a notice to proceed on site separation activities. Now that all FERC hurdles have been cleared, the only remaining significant regulatory step is receipt of the final DOE non-FTA permit, and we expect to receive this permit and begin construction later this year as planned.","Yesterday, with our partners, we also executed the financing documents and completed all requirements for making the final investment decision, commonly referred to as FID. Financing commitments for the project totaled $7.4 billion and will be provided by JBIC and a group of 29 international commercial banks, some of whom are insured by NEXI. Cameron received 16-year financing and highly competitive pricing due to the quality of its lenders, sponsors and customers. The transaction represents one of the largest project financings in U.S. history.","Now please turn to Slide 10. At our Analyst Conference in March, we discussed our interest in growing our LNG business. We are continuing efforts in this area with an initial focus on expanding existing assets. For our Cameron facility, now that we have reached FID, we will begin working with our partners to complete the development plans and initiate the FERC process for trains 4 and 5. We believe the Cameron expansion will be one of the lower cost alternatives, especially when compared to greenfield development. Our ECA LNG plant in Mexico is also well situated from a market perspective as the only brownfield facility on the West Coast. We are focused on determining the critical path items that would influence the feasibility and size of a potential export facility at ECA. These include issues around gas supply and delivery, customer interest, existing contracts and regulatory requirements. A positive development is that Mexican energy reform legislation now includes a basic framework for private sector LNG export.","In addition to ECA, we are assessing design options and feasibility for our potential Port Arthur facility in Texas. We will provide updates on our progress periodically and are optimistic about our ability to grow our LNG business with Sempra's existing assets and capabilities.","Now please turn to Slide 11. Our U.S. Gas & Power business has 2 other projects update. On the REX pipeline, the 1.8 Bcf per day of existing East-to-West capacity is now fully contracted. REX put a portion of this capacity in service in June, and the full capacity will be in service by next summer. All of this capacity, except 0.2 Bcf per day, represents the capture of development opportunities additional to our 5-year plan.","On July 31, U.S. Gas & Power also executed a power purchase agreement with Edison for a 94-megawatt expansion of our Copper Mountain Solar complex. For this project, we would expect to achieve commercial operation by the end of 2016 and have a 50% ownership share. Under the agreement, Edison would purchase power beginning in 2020.","Now please turn to Slide 12. Moving to Sempra Mexico. The initial phases of the Sonora and Los Ramones pipelines are both on budget and on schedule to be in service by year-end. Each represents an investment of around $500 million. IEnova secured financing in June for the 155-megawatt ESJ wind project, and in July, they finalized the sale of 50% of the project to Energen.","Regarding development projects under Mexico's 5-year infrastructure plan, official bid documents for the first 2 natural gas pipelines have been published. The first project is about 155 miles and will eventually connect with one of the proposed pipelines to be constructed in the United States. The second project is about 260 miles in northern Mexico. Tenders for these projects are due in October, and IEnova is preparing to participate in both bids. The 2 projects together would likely represent investments of over $1 billion.","In addition to these 2 projects, 3 pipelines in the U.S. and 5 more pipelines in Mexico are planned to be tendered in 2014. Opportunities in other sectors will also be bolstered by the energy reform efforts that just passed. As one of the largest energy companies in Mexico, we are looking forward to the opportunities that energy reform will bring in sectors such as liquids transportation, gathering and processing, and power transmission.","Now turning to Peru. We expect to begin commissioning of the 100-megawatt Santa Teresa Hydro project this month. Building upon our success with this project, we are exploring several additional hydro opportunities in the country. Luz del Sur has been granted a temporary concession on the hydropower project, Santa Teresa II, with a potential design capacity between 250 and 300 megawatts. We are progressing on environmental and feasibility studies and have begun conducting local outreach. Additionally, in southern Peru, we are assessing feasibility and design of 2 hydropower projects that can provide a combined capacity of around 350 megawatts. All 3 hydro projects are potentially large, technically sound investments, and we intend to make a decision on moving forward on these by early next year.","Now please turn to Slide 13 for an update on our California utilities. SDG&E and SoCalGas have both been making important headway on several regulatory issues. On June 12, we received the final PSEP decision. The decision is favorable in that it adopts our overall implementation framework and approves a process for cost recovery and balancing account treatment, subject to a reasonableness review. This decision covers expenditures in populated areas, and consistent with what we reported at our analyst conference, capital expenditures are estimated to be about $1.5 billion through 2018. On July 25, we submitted a notice of intent to file the 2016 General Rate Cases for both SDG&E and SoCalGas. After CPUC staff reviews these submissions, the utilities expect to file an official application in the fourth quarter of 2014. The CPUC's final decision is scheduled for late 2015.","Now let's finish by turning to Slide 14. In summary, we are on track for another strong year. We expect to be at the midpoint or higher of our 2014 earnings guidance. Our core businesses are performing well. We received a positive PSEP decision at our California utilities, and are on schedule with our major projects like Cameron LNG and our Mexican pipelines. We are also making great headway on some of our development opportunities. REX has additional contracted volumes and we are seeing many opportunities for growth emerging in both Mexico and Peru.","With that, let me stop and take any questions that you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So first, can we discuss REX here for a second, in the context of what's in the 5-year plan versus outside? Could you give us a little bit of a sense, what does 25% mean, just if you could define that? And then also regarding the non-binding open season, where is that shaking out as far as you've received interest, if you could comment a little bit more, if you wouldn't mind?","Debra L. Reed","Okay. I'll start, and we did put a slide in the package because we do understand the REX issues are kind of confusing. So if I could refer you to the slide and the slide number is 17. I think that would help you understand what's in and what's not in the plan. So let me kind of walk you through that.","If you look at the Seneca lateral piece of that, that's 0.6 Bcf, and about 0.25 Bcf of that went into service in June of this year. That piece was in our plan. We expected that to happen. That was in our 5-year plan. But what has now been contracted is an additional $1.6 billion in addition to that, and that comes in over phases. The next phase of that is another $400 million or so that will come in at the end of this year and provide some upside to our plan in next year and beyond. And then the remaining 1.2 Bcf comes into service in the middle of next year. And that is, again, incremental to what we had in our 5-year plan. So this is a really positive thing for us, just with what we have under contract.","In addition to that, there was a non-binding open season that was conducted in May, and that we're in negotiations with parties on the results of that. And we will announce the results of that when we've concluded those negotiations which are underway right now.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. Is there a timeline on the negotiations?","Debra L. Reed","I would say within the next couple of months, we would anticipate something coming out.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then...","Debra L. Reed","And again, I would just say, none of that was in the plan. So whatever that is, that was not in the plan either.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Excellent. And then moving back to the LNG side of the equation. Could you comment a little bit on where you stand on incremental contracts for both of the projects, 4, 5 and ECA? And perhaps specifically, kind of where you sit in the decision, FTA versus non-FTA?","Debra L. Reed","Yes, what I'm going to do is I'll just give you a high level, and then I'm going to turn it to Mark to go through kind of project-by-project and what we're looking at there.","I would say, the great thing that we have is that when we look at our Cameron facility, it is a very commercially-viable facility. It's -- we think, it's really well positioned in the marketplace, and we also believe our ECA facility would be very well positioned in the marketplace. So a lot of effort is underway to look at kind of the next steps at those facilities, and then we have this wonderful location with Port Arthur, and what might we be able to do with that. So we are very focused on kind of the next steps, and let me turn it to Mark to talk a little bit about that.","Mark A. Snell","Okay. Well, with respect to Cameron, I think, as Debbie says, a great facility. I think the thing I would add to that, too, is the partners in this -- in the facility are world-class trading partners with extensive LNG businesses. So while we have not signed contracts yet for trains 4 and 5, we're really just beginning, just starting to think about that as we have completed FID and move forward with the constructions of trains 1 through 3. So I think that the next step for us is to talk with our partners, decide how much capacity everybody would like, and then to see if we're going to market any of it out to other parties. And that hasn't really begun yet, but I think that is something that will be in the works now that we're moving forward with FID.","And I would just say with that facility too is there are -- the big point here is that, that facility, along with our ECA facility being brownfield sites, obviously, have a cost advantage and a construction advantage over any of the greenfield sites. So it's our expectation that the market will look to brownfield sites, ours included, but also including others and expansion of those existing facilities, first, before they really look at a lot of greenfield opportunities.","With respect to ECA, we are undergoing studies right now to determine the amount of gas that's available for the facility and the cost of delivering that gas into the facility. And then once we kind of determine that, which we think will take us towards the end of this year, once we determine that, we'll lay out some plans for the size of the facility and start marketing to customers. We have a lot of customer interest, and we don't think that acquiring customers will be a big issue, but we haven't started that marketing yet because we haven't sized the facility, but we're in the process of looking at the parameters to do that.","And then with respect to Port Arthur, another -- it's a great site, it is a greenfield site. We think the advantage of Port Arthur is that it's such a large site and has such good water access that the possibility of doing things beyond just LNG are there. We can -- there's other -- it's actually been proposed in the past as a crude terminal and other types of activities, and we think those activities could coexist with LNG, making it, in the long run, one of the more cost-effective greenfield sites in the country. So those are all, kind of, positives and where we're going, and then did you, Debbie, you want to comment on the process?","Debra L. Reed","Yes. You asked the question, Julien, about the DOE, non-conditional FTA. And going through the conditional FTA was really where the review, the extensive review occurred with DOE. So we would anticipate in the next few months to see the DOE, non-conditional FTA. We've seen, recently, other companies get their conditional FTAs. We haven't seen any change in criteria, so we would expect that to be coming out in the next couple of months. And then, that would allow us to begin, really, full construction on the site. But we are doing some site preparation activities. We've gotten the authority from FERC to be able to do that. And so, we're, actually, working on the site right now.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steven Fleishman of Wolfe Research.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","A couple questions. First, just with the final financing terms and the like, are all the numbers you've given for Cameron 1 through 3 still, kind of, right in line with what you've said before?","Debra L. Reed","Yes. We did -- and I think a couple of things, Steve. We've given you the range of $9 billion to $10 billion. We're still in that range. And we looked at the financing, the financing came in very competitively, as I mentioned in my comments. What we're looking at now is, at the $10 billion range, being somewhere towards the middle of the range that we've given you, for the first few years of operation. And then as the loan starts to be amortized, we would anticipate that, over time, the annual earnings would be $400 million or so. So $300 million to $350 million is still a range we would see being closer to the midpoints of that range in the first few years of operation, and then we would see being in excess of $400 million after the loan starts to amortize.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. And then just -- what's the -- just to set expectation, what's a reasonable timeframe to think about potential contracting of trains 4 and 5?","Debra L. Reed","I can't really answer that question. I will tell you that it's something that is a big focus for us, and that we're going to put a lot of energy into it, just like we did getting Cameron done. But that -- you got to get -- you got to do the same things we went through Cameron. And the good thing is we've been through the FERC process on that site, so it's not a new site to go through the FERC process. So, kind of, telling you a timeframe on that, I can't tell you. I'm hoping it would be expedited because we've already been through the FERC process on that site, but I really can't give you a timeframe at this point.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. And then just one last question on the -- you've given your 3 kind of scenario options on MLP back at the Analyst Day. Any new thinking on those 3 options or is it pretty consistent with what you said then?","Debra L. Reed","Yes, let me have Joe talk about that because we continue to do work in this area. And clearly, with the situation with REX being as positive as it is, we constantly are looking at that. So let me ask Joe to hit that.","Joseph A. Householder","Thanks, Debbie, and Steve, thanks for the question. As she said, it's some subject that we spend a fair amount of time on because it's very important to us and to the shareholders. And we're looking at the MLP space and the YieldCo space, actually, and the ones that have the highest visible growth, particularly, with large drop-down portfolios, those have the lowest yields and the potential for the highest value. And so let me tell you a little bit more about that we really are doing. We're continuing to evaluate the value proposition and we're studying the legal and financial aspects of both the MLP and the YieldCo space. And as we've noted before, having the clear growth strategy for the business is a critical element. So we're very excited about our growth at Sempra and focused on executing, as Debbie said, on all these projects that we're doing. At the same time, we're focused on getting the best market value for the shareholders on this growth and that current MLP YieldCo structure offer good opportunity for that. So we haven't made a decision at this time, which of the structures is exactly the right one, but we are very focused on it and looking at it and continuing to evaluate all of these opportunities.","Debra L. Reed","I would just add to that. We'll look at that in conjunction also, with the timing, and as I've said before, part of the analysis is looking at, with an asset as valuable as Cameron, how does the timing set, with splits and things like that? So all of that kind of analytical work is part of our assessment.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Greg Gordon of ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","The first couple of questions checked a lot off my list so I'll try to be brief. I'll probably fail, but I'll try to be brief. So thinking about when the revenues are rolling in on the stuff that's not in your plan. You've been very clear that 2015, 2016, there's 1 point more Bcf a day of revenue opportunity off of the REX backhaul that wasn't in the plan. Should we assume that -- should the Clarington West open season become a commercially viable opportunity that, that would hit in the second half of '15? Or is it hitting the first half of '16 in terms of incremental revenue? What's the timing assumed on the current path to bringing that into the revenue line?","Debra L. Reed","The timing on the current path is sometime in the middle of 2015 as that is -- it's expected to go in service. And I think, just go through the increments again to be sure the numbers that you have are consistent. We have $200 million to $250 million in service now, and that was in the plan. We add, incrementally, $350 million to $400 million at the end of this year, and that's additive to the plan. And then, we would add the remainder to get to the $1.8 billion, which is another $1.2 billion in the middle of next year some time.","Joseph A. Householder","And I think you might have been asking [indiscernible].","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","[indiscernible] on the Clarington West?","Debra L. Reed","And then on the Clarington West, the timeframe on that is not certain because with that -- a lot of that has to do with how you design it, and what the volumes are and how you design it. So we don't know what the timeframe of that would be.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Right. And Clarington West, if it's successful, would require more capital investment than the Seneca lateral and the $1.2 billion that you've already signed up, correct?","Debra L. Reed","Yes. There would be compression for one piece of it, and then there would be looping for the other piece of that. And for what we've done so far, the capital is really not very large at all, I think it was like $70-some-odd million, $80 million.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And the maximum size of Clarington West was another $2.4 billion? Is that -- or am I overstating it?","Debra L. Reed","No, that's right. That was the maximum size if you do compression and looping.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then, I have one question back on the utility. You gave guidance for a range of earnings for SoCalGas of $360 million to $390 million in 2015 at your Analyst Day. I'm wondering, as you now are analyzing the rate decisions you've gotten, for instance, the PSEP decision, where you think you would come out inside that range?","Debra L. Reed","Well, the ranges that we gave you in March of this year, we would anticipate being in those ranges for SoCalGas.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Rajeev Lalwani of Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","First is just a clarification. Joe, when you said earlier you're looking at different options for structures, were you saying that you're considering doing a YieldCo and having Cameron be a part of that?","Joseph A. Householder","I was saying that we're open -- we're looking at all of that. We're trying to determine what vehicle might, exactly, be the best, and we are keeping our options open as to what the right vehicle is. So at this point, it's open.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then, hypothetically, if you did go, sort of, down the YieldCo-type route, what other assets in your portfolio do you think would fit well? Obviously, you've got the renewables, but do any other assets come to mind?","Joseph A. Householder","That would be probably the primary asset other than the ones that we've spoken about before that would go into an MLP.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. What about some of the, like the Latin American assets you have. There have been a couple of YieldCos with those type of assets.","Joseph A. Householder","We've spoken about it a little, we haven't really done much analysis on it. It's a lot more complicated, obviously. And inside the utility, it probably wouldn't fit that well, but it's certainly something that we are keeping an open mind about.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And then in terms of -- there was a pipeline that was bid, I think, in Peru a couple of months back, and I think you were disqualified or there were some sort of issues. I was hoping you can provide an update there and just some color on what happened?","Debra L. Reed","Yes. I'm going to have Mark talk about what happened with that.","Mark A. Snell","Okay. Well, what happened was we were in a competitive bidding situation and we were in a consortium with other bidders -- I mean, with other participants in our consortium. And one of our members at the last -- kind of, at the last moment decided to change ownership percentages, and that caused us to have a technical disqualification. And so our bid was rejected, although we did open it publicly and announced it, and it was the best bid, it was the low bid, so I think would have won. And it was just unfortunate that we had this, sort of, technical problem that caused our bid to be disqualified. But I think it gave us a lot of encouragement in the sense that having gone through this process on this pipeline, and there's other projects coming up, that we were obviously very competitive. We came up with the lowest price. We think we had a better route and a better approach to the project. And so I think we're sort of emboldened to think that we're going to be very -- quite competitive in the future. It's unfortunate we have this little setback. But I think, moving forward, we look upon this, our group, as positively, as one that we can win projects down there.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And just one last question, if I can. In terms of thinking about the potential economics for an ECA or -- under Cameron 4 and 5, how similar or dissimilar would it be to Cameron 1 through 3, both in terms of the equity investment, as well as the return potential?","Mark A. Snell","Well, I'll take that. This is Mark. Obviously, the expansion is less expensive per ton of production than even the brownfield conversion to a certain extent. As you get bigger and bigger, then you start -- then it becomes less effective because you might have to add tankage and stuff. But with what we're considering, I think we would be very cost competitive. So the cost wouldn't be -- would be less than what we're currently contemplating, and I think that's what going to make it very attractive. We would expect similar kinds of returns as we would get. So I think that we would probably share those efficiencies with the market to make sure that we can sell the capacity. So I think those are all positives.","And then with respect to ECA, a little different facility there, a little different footprint. But I think, roughly speaking, the economics are somewhat the same, but ECA would likely be a smaller facility or will be a smaller facility.","Debra L. Reed","Before I take another question, I just wanted to comment on something back on the REX sheet to be sure everyone was clear. On the sheet that we have at 17, it says 25% of the volumes. I just want to remind everyone that we own 25% of REX. So when we're talking about 1.8 Bcf and 2.4 Bcf, not all of that flows to Sempra. I think you all know that, but I just don\u2019t want to mislead anyone.","Okay. We're ready for the next question.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Matt Tucker of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Matthew P. Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I guess, I wanted to ask about Mexico first and how you feel about your chances on these 2 CFE pipeline bids and if you could comment on how the competitive environment for these bids compares to other pipeline opportunities that you've gone after there recently?","Debra L. Reed","Well, I'll just start by saying that we are really excited about the opportunities in Mexico, and the good thing that we have is we have the infrastructure there, we have the team there, we have the ability to get pipes to the job, we have all of that because we've done projects. So I think that, that -- why competition is probably going to be higher than we saw in the past. I think also being on the ground with the projects that we already have there provides us a great competitive advantage in terms of our ability to show that we can deliver on these projects. And then we have the 2 projects coming in this year that are on schedule, on budget, and there are not very many companies that have that kind of proven track record. So I think we're in really good position to compete, and there's a lot of projects that are going to come out, and we're going to be, as we have in the past, selective of which ones we bid on, the ones that we feel we can be most competitive.","Matthew P. Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Great, thanks. And then just circling back to Cameron. You mentioned you expect the final DOE approval within the next couple of months. I guess, what's, kind of, holding that up, and what issues are they still considering? I kind of felt that like would be somewhat automatic. So maybe you could comment on that.","Debra L. Reed","Well, like I said within the next couple of months. I mean, we're not sure. It could happen soon, it could happen -- as DOE is looking at it, I think that one of the considerations was what kind of comments would come in on the FERC issue. And since that appears to have been that there were no comments that were filed timely, that, that may change how DOE focuses on it. Certainly, Senator Landrieu has already sent a letter that was made public asking DOE to act quickly on this. And as I said, it's not stopping us from getting on site right now and doing some of that pre-work. But the sooner we can get it, the better. So we're very anxious to have DOE act quickly and hope they will.","Matthew P. Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then with respect to the possible expansion. I guess, I just wanted to ask about the construction side of that. If, hypothetically, you were able to secure commitments and were able to get the permitting process, would you be able to start construction on trains 4 and 5 before trains 1 through 3 are completed, or would you have to wait until, really, 2019 to even start construction?","Debra L. Reed","No. I'm going to have Mark talk about how that might unfold.","Mark A. Snell","No, I mean, it really -- they have to be kind of done sequentially. And it's not just the construction issue, but also the terms of the financing require us to finish the projects that are being financed first. So unless we redid some of the financing, we -- it's -- they have to be done sequentially.","Matthew P. Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So we'd be talking about something like a 2020-type timeframe, the earliest, 2021 maybe for those to come online?","Mark A. Snell","Yes, it could be a little shorter than that. I mean, one of the things we are doing, we are constantly looking at the construction schedule and the construction that we're doing and we, kind of, call it a no-regrets construction policy, which is we're anticipating further expansion as we build. So there are certain things that we can kind of pre-build into the process so that we don't have to go back and redo it. So I think we can save some time there. So it may not be quite as long a timeframe as trains 1 through 3, but it would probably be sequential.","Matthew P. Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then just looking at the 3 LNG expansion opportunities. You discussed Cameron, ECA and Port Arthur. Would you be able to, kind of, rank those in terms of both the probability and the, kind of, timeline between those 3 projects?","Mark A. Snell","Well, I think the reality is the expansion of Cameron is probably up there. It's probably first, but very close behind is ECA, and that's, probably, almost a push as to which one could go first. Probably -- actually, ECA could start earlier than the expansion. So I think both of those are, kind of, at least, equal. And then Port Arthur, because it's a greenfield facility, obviously, would take longer to develop, and it could be quite a big facility. So that's further down the road. I'd kind of -- but I'd keep ECA and Cameron, kind of, neck and neck.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I want to ask about the good old-fashioned utilities. When you think about -- right, like nobody's asking, and you have really, really, really strong utilities. When you're thinking about the rate cases, how material? Meaning, how big of a number are we talking about in terms of either requested revenue change or a percentage rate change if you're the -- I don\u2019t know, if you're the intervenor looking at it from the other side?","Debra L. Reed","Yes, actually, I think that's the real positive that we have. If you look at SDG&E as example, our filed notice of intent to file the rate case set forth a number of $168 million increase. And on a combined electric and gas build, that's about 1.4%. And then on SoCalGas, we're looking at a $290 million increase, and that's about 5.5% increase in a bill. But I will remind you that in both cases, the bills are already much lower than the national average. So I think that we have operated our utilities efficiently over time. I think there's a benefit in that and going in to these rate cases and asking for what we really need to operate those businesses very efficiently and have it not be huge increases in customer rates.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then one question on Clarington West, kind of, the part that you're still trying to figure out, you and your co-owners are just still trying to figure out what to do with. What's the timeline for the open seasons there? And I want to make sure I understood this, what would be the potential, kind of, range of capital requirements from your perspective?","Debra L. Reed","Okay, Mike, I'll answer the first and then I'll ask Mark to talk about the capital requirements under the different phases, if that's public and -- when I'm not sure, I guess, that's not public information. So I won't answer that part of your question.","But I will answer the first part of your question. The non-binding open season went out in May and now, we're in negotiations with participants in that non-binding open season relative to contractual commitments. So however long it takes to secure those is the kind of timeframe that we're looking at. And that's why I said I think we would anticipate something in the next couple of months most likely.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Christopher Turnure of JPMorgan.","Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Did you guys give more color on the timing of the rest of the 2014 RFPs for the Mexico pipelines? There's a lot left in there besides just the 2 that are out there already, and it looks like each one individually will take a couple months at least from start to finish.","Debra L. Reed","Yes, there's 2 that are outstanding right now, and then there's 5 more that they've announced to come out of this year, and that's what's been indicated, and that's in the pipeline side. But I would also focus you on -- there's other areas of opportunity like transmission. And so, Mark why don't you hit, kind of, what we see over the next few months?","Mark A. Snell","Okay. I think, well, like Debbie said, there's 2 out right now, and we're actively working on those bids. And then the next 5 that are coming out of those, 2 big ones are in the United States that are for CFE. Those will be, probably, hotly contested just because they are the MLPs and everybody can compete with those. So we expect that to be -- have more bidders than the ones in Mexico. But we do believe that we have some unique things, properties that we can bring to the bid, to our bid, and then -- and I think that we can try to -- we can be competitive, and we should have a good chance to do that. And we've had a long history, obviously, working with the CFE, so I think that should bode well in our favor.","But then there's -- and then beyond that, there is a whole list of pipeline opportunities that are scheduled to come in -- to come out in the first half of '15. And obviously, we're even beginning to look at some of those and be prepared for those. But there is, certainly, a long list of opportunities on the natural gas pipeline side. But then we also have -- there are electric transmission projects and power generation projects, also product lines for PEMEX.","So I mean, I think, the story here is that energy reform in Mexico is going to produce billions and billions of dollars of capital opportunities for companies that have a history of operating in Mexico, and our positioning with our IEnova subsidiary makes us probably the premier energy company to bid on these competitive projects. We're the second largest energy company in Mexico behind PEMEX, and we're really the hometown incumbent there. So I think we feel very good about our chances of being successful and participating in this reform, and we certainly look forward to continuing to grow our business down there.","Debra L. Reed","And just to, kind of, add a flavor of the big numbers we're talking about over time. As part of the infrastructure program that the Mexican government has announced, they've announced 15 generation projects worth $13.6 billion, 17 gas pipelines for $13.1 billion, and 7 electric transmission lines for $1.7 billion. So you're talking about tens of billions of dollars of investment in Mexico. And they're moving forward on it. So we think this is going to be a great opportunity area for us.","Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just on cash repatriation. You guys have, I guess, some potential incremental opportunities in Peru after the failure of that initial RFP for the pipeline there, and then certainly all of the opportunities in Mexico. Will there be any pause that you contemplate with brining cash back here as a result of those and how should we think about that and, kind of, what's contemplated in guidance through, I guess, 2018 now, with the repatriation?","Debra L. Reed","Yes, what we've had in our plan and what we continue to have in our plan is repatriating $300 million a year. And that -- we look at that based upon the needs of capital in those countries. As we've told you before, we have a lot of debt capacity left, and so that's what we would go to first. And then, we have the ability to issue equity in those 2 countries. We would look at that as well. So right now, what we're planning on is still the $300 million a year repatriation.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Kit Konolige of BGC.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","On the possibility of the MLP\/YieldCo that, obviously, has been a hot topic that you've talked about and we have asked you about. Any further thinking on any kind of bridge assets that could be put into a hypothetical MLP, let's say, before Cameron was up and running? If I understood you correctly, in the past, REX alone as it was envisioned -- you wouldn't really have considered sufficient to be the, kind of, the lead-off batter for the MLP for that length of time.","Debra L. Reed","I'll have Joe talk about this. Joe?","Joseph A. Householder","Kit, while we haven't made any decisions at this point about the exact timing or asset composition, I will remind you, what we talked about on the first quarter, the things that are going on at REX that we talked about today and last quarter are really exciting because it does give us additional cash flow starting in the middle of next year that we can use in this regard. However, I did note that because we have a 25% interest in REX, it can't be the only asset that goes in there because of some 40 Act issues, so we need other assets. So what we've talked about is using some of the cash flow from REX, using -- as we get further along, obviously, the cash flows from Cameron, and now that we have FID, that puts us in great stead for that. But we have some additional cash flows from our LNG facility in Mexico that, actually, are in the U.S. and we would use those. We have some other, a little bit of midstream asset revenues not including the storage that we would put in there. And then if we did something broader, we could also include renewable revenues. But I think, given what's happened with REX, given that we now have FID, I think we have a mix of assets that we can use, as you call, sort of, a bridge to do something between now and 2018, 2019.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","So what should we assume is the earliest that you could do something given the mix that you see in front of you there? Is it some time in '15 or '16?","Joseph A. Householder","As I started out to say, we haven't made any decisions at this point about the exact timing, so more to come.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Okay, we'll stay tuned there.","Joseph A. Householder","I'll say one other thing. Obviously, we talked about the CFE pipelines in the U.S, Mark spoke about that, and we think we have a good opportunity to capture some of that. That would be an additional help that would get us there.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Right. And speaking of assets that are being bid out in Mexico. Are -- is it your idea that IEnova would be the owner as those assets are billed or, let's say, for ECA, would there be a different company?","Debra L. Reed","Now everything that's located physically in Mexico would be an IEnova position. As Joe said, there are some contracts that relate to gas that are not -- that are tied to ECA but are U.S. assets. Those would remain in the U.S. But to the degree that we developed ECA, to the degree that we're doing pipelines in Mexico, those would be Mexican assets under IEnova. To the degree that some of these Mexican bid pipelines occur in the U.S., those would not be part of IEnova.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Right. One last question on tax rate. You had some discussion earlier about how the tax rate varies quarter-to-quarter depending on what's repatriated and, obviously, other factors going on, several moving parts. How should we think about the tax rate, say, an annual tax rate over the next few years? Is it going to be pretty steady for estimation purposes?","Joseph A. Householder","Yes, over the next several years. This year, it will be just a little under 30, and over the next several years, in the low-30s. Pretty stable.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Mark Barnett of Morningstar.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Sorry to jump back into the LNG. You've been talking about it a lot today. I really appreciate all of your comments on it. Just wondering, it seems the agreement or the nature of the agreement for Cameron is a pretty successful one. If you are going to be moving forward with ECA or with the new Port Arthur facility, are you going to be looking for, kind of, a similar ownership structure?","Debra L. Reed","That is yet to be determined. And we'll look at the option that makes sense for each of those facilities. We have great respect and have worked really well with the partners that we have at Cameron, but that model doesn't have to continue on, and we would be looking at what model would make sense for us at each of the facilities.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Meaning, it's possible by the time you're ready to make that decision, you might feel comfortable taking on a project like that on your own?","Debra L. Reed","It depends on what kind of contracts we had. And all of that -- all I can say is it really depends. I would not preclude it, but it would have to also fit within our Sempra risk profile, and that's what we would look at.","Mark A. Snell","Yes, I would say the thing that we would be focused on is that it would be fully contracted.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And just one smaller thing. At the Analyst Day, you also mentioned the opportunity for some re-gas, maybe in Hawaii. Obviously, not maybe as large an opportunity as some of the stuff you mentioned this quarter, but just wondering if that's something you have an idea about, maybe the capacity that, that market might demand eventually? And that's probably, I would guess, a lower priority than any of the projects that you've spent so much time discussing, already, today?","Debra L. Reed","Yes. I would say, I'm going to have Mark talk about it. But I would say, one potential customer probably for ECA would be Hawaii so...","Mark A. Snell","Yes, look, I think, the reason we mentioned it is because there is, obviously, a real need there, and this is one of those interesting situations where bringing LNG into the island would do -- would have 2 beneficial effects. One, it would be a much cleaner burning fuel source for electricity because they're using fuel oil now. And two, it would actually lower their costs because they would go from a crude-based pricing to a natural gas-based pricing. So it's really got a double benefit and a clear need, and we think the desire on the part of the Hawaiian -- of the state government and the local utilities there to move with this direction. So we think there's going to be an opportunity there, and ECA is the natural, logical supply source. So that's why it was mentioned. We don't have an agreement. We don't have -- well, we've been talking to them. We think that there's a possibility, someday, of working something out, but we don't have anything. We don't have anything firm.","Operator","We'll take our final question from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","A lot of my questions have been answered, but just -- I wanted to clarify something on the DOE process. The Chris Smith proposal to, sort of, accelerate the -- to streamline the process and have them deal with the approvals at the end of -- other regulatory agency approvals. I'm sorry if I missed this, what is your expectation in terms of how that's going to proceed?","Debra L. Reed","Well, we think that's moving forward, and we're very positive on that. I mean, what we've seen in the queue is that we spent a lot of money going through the FERC process, and that it doesn't cost that much to go through the DOE process for our company, but they can block you in terms of timing for the queue. And that, we really like the idea of the FERC process, kind of, becoming the driver because that's what requires all the engineering, all the environmental work, all the things to really make the business decision on the facility. And we think that this change in process will actually help us in terms of the development of additional size for trains because we've gone through that process. And there -- I will tell you, it is a stringent process, and you can see now that are not very many companies that have made it through the whole FERC process. In fact, we're the first one that made it through the whole EIS process. So we think it's an advantage to us, as a developer, having had the experience with that for them to make those modifications.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Because the reason why bring it up is that, as I'm sure you're aware, API and others made comments that seems to be critical of that path. And I guess, you guys just have a different perspective on it. I'm just wondering if there's a simple -- I don\u2019t want you to go into anything elaborate, but I'm just wondering, is there a simple reason for that or...?","Debra L. Reed","Well, [indiscernible] your level of seriousness on these projects is tied to the FERC process. And so, that your expenditures and your level of seriousness -- and with the process that DOE was using with every few months one coming out, you could have projects that may not get developed, may not get the financing, may not have the customers, and have not even begun the FERC process move ahead in the queue because they filed something that didn't cost them anything really to file. And so we think the FERC process, really, drives your true commitment because when you file at FERC, you have invested a lot to get there. And so we're supportive of what DOE is looking at.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, I think I understand the difference. And then on the -- just in general, we've seen some real changes in the global LNG and gas market, et cetera. And I'm just wondering, where things stand now. And obviously, you guys have a competitive advantage with the respect to recent brownfield and stuff. Just in general, what's your thought about, ultimately, how much LNG is actually exported from the country? Or is that -- I'm saying in terms of just any market dynamic outlook, did that change at all from previously, when we've talked about this? Or I'm just, sort of, wondering, when we look at this -- like you said, it seems like everybody's brother's is announcing something, and of course a lot of it isn't, probably, going to happen. I'm just wondering if you could maybe give a little bit of flavor as to how you see the recent changes in the gas markets globally?","Debra L. Reed","Yes, I'll ask Mark to talk more about this. But what I would say is that all depends on what the relative cost in the market is. And I mean, some of the projects that we're doing now, which are brownfield projects, are very cost competitive. One of the advantages that you have in the U.S. or that you would have in Mexico is that you have an infrastructure, and then a lot of these other places, where they're having to build their LNG facility, they're having to build the pipeline infrastructure, they're having to access the resources to the supply. There's different hurdles that go with it. So we think that our country is really well positioned on this. And it's hard to say how much of that global market we get. I do think that we can be very competitive in that global market because of some of those issues. Mark?","Mark A. Snell","Yes, I would say in the near term, say between now and 2020 to 2022, you'll see the development of, probably, the brownfield facilities because those will be the most cost-effective and that could be somewhere in the neighborhood of 7 Bcf to -- just call it 8 to 10 Bcf a day. And I think that's what is probably likely to happen, and then given the size -- and then, I think it'll probably depend a lot on how much the world market is going to grow. I mean, right now we're talking about -- there's some estimates out there that the market for LNG could double over the next 10 or 15 years in the world market, and that, obviously, would create additional opportunities for gas-producing countries. But we've said all along that we don't -- we think other gas-producing countries, especially, ones like Qatar and others that have low-cost reserves, are going to be competitive in this market and they're not just going to seed market share to the U.S. or Canada or the North American market in general on a whim.","So at the end of the day, I think, there will be a demand for diversity of supply, which will include North America, and we're going to see other projects get developed and get built. We believe some of those will be ours. But at the end -- but it isn't an unlimited market and clearly, I think we're not approaching it, and I think responsible developers are not going to approach this with the idea that it's never-ending. And so you'll see a lot of proposed facilities, but at the end of the day, we think the actual ones that come online are the ones that will have sold their capacity. And that capacity market is going to be -- it's going to be looking for diversity, it's going to be looking for certainty of supply, and that bodes well for the North American market, and so I think it'll continue to grow. But it's going to be 2022 kind of 10 Bcf a day sort of market and kind of grow from there.","Debra L. Reed","I also would say that there's just a lot of things that have been happening in some of the international gas markets that are affecting us. Clearly, what's happening in Russia has a big effect. China just announced that their development of their shale is not progressing as they had anticipated, and it's going much slower and much lower production rates and more expensive. And so I think, those factors will play out over the next 3 to 5 years, where you have greater visibility in those areas, which have a lot of impact on what happens to the LNG market as well.","Debra L. Reed","Thank you, all, very much. As always, we have a top-notch Investor Relations team, and that they are there to answer any follow-up questions that you have following our call today. So if you have any additional questions, please contact our Investor Relations group. And thank you so much for joining us today on the call.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference.

Today's call is being recorded. And at this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead, sir.","Richard A. Vaccari","Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today we'll be discussing Sempra Energy's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Financial and Operational Results. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investor section. With us today in San Diego are several members of our management team: Debbie Reed, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Snell, President; Joe Householder, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Martha Wyrsch, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and Trevor Mihalik, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. We also have the heads of our 2 California utilities, Dennis Arriola, Chief Executive of Southern California Gas; and Jeff Martin, Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric.","Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and that we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures.","I'd also like to note that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, February 26, 2015, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.","With that, please turn to Slide 3 and let me hand the call over to Debbie.","Debra L. Reed","Thanks, Rick, and thanks to all of you who are joining us. 2014 lays a strong foundation for our future growth. We have solid financial performance, achieved double-digit annual EPS growth and posted earnings exceeding our guidance. We also achieved important milestones on development projects and delivered strong operating results across all of our businesses. With the great progress made over the year, we are on track to be at the upper end of our expected 9% to 11% earnings per share growth rate for 2014 to 2019.","As a reminder, we have our upcoming Analyst Conference on March 26, and we hope to see all of you in New York. At that time, we will update our 5-year earnings projections and discuss our plans to continue to deliver strong returns for our shareholders. For today's call, I am going to focus on a summary of our 2014 financial results and recent operational accomplishments that will help us to achieve our long-term growth plan. I will then hand the call over to Joe to explain the fourth quarter earnings, our 2015 adjusted earnings guidance range and our 2015 dividend increase.","Please turn to Slide 4. This morning, we reported 2014 earnings of $4.63 per share. On an adjusted basis, 2014 earnings were $4.71 per share, representing 13% annual growth over 2013. We had strong operating performance across the company that contributed to this result. Several fourth quarter factors also drove earnings above our expectation from the last call where we stated that we expected to be near the upper end of our 2014 guidance range. The major factor was tax reform in Peru that was implemented on December 31. Peru lowered its corporate income tax rate, which reduced our deferred income tax liability and resulted in an $18 million benefit recorded in the fourth quarter. Additionally, the CPUC approved our energy efficiency awards for both utilities earlier than we had anticipated.","Looking to 2015, we expect Sempra's adjusted earnings to be within the range of $4.60 per share to $5 per share, excluding 2 items Joe will discuss later. We also received Sempra Board approval to increase our annualized dividend to $2.80 per share, a 6% increase.","If you look back over the last few years, our dividend has increased nearly 80% since 2010, and we continue to be committed to returning capital to our shareholders.","Now let's turn to Slide 5 for an overview of key accomplishments at SoCalGas and SDG&E.","Our California utilities are spending capital consistent with approved programs. The utilities have also received important regulatory decisions in 2014 that established the framework to guide investments in programs like the Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan, or PSEP. In November, the CPUC approved the SONGS multiparty settlement agreement that resolves the cost recovery issues on the plant closure. Also, both SDG&E and SoCalGas filed their 2016 General Rate Case applications with a proposed decision expected by the end of this year. In December, the CPUC approved a 1 year extension of the utilities cost of capital rates. The extension keeps the authorized returns on equity of 10.1% for SoCalGas and 10.3% for SDG&E intact through 2016. It also keeps in place an automatic adjustment mechanism should interest rates move beyond a predetermined band.","Operationally, SoCalGas installed nearly 1.8 million advanced meters last year and is ahead of schedule on their program to install nearly 6 million advanced meters by the end of 2017. Both utilities are ahead of schedule in implementing their pipeline safety enhancement plans as well, having already tested or replaced over 30 miles of pipeline last year.","Now let's move to U.S. Gas & Power on Slide 6.","Key milestones reached last year on the Cameron Liquefaction project include reaching the final investment decision, or FID; forming the joint venture; and getting the project fully into construction. With permits, financing and the lump sum turnkey contract in place, we remain on track to complete all 3 trains in 2018.","In December, the JV also filed with the Department of Energy for FTA authorization to export an additional 2.95 million tons of LNG per annum on trains 1 through 3. We expect to file for the non-FTA export permit this quarter. These higher volumes match the maximum design capacity of the plant approved by FERC, and permits would allow us to export additional LNG during periods when production levels exceed the 12 million tons per annum already approved.","However, just to be clear, while this can provide upside, we do not expect the plant to produce at the maximum capacity on a routine basis and additional production is unlikely during startup and the first few years of operation. If higher volumes can be produced that Cameron's customers use for export, we could see earnings upside in the future of approximately $30 million for each 1 million tons produced.","Work on our 3 major LNG development projects also continues to move forward. This week, the JV partner submitted the FERC prefiling and DOE FTA export application for Cameron trains 4 and 5. The filing would add a combined LNG capacity of approximately 9 million to 10 million tons per annum. We expect to submit the full FERC filing later this year, which will initiate the detailed environmental review process that should take approximately 12 to 18 months to complete.","At Port Arthur and ECA, design, regulatory and commercial activities are ongoing. For Port Arthur, we are working to prepare our FERC prefiling. For ECA, we announced the signing of an MOU with PEMEX last week. The agreement signifies our intention to cooperate on the development of the export project and explore the possibility for PEMEX to participate as a customer, supplier and\/or investor.","For all 3 development projects, we have been meeting with a large number of potential customers and continue to see demand for LNG supplies in the 2020 to 2023 timeframe. We have also been on the road, speaking with many of you, about our competitive advantages in providing low-cost reliable LNG to the market. Our U.S. and Mexican LNG projects are very compelling, even in today's lower oil price environment. And Sempra is one of the few developers who have successfully contracted, permitted and financed a liquefaction facility in North America. We plan to provide an in-depth discussion on our development projects at our March Analyst Conference, and we'll have the President of our LNG business, Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es, there to answer your questions. Let's now go to Slide 7.","For our Natural Gas segment, converting REX into a bidirectional pipeline was a positive long-term development last year. As you know, 1.8 Bcf per day of east-to-west capacity on REX is now under long-term contract. 1\/3 of this capacity is in service, and the remaining capacity should be online mid-2015. In addition, the REX joint venture has made progress on finalizing precedent agreements with interested shippers for expansion of east to west capacity. The expansion would likely occur through additional compression and would be subject to regulatory approval. We are expecting any day to receive our FERC approval of the 1.2 Bcf per day of east-to-west capacity that is already contracted. Once that approval is received, we hope to provide additional details on the expansion project.","Shifting to our renewables business. In the fourth quarter, we added our 75-megawatt Broken Bow 2 Wind Project to a joint venture with ConEd. With this transaction, we have successfully partnered with ConEd on over 700 megawatts of renewable power projects, including 7 different solar plants and the Broken Bow 2 Wind Farm.","Please turn to Slide 8. In Mexico, IEnova has progressed on construction and is now generating earnings on sections of both the Sonora and Los Ramones pipelines placed in service in 2014. Together, these 2 pipelines will provide nearly 3 Bcf per day of import capacity to Mexico.","IEnova was also awarded the first natural gas pipeline tendered by CFE as part of Mexico's 5-year national infrastructure plan. The associated CapEx is $300 million and the pipeline should be in service in the first half of 2017 under a 25-year, dollar-denominated take-or-pay contract. Since our last call, the CFE has put out tenders for an additional 4 pipelines in Mexico, representing an estimated $1.8 billion in investment. One of the bids is due next month and the other 3 bids are due in May. For your reference, we provide updated information on CFE bids in the appendix to this presentation.","With that, let's move to a discussion of the quarterly earnings in more detail. Before I hand the call over to Joe, however, I want to comment on the status of our total return vehicle, or TRV, analysis. We have indicated that we expect to complete our analysis on a preferred TRV structure by the end of first quarter. We are continuing several different work streams in this respect. As you know, nearly all of our midstream and renewable assets are owned in partnerships and there are numerous accounting and legal aspects we must deal with for those assets. We will provide you with more information on our TRV preferred structure at the analyst conference.","Joe?","Joseph A. Householder","Thanks, Debbie. Turning to Slide 9, our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results were very strong. This morning, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $297 million or $1.18 per share. We recorded an additional $12 million after-tax loss in the fourth quarter for the early closure of SONGS, making the total SONGS-related loss in 2014 equal to $21 million. Excluding this loss, fourth quarter adjusted earnings were $309 million or $1.23 per share.","Full year 2014 earnings totaled $1,161,000,000 or $4.63 per share. This compares to 2013 earnings of $1,001,000,000 or $4.01 per share. On an adjusted basis, 2014 earnings per share were $4.71. Year-over-year, adjusted earnings per share grew 13%.","Similar to last quarter's call, we provide individual financial results for each of our businesses in the section of our presentation entitled Business Unit Earnings. Today, I'm going to focus on the key drivers of our consolidated fourth quarter earnings, beginning on Slide 10.","Fourth quarter adjusted earnings increased over the same period last year, due in part to $33 million of benefits in 2014, coming largely from 3 items.","First, in December, the Peruvian Congress approved gradually lowering the corporate income tax rate from 30% in 2014 to 26% in 2019, and that was signed by the President on December 31. We recorded an $18 million income tax benefit in the fourth quarter as a result of the remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities.","Second, U.S. Gas & Power recorded an $8 million after-tax gain from the sale of a 50% equity interest in the Broken Bow 2 Wind Project.","Third, SDG&E had $7 million of increased earnings from higher CPUC-based margin and FERC regulatory operations. Partially offsetting these items were $7 million of net benefits in 2013. SoCalGas had $20 million of lower income tax expense in 2013, primarily related to resolution of prior year's income tax items and higher flow-through deductions recorded in that year. Netted against this amount is $13 million of deferred income tax expense for Sempra Mexico in the fourth quarter of 2013 that related to Mexican tax reform.","With regard to foreign currency-related effects, we did see a $16 million reduction in South American earnings over the course of 2014 due to the depreciation of local currencies against the dollar. However, this impact was almost entirely offset by foreign currency-related effects and inflation in Mexico, where depreciation of the local currency decreased our deferred tax-related balances and increased our earnings.","Now please go to Slide 11. Turning to our guidance for 2015, we are setting our adjusted earnings guidance range at $4.60 per share to $5 per share. This range reflects a number of factors, including higher utility earnings, new revenue on the REX pipeline, a year end forecast for South American currencies and the fall of natural gas futures prices that may reduce our gas storage and marketing revenues. Our adjusted guidance range excludes 2 items.","First, as we indicated last quarter, we are not including the expected gain on the sale of the second block of our Mesquite Power Plant. The estimated earnings impact for this sale ranges from $0.12 per diluted share to $0.15 per diluted share.","Second, we expect to incur some development costs related to our 3 LNG projects, Cameron trains 4 and 5, ECA and Port Arthur. Advancing development projects to the full FERC filing could cost up to $25 million per project. However, at this point, we do not know the timing or the amount we will spend, the total cost we will share with our partners or the breakdown between the amount we may capitalize and the amount we may expense. We believe that excluding the development costs for these 3 projects gives better clarity into the ongoing results of our business since earnings from these efforts will likely only be realized in 2020 and beyond. We will be disciplined in our approach regarding development spending, and we'll periodically update you on our progress. Amounts expensed will be reflected in our GAAP numbers.","We expect to have more updates on LNG projects at our Analyst Conference in New York on March 26. At that time, we will also provide updated 2015 guidance on a business unit level, as well as our long-term projected growth rate.","With regard to the dividend, the Sempra board voted to increase our annualized dividend by 6% to $2.80 per share. Given our target payout ratio of 45% to 50%, this increase allows for a smoother path towards payout in 2019 when a full year of Cameron Liquefaction earnings is expected to begin. The increase in the dividend reflects the confidence we have in our long-term growth, and it's consistent with our commitment to grow the dividend. To reiterate Debbie's message at the beginning of this call, our underlying businesses are performing well. We are executing on our development projects, and we are on track to achieve results in the upper end of our expected 9% to 11% earnings per share growth rate for the period 2014 to 2019.","With that, we will conclude our prepared remarks and stop to take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will take the first question today from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI, Research Division","A couple of questions. First one is when you look at the impact of FX for fiscal year '15 versus fiscal year '14 using the assumptions that you're making, year-over-year how much of a headwind is that?","Debra L. Reed","I'm going to have Joe address the FX issue. As you know, we have FX going one way in South America and FX going the opposite way in Mexico, because the Mexico FX is related to Mexican tax code. And since we have dollar-denominated contracts in Mexico, but we pay the tax in the peso, it kind of creates a natural hedge. But I'll have Joe talk about the 2014 to 2015.","Joseph A. Householder","Greg, thanks. It creates some modest reduction in our South America utility earnings because we're using the year-end forward curve for the year, and that creates some downward pressure. But we've seen in the last several years that the Mexican tax pretty much offsets it. But we don't -- we're not providing any details at that level. [indiscernible] it's 1 million -- it was $1 million this year.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI, Research Division","Okay. So all things equal, you're not building in a big headwind from FX net-net?","Joseph A. Householder","No.","Debra L. Reed","No.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI, Research Division","Okay. I just wanted to be sure.","Debra L. Reed","And let me just be clear that when we do that, we look at the forward curves and we look at what is -- what the market curves are and that's what we put in our plan. So we don't do numbers that are not consistent with what the market curves are.","Joseph A. Householder","And the natural hedge from this, as I said before, works really well when all 3 currencies kind of move in tandem at the same time, and that doesn't always happen, but that's what we've witnessed the last several years.","Operator","We'll now go to Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Just a question with regard to the growth rate and going to kind of the upper end of the 9% to 11%. Is that on the basis that you gave at the Analyst Day last year, where you're only including Cameron for 2019? Or is that on kind of a more normal basis where you're including all the businesses for 2019?","Debra L. Reed","Okay. When we gave you the 9% to 11% last year, it was looking at the composite growth rate for Sempra as a whole, and it includes Cameron trains 1 through 3. And we're going to go through this in detail with an update at the Analyst Meeting. But as I said in my prepared remarks, with where we are now and some of the additional project opportunities we've already contracted, like pipelines in Mexico, the REX uplift and all, we feel that in the 2014 through 2019 period, we would be towards the upper end of that range. And we will go through how we get there. And I think you'll see at the Analyst Meeting that we have quite high visibility to the achievability of the upper end of that range. And then we also have quite high visibility of some additional upside that could either make that range higher or could extend that beyond 2019. And we'll talk about all of that in detail at the Analyst Meeting.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. And then my other question is just, I'm sure at the Analyst Day, you'll talk more about the LNG export environment for new contracts, but maybe if you can give us a little sense of the likelihood that -- when should we expect that you might have some kind of commitment to MOU for additional LNG export growth for Cameron 4 and 5 or others?","Debra L. Reed","Well, I think you should maybe use the process of 1 through 3 as an example of how it's most likely to roll out for 4 and 5. And you have to basically come up with a conceptual design of the facility to be able to kind of price out the facility. That's kind of what where we are right now with our FERC prefiling that we just made on trains 4 and 5 at Cameron and our DOE FTA filing. And then that's when you can really start your commercial activity because you have a project you can talk about that has some conceptual framework around it. So the active marketing really begins right around now, and we have had numerous contacts with customers. And on -- about all 3 of our projects, there remains a lot of interest, as I said in my remarks. And we'll talk about the groups of customers and their interest in each of the projects and what drives their interest in each of the projects in more detail at the Analyst Conference. Mark, did you want to add anything to that?","Mark Alan Snell","Yes, the only thing I would say is that we are talking actively with customers, but we need to do some of this preliminary work and engineering so that we can get a better ballpark on what the pricing and cost will be. It's very hard for them, obviously, to commit to something if they don't know what it's going to cost. We're highly confident that, especially with trains 4 and 5, that we'll be a low-cost provider and we think that will position us well for additional volumes. And then with -- at ECA too, as well, we believe we can be a relatively low-cost provider given both the existing facility and the transportation advantages that being on the West Coast has. So I think we're coming into the market with 2 projects at least that are -- that should be at the low-end of the cost scale of what people are looking at. And then we have a big opportunity at Port Arthur to build a kind of a big facility, and it could even be a multiuse facility. So I think we're pretty excited about the opportunities that we have in front of us, and we think as we progress during this year with the studies and the engineering work, the things that we need to do to get permitted, that we'll be in a good position to sign up people.","Operator","We'll now go to Chris Turnure with JPMorgan.","Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a follow-up on the last question. If we look back to the 2012 process for trains 1 through 3, could you just walk us through kind of the ultimate offtake agreements there? I know there were just commercial development agreements at that time, but my understanding was the 3 counterparties were each signed up for 1\/3 of the ultimate capacity and that they did not, at that time, know what they would do to sell that gas in any kind of firm way. So does that differ at all from this time around and where you are in the process now","Debra L. Reed","No. I think the process would be quite similar. I mean, we filed our FERC prefiling and our FTA at DOE, and then that helped define the project. And then a few months after that, we had the MOU, I think it was actually about 6 months after that, 5 months after that, we had the MOU with those parties. And we had the structure that's framed up for Cameron's trains 4 and 5, because it's very much like the structure of Cameron's trains 1 through 3. So Mark, do you want to just go in more detail?","Mark Alan Snell","Yes, to give a little -- to shed a little more light on that. So when we did the first 3 trains, we've started the FERC process and went through this, and we had agreements with partners that, subject to certain conditions, they would sign up for firm capacity. And so we're moving -- as we move through that process and as we got various permits, including our non-FTA, we got our fixed price construction contract and we got a handle on ultimate delivery, those we met some of the conditions precedent and then those commitments to take that capacity became legally binding at a point in time. It'll be similar to that here. The difference here is that we already have all of the operating agreements in place. We know how the facility is going to operate. We know how we're going to share costs. We have all of those kinds of agreements done. So a lot of the heavy lifting has been done, and it's really a matter of our partners marketing the extra capacity that they -- the extra LNG that they would produce, and ourselves, because on the expansion, we have the right to take 50% of the capacity subject to the same operating and arrangements that are in trains 1 through 3. And so our plan is to do that and for us to sell that capacity or LNG in the market, and we're working to commercialize that option. So it will -- it's very similar to the first one, but it is slightly different.","Debra L. Reed","The other thing that I would say different this time, is the first one it was Sempra doing this, and now it's the joint venture that is doing this. And so the decision that was just made to make these filings was the joint venture partners in addition to Sempra making the decision to move forward.","Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. That's very helpful. And then just to be clear, that point of kind of legal no return for the counterparties to commit after the different kind of domestic logistical hurdles were reached was the MOU, not the commercial development agreement?","Mark Alan Snell","Yes. Actually, the point of no return is typically the -- what we call FID, the Firm Investment Decision. So when we sign a contract to extend the construction to trains 4 and 5, when we commit the contracting dollars, at that time we'll be making a firm investment decision and we'll have all those commitments in place. That's usually quickly after that MOU kind of opportunity.","Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just to transition back to the expansion of trains 1 through 3, I guess you mentioned that with the FERC process you had known how potentially big it could be in terms of capacity. But then when you filed the DOE applications, you did not know that or you filed for a smaller amount. Was there kind of a political ramification to that where you wanted to be more conservative and not raise a red flag? Or did something change on the kind of engineering and design or end market side that made you want to expand it?","Debra L. Reed","No. This something that you're seeing with most of LNG facilities. When most of us filed at DOE, we filed based upon what you thought the actual average annual production was going to be. So at that point, we filed at 12 Mtpa. And then at FERC, they really wanted the nameplate capacity of the facility, which for us, for those 3 trains, was 14.95. And so we got the approval at FERC for the 14.95. We went back, and now, are reconciling the DOE permit to that. And you've seen that from several other of the parties that have already gotten their permit. In fact, I think Freeport just got there the other day for a reconciliation of the 2. So it's fully expected. Others have gotten it. It's not anything other than how the numbers were calculated.","Operator","Michael Weinstein with UBS is next.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Given the recent outcome in the CFE awards and considering that, along with the growing solar portfolio, just wondering how those 2 things impact your decision on TRV versus MLP? And how it might be coloring the decision one way or another?","Debra L. Reed","We're going to talk about our structural decision at our Analyst Conference, and we're going to go into all of those details at that time. I would just say that we're very much aware of our assets. We're very much aware of how those assets might fit into the structure. And what we're looking for, as we're looking at structures and the possibility of whether we go forward with this or not, is to -- what adds the greatest value to the Sempra shareholder and what structures would align best with our strategy? And so, we'll go through that at the analyst meeting so that you can have an understanding of how we're thinking about it, and I'd prefer not to say anything further today.","Operator","And we'll now go to Matt Tucker with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Matthew P. Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just to follow up on the expansion in the capacity of Cameron trains 1 to 3, just wanted to clarify that you had not included that capacity in the earnings guidance you've given previously? And then secondly, how does that capacity work with respect to your existing contracts? Would that be -- does that fall under those contracts? Or would these be like spot cargoes? If you could just comment on that.","Debra L. Reed","Yes. First, let me say that, as I mentioned in my remarks, that these trains 1 through 3, the incremental capacity from those trains happens after the facility is up and operational and producing where you don't have as much shutdown, you don't have as much opportunity, I mean, for maintenance and things like that, and that you have greater production. And that would go beyond the 5 years in our plan. And so the numbers that we've given you, where we gave you $300 million to $350 million a year on average, that's what we would still anticipating in the early years of our plan. And then over time, we would be able to have some uplift potential, providing that we can manufacture from the plant more than the 12 Mtpa and that our customers are willing to take that and export that. And the terms of that have all been part of our original contract, how that gets calculated. And as I said that we just gave you a rough number of, if you added 1 Mtpa per year of export, that, that would be about $30 million upside to us when it would occur. It's not in our planned numbers, it's not part of the $300 million to $350 million, it's upside to that, but it would not be in our 5 year-plan period. So that's why I try to make it clear because we made these filings, they're public. We wanted to be fully transparent and ensure you understood exactly what we were doing.","Matthew P. Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Understood. And then could you comment on how your discussions with potential customers for your LNG expansion plans as well as your confidence in the viability of these projects has changed in light of this recent drop in oil prices versus the discussions you were having when oil was in the 90s.","Debra L. Reed","Yes. The thing that I would say is first off, the buyers of these facilities are looking at 20- to 25-year contracts. So spot oil prices are not a determining factor for them in terms of looking at a long-term investment in these facilities. If that was the case, gas prices have gone down a lot, too. But how our customers look at this is they look at having a portfolio of LNG assets to meet some of their needs. The world demand in LNG is expected to increase considerably over the next 10 years. And they're looking at having LNG that can provide that need that gives them some optionality. And the things that have been really good about the U.S. projects are that they allow freedom of destination for export, which has not been true with some of the other contracts. And probably even more importantly than that, they have a liquid hub with upstream development that's already been there, with a robust pipeline infrastructure, with -- E&P work that someone else is paying for. And then they have a Henry Hub tradable point. So from the standpoint of our customers, they're very interested in having the opportunity to acquire LNG that has that kind of flexibility to it, and that's what we hear back. And then what we also hear back is that some of the customers like Port Arthur, because they could take equity there and that they could do a multipurpose facility. Some of the customers like Cameron trains 4 and 5 because they feel that it would be -- it's one of the lowest-cost projects that's been done and that for Cameron trains 1 through 3, 4 and 5 should be somewhere similar and that they see this optionality that I talk about. And some of them like ECA because they like the idea of a West Coast facility that could be built and access markets without going through the Panama Canal. So you have customers with different interests and different needs for the facility. And there's been a great deal of customer interest in the facilities. And LNG and oil are not fungible fully, so that Tokyo Gas is going to need gas. They can't use oil. So it doesn't really matter what the cost of oil is in that regard. And so I think there's too much connection to that because of the way pricing was done. The other thing I would say is that many facilities, if you looked at the price of oil today and you looked at tariffing on that basis, they could never get built because their just cost to build that facility would not be justified on an oil-linked price today. So if anything, we think it improves the competitiveness of some of the projects that are in the U.S. Mark, do you want to add anything to that?","Mark Alan Snell","I would just summarize by just saying on the -- you've got 2 parts to this, the consumption side and on the consumption side, natural gas, once you've made the commitment to natural gas as a fuel for generation or industrial usage, you're not switching back and forth between oil and natural gas. So the price of oil, other than the old crude-linked formulas, is really the only connection. It doesn't have that. And then on the supply side, there is a big advantage to the U.S. LNG because the biggest advantages -- the commitment that you need to make to buy LNG from the U.S. is less than it is than in most other places because all of the upstream development's already in place and you don't have to commit to pay for that over 20 years, it's already there. So you're really only committing to the facility, and that's a big advantage for customers on the supply side. So I think if you just think of it that way, you'll see that the U.S. LNG will remain competitive for a long time.","Matthew P. Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to ask one more on the Mexico pipeline opportunities. You talked about the roughly $1.8 billion in CapEx on these upcoming 4 bids this year. I know you've said in the past you're not baking any of that into your long-term earnings guidance. So from that perspective, anything you get would be upside. But I suspect you'd be fairly disappointed if you don't win anything. And if that's fair, what would you be happy with? What -- how can we kind of gauge success on those bids?","Debra L. Reed","What I would be happy with is to get them all for the kind of returns that we would like to have. So I mean, that's -- it's not how many we get, it's how profitable they are. And we run our business to provide shareholder value. And when we lose a bid, we look at it and we say, would we have wanted to have it for that? And most times I will tell you, we say no, that's not something we would have done because we have other ways we can invest our capital that will give us higher return. And so for us, it's about the discipline and the biddings and about -- we would be, obviously, disappointed if we don't get some of these. But as you've correctly stated, we don't have these in our plan, so it would be upside.","Operator","And we'll now go to Faisel Khan with Citi.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","On the -- just a couple of questions on the operating results and then some broader questions. First question, on SoCal, SoCalGas, I understand the sort of movements around taxes there and the tax benefits last year versus this year. But if I go above the line to sort of operating income or EBIT, or even for that matter, operating margin, it looks like year-over-year in the quarter, it looks like, basically, operating profit was flat year-over-year. So I mean, I'm just trying to see how the growth is coming through at SoCal with all the capital you guys are spending in the business?","Debra L. Reed","Yes. I'm going to have Joe talk about that. But I will say that 2014 was kind of a transition year. We were waiting for the PSEP decision to come out and starting up on a lot of the CapEx that you're going to start seeing flowing through the plan. So let me have Joe talk in particular about the year-over-year. And then Dennis is here, and he can talk about kind of what he's looking at and some of the changes in 2015 over 2014.","Joseph A. Householder","Faisel, yes, when you look at the tables -- I guess that's what you were looking at, is the tables.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, the supplementary tables.","Joseph A. Householder","And one thing that these tables -- yes, one thing that they don't show is that last year, we had still some of the retro income from the rate case delay, and so these throw you off. When you look at that, it looks like $124 million, $124 million. But last year, there was income in the numbers from the retroactive piece. And so they actually do have nice growth from year-to-year and the taxes -- between the 2 utilities, we had like $20 million of tax benefits last year and $21 million this year. It just happen to be between the 2 utilities. If you look at the 2 utilities in total, there's nice growth. But I'll let Dennis respond if there's anything else in there. But you had at least $25 million in revenue impact last year from the retro and some depreciation impact. So actually, their numbers look better than they do on the sheet. Dennis?","Dennis V. Arriola","Faisel, what I'd say is with the capital that we're spending and as Debbie mentioned, in '14, we're really well-positioned for the growth that we're going to see in '15. With PSEP now fully charging forward, you're going to see a full year of earnings related to that. And with the acceleration in advanced meter, that's continuing to go well. The other thing is by accelerating the Advanced Metering program in 2014, we did incur some additional operating expenses there that we won't necessarily have in years -- in 2015 as well. So when we look at those 2 programs plus the continuing growth in AFUDC related to projects like our Aliso storage replacement, we're really confident that the range that we gave out in 2015 [ph] at the analyst conference, we're on track for that for earnings.","Joseph A. Householder","Faisel, this is Joe. It just occurred -- dawned on me. I was actually really thinking about the annual numbers, because the retro piece was in the first quarter. It wasn't in the fourth. But I think the points that Dennis just made addressed the fourth quarter. If you look at the annual piece, I still think if you back out the retro, it looks okay, it looks good.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Okay, got you. And then if I look at the EPS guidance you guys laid out today for '15, what's the assumed sort of tax rate in that number? I think you may have mentioned it and I may have missed it in your prepared remarks.","Joseph A. Householder","This is Joe. The tax rate for 2015 is about 29%.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then going back to the, Debbie, your comments on the extra 2.9 million tons of potential LNG capacity at the plant. So the 12 million tons is what you have contracted. So I just want to make sure I understood this, so you'd have to actually contract for the extra 3 million tons to your existing customers, is that what you were saying in your remarks?","Debra L. Reed","I'll have Mark go through kind of how that works.","Mark Alan Snell","Okay. So if we're talking -- you're talking about the extra tonnage because of the sort of the de-bottlenecking the extra nameplate capacity? Okay. Yes, we actually -- that extra tonnage was contemplated when we did the agreement. So we get paid for making that available. If we make it available and it's used, we get paid a specific fee for that. And that's the calculation that we gave you that said it's about $30 million per ton per annum. And so we won't get that all the time. It will be intermittent. It -- because you do have to maintain these facilities, so there will be some times we'll be taking the facility down and it will earn less in its nameplate capacity, but we will have opportunities to really exceed it. And when we do that, we have a formula for getting paid.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Understood. And then last question for me, just as you guys are thinking about sort of the performance in the stock, which has been great over the last 12 to 18 months, and sort of the -- everything you guys have lined up for the next several years, how are you guys thinking about acquisitions at this point? I mean you've seen some volatility at least in the midstream sector. I mean, what's your philosophy right now on acquisitions? Is the table sort of set and you don't need to -- you're not interested in anything? Or does it make sense to go out and look for things?","Debra L. Reed","Well, we always look for things. And I think that with the markets having a little bit of instability right now and watching what's happening with some companies who really need to raise capital and are looking at getting rid of certain assets, that this is a good time for us to be shopping if there are some good assets on the market, and we look all the time. But what we look at is assets that will add value to the shareholder or give us a strategic advantage where 1 plus 1 equals more than 2, and that we really are very particular. As you said, we have a great growth rate that is just based from the organic growth that we have in our business. We are in a wonderful position where we don't have to make acquisitions in order to grow. So the way we look at it is, is this going to be a benefit to our shareholders? Is it going to add to our portfolio? Is it going to give us greater long-term growth? Or is it going to give us the opportunity to extend our growth beyond our 5-year period significantly above our peers? And that's the way we look at acquisitions. So if we find some things, we're always interested if they fit that.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I guess, the one reason why I'm asking is that a lot of the growth that you have -- you've got set up right now for the company over the next few years or several years, for that matter, is -- are sort of acquisitions or sort of investments you made sort of many years ago that are sort of driving a lot of that growth. So like how do you guys think about trying to set up for the next decade with the portfolio you have?","Debra L. Reed","That's a great question, and we actually have a team that's working on beyond 5 and what are the things that we should be doing to create the foundations for future growth. And that is part of our strategic review process that we're going through. I mean, not -- I guess not too many companies are fortunate enough to have the visibility 5 years out to the growth [ph]. And what we want to do is set it up so that we have visibility not just 5 years, but 10 and 15 years out, and we are already working on that. It's a great question.","Operator","And we'll go to Mark Barnett with Morningstar.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","So you've talked a lot about the Cameron project. I did want to flip it a little bit back to some of your comments about the opportunity in Mexico. You've kind of addressed this a little bit, but when you're looking at the bid process, you've obviously been successful, you have a recent success, and you're looking back on some of the bids you didn't want and why you didn't get them, talking about the returns process. But just wondering if how does it -- how final does this bidding process feel to you at this point? Feedback from the CFE, improvements that you'd like to see. Is there anything, I guess, in the process itself that would make it, I don't know, would make it easier for you to evaluate these projects?","Debra L. Reed","I'm going to ask Mark to answer that. We've gone through the full analysis of the bids and I would say that the -- that the bidding process is a pretty solid process, from what we see. And it's pretty clear. And I would say the U.S. pipeline bids were not as clear at the beginning, but they became clearer towards the end. The one thing that I think, and it was said on our IEnova call today, that we're all having to look at a little differently, is that when they bid these pipelines, they bid them to a certain capacity. And what many of the bidders are doing is looking at beyond that capacity that's going to be contracted and what is the market potential to add compression or to broaden the opportunities on the pipeline. And so I think that's one thing that we're seeing from bidders now is that they're looking not just at the first contract, but what could you do to grow that. Mark, do you want to...","Mark Alan Snell","Yes, I'll just elaborate a little bit on that. I would say one of the things that we're seeing from the bid process as a whole, it's actually quite good. It seems to be relatively -- it seems to be fair. They're looking at the right things and they kind of break it into 2 parts. There's a capital part and then the net present value over the future payments that the customer would take, whether that's CFE or PEMEX. So they've done this in, I think, a logical way. But to Debbie's point, one of the things that I think that will necessitate winning bidders to do in the future is to anticipate some additional revenue and capacity that would be used by the market, because all of these will be open access pipelines. They will eventually attract other customers and you got to kind of figure that into your net present value of your cash flow stream. And so, I think that it's going to keep a competitive process for Mexico. I guess the thing that I would add to that -- so I think we're looking at that and I think we can make adjustments for that. But I do think the thing that's most important is we've got these other group of bids that are coming out here shortly, but we have a whole list of other projects that are going to come out during the year. And the most encouraging thing we've seen is, in spite and maybe because of the drop in oil prices, the need for outside investment in Mexican infrastructure continues to grow. There seems to be no reluctance on the part of CFE or PEMEX to get moving on some of these projects because they're critically needed to deliver gas into the bowels [ph] of Mexico, and we really want to make sure that those projects that they're developing down there that are going to use this gas are all moving forward, and they are. And so I think all of this speaks very well for the additional investment. And we are, even though that we watch our returns and we want to make sure that we get a good return on our investment, we're still in one of the best competitive advantage -- in one of the best competitive places to be from having an advantage of just being the incumbent and the largest incumbent. Our relationship with the contractors and the pipe producers and the things that we've been using in Mexico, really, I think, we can be very quite competitive, and I think we'll do well.","Debra L. Reed","So one other thing that we didn't mention is that in addition to the 4 pipelines, they're also putting a bid out for gas supply at Baja Sur. And in that, they're allowing you to construct how you would get the gas there, whether it's by pipeline or it's by LNG. And I think we're starting to see a little more breadth in the type of bids that are coming out, and that pays to our sweet spot -- plays to our sweet spot where we can be creative in how we use the assets that we already have in Mexico and we take those and work them together in a way that puts a really attractive package on the table. So I think we feel very good about this, but we also are going to be very disciplined.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Great. Now that's some really nice commentary. I appreciate that. And maybe to kind of pick up where you mentioned on the competitive advantage side and given how successful you've already been and seem to be so far, I mean, does that kind of change the appetite for maybe partnering with other large multinationals in pursuing some of the larger projects? Is that still an option that you are considering when you look at particular -- the larger bids perhaps?","Debra L. Reed","Yes, I mean, we always look at partners. But what we want to be sure is both partners bring something to the table. In terms of just bringing capital to the table, we feel that we have great opportunities in Mexico to raise capital for this. But if there's something strategic that they bring to the table, that combined with us, would make us more competitive, we'd certainly look at that.","Operator","And we'll go to Winfried Fruehauf with W. Fruehauf Consulting.","Winfried Fruehauf","Assuming the market price for LNG produced at Cameron is petroleum-based or petroleum-related, and assuming current petroleum prices would remain at or below current levels for 5 years, would this, in your opinion, affect the ability and willingness of the offtakers to proceed under the terms of the contract?","Debra L. Reed","If you're talking about the trains 1 through 3, no. I would not expect that. I mean, we have a very tight contract. The other thing, and the way we structure trains 1 through 3, is our customers are our partners. And so we had envisioned that if there was upturns or downturns in the LNG market, the fact that they're paying theirselves is an advantage under this. And so what you have with this is you have some, as you're pointing out, some credit risk. I certainly think GDF, Mitsui and Mitsubishi are very strong credits and that they look at this as a long-term investment for them. So I wouldn't see that, Winfried.","Operator","We'll now go to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just on the -- almost all my questions have been answered, and I apologize if I missed this, but the non-capitalized development costs for the additional LNG projects, what was the amount that you guys are seeing, that you guys are expecting, for that in 2015? And how should we think about what that might look like going forward in the future?","Debra L. Reed","Okay. I'll ask Joe to answer that one.","Joseph A. Householder","Paul, the reason that we are excluding it from guidance, as Debbie mentioned, are severalfold. But we actually are not able to estimate it right now, and that's why we didn't give a number and we didn't put a range for it, because we expect to be spending this money, but as Debbie said, we're going to be disciplined. We also have partners in these projects, and so we are not sure at this point in time how much we're going to spend versus how much we're going to collect from partners. And then as we work through getting customers signed up for MOUs, at some point, we'll be able to capitalize the costs. So we just -- we cannot, right now, estimate the amount that we may ultimately spend. Mark, I don't know if you have anything to add that you'd like to.","Mark Alan Snell","No. I think that's right. We really just can't estimate it now, and because of the difference in capitalization or expense, we just thought it would be best to exclude it.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. So you're just calling it out...","Debra L. Reed","One thing also, I just think from a transparency standpoint that you'll be able to see this because we'll be reporting earnings and you'll be able to see, as we're reporting, how much we're spending. And then -- so it makes it more transparent to you, and I think that's a positive way to handle it. When you can't really estimate something and it's something that's really leading up to your FERC filing, and then you guys will be able to see.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. I understand that, I don't want to make too much of it. I just was sort of wondering though, how long do you think this will be a separate issue that you guys will be calling out, just the...","Debra L. Reed","No. I mean, what we're looking at is we're looking at getting the filings done this year on all of these. So this is the expenditures that would occur before the filing and a lot depends on, as was said, when you get partners, when you get MOUs and what the capitalization policy is versus the expense policy. And the fact that we have 3 going at one time this year is quite unusual. So I wouldn't see this as being an ongoing thing and it's really expenditures for projects that really will be beyond our 5-year plan, so.","Mark Alan Snell","Paul, one thing is, if we develop these projects beyond this year, likely, all these costs will continue to get capitalized.","Operator","And next is Ashar Khan with Visium.","Ashar Khan","Debbie, one thing, as you go out -- and we look forward to the Analyst Day, but we had one in the beginning of the year for the company. But I hope one thing which would come out is you're doing your strategy is on this Total Return Vehicle, me being a Sempra holder, is how does this enhance my valuation when you select whatever that is? And I'm hoping it is through a better growth rate in earnings or something like that which you can quantify that this vehicle would provide valuation uplift to the parent company, which has been somewhat missing in what we saw earlier this year. I hope that comes out very clearly as you pursue this path that we, as Sempra shareholders, what are we going to get by having this TRV vehicle?","Debra L. Reed","Well, if we decide to do a TRV, then how we explain that -- we have heard this from a number of our investors and it is one of the most important things on our mind in consideration about this. And if you go forward on it, is where is the value creation for the Sempra shareholders? Where does that come from? Obviously, that -- there are all sorts of rules regarding communication and what you can do and what you can do when. And if we decide to go forward with this, we have to comply with those rules. But we hear you. And that if we decide to go forward, that I hear what you're saying, and that we will make every effort to address it.","Operator","And Michael Weinstein with UBS has a follow-up question.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a quick follow-up. I think you were alluding before to a possible decoupling of LNG pricing from oil pricing, given the drop in oil on the spot market. I'm just wondering if that is indeed what you're trying to say and what you're seeing out there, that we might be seeing a natural decoupling?","Debra L. Reed","Yes, to some degree. I'll have Mark talk.","Mark Alan Snell","Yes, it's -- look, there are numerous LNG contracts around the world that are linked to oil prices and they call it the crude cocktail price or you've heard those terms. But the change that's coming, that's happening is really not one of a decoupling, but it's diversification which is going to -- that's entering another mix into this, and that is a Henry Hub-based LNG price. So most of -- in fact, all of the LNG so far, I think that's been sold out of the United States, has had some kind of index back to Henry Hub. So it's giving the purchasers a mix in their portfolio of a different pricing, and that was very popular, obviously, when crude was very, very high. But the popularity hasn't diminished because crude has gone down in price. I think there is a big desire by the -- especially the Japanese and the Koreans, to diversify their pricing mix and to have some different points -- different pricing points. So I think that's purely what it is. And it's a very small percentage now of their overall mix. It's growing. But we're not anywhere near where they are full up with Henry Hub-based price. I think there's still a lot of room to go.","Operator","And that will conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn it back to Debbie Reed for any additional or closing remarks.","Debra L. Reed","Well, thanks, again, for joining us today.

Earlier this morning, we reported first-quarter earnings of $236 million or $0.97 per share, compared with $254 million or $1.05 per share in the same period last year. All of our businesses performed well, and we're on track to meet our earnings guidance for 2012, which is $4 to $4.30 per share. You'll note that this is the first quarter of reporting our financial results under our new operating unit structure.","We now have 6 reporting segments, which include our 2 California utilities, SDG&E and SoCalGas. We have 2 reportable segments within Sempra International, the South American Utilities and Mexico segments. And finally, we have Sempra U.S. Gas & Power, which consists of the Renewables and Natural Gas segments.","Now, let me hand it over to Joe so he can take you through some of the details of the financial results beginning with Slide 4.","Joseph A. Householder","Thanks, Debbie. At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the first quarter were $105 million, up from $89 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase in earnings was primarily due to higher equity AFUDC earnings compared to the year-ago period, driven by the construction of the Sunrise Powerlink project that is very near completion.","Moving on to Southern California Gas, first quarter 2012 earnings were $66 million, compared to $68 million in the first quarter of 2011. I'd like to point out that until we receive final decisions in the SDG&E and SoCalGas general rate cases, we will be recording revenues based upon our 2011 authorized levels with no attrition plus an adjustment for the actual incremental costs of wildfire insurance premiums at SDG&E. Once those general rate cases are resolved, we will expect to -- which we expect to occur in the second half of this year, we'll record the cumulative impact of the decision from January 1 through the quarter in which the final decision is issued.","Now let's go to Slide 5. Within the Sempra International operating unit, we have 2 reporting segments, as Debbie just mentioned. At our South American Utilities, which includes the electric distribution utilities in Chile and Peru, earnings were $40 million in the first quarter of 2012, that's up from $22 million last year. The $18 million increase was due to higher earnings as a result of the acquisition of the controlling interest in our 2 South American utilities in April 2011. Our Mexican operations include the Energia Costa Azul LNG terminal, natural gas pipelines, the joint venture we have at Pemex, the Mexicali natural gas fuel generation plant, as well as a small natural gas distribution business.","For the first quarter of 2012, the Sempra Mexico segment produced earnings of $37 million compared with $39 million in the same period last year.","Now, please turn to Slide 6. In the U.S. Gas & Power business, our 2 reporting segments are Renewables and Natural Gas. The Renewables segment represents our U.S.-based wind and solar business. The Renewables earnings were $10 million in the first quarter this year, that's up from $4 million in the same period of last year on a restated basis to reflect the change in accounting method for projects that we have with investment tax credits. The restatement reduced first quarter 2011 earnings by $4 million, which is $0.02 of earnings per share. As we've previously mentioned, beginning in the first quarter of 2012, we are using the deferral method of accounting for these credits.","In the Natural Gas segment, which includes our storage and pipeline assets, the Cameron LNG terminal, the 1,250-megawatt Mesquite natural gas fuel generation plant and the small natural gas distribution business, earnings were $1 million in the first quarter of 2012. The decrease in earnings of $62 million compared to the prior-year period was primarily due to the expiration of the CDWR contract.","And with that, I'll hand the call back to Debbie.","Debra L. Reed","Thanks, Joe. Now, I'd like to update you on some of the key activities within our businesses. Starting with our California utilities. Last month, we and the other major utilities in California, filed our application in the cost of capital proceedings, seeking approval of a new proposed cost of capital to be effective in 2013. In these proceedings, the CPUC determines the appropriate and reasonable rate of return necessary to attract capital. This compensates the utilities for their business and financial risks and promotes continued safe and reliable operations. Both SDG&E and SoCalGas requested adjustments to their capital structures and the authorized cost of debt, preferred stock and return on equity.","SDG&E requested a decrease in the overall rate of return from 8.4% to 8.2%, reflecting a lower cost of funds raised by the company since its previous proceeding in 2007. The proposal included a decrease in return on equity from 11.1% to 11%, and an increase in the common equity component of its capital structure from 49% to 52%.","SoCalGas requested a decrease in the overall rate of return from 8.68% to 8.42%, also due to the lower cost of funds raised since its last adjustment in 2003. The proposal included a slight increase in the return on common equity from 10.82% to 10.9%, and an increase in the common equity component of its capital structure from 48% to 52%. Both utilities also proposed to continue mechanisms that automatically adjust the cost of capital until the next proceeding, proposed for 2016. The mechanisms would trigger adjustments in the event of market changes that exceed certain measurement levels. SDG&E currently has the same mechanism as Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric that propose a safeguard provision to protect against extreme changes in interest rates. SoCalGas currently has a different adjustment mechanism that is based on U.S. Treasury. The other large California utilities used a mechanism based upon utility bonds, and SoCalGas has also requested to use utility bonds. SoCalGas also proposed the safeguard provision against extreme changes in interest rates.","We expect the final decision in the cost of capital proceedings by the end of this year, which will be effective in January 2013.","I'd also like to remind you that for SDG&E, this cost of capital filing only covers CPUC jurisdictional assets. SDG&E's electric transmission assets are regulated by the FERC, which currently has an authorized return on equity of 11.35% on actual equity. The currently authorized FERC return is effective until September 2013.","Please turn to the next Slide. Now, on to some of the other key regulatory proceedings. In San Diego Gas & Electric's and Southern California Gas Company's general rate case proceedings, opening briefs were filed last month and reply briefs are due in May. We expect the decision in the second half of this year, which will be retroactive to January 1 of this year.","Turning to our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan. Last month, the commission approved memo account to track the project costs at SoCalGas and SDG&E, and also transferred the proceeding into the Triennial Cost Allocation Proceeding, or TCAP, which is a natural gas transmission and storage rate design proceeding.","And finally, at San Diego Gas & Electric, construction of Sunrise Powerlink is now nearly 90% complete, and we expect that it will go into operation this summer. When completed, Sunrise will add about $1.2 billion to SDG&E's FERC rate base, which includes the impact of bonus depreciation. None of the project costs are currently in rate base, but once the line is operational, we'll transfer the projects of work in progress to rate base.","Now I'd like you to go to Slide 9 for an update on our Cameron LNG export project. We've made excellent progress in moving our Cameron liquefaction project forward. Last month, we announced commercial development agreements with Mitsubishi and Mitsui. These agreements commit the parties to fund the engineering and permitting of the liquefaction project. In addition, the commercial development agreements are the precursor to the tolling agreements and equity agreements. The project we are developing is a 3-train, 12-million-tonne per annum liquefaction facility. We have already agreed upon the key commercial terms of tolling agreements with Mitsubishi and Mitsui for a total of 8 million tonnes per annum from 2 liquefaction trains.","This morning, we also announced that we have reached an agreement with GDF SUEZ for the remaining 4 million tonnes per annum of capacity. On the permitting and approval front, we initiated the FERC pre-filing process earlier this week, and we expect that the FERC approval process will be complete in the second half of next year. And our application with the Department of Energy to export to non-free trade countries is pending. We previously received approval from the DOE to export to free-trade countries.","I'm very pleased with the early progress that we've seen with the Cameron export project, and I look forward to updating you in the future as we take steps towards making this project a reality.","Before we move on to the summary, I also wanted to mention that the CPUC approved SDG&E's power purchase agreement with 156-megawatt Energ\u00eda Sierra Ju\u00e1rez Wind project that we are developing within our Sempra Mexico business. We expect to develop this as a joint venture and to start construction this year following the receipt of the remaining authorization, including those from FERC and DOE.","Now let's go to the final slide. I'm very pleased with the results of all of our businesses for the quarter. We continued to execute on our strategy throughout the quarter and made significant progress on our key initiatives. We are on track to meet our guidance of $4 to $4.30 per share for 2012, and believe that we have a clear path to achieving 6% to 8% earnings growth over the long term.","Now with that, I'll stop and open up the call to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just wanted to talk about the Southwest merchant gas-fired assets. Given the SONGS outage and just with low natural gas, do you have any just updates or implications for the performance of those assets or just general interest in those assets?","Debra L. Reed","Well, I would say that there has been a lot more interest generally in generation in the Southwest. There are a number of RFPs that are out right now or coming out in the very near future, so we'll get long-term contracts for generation. Some of that is associated with the ones with cooling issues, some of that is associated with looking at possible coal retirement. And I'll ask Mark to add a little bit of color on what's happening in the current marketplace.","Mark A. Snell","Well, clearly with the outage at SONGS and some of the other maintenance issues with some of the other plants in the region, we've had a tighter market than we expect in the -- for this time of year, and as we roll into summer, it looks like we're going to have, I would say, as we look at it today, it looks like we could have a slightly tighter market than what we've experienced in the past couple of summers. So that should have some upward pressure on pricing, but we're not -- we really haven't made any change in our outlook for what we think that business will do for the year. We could be pleasantly surprised, but I think at the end of the day we're kind of sticking to the numbers that we gave you at the analyst conference.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great, That's helpful. And then just on the LNG export, actually this is on Costa Azul. I'm just curious, are you having any discussions on possibly turning that into export or is that not really a focus area right now?","Mark A. Snell","We certainly are taking a look at that. It's an interesting opportunity for us. It has some advantages, as being closer to Asia and not having to go through the Canal and all that. So we are definitely taking a look at it. It isn't -- we don't have as much land there as we do in Cameron, but it is something -- we could handle maybe 1, maybe 2 trains at the most there, but -- it is something that we're exploring, but our top priority is to get Cameron online and to move that forward. And obviously, we took a big step on that today and we're really excited about it, and we think that, that will add tremendous value.","Debra L. Reed","Let me just add that, unlike Cameron, the facility in Baja is fully contracted for 20-plus years. And so, it's not -- for us, the priority is definitely on getting Cameron, which is not fully contracted, fully utilized and producing earnings.","Operator","And we'll go next to Kit Konolige with Konolige Research.","Kit Konolige - Konolige Research, LLC","Couple of questions, kind of following on this. On Cameron, can you give us some perspective on, I think Shaner is -- I think, got their equity infusion and is kind of ready to roll. Can you update us on where they are, and what, if any, implications that has for you guys on a competitive basis?","Debra L. Reed","Well [Technical Difficulty]","Mark A. Snell","The GDF announcement that we have today, kind of, completes the circle for us. So we have all 3 trains now that we have customers for, and we're just going to work forward on moving that. And I think one of the things that where we are, what we feel very comfortable with, is our partners in this project and our major customers are all experienced LNG players that have long customer relationships with Korea, with Japan, with Chile, with places that are some of the biggest users of LNG in the world. And so we feel like we're in a very good position to move our project forward.","Kit Konolige - Konolige Research, LLC","And if I can just follow up on that a little bit, can you then point out to us what you see as -- I think I know generally, but what you see as kind of the next critical steps that we need to keep an eye on? Obviously, ultimately, we need federal government approval to go ahead, and financing, but if there are specific benchmarks?","Mark A. Snell","Yes. Look, I think the things that are -- the big milestones to come forward is, first, let me just remind everybody, that we do have export capability to all the free-trade countries, and that includes Korea, which is a very big user of LNG. The next step is to get the non-free-trade export permit. And we expect to get that, as we've said, sort of later in the year, could be at the early part of next year. But that's something that we've got to get done. We also would need a FERC permit to construct, and we are working on that right now. We would expect to get that sometime later in the year. We are working on the final design and engineering, those kinds of things need to be done to get the FERC permit. So we've got a ways to go, we're just off to a very good start.","Operator","And we'll go next to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I'm sorry if I missed this. You were talking about the MICAM filing that you guys are -- that you asked for a waiver on, I think, and what's the procedural schedule for that? When do you think the CPUC will act on that, or whoever it is who acts on that to give you the waiver on it?","Debra L. Reed","Well, we would anticipate that since we've made our filings for the cost of capital that, that would really take precedent. And that we have had -- we have made a prior filing a couple of years ago at SoCalGas because of the impact of some of the government policy issues on using [ph] in U.S. Treasury, and that was never envisioned when that mechanism was put in place. And so when we made those filings, we had some discussions with the CPUC at the time about us filing for the cost of capital. So they were expecting us to be making this filing. So I think that we will be on the same schedule as all of the utilities, and that would have us having a decision by the end of this year with new cost of capital mechanisms and cost of capital structures going into place on January 1, 2013.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","But is there any idea when they'll actually formally sort of like say that you don't have to file this MICAM letter?","Debra L. Reed","No, I don't know.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, that's fine. And then the wildfire litigation liability seemed to go down, I was wondering what led to that, and what the -- if there was an EPS impact, I noticed on the balance sheet, just what the -- what was going on there?","Debra L. Reed","I'm going to have Joe go through the numbers on the wildfire reserves and litigation.","Joseph A. Householder","Paul, it was mostly payments that were made. We're resolving many, many. -- we're mediating many of these cases, like 60 a month. And so mostly it was about $130 million of payments during the quarter. So it wasn't an adjustment to the reserves so much as it was payments down. There was no impact on the P&L as a result of that.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","And then on the liquefaction, just on the DOE, the issue of potential export restrictions, with non-free-trade agreement of company -- of countries, excuse me. Some companies have in their negotiations with shippers, put that risk on the shipper, if you follow me. In other words, it's not one that the actual terminal owner will have. At least that's my understanding. And I'm just wondering how you guys have approached that with your contracts with the shippers and stuff, if you can tell?","Debra L. Reed","I'll have Mark go into a little bit of color on that.","Mark A. Snell","It's a great question. In the commercial development agreements that we have signed with our 3 customers and partners, they have agreed to a long-term tolling arrangement, which does not include an out or losing that license. So if we were to get the license and lose it or not get it, the long-term tolling arrangement doesn't have an out for that. But the long-term tolling arrangements haven't been signed yet, so there is some -- if we never got it between now and the time that we would sign those long-term tolling arrangements, it may change things. And I think the way we stand now, given the partners that we have, it probably has more to do with the sizing of the facility than whether it actually moves forward or not. I mean, we feel like there's enough of a market currently that there would be a market for the facility even if we didn't get it. But at the end of the day, we expect to get it. It makes the most sense. And frankly, the -- but the long-term implications of that would rest with the shipper. Now that's one of the reasons, too, though that we want them to be partners in the facility because if there was any kind of disruption like that, it's nice to do this as everybody has an equity interest in the facility, and we would work together to make -- to have the right outcomes.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, that's excellent. I think that's great. and then, just finally, any sense as to how much liquefaction does the North American continent can actually handle? I mean, as you know, you're not the only ones who are announcing this stuff. Just sort of any sense we should think about like the natural sort of, just economic constraints there are of just the amount of stuff we're hearing being announced.","Mark A. Snell","Let me take that first, and I think Debbie has a comment on it, too. But I'd -- look, it's a great question, because I think there is an awful lot of concern in the country about exporting a tremendous amount of gas. And I think one thing we all have to remind ourselves is that the LNG market, while it is big, it is a fixed amount, and we have lots of competition around the world to sell that gas to those countries that need it. And so right now, we think that there's a potential kind of excess capacity in the near term -- or excess demand in the near-term, primarily driven by Japan's desire to -- as they've shut down their nuclear fleet and their desire to wean themselves off nuclear and move to gas, and then as the economies pick up, it's probably something like 20 million tonnes a year. And I think what we're talking about is a facility that could be as much as 4 -- and then when we look at some of the other facilities, there's plenty -- there's enough to absorb what could come out of the U.S., but you're not going to be in a situation where we're going to have 20, 30 Bcf a day being exported. It's probably not that big of a market right now.","Debra L. Reed","Yes. I just want to clarify something Mark said, I think he was talking about in CFD versus metric tonnes. Because when you look at the potential for export, it's higher than the 20 number...","Mark A. Snell","Yes. I confused the numbers. Yes. But it is -- the potential is, just Japan alone is probably an excess of 10 million cubic feet a day, 10 billion cubic feet a day, or something like that. So there is some potential for export but it isn't an unlimited market. So I don't think the U.S. has to worry that we're going to have a large share of our gas supply go offshore, that's probably not the case.","Debra L. Reed","And what I was going to say is, yesterday, I'm sure many of you saw that the Brookings Institution published a study, and they looked at an export level of 9 Bcf a day out of that study, and showing very, very minimal impact on gas prices coming from that. And at least their approach was that, it should be open to all parties who can participate in the market. And I mean, I think that's the position we would really like to see adopted, is that this becomes market-based, we think of this as market-based, we have a very competitive facility. And that we will be with our counter-parties that we've signed these CDA agreements, and we will be moving forward with construction and export, if we can have a market-based type of approach like Brookings suggested.","Operator","And we'll go next to Greg Gordon with ISI.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I have a question on LNG. Can we talk a little bit about the cost of capital filing? Specifically, we know that you've asked for ROE at the level that you put in your presentation. But I think, when we look at the trends for authorized ROEs nationally, an ROE of 10.9% or 11% is a bit above the national average, but more importantly there are some cases pending in California, namely, a water case or 2, where it looks like the ROEs could come in demonstrably lower than that. What gives you comfort that in your dialogue with the regulators you are going to be able to articulate the facts that's supportive of ROEs closer to what you filed for?","Debra L. Reed","First of all, let's take a water case as a good benchmark example. If you look at, historically, the differential between energy companies and water companies and ROEs authorized, it is about 100 basis points. So an authorized ROE of water companies in the 10-range would definitely be equivalent to, for energy companies, in the 11-range based upon historical precedent. The risks seen in those businesses are quite different, and so there's always been a much higher ROE granted to the energy companies. I would also say that California have seen the need to have ROE's that will allow us to attract the capital necessary to make the kinds of investments that the State is expecting, in terms of clean energy, renewables, having the 33% renewables contracted, having the balance sheets to support that, all of the infrastructure, the pipeline safety investments that we will be making. And so, I think that, if you kind of look at those facts, I think they do support an ROE that's in the 11-range.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ashar Khan with Visium.","Ashar Khan","My question has been answered.","Operator","And we'll go next to Mark Barnett with Morningstar.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","A quick question on the GDF SUEZ agreement, too many earnings calls to see it, the announcement, yet, but is that also going to include a future equity investment from GDF?","Debra L. Reed","Yes. The way that all the parties that we worked with and signed agreements are, we're looking at making this a joint venture, where we would have most likely 50% ownership, and they would, the 3 parties, have a sharing of 50% ownership. And all of those parties have expressed an interest in taking equity. We haven't negotiated the final terms of that, but that is what's envisioned.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And then, I guess, given the approval last month of the memo account, is any of your pipeline CapEx, has any of that timing shifted a little bit closer into 2012 or are you still kind of comfortable with where you presented at the analyst day?","Debra L. Reed","Yes. We're still looking at 2012 being largely about doing the engineering studies and the planning for the construction, and expecting that the expenditures would be somewhere in the $100 million range for 2012.","Operator","And we'll go next to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Two questions, one related to the utilities. Utilities posted great quarters, especially SDG&E, and especially given the challenge of not having a rate order in hand. If we go back and look at PG&E's first quarter from last year or Southern Cal Edison from first quarter this year, both had pretty significant challenges in terms of year-over-year earnings at the utility. Can you talk a little bit about what the drivers were at SDG&E, was it all just AFUDC, was there a significant change in the O&M level, and significant change in the cost structure, et cetera?","Debra L. Reed","The main driver at SDG&E, Michael, is definitely the AFUDC from Sunrise. That is a significant issue. What I would say though is that both utilities were trying to operate at the revenue requirement that we had last year, because, until you get a decision, that's the prudent thing to do. And so we've had a history of trying to operate our businesses until we get the CPUC decision at the level that has been previously authorized and raised.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","The other thing on the Renewables side here in the U.S. Can you talk about where you see -- what RFPs are kind of out in the market and therefore publicly known for either solar or wind in the desert Southwest, I'm thinking some of the bigger ones.","Debra L. Reed","Mark, do you want to -- the renewable RFPs in the desert Southwest, and what are some of the bigger ones that are out right now?","Mark A. Snell","Well, I guess we wouldn't really talk about the ones that we're currently bidding on. But there are still some several fairly large ones that are out there, and there are some that have been in process for a while that people have had trouble now meeting some of the requirements, and they're coming out for additional opportunities. But we don't, probably, the numbers that we presented at the analysts conference for our fleet are likely to be what we've have been for the rest of the year. We haven't seen -- I don't think anything that would come up now would have happen at least until the following year.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And there are no further questions in queue. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to Debbie Reed for any additional or closing remarks.","Debra L. Reed","Well, thank you, all, for joining us this morning for our first quarter call. If there's any follow-up questions you have, please contact Rick or Scott or Victor, and have a really nice day.","Operator","That does conclude our conference.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead, sir.","Richard A. Vaccari","Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm Rick Vaccari, Vice President of Investor Relations. This morning, we'll be discussing Sempra Energy's Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2012 Financial Results. A live webcast to this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section.","With us today in San Diego are several members of our management team: Debbie Reed, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Snell, President; Joe Householder, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Trevor Mihalik, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer.","Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's reports filed with the SEC.","It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and that we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our fourth quarter and year-end 2012 earnings release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures.","I'd also like to note that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, February 26, 2013, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.","With that, I will turn it over to Debbie.","Debra L. Reed","Thanks, Rick. On the call today, we'll give you our guidance for 2013, review our fourth quarter and year-end financial results, provide an update on regulatory matters at the California utilities and bring you up to speed on some of our key projects.","Let me begin with the announcement we made last Friday that our board approved an increase in our annualized dividend to $2.52 per share or an increase of 5%. This increase highlights our commitment to growing the dividend while allowing the company to achieve top quartile earnings growth. As we noted last year, we are beginning a plan of distributing cash from our international operations back to the U.S., which will result in our payout ratio being higher than our target of 45% to 50% for the next 5 years or so.","Now let me update you on our guidance for 2013. We now expect to earn between $4.30 and $4.80 per share this year. This guidance includes our estimate of the impact from a final decision in our general rate cases, including a 2012 retroactive adjustment, which will be recorded in 2013. The guidance also includes roughly $0.20 per share related to the benefit from a gain on sale of 50% on the Mesquite gas plant, offset by the roughly $0.30 per share of tax expense related to our repatriation strategy. Lastly, the guidance includes the dilutive impact of our proposed equity offering for Sempra Mexico and related costs.","As you may have read in the press release we issued yesterday, we plan to sell between 15% to 20% of Sempra Mexico at a public offering in Mexico and a private offering in the United States and internationally. This offering is expected to close by April of this year and is consistent with the strategy that we've discussed previously of having some local ownership of our international businesses.","As I mentioned, this transaction is fully incorporated in our 2013 guidance. However, securities regulations prevent us from discussing this transaction until the offering is closed. I don't like the idea of having an analyst conference where we cannot fully discuss issues. So I have decided to move our conference until the second quarter after the offering is expected to close. We can then openly talk about results from the transaction and should also have more to share regarding progress on our Cameron JV and our general rate cases.","Since our analyst conference will now occur in the second quarter, we want to give you more data today on our outlook for 2013 and beyond, and Joe will do so after he reviews our financial results for the last year. So let me hand things over to Joe now.","Joseph A. Householder","Thanks, Debbie. I will begin on Slide 4. Earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $293 million or $1.18 per share. Excluding the $25 million after tax receipt from Kinder Morgan related to the sale of its interest in the Rockies Express Pipeline, or REX, adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter of 2012 were $268 million or $1.08 per share. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we reported earnings of $285 million or $1.18 per share, which included a $50 million benefit from the CPUC's approval for the recovery of wildfire insurance premiums at SDG&E.","For the year, we reported earnings of $859 million or $3.48 per share. Excluding the $239 million impairment charge we recorded on REX during the year and the effect of the Kinder Morgan receipt I just mentioned, our adjusted earnings for 2012 were $1,073,000,000 or $4.35 per share. This compares to adjusted earnings in 2011 of $1,054,000,000 or $4.36 per share.","The performance of our business was exceptional for both the quarter and the full year, considering it does not include any impact from the pending general rate cases. Last quarter, we told you that without a final decision in the 2 GRCs, we expected 2012 adjusted EPS to come in around the low end of our guidance range of $4 to $4.30 per share. However, our adjusted earnings were closer to the midpoint of that range of $4.16 per share after excluding the $0.19 per share tax benefit for the change in life insurance holding periods that was recorded in the second quarter.","Now let's go through the results for each of our segments beginning with our 2 California utilities on Slide 5. At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the fourth quarter were $110 million, down from $158 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease is primarily due to the CPUC's approval for the recovery of 18 months of wildfire insurance premiums in the fourth quarter of 2011.","For the year, SDG&E earnings increased to $484 million from $431 million in 2011. This increase was driven primarily by higher earnings from the Sunrise Powerlink and a reduction in tax expense as a result of the change in tax treatment for certain repair expenditures.","Moving now to Southern California Gas. Fourth quarter 2012 earnings were $99 million compared to $79 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. The increase was driven largely by a lower effective tax rate in 2012 due to a change in the way gas pipeline repair costs are handled for tax purposes. Under IRS guidance, certain repair expenditures that are capitalized for book accounting may be deducted from taxable income when incurred, creating a tax benefit under regulatory accounting. This is similar to the issue we discussed last quarter related to SDG&E.","Full year 2012 SoCalGas earnings were $289 million, up slightly from $287 million last year. Please keep in mind that until we receive final decisions on our general rate cases, we continue to record revenues based upon 2011 authorized levels, plus an adjustment for recovery of incremental wildfire insurance premiums at SDG&E based on CPUC's decisions for recovery of prior year's increased premiums. In the quarter the general rate cases are decided, we'll record the cumulative impact of the decision from January 1, 2012.","Now please go to Slide 6. At our South American Utilities, earnings were $46 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to $39 million in the year-ago period. Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2011 were negatively impacted by a $6 million nonoperating foreign currency exchange loss related to U.S. dollars that were held in Chile at the time.","Full year earnings for South American Utilities in 2012 were $164 million compared to adjusted earnings of $148 million in 2011. The 2011 adjusted earnings excluded the $277 million remeasurement gain that was due to our acquisition of additional ownership in these companies. The increase in adjusted full year earnings is primarily due to this increased ownership level.","Our South American Utilities continue to perform very well and grow at levels that exceed what you typically see for U.S. utilities. For the year, our business in Chile and Peru grew their customer base by a combined 3% and electricity sales by a combined 6%, and we expect those trends to continue.","Fourth quarter 2012 earnings for the Sempra Mexico segment were $35 million compared with $80 million in the same period last year. Essentially, all of the decrease was due to a pricing change in an intercompany agreement with Sempra Natural Gas, which became effective in January of 2012. The reduction in Sempra Mexico's quarterly earnings is offset by an improvement in Sempra Natural Gas's performance for the fourth quarter of 2012. The new agreement is a market-based contract where Sempra Mexico records revenues for the sale of the power generated by the Mexicali power plant and pays fees to Sempra Natural Gas for energy management services and for the purchase of fuel.","Full year 2012 earnings at Sempra Mexico were $157 million, down from $192 million last year. The decrease was primarily a result of the intercompany agreement change that I just discussed.","Now please turn to Slide 7. Moving on to Sempra U.S. Gas & Power, the Natural Gas segment earned $19 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. Excluding the $25 million benefit of a receipt related to the REX sale, the segment lost $6 million. The cash received from Kinder Morgan reimbursed us for an economic loss that was resulting from the change in tax depreciation that was triggered by the sale of their 50% interest in the pipeline. The $6 million loss in the fourth quarter compares to a loss of $36 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The improvement in results is mainly due to the change in the intercompany agreement for the Mexicali plant that I discussed in our Sempra Mexico results, offset in part by lower earnings from our U.S. LNG marketing operations.","For the year, Natural Gas lost $27 million in 2012, excluding the impact from REX. This compares to earnings of $115 million in 2011. The decrease is due primarily to the expiration of the CDWR contract in September 2011. You will also recall that Cameron LNG is now part of this segment, and lower gas prices, coupled with the development costs for the liquefaction facility, are affecting our U.S. LNG business, and therefore, the Natural Gas segment.","The Renewables segment generated earnings of $14 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, up from a loss of $2 million in the same period last year. The increase was driven by the addition of new solar and wind assets. Earnings for the year in Renewables were $61 million compared to $7 million last year, also driven by the addition of solar and wind assets.","Now let's move to Slide 8. As Debbie mentioned at the outset, we wanted to give you more color on our outlook for 2013 and beyond. We're very confident in our long-term growth prospects. In fact, we believe that the long-term growth rate of 6% to 8% that we announced to you last year is very achievable with just the expected growth of our core businesses and the projects we recently just announced in Mexico. In fact, as we look at our plan through 2017, we see that about 90% of our projected earnings for that year are either regulated or contracted, giving us excellent visibility into our future prospects.","Additionally, we have many new development activities in each of our businesses. These are highlighted in a blue box on that slide, and these should allow us to exceed the 6% to 8% growth target over time. We would expect to have a CAGR through 2017 of 8% to 10%, assuming we are successful on just a few of these additional development opportunities. And looking forward to 2019, which should be the first full year of operations for all 3 trains of liquefaction at Cameron, we would expect our growth rate from today through 2019 to be closer to 9% to 11% annually, assuming the same success rate on the development projects. We're pleased with our great growth prospects, supported by long-term contracts and regulated assets.","Now please go to Slide 9. We also felt it's important provide you with our business unit guidance for 2013, which we have not traditionally done on this call. The table on Slide 9 provides the buildup by business unit of our new guidance range of $4.30 to $4.80 per share. The earnings ranges for our 2 California utilities include our estimate of the 2012 retroactive impact of our rate cases that will be booked in the quarter final decisions are reached. Once we have the final decisions, we will provide you with a more definitive view of the impact.","Our U.S. Gas & Power forecast includes the benefit from the gain on the sale of Mesquite. It's important to note that we also accelerated the completion of 2 large solar projects in 2012, which resulted in somewhat downward effect on our 2013 guidance for this unit. The international business unit range includes the dilutive impact of our reduced equity ownership in Sempra Mexico and the parent line includes the tax expense associated with our repatriation strategy, which is supporting our higher dividend.","With that, let me hand things back to Debbie.","Debra L. Reed","Thanks, Joe. Now I'd like to provide you updates on our businesses, beginning with the key regulatory proceedings at SDG&E and SoCalGas. In December of last year, we received a final decision from the CPUC in the cost of capital proceeding. That decision granted ROEs of 10.3% and 10.1% at SDG&E and SoCalGas, respectively. Importantly, the decision also granted increased equity ratios of 52% for both utilities.","Additionally, a proposed decision was issued last week in the second phase of this proceeding, which calls for a continuation of the current methodology of the triggering mechanism for a change in the cost of capital. The PD also calls for SoCalGas to now use the same triggering mechanism as the other IOUs in California, which is based upon a utility bond index. A final decision on the second phase of the cost of capital proceeding should be issued in the first half of this year.","We are awaiting a proposed and final decision on our 2 general rate cases. And based on recent communications with the assigned commissioner, we understand there have been some resource constraints at the CPUC, and we should expect the final decision in the first half of this year. We continue to record revenues and manage our businesses based upon 2011 authorized levels, plus an adjustment for recovery of incremental wildfire insurance premiums at SDG&E. And as Joe noted, we will record the entire retroactive impact of the final decisions, including the piece related to 2012, in the quarter in which a final decision is reached.","Moving to SONGS. In the fourth quarter of last year, Southern California Edison, the majority owner and operator of the plant, submitted a plan to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to restart and operate Unit 2 of the facility at a reduced power level for a period of 5 months and then shut it down for further inspection. The NRC has not set out a detailed timeline yet, and we have no assurance about the exact length of time it will take the NRC to review that plan.","The CPUC has also issued an order instituting investigation, or OII, that will determine whether some or all of the revenue requirements for the facility should be removed from rates. This OII has been split into multiple phases and is likely to take several years to be completely resolved. As of the end of last year, SDG&E's total investment in SONGS was $512 million, which includes rate base of $275 million. The remainder of the investment is made of CWIP and nuclear fuels. Additionally, SDG&E recorded replacement power costs of $77 million in 2012.","On our wildfire costs recovery proceeding, the CPUC issued a ruling late last year that essentially kicked the can down the road on this issue. The commission allowed our utilities to maintain their memo account, tracking fire-related costs. So that we may file future applications requesting recovery subject to reasonableness review. We continue to believe that it is probable that we will be permitted to recover a substantial portion of the costs related to wildfire claims through customer rates.","In regards to our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan, or PSEP, all briefs have been filed, and we expect a final decision on our long-term plan this year. As you will recall, we received approval for a memorandum account last year to book costs related to PSEP, pending the final approval of the plan.","Last week, we filed our new transmission formula rate case with FERC. This filing is substantially similar to our current formula rate and ensures that SDG&E earns no more or no less than its actual cost of service, including unauthorized ROE. We have requested an ROE of 11.3% as compared to the current ROE of 11.35%. The requested ROE consists of a base ROE of 10.3%, based on the median of a western proxy group, plus 50 basis points for our membership in the Cal-ISO, plus an additional 50 basis points for business risks unique to SDG&E. The new rate should be effective on September 1 of this year.","Now please turn to Slide 11. Moving now to U.S. Gas & Power. In December of last year, we announced that the cities of Los Angeles and Burbank had approved a 20-year agreement to purchase 250 megawatts of solar power from our proposed Copper Mountain Solar 3 project in Nevada. Construction on this facility should be completed by late 2015.","On our pending sale of a 625-megawatt block of the Mesquite Power Plant, we have received the necessary approvals and believe the transaction should close shortly. As I mentioned, last quarter, the sales price was about $600 per kilowatt and should result in an after tax gain of about $50 million that will be reflected in our first quarter 2013 earnings. We continue to make progress on contracting and -- the remaining capacity and are working diligently to find ways to maximize the value of that asset.","Before moving on, let me give you an update on our liquefaction project at Cameron. In December, we filed our formal FERC application, making us one of only 4 terminals to have done so. The FERC permit process should take about 9 to 10 months from our submission date, and I would expect that we will be granted our FERC permit later this year. We also sent out bid packages to EPC contractors earlier this year and expect to get those bids back and select the contractor in the second half of 2013.","The DOE commissioned a study that was released last December and had a very positive outlook on the prospects for LNG export. Both the comment and response periods for the study have expired, and DOE should now be in a position to review applications and grant permits. While we do not know specifically how DOE will handle the permit applications that have been filed, we are confident that ours is strongly positioned to be among the first to be reviewed and granted.","As I mentioned last quarter, the delay in issuing the results of this report should not have a significant impact on our timeline, and we continue to expect to be ready to start construction on the facility early next year. The facility is now being designed to a nameplate capacity of 13.5 million tonnes per annum, providing an export potential of 12 million tonnes per annum.","This increased capacity has raised our incremental construction cost estimate to $6 billion to $7 billion. The total costs of the facility, including the cost of our original facility, plus interest during construction, financing costs and required reserves, is estimated to be $9 billion to $10 billion.","We now also expect the earnings contribution from the project to be higher than our previous forecast. Sempra's joint venture partners have begun to announce sales to customers of LNG from the Cameron facility, and we now expect the terminal to begin operations in the second half of 2017 with all 3 trains completed by the end of 2018.","Now let's move to the final slide. 2012 was a very good year for our company, but I'm really excited about our future potential to provide strong growth and earnings from very tangible projects. We are confident that we have the right strategy to achieve long-term earnings per share growth of 6% to 8%, with future opportunities that could enhance our growth profile even further. We believe that this profile, in combination with our growing dividend, makes Sempra a very compelling investment opportunity now and into the future.","With that, I'll stop and open up the call to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Faisel Khan with Citi.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","A couple of -- 2 questions for me and I'll get back in the queue. The first one, if you could just repeat the numbers you had on the liquefaction facility. I think your original -- if you go back to what your original estimates were and then what your new estimates were and what the increases are from the original estimate to where you are today, and I understand the higher earnings contribution from the project now that it's a higher cost project. Then I have a follow-up question for that.","Debra L. Reed","Sure. Let me just remind you that when we talked about the plant and the cost of that the plant previously, we did not include any of the interest or the cost that's associated from putting our assets in. So the cost that we were referring to previously was a $6 billion cost, and that was really the incremental of the cost of the facility without the financing cost and -- or capitalized interest cost. That cost now is estimated to be between $6 billion to $7 billion. And the reason for that is that in order to give a steady supply of export at 12 mtpa, our partners wanted the facility sized to 13.5 mtpa so that their actual export could be at that level of 12. And so we upsized the facility on the nameplate basis. The license still remains as a 12 mtpa export, but that gives us the ability to have downtime and still be able to export that on an ongoing basis.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then just -- I know you guys are limited on what you can say on the Mexican IPO. But if I can ask in terms of the strategic rationale behind pursuing the IPO, I think you mentioned was you wanted foreign ownership of these assets, given where they sit. Can you go into a little bit more granularity on that? I mean, is it the country risk that is an issue, or is it that you're growing the assets in that country and so you need to raise equity to fund the capital expansion in that particular area?","Debra L. Reed","Yes. Faisel, due to securities rules, we are not able to talk about that. What I will say is that we are very pleased with our Mexican businesses and the performance of our Mexican businesses. But I cannot talk anything about the offering at all or the rationale behind it, yes.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just wanted to take a look at Slide 8 and make sure I understood the growth outlook, and thanks very much for the clarity that you provided here. It is very helpful. As you think about the baseline upon which you're growing EPS, as you noted in the remarks, you're excluding the earnings benefit from the sort of 2012 adjustment that shows up in 2013. Would that also exclude Mesquite? And I guess what I'm trying to better understand is what would that range be upon which you are projected to grow your EPS? Can you just provide a little bit further color on that?","Debra L. Reed","Yes. The base that we're using, the only exclusion for 2013 from that base would be the retroactive effect of the rate case, and we're not going to quantify that amount. But if you looked at our 2013 estimate, the only exclusion that we're taking out of that for our growth projection would be the 2012 retro effect of the rate case.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, understood. So the -- in the $430 million to $480 million it does have in it the retroactive impact and Mesquite as well, or did I get that wrong on Mesquite?","Debra L. Reed","Yes, that has -- it has -- excuse me, I'm sorry. It has both the retroactive impact of the rate case in Mesquite in the $430 million to $480 million. And the range is wider than we normally would give because we have 2 years of rate case effects coming in to 2013 now because of the delay. Joe, I think you want to added a little a bit of color.","Joseph A. Householder","Yes. Stephen, you're right. Mesquite is in there and that's sort of a onetime thing. But we also have some onetime costs in there in the parent segment related to the transaction that we were talking about a moment ago, with our reduction of our interest in Mexico. So it helps offset that. It's not that big but...","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And just if I could on SONGS. I imagine, again, here, unfortunately, you probably are limited as to what you're really able to say. But I was just curious if you had any -- as you've looked at the procurement situation and the allegations regarding procurement that are being discussed, if you had any further color on the risk inherent in some of these allegations that procurement was done improperly? Or anything further you could say on just the situation with Mitsubishi?","Debra L. Reed","Well, we have had no access to any of the reports that have been published in the media. So I -- we don't have any special insight as to what the allegations are at all. What I can say is that when we look at the facility and we look at the going-forward process, that there's Mitsubishi coverage, liability coverage, and Edison has filed disputing the fact that it should be capped. And so that will be an issue as we go forward as to how much liability coverage Mitsubishi -- or warranty coverage Mitsubishi would have. And then we've also made a filing at NEIL for insurance. And NEIL has previously covered and it is part of the coverage with NEIL to cover replacement power cost under these kind of situations. So I think this will be kind of a prolonged process of trying to get to the root issues. Our focus is to ensure that when the facility is restarted, when Unit 2 is restarted, that it's done so safely. And that is the most critical aspect to us is to ensure that our partner, who is the operator, Southern California Edison, pays close attention to the safety of the restart of that facility. And I think the rest of this will play out over a few years.","Operator","We'll hear next from Neel Mitra with Tudor, Pickering.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","A question on liquefaction. In your slides now, you're saying that it'll be online in the second half of '17. Does that mean that we should, I guess, subtract out the small portion that you've included in the '16 guidance from the last Analyst Day?","Debra L. Reed","Yes. When we looked at -- I think last year, we had something like $20 million or $30 million in for liquefaction. We have like one month's worth of liquefaction, so it was a very small amount in 2016. And now we're looking at it coming on -- it starting in the middle of 2017 and then all 3 trains being completed by the end of 2018.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And second question, just on the parent expense. It looks like in your '13 guidance, it's up about $40 million from the midpoint versus the last Analyst Day. What's changed on that?","Debra L. Reed","Yes. I'll have Joe go through that with you.","Joseph A. Householder","So a couple of things are occurring. As I just mentioned when I -- when Stephen was asking his question, we do have some onetime costs in there related to the transaction with Mexico, and then we have a bit higher interest expense. We moved some things between a couple of the segments, but it's mostly that first item. So it'll be kind of a one -- mostly a onetime issue, and then it won't be the same going forward.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And then it'll come back to kind of what you've guided to in the last presentation?","Joseph A. Householder","Yes.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about capital spending levels or expectations at the utilities, both of them, SDG&E and SoCalGas, going forward 2013 and beyond, just kind of what do you see directionally may have changed since your Analyst Day and just kind of how you're thinking about whether CapEx from here grows from 2012 levels, kind of flatlines, kind of declines, just big picture?","Debra L. Reed","Yes, if you look at the big picture of CapEx that -- what we gave you at last Analyst Meeting is looking pretty good for the 2 utilities, that we spent about $1.2 billion at SDG&E last year and we spent about $700 million or so at SoCalGas last year. And our numbers for 2013 are, at SoCalGas, higher than that because we are now implementing the smart meter program, and we expect to get a decision on the PSEP. And so on the long term at SoCalGas, we gave you numbers last year of $1 billion to $1.2 billion over the 5-year period, those look like pretty good numbers over the 5-year period. And at SDG&E, we gave you numbers last year of $1 billion to -- of about $1 billion to $1.1 billion, which looks to be pretty good over the 5-year period at SDG&E.","Joseph A. Householder","Yes. This is Joe, Michael. Do you see on Slide 8? It says $14.6 billion capital program. But not to upfront the conference because we want to have something to talk about there, but roughly the same percentage is going to be spent in the California utilities as before.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it, okay. And I want to make sure I just understand the accounting for how the rate case -- the delay in the rate case impacts 2013 and whether that has any impact beyond 2013.","Debra L. Reed","Yes. The -- let me just try to go through that and then I have Joe add anything to it. But basically, the only thing that was recorded in 2012 was an increase with the expected wildfire recovery at SDG&E, because we had been granted that numerous times by the commission. And so that was recorded as estimated additional revenues in 2012. Then in 2013, we would record the retro effect of the true-up of the revenue requirement for 2012 in the quarter which we get a decision in 2013, and then we would look at the 2013 amount of retro for the beginning of this year and then record that. And then from that point on, we would record the 2013 revenue requirement that we actually get, and there would not be any other effect in that -- in 2014 and beyond, other than we get attrition. And whatever the attrition mechanism is in 2014, the revenue requirement would go up by that attrition mechanism. And so we'd be back to more of a normal basis. I don't know. Joe, is there any...","Joseph A. Householder","No. No, that's correct.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then final item, how are you thinking now about growth on the U.S. Gas & Power business, meaning you've signed up some of the new contracts on the solar side? Just curious for your views on how much incremental solar growth, how big you want that business to be, and what your thinking is on both wind and gas-fired generation?","Debra L. Reed","Well, we're very excited about the opportunity for that business, especially integrated as the Cameron LNG comes on and some of the other assets that we have that we think will have some uplift with that. So let me have Mark kind of go through that a little bit more detail.","Mark A. Snell","Okay, thanks. Well, look, I think what -- obviously, the big growth engine is going to be LNG. That's the thing that's going to really grow the U.S. Gas & Power business. But until that comes online, I mean, we do expect to -- we've set a goal of about 1,200 megawatts of renewables. We're at about 842 now, and we would expect to reach that goal. We have a lot of projects under development. I think they all look pretty good. That business I think -- look, it's definitely been hurt by lower gas prices, and it's -- and lower power prices. But I think we've taken the appropriate steps to mitigate those realities, and I think you're going to see good growth in that business, especially as  LNG comes on.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Mark Barnett with Morningstar.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","A couple of quick questions, I guess maybe be a follow on to Michael's question about U.S. Gas & Power. I know with the PTC extension, does that kind of increase your appetite for maybe some incremental development outside of what you've talked about explicitly, or maybe some additional M&A in that area?","Mark A. Snell","Well, Mark, it's -- I mean, obviously, it was -- it's a good thing. We have to be careful because the projects have to start in 2013. And unfortunately, the industry as a whole wasn't anticipating the extension, so we've got some catching up to do. But I do think it might lend itself to another wind project or 2.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I guess now -- like a quick question on the equity offerings, not about the offering itself, I guess, but will the kind of -- the 15% to 20%, will that change kind of your debt financing strategy significantly for this current round of infrastructure projects?","Debra L. Reed","We just really can't talk about anything that -- relating to any changes in the business as a result of this. So I just want to be very religious in following the securities rules, and I'm getting the signal from our attorneys that we can't answer the question, so.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I understand. I understand. Well, maybe you can -- this one might not cross any line. Is there a potential to maybe replicate that elsewhere in South -- in your South American businesses. Might that be something to consider, given you mentioned some sort of larger projects down the line?","Debra L. Reed","Yes. I mean we like -- we said previously in the Analyst Meeting, we like the structure that we have in Peru, where we have about 20% local ownership. And we think it's good to have debt and equity capital in the countries where we're doing business. We think that's a very good model. And so we would look at that in Chile. We would look at that anywhere we have foreign assets which we've already done really in Peru. So Chile would be the next area where we would look at that potentially.","Operator","We'll hear next from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just a quick -- a few quick questions. On the LNG marketing operations that negatively impacted the fourth quarter, what was that, and how much was that?","Debra L. Reed","I'll have Joe talk about it. But a lot of this has to do with the timing of cargoes that are necessary to maintain Cameron in its cold state and how those get timed in. So, Joe, do you want to?","Joseph A. Householder","Sure. Paul, I think last year, if you looked at last year's slides, we said there had been some like $18 million of income we made from LNG marketing activities that wouldn't recur, and there's various things as cargo. But natural gas prices slightly impact it. Some higher costs around the liquefaction development cost impact it. But we don't give detail at the segment level even, and particularly at the LNG, and we said last year we weren't going to give more details at the LNG level. But it's an operation that is in this transition, where it's moving from an asset to one that's really going to drive the business. And the size of the Natural Gas segment is going to be close to the size of our International business or SoCalGas. So we're looking forward.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","So it's kind of a timing issue and not something that we should be [indiscernible].","Joseph A. Householder","It's a timing -- yes. It's really -- it was mostly a timing issue between years, making more in one year and less in the other.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then in the balance sheet, the sundry items. I asked about this in the third quarter, and again, it seems like it's jumped a bit here in the fourth. And I'm just wondering what was it that's making it grow by about $100-plus million. And did that impact EPS, whatever that item was or items were?","Debra L. Reed","Okay. I'm going to have Trevor, who is looking at that right now, see if he can give you an answer right now. If not, we'll have someone follow up with you after the call. He's looking.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","While he's looking at that, yes, maybe it's the Rabbi Trust or something. But while he was looking at that, I just was wondering on the LNG, just to clarify this, you guys are spending more, you expect to have higher earnings, there's some change in the scheduling it sounds like, but basically though, the ROI we shouldn't think of being materially changed, is that right? The return on investment with this increase in comps?","Debra L. Reed","Yes. I said the ROI it should -- you should assume it's within the same type of range as we've talked before. I mean, we're looking -- just to give you kind of a general range, we're looking at when all 3 trains are up and operational, in the range of $300 million to $350 million depending -- annually of earnings, depending on what the actual cost of the facility ends up being.","Mark A. Snell","Paul, this is Mark. If you'll recall, last year, I -- at a very early preliminary stage, we said that we would expect earnings of about $300 million. That's now changed to $300 million to $350 million. But I think the most important thing to realize is the additional cost for expansion of the facility is based on, A, number one, better estimates of what it's going to cost. But the expansion of the facility, to be able to operate constantly at 12 million metric tonnes per annum, that was really a decision of our partners. And so they're asking for us to make these modifications in our original thinking and, obviously, we'll -- are paying for those decisions. So this isn't something that we just kind of came up with on our own. This is in collaboration with working with our customers and partners in the facility.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then just on the non-FTA, Christopher Smith, the Deputy DOE guy, made some comments at NARUC that have been sort of -- that I guess have picked up some coverage and what have you in terms of more caution, et cetera, with respect to non-FTA countries apparently. Any -- is that sort of figured into your estimates in terms of approvals and everything? I mean, you guys went over that in your prepared remarks. But I mean do you see any change in this, or is this pretty much in line with what your thinking was?","Debra L. Reed","Yes. I mean -- I think when you look at the DOE report that came out, when you look at the fact that you've had major media all be in support of the non-FTA and then there was recently a meeting with the Prime Minister of Japan with the President who urged the President to move quickly to allow the export for the benefit of Japan, I think everything -- that you're going to always hear some other side of that. But I think the momentum is largely moving in the direction of approval. And I'll ask Mark because he's actually been meeting with some of the elected officials in Louisiana who are very supportive of the project, and I'll let Mark kind of fill you in on what he's hearing.","Mark A. Snell","Look, I think all of the news -- it's -- obviously, there's always -- there's some detractors, but I think most of them have been identified as having some very specific self-interest. I think the vast majority of the reports that are coming out and the people that we talked to are supportive of the -- of exports. But I think what's most important and direct to your question, we expect to get the FTA approval this year. We actually expect to hopefully to get it in the first half of the year, but irrespective of when we get it this year, it isn't changing our schedule at all. We're moving forward on our plans. We've -- we're -- it's really not affecting our timing any -- as long as we get it this year, we'll be fine. So I think that's the important thing is it's not affecting our timing, and we very much expect to get it this year.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And the sundry items, did you guys come up with an answer yet or?","Debra L. Reed","Yes, yes.","Joseph A. Householder","Yes, Paul, we have an answer. I like your detail orientation. For that $150 million increase, only about $31 million of it is really P&L related, which is, as you mentioned, the Rabbi Trust that we talked about last time, which is going up in value as the stock market increases. We also contributed some funds to that, which was about $40 million. And then there was about $20 million of line to credit fees that got put in there, and those get amortized over time. And then we had sort of a gross up of some workers' comp activity, where we put something into that account and also put a liability, kind of grossing up the balance sheet. But really, the only thing that went through the P&L is about $31 million of earnings from the Rabbi Trust.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Is that pretax? Is that after tax?","Joseph A. Householder","That's a pretax number.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","That's a pre-tax number.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ashar Khan with Visium.","Ashar Khan","Debbie, going back to your remarks, pretty comprehensive in terms of questions. Once we get the rate case decision, can we expect then in the following quarter that you tighten the guidance for the year?","Debra L. Reed","Well, the -- what we would plan to do is once we get that decision, look at it, and we would most likely tighten the guidance range at that time, once we've had the chance to have a final decision and analyze it. I think that, yes, that's where we're headed right now is to be able to do that.","Operator","We'll hear next from Michael Goldenberg with Luminus Management.","Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management, LLC","Just to clarify, on the LNG, you're saying ROI will be the same. And it's going to be $300 million to $350 million of earnings, and that's kind of pro rata to what it would have been at 12 and then going to 13 7, so the math works. I just want to confirm that all those numbers are correct.","Mark A. Snell","Yes. It's more related to the cost than it is to the size. But yes, you're on the right track.","Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management, LLC","Okay. And then one question on utilities. The benefit from putting 2012 rate case into 2013, how much is that?","Debra L. Reed","Yes. We're not going to give that type of level of detail. It's in our guidance, and we've done our estimate in our guidance, and we'll let you do your own estimate.","Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management, LLC","Is there anyway to glean from in 2012 how much the fact that you didn't get the rate case impacted earnings? Is that maybe a question you can answer or?","Debra L. Reed","No. I really can't go there. I think you saw our 2012 results. You saw what we had told you in 2012, originally. And if you want to come up with an estimate, I think you can -- you have the kind of the numbers that we have to come up with an estimate.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take a follow-up question from Faisel Khan from Citi.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a few more questions. Do you guys have a CapEx number for 2013? It seems, directionally, looking at the projects that you guys built out last year and the year before, it looks like that number is coming down this year. But if you could give us some details on that, that'd be great.","Debra L. Reed","I have -- I don't know that I have that now to give. We will definitely give you that at the Analyst Meeting when we do that later this year. But it was pretty -- all I can say is it's pretty consistent...","Joseph A. Householder","It'll be very consistent with last year.","Debra L. Reed","Yes, with last year and last year's plan that we gave you. So nothing that is a significant change to last year -- last year's plan.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So even with the powering up of Sunrise and I guess some of the reduction in capital in Renewables, you still expect the CapEx to remain...","Debra L. Reed","Yes, let me just -- remember, at SoCalGas is where we're really starting to spend some money now. And then in Mexico, we just received the $1 billion worth of the pipeline, the 2 pipelines and then another project in the JV with Pemex. And so the total CapEx is not occurring so much in the Renewables space, but that's been now -- had a move to our utility at SoCalGas and then our business in Mexico.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, understood. And then for U.S. Gas & Power, what kind of assumptions are you guys using for the remaining component of your generation portfolio in terms of capacity factors and spark spreads?","Mark A. Snell","Well, again, we just use the forward curve on gas. And I don't know that we've ever disclosed what the capacity factors are, but it's a nominal effect on earnings.","Debra L. Reed","And just remember, not only do we have the 625-megawatt block that sold, but then we've also sold another block starting in 2015. That's 241 megawatts. So we got down to where we own a very small portion...","Mark A. Snell","Right.","Debra L. Reed","Of that facility. And then it hedged, over the next couple of years, close to that 241 megawatts that we sold-forward starting in 2015 for 25 years. So there's not as much. We've done what we told you we were going to do, and we've reduced significantly any of our market exposure to the Mesquite Power Plant, so.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then just -- there's a project that it looks like it's trying to move forward to build an oil pipeline from the Permian Basin into Los Angeles, and some of that traverses along a pipeline that you guys bought from Questar. I was wondering if you guys had any interest, or are you looking at participating in something along those lines or in a project like that?","Debra L. Reed","Well, I think it's funny because we bought that project from Questar and converted it to a natural gas pipeline because we needed it to reinforce our system. I mean, we have not done anything actively on that. We are aware of the project. We'd have to look at the provisions of our rights of way and all of those issues to see if there was anything that we could do in partnership. But it hasn't been something that we've been focused on greatly.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then last question for me, on the cash flow statement. It looks like the last 2 years, you had a working capital drain, $225 million in '11 and $630 million in '12. And I was wondering, does that reverse, or is there some sort of permanent reduction in working capital that's a drag on cash flows?","Debra L. Reed","Okay. I'm going to turn that over to Joe and Trevor to see the reconciliation on the cash flows.","Joseph A. Householder","Trevor, you want to answer that?","Trevor I. Mihalik","Yes. Faisel, your question specifically relates to?","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes. So in 2012, the negative working capital outflows of $630 million, and then in '11, you also had a working capital outflow of $224 million. So I'm just trying to match operating cash flow.","Trevor I. Mihalik","Right. Primarily those -- there's -- those working capital outflows are the reg balancing accounts, as well as the wildfire payments that we received in 2012. That's almost $400 million that came in. So there's an adjustment there.","Joseph A. Householder","Yes. Very significant portion of it, Faisel, is regulatory balancing account changes coming in and out.","Operator","And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ms. Debbie Reed for closing remarks.","Debra L. Reed","Well, thank you, all, for joining us today. We -- if you have any follow-up questions, whatsoever, please feel free to call Rick or Victor.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Steve Davis. Please go ahead.","Steven D. Davis","Thank you, and good morning. I\u2019m Steve Davis, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. This morning, we'll be discussing Sempra Energy's fourth quarter and full year 2011 financial results. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section.","With us today in San Diego are several members of our management team, including Debbie Reed, Chief Executive Officer; Mark Snell, President; Joe Householder, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Bruce Folkmann, Acting Controller.","You'll note that Slide 2 contains our Safe Harbor statement.

Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and the Table A of the financial tables in our fourth quarter and full year 2011 earnings release for reconciliation to GAAP measures. ","With that, I'll turn it over to Debbie, who will begin with Slide 3.","Debra L. Reed","Thanks, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. On today's call, I'd like to accomplish several things. First, we'll review our fourth quarter and year-end financial results. We'll then talk about our dividend increase and I'll give you an operational update on our businesses. ","Now to the financial results.  Earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $292 million or $1.21 per share compared with $280 million or $1.15 in the same period last year. For the full year 2011, we recorded earnings of approximately $1.4 billion or $5.62 per share compared with 2010 earnings of $739 million or $2.98 per share. On an adjusted basis, earnings for the full year 2011 were $1.1 billion, which excludes a gain of $277 million that we reported in the second quarter to reflect the write up in value of our investments in Chile and Peru. Adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2011 was $4.47 compared to $3.93 per share of adjusted earnings in 2010, which is an increase of 14%.","I'm very pleased with our strong results in both the fourth quarter and for the year. Each of our businesses performed extremely well, enabling us to beat the upper end of our adjusted earnings per share guidance for 2011 which was $4.30. ","Now regarding the dividend. I'd like to mention that earlier this morning, we announced that our Board of Directors have authorized a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend, which brings the annualized dividend to $2.40 per share. You may recall that last February, we also increased the dividend by more than 20%. The strong and growing operating cash flows from our utility and contracted infrastructure businesses, we expect to continue to grow the dividend while reinvesting capital to achieve above average long-term earnings growth. ","Now let me hand it over to Joe so he can take you through some of the details of the financial results, beginning with Slide 4.","Joseph A. Householder","Thank you, Debbie. San Diego Gas & Electric earnings for the fourth quarter were $158 million, up from $105 million in the year-ago quarter. The fourth quarter of 2011 included $50 million of earnings related to increased wildfire insurance premium recovery for an 18-month period and $13 million of higher equity AFUDC earnings compared to the year-ago period.","I'd like to point out that in December of both 2010 and 2011, CPUC approved SDG&E's request to recover the increased cost of wildfire insurance premiums. SDG&E has one additional request pending to recover increased wildfire insurance premiums, which we expect the commission to approve in the second quarter. $15 million of the benefit we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 reflects this anticipated cost recovery. Going forward, the anticipated recovery of wildfire insurance is contained in SDG&E's 2012 general rate case.","SDG&E also expects to recover any costs incurred that are associated with the 2007 wildfires in excess of amounts recovered from its insurance coverage and other responsible third parties, as we've disclosed in our 10-Ks and 10-Qs. As of the end of 2011, SDG&E has booked a regulatory assets of $594 million associated with its anticipated recovery.","Full-year 2011 earnings increased to $431 million from $369 million last year. The increase of $62 million was due primarily to $31 million of higher equity AFUDC earnings, net of higher interest expense and $28 million for higher revenues related to wildfire insurance premiums, net of the higher insurance expense.","Moving to Southern California Gas. Fourth quarter 2011 earnings were $79 million compared to $74 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. For the full year 2011, earnings for SoCal were $287 million compared to earnings of $286 million in 2010. ","Now let's go to Slide 5. Sempra Pipelines & Storage recorded earnings of $70 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with earnings of $39 million in the same quarter of 2010. The increase was due largely to $24 million of higher earnings from our operations in South America through the accretive acquisition we closed in April of last year. For the full year 2011, Sempra Pipelines & Storage recorded earnings of $527 million compared with earnings of $159 million in 2010. Excluding the $277 million gain that was recorded in the second quarter of 2011, related to the acquisition of controlling interest in the operations in Chile and Peru, earnings were $250 million in 2011. The increase from the prior year was primarily due to $55 million from the increased ownership interest in South America, $13 million of higher earnings from the Mexican pipeline assets that we acquired in April 2010 and $10 million from nonoperating foreign exchange effects related mainly to a U.S. dollar-denominated cash balance, previously held in Chile. ","Now, please turn to Slide 6. Sempra LNG had earnings of $24 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with earnings of $18 million in the prior year's period. For the full year of 2011, Sempra LNG had earnings of $99 million, up from earnings of $68 million in 2010. The increase for the full year was due primarily to higher earnings from contracted cargoes that were not delivered.  Earnings in 2011 also included $18 million in marketing activities that we currently do not expect to recur in 2012. ","I'd also like to take a moment here to discuss our contract with the Tangguh partners to supply LNG to our Energ\u00eda Costa Azul terminal. We entered into this contract in 2004 and the 20-year contract became effective in the second half of 2009. You may recall that the contract permits our counter-party to divert cargoes to other markets in exchange for a fee. Given the wide disparity between the price of natural gas in Asia and the U.S., we have seen a significant increase in the amount of diverted cargoes and a resulting in increasing our earnings. In light of these market conditions, we have amended this contract to provide enhanced value to both parties, including certainty of cargoes for Sempra and additional flexibility for the Tangguh partners. For Sempra, this will result in more consistent earnings from that contract going forward.","With that said, we currently expect 2012 earnings from LNG to be more in line with our prior guidance of $50 million to $70 million, as the benefit of the contract amendment will be offset by lower natural gas prices. Over the longer term, however, we expect earnings from our existing LNG operations to be roughly $65 million to $85 million per year. As you may recall, Sempra LNG will no longer be a reporting segment starting with the results in the first quarter of 2012, and we do not expect to regularly provide earnings guidance for this business going forward. ","Now, please move to the next slide. Our generation business recorded a loss of $6 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with earnings of $43 million in the same quarter of 2010. The loss in the fourth quarter of 2011 was due to the exploration of the 10-year contract with the California Department of Water Resources, which expired on September 30, 2011, and also to a mark-to-market loss of $9 million. ","For the full year 2011, Sempra Generation recorded earnings of $137 million compared with earnings of $103 million in 2010. The increase in earnings for 2011 was due primarily to an $87 million litigation settlement that negatively impacted 2010 results, and due to the lower earnings from our natural gas plants due primarily to the expiration of the CDWR contract. ","Now, please to move Slide 8. Through the end of 2011, we recognized the investment tax credits from our solar business as a tax benefit in the year that the new capacity was placed in service. This method, called the flow-through method, created an even earnings profile for our solar business. Beginning in the first quarter of 2011, we will begin using the deferral method of accounting for these projects. Under this method, the book basis of the asset will be reduced by the amount of the investment tax credit, resulting in lower depreciation and more  even ongoing earnings as compared with the flow-through method.","I want to stress that this change in accounting method has no impact on the economics of our solar projects. These projects are contracted for 20-plus years with utility counter-parties. The switch to deferral accounting does, however, result in a decrease of approximately $0.40 per share in 2012 compared with the earnings under the old method. The offset to the lower initial earnings will be lower depreciation and higher earnings in future years under the new method.","Taking into account the use of deferral accounting and considering other changes across our business, we are now expecting our earnings per share to be within the range of $4 to $4.30 per share in 2012. And due to strong business unit growth and performance, we continue to expect Sempra's long-term EPS growth rate to be in the 6% to 8% range. ","Now, please go to the next slide. As Debbie mentioned earlier, our Board authorized a 25% increase in our common stock dividend. This takes the dividend to $2.40 per share on an annualized basis, up from the current annualized dividend of $1.92 per share. You may recall that our Board established a target dividend payout ratio of 45% to 50% last year. While we are not changing our long-term target payout ratio, we expect to exceed that level for the next several years, and we do expect to increase the dividend as our earnings grow.","One of the considerations behind the dividend increase relates to the significant amount of earnings from our South American utilities and Mexican businesses, coupled with certain tax position. Historically, we have reinvested those earnings into our international businesses. ","Beginning in 2013, we intend to distribute current earnings of about $300 million to the United States from certain of our international subsidiaries. The additional amount of cash tax that we will pay is expected to be very minimal in the near-term but the tax will largely be offset by net operating losses from bonus depreciation and renewable energy tax credits. While the use of these tax assets is a good economic decision, it will reduce earnings by approximately $0.30 per share beginning in 2013 due to additional booked tax expense.","We expect to use of most of the repatriated earnings to repay debt and, to a lesser extent, to support the higher dividend we announced today. ","The point that I'd like to leave you with is that we have stable and growing businesses, both in the United States and internationally that produce strong cash flows that can support a higher dividend going forward. ","And with that, I'll hand the call back to Debbie.","Debra L. Reed","Thanks, Joe. Now let me update you on some of the key activities within our businesses, starting with our California utility. Last month, hearings concluded in San Diego Gas & Electric's and Southern California Gas Company's general rate case proceedings. The schedule for the rate case, which was issued by the commission late last year, calls for a rate case decisions around March of this year. But now we expect the case to be resolved later than what had been set forth in the original schedule. The commission has yet to issue a revised proceeding scheduled, but opening brief have been schedule for April while reply briefs are due in May. It is important to mention that the revenue requirement established in the rate cases will be retroactive to January 1, 2012. And I'd also note that until a final decision is reached, we'll be recording revenues based on currently authorized levels. In the quarter, in which a final decision is reached, we'll record the retroactive increase in earnings since the beginning of the year.","Moving to some of the major capital projects. At San Diego Gas & Electric, construction of Sunrise Powerlink is now more than 75% complete and we continue to expect that it will be going into service in the second half of this year. ","Turning to our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan. Last week, Commissioner Florio released a proposed schedule, which calls for hearings during the summer and briefs due in October of this year. We're also waiting for the commission to authorize a memorandum account to track the project cost.","Now, I'd like to take you to Slide 11. On renewables business, construction has begun on the 150-megawatt expansion of the Copper Mountain Solar project in Nevada. In December, the CPUC approved our 25-year contract to sell the power generated by the plant to PG&E. We expect to complete 92 megawatts by the end of January 2013, and we'll bring the remaining 58 megawatts into service by 2015. ","Also in December, we agreed to partner with BP Wind to jointly develop 2 projects that will have a combined capacity of 560 megawatts at a total cost of $1 billion. These projects include the 419-megawatt Flat Ridge 2 project in Kansas and the 141-megawatt Mehoopany project in Pennsylvania. Both projects are expected to be completed by the end of this year.  These 2 projects will more than double the amount of operating net wind capacity at our U.S. Gas & Power business, all of which is in partnership with BP Wind. ","We now have nearly 1,000 megawatts of renewables project either in operation, under construction or contracted. We've made tremendous strides in the development of our renewables business and is a great example of how we've been able to leverage an existing asset decision to drive future growth. ","Now let's go on to the final slide.  I am very pleased to the results of all of our businesses for both the quarter and the year. Adjusted earnings per share grew by 14% in 2011, and we exceeded our financial outlook for the year. While our new 2012 earnings per share guidance of $4 to $4.30 was negatively impacted by $0.40 due to the move to new solar accounting method, the change provides more consistent and growing earnings going forward as we develop our solar portfolio. And with strong business unit growth and performance, we expect to grow our earnings per share at a compound annual growth rate of 6% to 8% over the longer term. ","Finally, I'd like to remind you that we'll be holding our Annual Analyst Conference here at San Diego on March 29. At the conference, we'll provide an update on the strategic direction of the company, and we'll provide an overview of our earnings outlook and capital program at that time. ","I'll leave the details for March, but we expect to show you a plan that generates above average earnings growth, which when combined with our competitive dividend, provides a compelling investment opportunity.","With that, I'll stop and open up the call to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just wanted to talk about the dividend and growth here. So then, the new dividend certainly is above the overall payout ratio target, and I think I follow what you're indicating in terms of ability to grow into that and continue to grow the dividend. As we think about dividend growth given that, right now, the dividend is essentially sort of above that long-term payout ratio level, should we be thinking about growth in line with further earnings growth or how should we think about just how that dividend may grow over time?","Debra L. Reed","Well, Stephen, when we set the dividend level -- the Board, obviously, sets the dividend level. But one of the things we looked at is the long-term earnings growth that we have in our 5-year plan that we'll be showing you at the analyst conference. And as we mentioned, we see 6% to 8% growth in that plan. So we believe that there's still upward potential for that dividend. It may be slightly less than the earnings growth that we have in that plan, but we could still have that 50% payout ratio, 45% to 50%, on a long-term basis and continue to have some growth in the dividend.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just as a follow-up, as we think about earnings growth over time, you've laid out the target growth level, it sounds like over time, you'll be able to repatriate some capital from Latin America, which sounds great. Sounds like there would be an earnings impact. Does this earnings growth profile reflect in the EPS impacts of that cash repatriation?","Debra L. Reed","Yes, and you will see this, and we're not going to go through the details of the 5-year plan here on this call, but the 6% to 8% that we've quoted reflects in the -- bottoms up strategic review of our businesses, the repatriation scenario and all the things that we're reflecting in our business plans going forward, which we'll share with you in detail in March.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Leslie Rich from JPMorgan.","Leslie Rich - J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Inc.","Just to clarify, so the impact of adjusting the accounting methodology for the solar impacts earnings $0.40 a share in 2012. And then what would -- how should we think about that on an ongoing basis for 2013 and beyond? And I understand you don't want to give specific guidance, but then that separate and apart, I think, from the $0.30 per share negative impact from the higher taxes associated with repatriating the money from Latin America. I'm just not sure to what extent those 2 items are related, if at all?","Debra L. Reed","Well, Leslie, there's actually 2 different things going on, and you correctly indicated that they are separate items. The item where we changed the accounting method for 2012, that's about $0.40 a share. We'll go through the details with you in the analyst presentation because we really have to build up on what solar projects we were planning in each of the years. And so there's some variability in that from year-to-year, but $0.40 is a pretty reasonable number to use for that. And in separate and apart from that is the decision to repatriate, which we would begin in 2013. And we would then be able to see what happens with all the tax law changes potentially and all, but begin the repatriation there and would take a reduction in our earnings outlook for 2013 of about $0.30 related to that. Joe, did you want to add anything...","Joseph A. Householder","No, think that's right. I think over to 5 years, it's a $0.25 to $0.35 for the repatriation cash. It's not cash tax, it's book tax. We'll have a very small cash tax on that. But we'll have book earnings impact of $0.25 to $0.35 over that 5-year period.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Faisel Khan from Citigroup.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just to clarify, on the deferral treatment method for the solar tax treatment, that's just on new projects going forward, there is no impact to the previous projects you brought online, is that right?","Debra L. Reed","Yes, I'm going to have Joe describe exactly how that works. Joe?","Joseph A. Householder","When we get to the first quarter, now that we're on the new method in Q1, when we report our results for the 10-Q, we will have to go back and recast the prior year's but it's fairly small. But what you saw in 2011 is under the old method, under the flow-through method, but all of 2010 and 2011 will be recast under this method.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And is that the life of the facility, so is it like 20 years of kind of deferrals is how that works?","Joseph A. Householder","Yes, it's over the depreciated life.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And just so I'm clear on the foreign tax issue for 2013, because you pay lower taxes in other countries and in South America, the difference basically is the tax that you pay there versus the tax you pay here and that's the $0.25 to $0.35 you're going to end up having to occur next year, is that right?","Joseph A. Householder","Yes. Faisal, this is Joe. That's correct. We have an average tax rate on all of our foreign income that's accumulated throughout all the periods of around 20%. So to bring it back and pay Federal and California taxes is about another 20%, let's say.","Debra L. Reed","One thing I do want to stress that Joe mentioned is that, that there's very little cash tax. It's deferred tax, and so the earnings that we talked about with the $0.30 starting in 2013 is not a cash tax amount. It's a deferred tax amount.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, got you. Fair enough. And then just on the generation business, if I exclude the mark-to-market loss in the quarter, is there any way for your guys to give us kind of an idea of how much of a drag the gas-fired generation fleet was on that business? Because as I suspect that your -- on a pretax basis, your renewable portfolio was profitable, but at the fossil fuel fleet, that was probably a drag on earnings, but I have no way of kind of figuring that out?","Debra L. Reed","Yes. I'll ask Mark to go through a little bit of high level on that.","Mark A. Snell","Right. Faisal, it's Mark. Your intuition is correct. I mean, we did have a small loss on the fossil fuel fleet. Although in our plans going forward, we expect to operate that fleet profitably even on a GAAP basis, kind of a break even to slightly positive, and certainly very positive on a cash flow basis. And then we also have the earnings from the fossil fuel -- from the renewable fleet in addition to that. But we'll get into the details of that at the Analyst Conference and we'll show you those numbers.","Operator","And we'll go next to Michael Goldenberg from Luminus Management.","Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management, LLC","I'm sorry if I'm going back to the same questions on accounting, but I just want to be crystal clear on the 2 items that you've identified. On the repatriation of international earnings, the $0.30, the higher tax rate that you'll be paying when you repatriate, is that going to be backed out as a onetime item or basically every year, when you bring it back in, it will just grow at the state of income tax expense that we will see on the income statement?","Debra L. Reed","As we record that, it'll be shown every year. It'll be recurring as a deferred tax item that we'll be recording. As I mentioned, we won't be paying the cash taxes because we'll have a net operating loss, and so those cash taxes for the most part are deferred for 5-plus years. Joe, I don't know if you want to add anymore to that...","Joseph A. Householder","I think that's right. Michael, I'll just add this. I mentioned that we intend, in 2013, to start bringing back current earnings from some of the subsidiaries and our expectation is about $300 million for several years in a row, at least. And so if you think about the book tax effect of that might be about 20% of $300 million for several years in a row.","Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management, LLC","Got it. And then the other question is on the solar tax credits that changed from onetime to deferral method. So I understand that will significantly smooth out the earnings profile. But based on my understanding, the way other companies do it, there's still a higher tax benefit in year 1 versus year 2 through the end of the life. Can you give us a sense of relative tax benefit for year 1 versus years 2, 3 that will now be for a new solar project?","Joseph A. Householder","Yes, Michael, this is Joe. I'll just try to do it with a rough example. If you spend $100 million under the investment credit method, you would reduce your tax basis by 1\/2 of that investment credit of 30. So then you have to book a deferred tax liability, we'll call it 35% of that difference, about $5 million, and then you have $30 million of ITC. So you book the $25 million benefit on the $100 million that you spent. Under the new method, the book basis goes down by the whole ITC, so it goes down by 30. That tax still goes down by 15 and you actually a book a deferred tax benefit of 5. So you're booking 5 instead of 25 in that first year. That's just the one-time sort of 5% of the cost, you're booking it right then.","Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management, LLC","And what will be the tax benefit now in years 2 through 5, 6 our life of the project?","Joseph A. Householder","Your $30 million will reduce depreciation. It's not going through the income line. It's going to reduce depreciation over the 25 or so years, 25-year life of the project.","Debra L. Reed","Yes, I would say, we will go through this in detail at the analyst conference and go through some examples and also that you'll be able to see the effect of this.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Moving on, we'll hear from Greg Gordon from ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I'm sure you realized you were opening up Pandora's Box when you gave us some, but not all, of the goodies from the Analyst Day. But I just wanted to ask, just structurally speaking, clearly, the earnings -- you re-based the earnings here in 2012 by making the accounting change on the solar, which I think most of your investors and analysts would say was the right way to go. But I guess when I think about '13, '14, '15, it's clear how you're generating the incremental cash flow to fund the dividend payment. Thank you for articulating that. You're going to show us at the Analyst Day what the offsetting factors that sort of fill in that $0.30 incremental, sort of headwind, associated with the noncash tax impact. Because in order for you to sort of -- if we think about a straight-line 5% to 6% earnings growth rate, you'd have to have a fairly significant offsetting earnings growth driver in that year to not have sort a growth rate at least in '13 that looked  like your longer term aspiration. So are you going to be able to show us what the sort of the puts are that offset that sort of incremental headwind in '13 when we see you in March?","Debra L. Reed","Yes, we will show you, when we see you in March and what we've shown you before, which is the 5-year growth rate. And the growth rate is not going to be necessarily even in each of these years. It's not necessarily a linear function. And I so I don't want to leave you with that impression. But over the 5-year period, we're looking at 6% to 8% growth in our plan over the 5-year period of time, and we'll be able to show you how that occurs. And what fills in that growth, and a lot of it, if you look at our 2 utilities as an example, over the 5 years, SoCalGas is going to grow at about 7.5%. And SDG&E over 5%. So you have a lot of it embedded in projects that have already been approved at our utilities or are in the regulatory process of our utilities, then we'll go through all of that at the analyst conference.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So we shouldn't assume a linear progression but over the sort of normal 5-year forecast horizon that you usually roll forward, you'll be able to sort of validate how you get to [ph] that aspiration?","Debra L. Reed","Yes. That's how you should look at it.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I wanted to ask you just, I mean, I guess I don't want to belabor this and it sounds like a lot it is going to be other analyst meeting. But just to clarify, the $0.30 of impact in future years associated with the repatriation, you guys are still expecting to grow 6% to 8% growth in spite of that, correct?","Debra L. Reed","That's correct. The 6% to 8% growth over the 5-year plan period includes the impact of everything we've talked about today. And it also includes the bottom-up review of all of our businesses. And as an example, if you look at what we talked about with the forecast for 2012 in our guidance, we would have been at $4.40 to $4.70. It was $0.10 higher than where we were last year based upon the performance of our businesses but then that's reduced by the $0.40 from the change of accounting method which, again, has no economic effect on the business. But we've heard from a lot of you that you would like to have a better sense, not to have to time when these projects go into service precisely. And so this allows for that type of greater predictability. All of that's incorporated, the repatriation is incorporated. And with all of that, we're looking at 6% to 8% growth over the 5-year time frame.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then the $0.40, and I know you went through these, the calculation on the book deferral and what have you, just, what is the impact of the $0.40 in 2013, if we could just get a little bit of flavor for that, in other words, by taking a hit in 2012, there will be a benefit in 2013. Do you guys have a rough approximation as to what that would be?","Debra L. Reed","Yes, we're going to hold off to go through the 2013 numbers at the Analyst Meeting. The only thing that we wanted to do was to let you all know that we were making this change, so we didn't surprise you with that at the Analyst Meeting. So we wanted you to know we're changing in terms of repatriation and the rationale behind that. Again it's a good economic decision for us because we have this net operating losses that we can use now by doing this, and we just wanted to give you awareness of that. We will go through all the details at the Analyst Meeting.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then just on the decision to do the repatriation from the international business, could you just like give us a little more flavor as to sort of what's kind of caused this? I mean, is it simply because of the international outlook versus tax issues? And just in general, is there any issue with respect to potential changes because we keep on hearing about tax reform in various things showing up regarding taxing of foreign entities, and taxing of just, in general, I mean, vast changes perhaps in the tax code. I mean just in terms of your flexibility with respect to this issue and what have you?","Debra L. Reed","Yes, that's an excellent question. And we spend a lot of time on this. I'll give you a very high level on it then I'm going to have Joe go through the details on the flexibility. But from a strategic standpoint, these businesses are doing really well, and they are generating a great deal of cash, and if we did not repatriate cash, we would build up excess cash in excess of what we need to grow those businesses by 6% to 8% per year, of something over, around $1.5 billion. And that it didn't seem appropriate to us to keep that cash offshore, and be able to fund all of our growth and not look at some changes to the capital structure of those businesses because we have the ability to put leverage on those businesses locally. We feel that is a better long-term capital structure for those businesses. And with this net operating loss that we have, because of the bonus depreciation and because of the solar tax credit, if we were going to repatriate funds, then this would be the best time to do that, but for any type of tax holiday and all. And I'm going to have Joe talk to you about our assessment of that and what flexibility we have, because we do have a great deal of flexibility relative to changing our timing of repatriation based upon what might happen within a national tax policy. Joe?","Joseph A. Householder","Okay. Thanks, Debbie. Yes, Paul, exactly what Debbie was saying, this started out in our strategic review and our capital allocation process and looking at the international operations, what their requirements were, the very low debt-to-cap ratios we have in those countries and then the overall tax position as Debbie articulated. And we took all that into the account. Then we thought about, well, what would be the effect if there were a change in tax policy. So what we've decided to do, and this is why we're announcing it now, is we want to let you know is that we were thinking about doing this in 2013. We would like to be able to see what happens with the election. See what happens with tax policy. It's not clear to me that very much will happen, but there's a lot of people talking about it. But what we intend to do is start taking the earnings effect of it in 2013 but probably not actually repatriate the cash until the end of the year, which gives us a long runway from now until the end of 2013 to see exactly what's going to happen with tax reform. If anything happens, it's likely that if it's going to benefit us, we'll know that, and then we would be repatriating anyway. As Debbie said, we have more cash buildup there than we need to even grow those earnings at 6% or 8% and towards the top of that range. So this -- a repatriation build that would allow cash to come back at lower rates would benefit us more. If it goes the other way and something like the President's proposal that came out, and says you're going to have to pay a minimum tax even if you don't bring the money, then what we're doing now even makes more sense. We might as well bring it here and use it in the U.S. and use up these tax assets that we have sooner than we would otherwise use them.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Makes a lot of sense. Finally, just the Tangguh and the lower gas pricing, you guys mentioned the contract changes and amendments and lower gas prices kind of offsetting each other. Could you just give us a flavor as to the impact of both of those?","Debra L. Reed","Yes, I'm going to ask Mark to...","Mark A. Snell","Yes, with respect to Tangguh, we renegotiated the contract and where we ended up with is, we allowed our partners to have more flexibility to divert cargoes, and we were compensated for allowing that extra flexibility. And that offset the effect of lower gas prices on our plan going forward. So all in all, it was a positive for them, and it actually is a positive for us to because we have a guaranteed number of deliveries. It's a small number, but it's the total amount we need to keep the plant cool. And we're also allowed to divert a cargo to other our facility in the Gulf, which eliminates the need to buy an expensive cargo there to keep that plant cool. So I think, all in all, the renegotiation, it's always kind of trite to say that it's a win-win but it's truly one that would turn out better for both parties.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. So the financial impact of that versus to get lower gas prices is sort of what?","Mark A. Snell","Yes, kind of flat.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. But what was the impact, I guess, from one of them?","Mark A. Snell","Well, we're not disclosing what the financial impact of the contract is. But you'll see it in the LNG numbers when we do the Analyst Conference.","Operator","We'll go next to Ashar Khan from Visium.","Ashar Khan","Just wanted to, I don't know, I guess, coincidental, I was just looking -- I just want to understand the assumptions, I think if I understand. But if I look at Slide 2 from the last deck that you provided at your Analyst Conference, the 2011's outlook was $4 to $4.30, growing 6% to 8% percent and then we came to a $5.50 to a $5.80 number as part of the 2015 target. So if I -- using what you are pretty consistent, of course, we lost, now, '12 is back to $4 to $4.30, the growth rate is 6% to 8% EPS. So I'm assuming the range if I impute it from last year, the range should be similar because the growth rate hasn't changed, the base is the same and so the range should be I guess '16 should be $5.50 to $5.80 if I impute what was done last year. And am I thinking through this rightly? The base is going to be '12 and you're looking towards the '16 targets.","Debra L. Reed","I'm not going to give you the '16 target until we get to the Analyst Meeting. But I think your calculations do make sense, and we'll go through the details of '16 and what our estimates are at the Analyst Conference. But your methodology is how we get to our 6% to 8%.","Ashar Khan","Okay. And then if I could just go back, I guess the business that -- I'm just looking through which did better than forecast, one was pipeline and storage. I guess it came out $2.50 versus the high-end of $2.20. I know there was $18 million from a kind of like a tax related issue when you brought the money thing. But is there anything in that business that I guess the rest of the gains were all permanent better operations that are going to go on forward, just trying to ...","Debra L. Reed","Excuse me, I'm sorry...","Ashar Khan","No, just trying to get a sense of the strength of the business, I'm assuming it's permanent and we can grow from there?","Debra L. Reed","The main thing that happened, of course, in pipes and storage, is we acquired the South American utilities in April of last year. And that, that business -- those utilities performance will be ongoing, and we'll have a full year's effect of that this year. So when you look at the earnings in pipes and storage and the significant increase there, it's largely from the acquisition.","Joseph A. Householder","There were up couple of a onetime things that I think were mentioned that there was some gains from some cash, some U.S. dollars we held in Chile at the time. It's not there anymore. But originally, it was there. And there was some foreign exchange gain of about $10 million and we had some Mexican tax benefits in that business also. So there's a roughly $20 million in there that was I would say more a onetime than continuing.","Operator","Moving on, we'll hear from Mark Barnett from Morningstar.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Mark Barnett, Morningstar. Just a couple of quick questions, maybe out of the weeds here a little bit. So you know you had at the end of last quarter 2 plants left to kind of on the contracting side after the expiration of the DWR contract. And I'm wondering how those plants are looking and whether you had finalized kind of marketing those for the next few years?","Debra L. Reed","Let me have Mark talk about that because this -- clearly, as part of our strategic review, we have looked at every market and we have looked at every asset, and we've done a full assessment. And so let me have Mark just comment on that and again, we'll be going through a lot of this detail at the Analyst Day.","Mark A. Snell","Good question, Mark. Let me talk to you a little bit at how we're looking at these assets, and I think it will be indicative of kind of our entire strategic review process. The first thing we're doing is we are doing a fairly thorough market review of what we think those assets would sell for in the marketplace. And we're just about done with that with respect to the plants. And then as we figure out what that number is, then we look at what we believe our earnings from those operations will be. And we then, frankly, do a very simple calculation and say that if we got those proceeds, could we do better in other parts of our business? And we're kind of making that evaluation right now. But if we can think we can do better someplace else with that money, we're likely to move it into another part of the business. If we think that the current market just doesn't put enough value on those and we're getting an extraordinary return on the value we can get, we're likely to hold them for a while until that situation changes. Obviously, we wouldn't do that if we thought it was going to get worse. But if we thought it was going to get better, we'd continue to hold them. And we're making that, and we'll probably have some of those decisions done by the Analyst Conference. But we are looking at those. We put everything on the table, and it's just a way that we're thinking about it right now. And, frankly, I think we're in -- it's that process that just continues to move forward.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","All right. And I guess this is probably something else you will, so forgive me, you will probably address at the Analyst Day. But you received at the end of last month the initial permit for liquefaction from Cameron, I believe. And then I know that there's a second round for exploring the countries without free-trade agreements. I'm just wondering, had you already initiated that or are you waiting to sort of evaluate what you want to do on the investments side to apply for that second license?","Debra L. Reed","Yes. In terms of that, we filed for and received the U.S. free-trade export license from DOE already in January. And we also filed separately for the non-FTA countries, which is now pending. We also have to file a FERC permit, which we would expect to do sometime around the second quarter of this year. And that's likely to take 12 to 18 months. So that's kind of the timeline we're on.","Operator","And we'll move on to  Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Debbie, rate case. How do you think about how far apart you guys are versus the interveners at both SDG&E and SoCalGas, kind of what's the bid? How far are apart are you on both O&M and on actual rate base expectations? And what are the likelihoods of settlement? You guys have been one of the best at settling rate cases in California over the years. Just curious to see where we stand now.","Debra L. Reed","Thank you, Michael. It's nice to speak with you this morning. In terms of the rate case, as you mentioned, we have a history of settling our cases, and the thing that I would note it that while the numbers between ourselves and the DRA staff may seem large on the surface, when you start drilling into them, there are a lot of the things that have been litigated time and time again in rate cases. They deal with what's the relative level of compensation or they deal with how we account for certain depreciation of asset. So there are issues that have been raised multiple times in rate cases. They have been litigated and\/or settled and settled in the favor of how we filed them in the rate case. So I don't feel like we're truly as far apart as it might seem when you look at the filings that have been made by the parties and ourselves. We have been in discussions with parties. But I also say, we have a strong case. We completed the hearings in January. And if we're not able to reach a settlement that we think is the right amount for us to operate our business safely and effectively, then we are fine going through the regulatory process. But we do have a history, as you mentioned, of settling, and we always like to be able to try to work with the parties and see if we can't come up with a resolution that works for everyone.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. One other thing, rate case or tied to the regulated utility subsidiaries, what's remaining in terms of incentive compensation of earns -- incentive structure that the utilities can earn above and beyond kind of the traditional GRC? I'm thinking gas and -- your purchased gas incentive. I'm thinking energy efficiency. What's left going into 2012 versus what is kind of already halted and won't be there going forward?","Debra L. Reed","Okay, let me try to hit the major categories. We have at the gas company the gas cost incentive mechanism, and that is remaining in place. In fact, we've just got a draft decision this week, granting or recommending that we receive the incentive from what we filed last what year. And then we have a storage incentive mechanism at the gas company that allows us to market storage and to the extent we recover more than our embedded cost and there's a sharing mechanism on that. In terms of energy efficiency, that is up for review right now by the commission as to what is going to be a mechanism for energy efficiency going forward. And so we're not quite certain as to what the mechanism will ultimately be, but that is something that's up for review. And then at SDG&E, we also have a gas PBR mechanism similar to what we have at SoCalGas. And so those are the key mechanisms that are still in place.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Last item, renewable projects. Obviously, you've got a lot in the hopper. How do you think about whether you have the capability to expand upon that in the next 2 to 3 years, not necessarily next 5, but thinking more near-term, next 2 to 3 years, meaning the potential for incremental solar projects in all likelihood?","Debra L. Reed","Well, as you know, we have exceptional land position. And that -- as an example at ESJ in Northern Mexico, we have a project now that is just the first phase and maybe about 10% of the total capacity potential to be built at that location. That is for approval at the commission on March 8. So that there is some great opportunity there for wind potentially to grow. We have land positions adjacent to our power plants in Arizona and Nevada, and then we have a land position in Central California, all of which we will participate in RFPs and be able to bid out. And then we have some partnerships that we've formed where we work with other companies as we have with BP to take partner projects that they have and us be a 50-50 partner. Mark, I don't if you want add any more color to that.","Mark A. Snell","Well, I just would say I think it is a very robust pipeline that we have. And I think we'll continue to grow the business at significant rates. And it's a very profitable business for us. About look at all of our options down the line with respect to renewables, I think we're pretty excited about where it can take us and where it'll go. There's all kinds of options with respect to capital availability and things, where we can put very -- continue to put very little capital into it and get great earnings and great returns.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. I'm sorry, I wanted to cheat - last one here. Joe, I want to simplify the tax issue. In 2012 GAAP tax rates versus cash tax rates, and if you can give that for '13 as well, that'd be great.","Joseph A. Householder","Just a minute, Michael, let me grab that. 2012, let's say our GAAP tax rate is going to be around 30%. Cash tax rate will be fairly low. I don't have a percentage, but we would have a modest Californian tax and probably between California and our foreign businesses, maybe around $100 million of tax.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. In '13?","Joseph A. Householder","In '13 -- or '12. In '13 I think we'll get more into those numbers when we get to the conference.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Vedula Murti from CDP Capital.","Vedula Murti","Let's see, most of my questions have been answered, but I just wanted to make sure if we think about the repatriation issue, if we think about the kind of like the status quo, such that nothing changes, how many years of NOLs and other types of things do you have such that you could repatriate $300 million a year back to the U.S. with minimal cash taxes?","Debra L. Reed","Joe?","Joseph A. Householder","Yes, this is Joe. We're expecting, depending on how this plays out, but assuming the status quo, we would probably repatriate about $300 million a year, to around 2018.","Vedula Murti","Okay. So you can do that with...","Joseph A. Householder","So you've got both NOLs and -- sorry, go ahead.","Vedula Murti","So you've got about 5 years or so with very minimal cash taxes?","Joseph A. Householder","Yes. We have several years of net operating losses that we could absorb. And then we also have renewable energy credits that we can use.","Vedula Murti","Okay. And we've just spent a lot of time talking about EPS growth off of these headwinds of 6% to 8%, but all these headwinds have had no effect on cash. Can you talk about the cash flow growth rate over the next 5 years so does the EPS growth rate? Should we -- will we see a commensurate increase in cash flow growth or are we going to see the reversal which we have seen, where cash flow is fine and EPS reported GAAP has these headwinds and then EPS -- and then EPS improved, but cash flow kind of stable or doesn't keep up? Can you talk about the growth rate of cash flow over the period?","Debra L. Reed","Yes, I would just say that I wouldn't see a big disconnect between cash flow and earnings over the period of time. If anything, the cash flow should be a little bit higher for the tax reasons that we talked about. And some of our assets are cash flow positive, but they're not producing stronger earnings. So I would say that for the purposes of where we are today, we'll go through that again at the Analyst Meeting. The purposes of where we are today to assume they're relatively parallel.","Vedula Murti","Okay. And one last question. In terms of where payout is and that type of thing, and obviously, with the outside uptick in terms of dividends today, should we just kind of think that going forward, just kind of plug that dividend growth going forward should be somewhere like half of like your targeted growth rate from here going forward?","Debra L. Reed","Well, I'd say our board looks at this every year. And the decision that they made this year with a larger increase in dividend was not predictable last year. But if you just kind of look at our earnings and you look at getting to a 50%, 45%, 50% payout ratio, you can envision the opportunity over the 5-year growth rate that we have that we should be able to continue to increase the dividend at some level that's slightly less than our earnings growth rate. So I mean, I think that we'll show you some of this when you show you the 5-year earnings growth rate and we'll show you the earnings and then you can kind of look at that dividend payout ratio and figure for yourself about how much greater it can be over the period of 5 years.","Vedula Murti","Great. I just to make sure that in terms of what I understand, that you've got a running room of about 5 years or so in terms of various NOLs and tax credit such that irrespective of U.S. tax policy, you'll be able to repatriate $300 million a year with minimal cash back, and that the growth rate on cash flow going forward is going to be comparable, if not superior, to what you're going to -- what you're striving to achieve in terms of GAAP EPS growth rate.","Debra L. Reed","That's correct.","Operator","And we'll take our next question today from Naaz Khumawala from Bank of America.","Naaz Khumawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I had just a couple of one clarification question and just a couple of other questions. On the $0.30 a share of hit, is that all in '13 or is that like $0.06 a year over the next 5 years? I was confused about how that was kind of said over the call.","Debra L. Reed","Yes. The $0.30 per share, it continues. It doesn't increase, but it basically continues. We'd factored the time is based upon the amount you repatriate that year and what, if you're repatriating $30 million -- $300 million a year every year, then you'll have that hit for that one year for the deferred tax on the amount you're repatriating. So as long as you're repatriating, and let me just clarify, as long as your repatriating, then you would have that. If we decided to repatriate in 2013 and then something changed our view and we elected not to repatriate in 2014, then we would not have that $0.30 again in 2014. When we do have a lot of flexibility in this as to how we choose to repatriate, and when we make those elections.","Naaz Khumawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And I think the last time markets said that you have $1 billion of cash overseas, is that more like $1.5 billion now, if I just do $300 million from 5?","Joseph A. Householder","This is Joe. I think you'll probably referring to when Mark was talking about how much cash we had available, including that was prior to the acquisition of the South American utilities. So we have basically brought back or used in investment cash. There's not any big amounts of cash sitting there today. We have very low debt-to-cap ratios, as I mentioned. So we have the ability to grow those. We're not going to repatriate funds that we needed there to grow the business, and we also have the ability to borrow there if we want to fund additional investments beyond their really good growth that they have.","Naaz Khumawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just the last question on California, on the pipeline safety memo account that you had applied for, do you know what kind of timing you expect to receive that for this year?","Debra L. Reed","Well, the memo account, we're anticipating sometime in the first half of the year getting the memo account established. And the assigned, Commissioner Florio, basically set the schedule for the proceeding that would have the closing brief filed in October, hearings in the summertime and then closing briefs in October. But we would expect the memo account to be put in place before that time. The other thing that was very positive is that in his decisions setting forth the procedural schedule, he encouraged us, once the memo account was established, to begin the rate collection of that so that there was not spikiness in terms of the rate recovery. So I think you'll see some movement in the first half of this year on the memo account in the latter half of this year, early next year, on the whole termination or completion of the preceding.","Naaz Khumawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just in terms of how much of the $3.1 billion, if you did get the memo account, let's say, midyear, how much of that spend could you potentially do in '12 or how much have you anticipated in the guidance?","Debra L. Reed","Yes, in terms of what we would do in '12, it wouldn't be a great amount in '12. It would certainly be less than $100 million. And a lot depends on the timing of the memo account. But I would not anticipate a lot of expenditures in '12. It would be more of a ramp up. And then in '13, we will begin.","Naaz Khumawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And so, I think you guys before have included about $400 million of pipeline safety spend in your 5-year CapEx, is that right?","Debra L. Reed","What we have for pipeline safety spend, we had $1.4 billion over the 5-year period of our plan. And as I said, when we did the 2012 numbers, we did a bottoms-up for 2012. So we looked at the situation that we feel that we're in today and what we think is going to happen today, and we redid our guidance for 2012. So whatever was in 2012 would now be deferred most likely to 2013. And that the total amount is still anticipated at $1.4 billion over a 5-year period.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Stephen Huang from Carlson Capital.","Stephen Huang","I was just wanted to double check and reconfirm something. The long-term growth rate, we're starting at the $4 to $4.30 2012 base, is that correct?","Debra L. Reed","Yes.","Stephen Huang","Okay. And then, Joe, the second question I had was you mentioned that you would go back and recast the '10 and '11 solar and then bring them back forward. So is that basically you'll do like a onetime charge in '13 first quarter and then you'll kind of add $0.05 a share of earnings going forward per year? Are you basically taking '10 and '11 earnings and adding $0.05 going forward?","Joseph A. Householder","The 2010 and 2011, the financials will just be recast as if we had been on the other method in the prior years. And so there'll be slightly higher earnings over the next 25 years because we're moving those credits going forward into the future years.","Debra L. Reed","But there's no effect of...","Joseph A. Householder","There's no onetime effect in 2012 or 2013 of it. There's the continuing slow amortization of the ITC over the 25-year life.","Stephen Huang","Right. But it would add about $0.05 to ongoing -- in that ballpark of ongoing earnings, starting from '13 and going forward.","Joseph A. Householder","I'm not sure where -- how you're computing that number, but we'll go over this at the Analyst Conference [indiscernible].","Stephen Huang","But it should add a couple of pennies of earnings going forward. Or are you just moving it out?","Joseph A. Householder","Yes, it should add a modest amount. That's correct.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Worms from BMO.","Michael S. Worms - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Michael Worms. Just a quick question on the repatriation of the money in South America. At what point, I thought the plan was to build some transmission lines down there, and to potentially build another hydro plant or 2. So are those plans now and you going forward will just bring back money to the U.S.? Can you kind of give us some color on that?","Debra L. Reed","No, those plans are still in existence. And when we've done with our 5-year plan, we've incorporated the requirements to have that growth. We're still looking at transmission projects. We're building the hydro project right now in Peru that should be online at around 2013. And we have other hydro projects in Peru that we're bidding on, as well as transmission projects in Chile. Those projects are still incorporated in our plan, and we have the ability through operating cash flow from those businesses and local debt. We talk about the fact that those businesses really don't have any debt on them. And that we really feel that there's a preferred capital structure for those businesses where we would pay off some of the U.S. debt with the repatriated dollars and have local debt on those businesses, which make more sense for the projects that we're doing. So that's the way we will structure those projects in more of the kind of cap structure we'd like to see there in the long-term.","Operator","And James Heckler from Levin Capital Strategies has our next question.","Neil Stein","It's actually Neal Stein from Levin Capital. I have a couple of more questions on the repatriation issue and just as it relates to the growth rate. So you'll book a $0.30 adverse impact, EPS impact, from repatriation in 2013. Are you still able to grow 6% to 8% in that year or are you saying the 6% to 8% is applicable over the long-term and maybe you can't grow in '13 by that amount?","Debra L. Reed","Yes. I'm not saying that it's going to -- I think, I've made a comment before, and I'll restate it. Our growth is going to be 6% to 8% over a 5-year time frame. And that there will be some unevenness in that growth from -- not every year is going to be 6% to 8% over their prior year. Some years maybe 3%, some years maybe 9%. And a lot of that has to do when projects come in, especially some of our renewable projects and when they start providing earnings. And so that we've never grown evenly. If you'd kind of look at our historical growth, it's been over a longer-term time frame that we give you the projections. And then when we see you at the end of March, we will give you the projections as we have and what our growth rate is over the longer term and then what we expect it to be in each of the early years.","Neil Stein","Well, could you say, are you able to specifically offset this $0.30 impact in '13?","Debra L. Reed","We're not giving 2013 guidance today. And so I'd rather wait and go through all of that with the total plan at the Analyst Conference. We've given you the 2012 guidance, which is what we always do on this call, and then when we get to the Analyst Meeting, we will go through and lay out for you what our expectations are over the 5-year time frame and in 2012, 2013.","Neil Stein","Well, let me ask this. There's the possibility you may book $0.30 maybe in one year or just a couple of years. I guess there is also the possibility you may book at meeting you'll repatriate $300 million of cash every single year over the 5-year period? Is that a possibility? And if you were to be booking this $0.30 adverse impact from the repatriation tax, would you still be able to grow 6% to 8% for the 5-year period?","Debra L. Reed","Yes. I mean, what we've assumed is that we would have the $300 million a year repatriated every year over the time frame of the 5 years. And even with that, that we would have a 6% to 8% growth rate over that 5-year time frame.","Operator","Our next question today is from John Ali [ph] from Decade Capital.","Unknown Analyst","Sorry to keep asking about this. Just to be clear, the 6% to 8% growth, so you're going in year 5, if you took the repatriation, you'd still have that number?","Debra L. Reed","Yes. Again, the way -- yes. The way we've looked at it is we've calculated the growth over that 5-year plan, and it includes the change in solar accounting and it includes the repatriation.","Unknown Analyst","Every year?","Debra L. Reed","And we look at it over the 5-year and, we said that, that compound annual growth rate over that 5-year period will be 6% to 8%. Now that doesn't mean that every year grows 6% to 8% over the prior year. It's not always even. But if you look at it over the 5-year time frame, then the average growth rate, the CAGR and earnings, ends up being 6% to 8% over that 5-year period.","Joseph A. Householder","And then -- it's Joe. Just to confirm, the repatriation is in the plan from 2013 through the remainder, not in 2012, but 2013 going forward.","Debra L. Reed","Yes. The other thing I would say is that we're not going to give you the 2013 number today. But it's always positive growth. We're not going to have a decline in growth over the period of time. But it's not always going to be 6% to 8% year-over-year-over-year on a linear basis. But it will always be a positive growth, even taking into account the $0.30.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And the $300 million a year, how does that relate to the earnings you get every year, meaning what percentage of earnings is that or are you just re-levering the business?","Joseph A. Householder","It is most of the earnings from Mexico and Peru that we don't need in the business.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. I guess, what's the level of international earnings every year? And the other question I have is, Peru and Chile, how fast as they growing?","Debra L. Reed","Well, Peru and Chile have growth rate of about 6% to 8%. And that's been the historical growth rate and that's kind of the projected growth rate, without some of the special projects. And that's just inherent in the basic utility business there is that you're running around 6% to 8% growth in total electric demand in those 2 countries and then about 3% to 4% customer growth each year. And then in addition to that, we have these special projects like the hydro project and transmission project.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. But just the run rate business is about 6% to 8% in terms of net income?","Mark A. Snell","Yes, towards the high end of that.","Unknown Analyst","Got you. And how much cash do you have overseas internationally?","Mark A. Snell","Well, we just did a large acquisition so we don't have -- we used up a lot of our cash. But we are, like Joe just said, too, we don't have a lot of leverage overseas. And so we have a lot of borrowing capacity.","Unknown Analyst","So roughly how much borrowing capacity [indiscernible] business we could get back into it?","Mark A. Snell","$1 billion, probably.","Unknown Analyst","That's borrowing capacity?","Mark A. Snell","Yes.","Operator","That will come from Chris Shelton from Millenium Partners.","Chris Shelton","A quick follow-up question. I guess in terms of the $300 million that you guys are repatriating each year, as far as uses of that cash, obviously, you had a dividend increase, which will take up a portion of that. But what are the kind of -- what are the potential uses of that cash that you see going forward?","Debra L. Reed","I'll cover the high level and then ask Joe to add anything he wants to. As we said, really, the dividend is secondary for the use of this cash, that the majority of this cash is used for debt repayment in the U.S. And what we're trying to do is repay off some of the U.S. debt and then have some local debt established in Chile and Peru and Mexico for the projects that we're doing there so that the leverage in each of those countries has the kind of cap structure that we want to have eventually. That is the way that those businesses should be structured there. They're very underleveraged right now in each of those locations. We'd rather have local debt. We think there's a lot of good reason for having local debt in those countries, and then we'd like to be able to bring this back while we have these net operating losses so that we can repay some of the U.S. debt.","Chris Shelton","Got it. Makes sense. And maybe this is an Analyst Conference question, but what is the -- I guess on the U.S. side, what is that kind of desired level of debt?","Debra L. Reed","Yes, we pretty much keep a 50-50 kind of a cap structure, 51-49, in that range.","Chris Shelton","Okay. And so $300 million a year for how many years would get you -- I guess where -- the better question is where is the balance sheet currently for the U.S. portion, I guess?","Joseph A. Householder","It's about 51% debt to cap.","Chris Shelton","Okay. So if you're repatriating $300 million a year for a number of years, would you expect to kind of use, I guess, use some of that cash in the business as opposed to sort of paying down debt because it seems like you might overshoot the balance sheet capacity?","Debra L. Reed","Yes, you have to look at too what our capital spending is for the 5-year period. And we're looking at spending something like close to $14 billion of capital during that period of time, mostly in our utilities. And so that -- and this is what we'll go through at the Analyst Meeting because you really need to look at this in terms of the 5 years, what the capital spending is, what the repayment of debt is, what the growth is in our international businesses and see it on our composite basis, which we'll show you at the Analyst Meeting. But principally, to keep our credit stats strong and all, we're intending to use the funds that we repatriate to pay off debt, and then we will be issuing other debt as needed for our capital projects to fund this incredible growth that we have with really great projects.","Chris Shelton","I see. And I guess because last year, you had some pretty good -- last year's Analyst Day, had some pretty good growth -- took pretty good growth assumed without repatriation, was that the assumption for last year? And now the assumption is that you'll repatriate, so are there kind of other projects incremental last year, is that the way we should think about it?","Debra L. Reed","Well, in this 5-year plan, another year is added to it. And there are some additional projects that we will have obviously, in that extra year. But what I want to leave you with is the growth will continue in our South American businesses. We'll be able to fund that and we'll be able to create a capital structure there that are appropriate for those businesses and fund the growth that we showed you last year in those businesses, including transmission and generation projects. And then we will repatriate and use the cash to pay off debt, and we'll most likely leverage up those utilities internationally and get the cap structure they should have and produce -- and have more debt than internationally. And then the cash will be used to pay off debt here, so you're basically paying your leverage in a country where you're doing business and bringing back the cash and paying off U.S. debts.","Joseph A. Householder","Chris, we expect that debt U.S. ratio to stay about the same. We have really solid growth. In our view, look, money is fungible. So whether repayment of debt or spending it on your projects, right now for the first few years, we're spending more than our free cash flow. So we're increasing debt in the early years and paying some in the later years. But we're roughly keeping our debt in that ratio about the team, and we're looking at our credit statistics and making sure we have strong credit ratings.","Debra L. Reed","Okay, if there are no further questions then, I'd like to thank you again for joining us on this morning's call. And if you have any follow-up questions, please don't hesitate to call Steve, Scott or Victor, and have a great day. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation."],"18981":["Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) Q1 2017 Earnings Call May  9, 2017 12:00 PM ET","Executives","Richard A. Vaccari - Sempra Energy","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","Steven D. Davis - Sempra Energy","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Analysts","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Operator","Good day, and welcome to the Sempra Energy First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead, sir.","Richard A. Vaccari - Sempra Energy","Good morning and welcome to Sempra Energy's first quarter 2017 financial presentation. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website.","Here in San Diego are several members of our management team: Debbie Reed, Chairman, President and CEO; Jeff Martin, Chief Financial Officer; Steve Davis, Corporate Group President of Utilities; Joe Householder, Corporate Group President of Infrastructure; Dennis Arriola, Executive Vice President; Martha Wyrsch, General Counsel; and Trevor Mihalik, Chief Accounting Officer.","Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q.","It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts are shown on a diluted basis and we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our first quarter 2017 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures.","I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, May 9, 2017, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.","With that, please turn to slide 4, and let me hand the call over to Debbie.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thanks for joining us this morning. And I first want to start by saying that I am going to be talking about Sempra, and not whoever that other company was that that operator put on. Thanks, Rick, and thanks to all of you who joined us in San Diego or via the webcast for our analyst conference a few weeks ago. I appreciate the useful feedback we received. For those of you who were unable to attend, you can find all of the conference materials on our website.","I'd like to start off by reiterating Sempra's long-term value drivers. First, we expect to grow our EPS 10% to 11% from 2017 through 2021 by successfully executing on project already under contract, and our Infrastructure businesses and our expected utility performance. Second, we plan to grow our dividend from 2017 by 8% to 9% annually, then reassess that for additional increases after Cameron's three trains come online.","And third, our increased cash flow should provide $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion in additional debt capacity in 2021. This offers us the flexibility to further enhance long-term shareholder value. And four, we expect to capture opportunities over the next five years to add to or extend our earnings growth.","Before I turn it over to Jeff, please turn to slide five. One of the ways we measure our success is delivering on our EPS guidance. Jeff will review a few of our recent operational successes and our first quarter results, which keep us on track to meet our 2017 earnings guidance of $4.85 to $5.25 per share. Jeff?","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","Thanks a lot, Debbie. First, regarding the cost of capital, we remain constructive on the settlement and believe it's in the best interest of all parties. We continue to expect that the settlement or something in a substantially similar form will be approved. Second, we're focused on executing the capital plan that we laid out at our conference by advancing major projects, in particular Cameron's Trains 1 through 3 in the marine pipeline.","We've also made near-term progress on several other projects. At SDG&E, we signed five new contracts for battery storage facilities totaling 83.5 megawatt, 70 megawatt of which will be directly owned by SDG&E. SDG&E also placed one of the largest lithium-ion battery systems in the world into service in the first quarter. Many of you had the opportunity to visit SDG&E during the conference to hear about this and how it supports California's electrification efforts, as well as furthering the state's policy goal by reducing carbon emission.","IEnova expects to complete three natural gas pipelines by the end of the second quarter. This also represents a combined investment of close to $900 million. Each project you recall is backed by 25-year U.S. dollar denominated contract with CFE.","Third, we're also looking at new investment opportunities. Let me list a few examples. IEnova recently agreed to construct a solar facility with a 20-year PPA for 110 megawatts with an industrial steel company. This is the first bilateral agreement in Mexico under the new market for renewables where the off-taker is a private company. We anticipate there'll more opportunities like this.","The Pima Solar facility is expected to cost roughly $115 million and be operational by the end of 2018. This project is also a great example of how we at Sempra leverage our experience across different growth platforms. The success we've demonstrated in the U.S. renewable business allows us to compete more effectively for projects just like this in Mexico.","We also made CPUC filings for additional projects representing the potential for almost $500 million of new capital. To be clear, these projects were not included in the capital plan we outlined at the analyst conference. These projects include an expansion of SoCalGas' Master Meter program for Mobile Home Parks and SDG&E's proposal to replace its Customer Information System.","Now, please turn to the next slide. Our first quarter financial results was the strongest first quarter performance Sempra has experienced since it was formed. Earlier this morning, we reported first quarter earnings of $441 million or $1.75 per share. This compares favorably to first quarter 2016 earnings of $353 million or $1.40 per share. On an adjusted basis, we reported earnings of $438 million or $1.74 per share. Again, this compares to first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings of $404 million or $1.60 per share.","You'll also recall that we adopted the new accounting standard on stock-based compensation in the third quarter of last year. This was applied retroactively to the first quarter of 2016, and accordingly increased earnings by $34 million in that period.","Now, let's turn to slide 7 to discuss the key factors impacting our result. Our higher quarter-over-quarter adjusted earnings were driven by strong operating results, including $18 million of higher operating earnings from SDG&E in South America; $21 million of higher earnings at our California Utilities, this is largely as a result of the delay of the 2016 GRC file decision, these earnings were recorded in the second quarter of 2016; plus $29 million of higher earnings at Sempra Mexico related to the GdC and Ventika acquisitions, and higher AFUDC earnings. Also improving earnings this year were $14 million of higher tax benefit and lower interest cost at Parent.","These items were partially offset by $34 million of tax benefits in 2016 compared to $3 million of tax expense in 2017 associated with share-based compensation. And at Sempra Mexico, $25 million of lower earnings from foreign currency and inflation effects, primarily from current quarter losses. If you will, I'd like to spend a moment on foreign currency. You'll recall that our current hedging strategy limits our FX-related exposure on U.S. dollar debt in Mexico. While we expect some inter-quarter volatility from time to time, our hedging strategy over the full year is designed to reduce or eliminate expenses related to this exposure.","You'll also recall that there are other FX exposures that impact earnings, but not cash flow. These occur in Mexico and South America and we do not hedge these additional costs. These exposures have historically largely offset over a full year when the currency's movement (08:50). You'll find additional details on FX in the appendix.","And with that, we'll conclude with our prepared comment and start to take any additional questions that you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Hi.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Hey, Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Couple of questions. So first on the cost of capital settlement, could you maybe just let us know if there's any additional color you have on why the delay in approving it, and if you don't have any additional color, when do you expect to get some color?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","I'm going to have Steve Davis talk a little bit about that. But just to remind everyone, this is an all-party settlement. There were no comments filed against the settlement during the proceeding. The settlement included both ORA and a major consumer group in the state, TURN, as well as the three utilities as part of that. And we have been having meetings, ex parte meetings with Commissioner with all of those five parties present in those meetings to reinforce the settlement. And so, we had a meeting last night. We have more scheduled today, and I will turn it over to Steve to add any more color.","Steven D. Davis - Sempra Energy","Yeah. Thanks, Debbie. I would just add that we continue to believe the settlement or something substantially similar will be approved by the Commission in a timely basis. And we will continue to have further discussions with parties this week and we're hopeful of having a timely decision.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Did they give any indication on why this delay occurred?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","There has been no real indication, but what I will say from my 30 \u2013 almost 40 years of experience is that when you have new Commissioners coming in for a major decision for the first time on that, oftentimes they want to take a little bit more time until they understand the issues. And that it's usually the assigned Commissioner would allow for that to happen. So, we're not reading anything more into it that there's like any major concern. And we're not getting indications of major concerns in the meetings that we had so far.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Secondly, just \u2013 sorry, I have to ask this every call, but just is the Cameron project still on the same timeline as you said at the Analyst Day?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. I mean, ourselves and our partners and our contractors are committed to that timeline. I mean, I asked Joe to talk about some of the processes that we have in place to monitor the project and try to stay on top of it with our partners and our contractors because Joe has been personally involved with those. He also talked to the CEO of CB&I earlier this week. So, Joe?","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Thanks, Debbie. Hi, Steve. Yeah. Debbie mentioned, I did speak with Phil Asherman over the weekend in preparation for this call, as I normally do now. And there is no change in the dates that they gave us and we gave you last fall. And I think it's important to emphasize what Debbie did, the commitment of each of our partners, and as you know, our customers, to get the project finished and into operation is completely there. We have joint venture board meetings regularly. We're all going to go out and see the sites next month when we have our meeting. And everybody is engaged in getting this important project done.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And just any other update on the partner issue?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Go ahead, Joe.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Yeah. Thanks, Debbie. There's really no update from what I gave at the Analyst Day. I continue to believe and I'm confident that we'll find a common path here to a solution, but as I mentioned, it's complex, and we have to negotiate all these things, and it requires unanimous consent as I mentioned. So, I don't have a particular date of when we're going to get it done, but it's clearly one of my priorities, and I'm focused on it, and I'm actively working on it with my team and with the partners.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","We will take our next question from Julien Dumoulin of UBS. Your line is open.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning. Good afternoon.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Hi, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Hi.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","So, quick first question here, more focused on the quarter than anything else. Can you elaborate a little bit more on \u2013 I think the gas marketing was the \u2013 what you guys talked about in the deck. What was the source of that $26 million higher earnings a little bit, and how should we think about that on a go-forward basis?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","I mean, that \u2013 we always have given you indications of kind of information on how gas prices affect our business and we have that information in the appendix. Part of what you're looking at is the change of gas prices year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter, but I'll have Jeff take you through that, and in particular to have you understand kind of what we think is going to happen for the remainder of the year. So, Jeff?","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","Good afternoon, Julien. On the $26 million improvement, roughly $15 million of that is from mark-to-market losses in the quarter last year. And as Debbie indicated, obviously, the natural gas prices have improved just over $1. I would also mention that at the end of this year you'll think about the ENI contract will be rolling off. And I think if I was to guide you in terms of how we think about the year, this segment we showed you at the analyst conference would report roughly $40 million to $50 million of negative results for the year, and we still think that's the best way to think about it.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Excellent. Can you elaborate any further successes? I know we're just a few weeks out in terms of the Peruvian bid or anything like that, and also in terms of Mexico on the marketing effort, those \u2013 both seems somewhat tangible (15:35)?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. As you say, it's only been 30 days out, Julien, but in that 30 days, we did announce a new solar project in Mexico. And we \u2013 if we think to answer the Mexico question first, is there's some wonderful opportunities in terms of renewables there. A lot of bids will be going out for additional renewable resources to meet the standards that have been set by Mexico.","And then, what's significant about the Pima project is it's one of the very first projects to be assigned with an industrial customer. And we think that that's a really interesting market to have some opportunities to directly sign up with some of the commercial and industrial customers to provide them renewable resources. Also on Mexico, we're still expecting bids coming out on the electric transmission side. And as we told you at the conference, we think there's some great opportunities to continue our efforts in the liquids side of the business, and don't have anything specific to announce in that area.","But we see a lot of interest in finding a partner like IEnova to build the infrastructure on the liquid side of the business. And as you know, we already have an ethane pipeline and a terminal and so we've been in that business and we think it has some great opportunities for us.","On the Peruvian pipeline, I will ask Steve Davis to add any color to that, but what I will tell you is that it looks like that that project will go out for bid and that it's likely to go out for bid later this year or the beginning of next year. And our focus has been on ensuring that the bid turns will allow for a truly competitive bid process with participants that are concerned about not taking on any Foreign Corrupt Practice Act responsibilities.","And as you know, we backed away from that when we felt that we could not get the kind of a clean deal that we felt that we could execute on. And so, we have had some meetings with the government officials, encouraging them to create a bid that ensures that the project is going to be financeable, and that there will be adequate opportunities to bid in the way that the bid is structured.","Steve, I don't know if you want to add anything more to that?","Steven D. Davis - Sempra Energy","Yeah. The only thing I would add, Julien, as you know, we talked a little bit about this at the analyst conference, and we obviously know a lot about the project. And as Debbie had mentioned, we are having discussions with the government. And to the extent that it fits our risk profile, we'll take another look at it and we expect something to happen either later this year or the first part of next year.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Excellent. Sorry, going back to the first question real quickly, Jeff, did I hear you right saying something about a contract rolling off? How does that impact the sensitivity, just really quickly to clarify?","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","I think that you'll recall that the \u2013 ENI was one of the original contracting parties at Cameron, and that contract is rolling off within the year. And what we're really basically saying is, next year, you will not have the benefit of that contract.","Steven D. Davis - Sempra Energy","And, Julien, that's the regas contract.","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","Right.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. I mean, this has been part of what we've told you all along that we want to remind you that that \u2013 because we start \u2013 I mean, it's a good thing \u2013 because we start the testing of the first train in the beginning of next year, we cannot have export going on at the same time as import. And so, that contract has to stop so that we can begin the testing of the trains for the export. And that impacts us financially later this year, and the beginning of next year, always have been incorporated into our base plans.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. But that reduces the sensitivity, just to be clear, the gas sensitivity?","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","Not really. It's \u2013 I mean, it's probably about a $5 million benefit this year and zero next year.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. All right. Sorry to belabor it. Thank you, all.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. It's a \u2013 if your question is, does that reduces sensitivity to gas prices, no, because it's really not dependent upon gas prices. The gas price sensitivity is really tied to the ECA plant and attained good (19:55) contract at the ECA plant, plus any gas in storage and have volatility during the course of the year.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. That's what I thought. Thank you.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Okay.","Operator","We will take our next question from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. One quick one just on the utilities, the Mobile Home Meter and the CIS projects. Those were not included in your base CapEx, but they were included in I think your upside scenarios, what's \u2013 can you kind of just walk us through what's changed in the last four or five weeks?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Sure. We've actually made our filing on the CIS project for SDG&E and about $250 million project. So, now we're beginning the regulatory process on that and that happened since the analyst conference. And then, do you want to talk a bit about the Master Meter, because there are some differences between the two utilities and how that moves forward?","Steven D. Davis - Sempra Energy","Sure, Debbie. Hi, Michael. As I had mentioned at the analyst conference and that looking at some of the incremental capital opportunities, they were both highlighted and we talked about quarter two filings of which we made a filing on the 28th and then one just on Friday for the Master Meter project. So, both are in alignment with what our plan is. The CapEx associated with the SDG&E Customer Information System is about $250 million and that the gas company for the Mobile Home Park, it's about a $270 million capital project. So, both are solid projects and we look forward to timely approval of those going forward.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","When do you think spend \u2013 how long do you think the regulatory approval process will likely be, and when do you think the capital \u2013 and what's the timeline for the capital to actually occur or actually be spend?","Steven D. Davis - Sempra Energy","Well, the good news is we've had two very successful pilot projects at both SDG&E and the gas company. So, the Commission is very well aware of our track record, and so we think we will get a timely decision likely in into 2018 and we would begin immediately after the approval.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And, Joe, I want to come back a little bit to the Cameron project. And I know you talked with Phil from CBI, but also note that in their earnings call yesterday, one of Phil's colleagues, Patrick Mullen, used the comment when asked about Cameron LNG and the start-up, and I'll quote, \"We expect the phased start-up of these three trains starting in the latter half of next year\". That may have just been kind of bundling of Train 1 and Train 2 with one supposed to be mid-year and one supposed to be at the end of the year, or you could interpret that as, hey, everything is moving a little bit more again. Would love your thoughts if any.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Joe, why don't you go ahead and...","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Okay. Yeah. Thanks, Michael. I obviously read that as well and I think you can read it a number of different ways. I think what he was saying wasn't different from what my discussion with Phil was because I've been in a number of conversations with Pat and I think they believe that they are in the schedule that they gave us. So, I think he was just commenting altogether, he basically said all the trains are moving toward getting into operation in the second part of the year, which is very consistent with what we said.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you, Joe. Much appreciated.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Sure.","Operator","We will take our next question from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Your line is open.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good morning.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Hi. How are you doing? So, a lot of my questions have been answered, but just a few quick ones. So, I was wondering how the Australian LNG curtailment potential might impact you guys. What kind of opportunities you guys might see or just in general what it means for the market? So, that was my first question.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. I'm going to have Joe go through it in more details, but what I will say is that we've been saying all along that we saw a market opportunity in the 2021 to 2023 period. And I think now the kind of the herd mentality is where we've been all along.","And that's why we've moved forward. We're trying to get Port Arthur in the marketing stage where we are right now. And while we're trying to get the issues with Cameron Train 4 resolved so that we can get into the market for that. And I think what you're seeing is what we have been predicting all along as if there was going to be a demand need in the market come that kind of timeframe, and that's why we've continued to work on development of our projects.","Joe, do you want to talk about the Australian curtailments?","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Sure. Hi, Paul. I guess I would say it this way, I think that the long-term users of LNG both in Asia and Europe are looking for long-term solutions and reliability. And so they want to make sure that they're going to a source where they can see that over a long term.","And I can say that the meetings that we had together with Woodside where we were jointly marketing the Port Arthur facility went very well and there's quite a lot of interest in that facility. And I think that what's going on in Australia it just shows that not necessarily getting these things done means that always that that's going to be available or available for a longer period of time.","So, I'm not sure it's going to have an immediate effect, but it starts to show that the end users are seriously starting to contemplate the need to go FID pretty soon, if not this year, next year or into the next year so that they can make sure that they meet the needs that they have, and don't get in trouble if something like that were to become more serious. And so, I think that having Woodside along with us has been very good for the project and for us. So, we look forward to trying to get these things signed up.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. So, it's been positive for the most part, and \u2013 but you don't actually see any sort of near-term potential opportunities that are going to be developed (26:42) if I'm understanding what you guys are saying, is that right?","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","I would like to make sure I understand your question. You're talking about near-term development projects in Australia or here?","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","No. No. I mean, with you guys. I mean, if you're having curtailments, that would suggest that people might have concerns about \u2013 first of all, what does it mean for just LNG sales in the near term in the market, what does it mean in terms of tightening up the market perhaps in Asia?","And then secondly, does it make \u2013 and it sounds like you were saying that it does, does it make people more interested in something like Port Arthur or are there opportunities that you guys are exploring in terms of getting supply that may not be as \u2013 I'm sorry, that may not have as much risk perhaps associated with it as something like we're seeing in Australia?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","I mean, we have talked to you all about what we saw as the advantages of the U.S. project, over these projects with dedicated supply sources because of the supply it dries up or that there's a problem of getting that supply to market. And in the U.S. market, you don't have one dedicated supply source for the gas.","And you also have the ability to sell off the gas at liquid points in the U.S. if you don't want to take the gas. I actually think that what's happening in Australia and in some of these other locations where the supply source starts to get more constrained makes it way better for the U.S. in terms of marketing our projects.","And so that's the opportunity that we see right now. And I think Woodside's seen the similar view, they've been very excited about our Port Arthur project from the beginning. And I think, being an Australian company, they see the benefit of that as well.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, great. And then the second question I have is that we're seeing \u2013 there was an announcement last \u2013 yesterday on some immigration enforcement by the DOJ with respect to another LNG facility. And we've also been hearing in other industries potential issues with immigration raising construction prices, delaying in-service dates and stuff. And I was just wondering \u2013 or at least the risk that's being perceived to that, I'm just wondering if that \u2013 is it all an issue that you guys are thinking about in terms of just as a cost and scheduling with LNG.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","I'm going to have Joe \u2013 because we just read the news report and we checked into it. It's not our project and we have controls in our project that should allow us not to have this kind of a situation occur. Joe, do you have any...","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Yeah. Thanks, Debbie. So, I think as she just said, we saw this article this morning and didn't \u2013 we haven't heard that, so that didn't sound like it was us.","I checked. It wasn't us, it wasn't CC JV, and it wasn't their contractors, and we have controls in place around that. Also, you heard on the call yesterday, Phil mentioned that they were employing a great number of people, and they have a huge roster of people that they go to to bring people onsite. And they haven't really had problems bringing people onto the site.","So, I think their controls are very sound, and we haven't seen this problem. Obviously, one of the reasons that we hired this consortium of contractors to work on this project was they have a large resource of people to go to, to bring to the site, and very much though in Louisiana.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I didn't mean to suggest it was your facility. I guess what I...","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","There was a comment that if a news article that it was.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Oh there was? Okay, I'm sorry.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah, there was. Yeah. That's why we had it checked right before the call. So...","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Yeah, I checked as well. But just an \u2013 and FYI, though, I guess, just a \u2013 sort of a derivative to that is \u2013 and I don't mean to belabor this, but are you seeing any issue with any of your projects, LNG or otherwise with respect to this issue of \u2013 we're hearing this from the building sector, et cetera, that like they're having significant concerns about access to labor due in part to limitations on immigration and more immigration enforcement. Have you heard of anything? Was that \u2013 is that something that's coming up in terms of costs or anything that you're hearing about in general in the market?","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","We have not, actually, Paul, and we do talk about this when we meet with the contractors. And they seem to have ready access to labor and have not brought this up as an issue.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Thanks so much.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thank you.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Thank you.","Operator","That concludes the time that we have for questions at this point. I would now turn the call over to Ms. Debbie Reed for closing remarks.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Well, thanks again, for joining us today.

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead.","Richard A. Vaccari - Sempra Energy","Welcome to Sempra Energy's fourth quarter 2016 financial presentation. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website.","With me in San Diego are Debbie Reed, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Snell, President; Jeff Martin, Chief Financial Officer; Steve Davis, Group President Utilities; Joe Householder, Group President of Infrastructure; Martha Wyrsch, General Counsel; and Trevor Mihalik, Chief Accounting Officer.","Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K.","It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis that we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our fourth quarter 2016 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures.","I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, February 28, 2017, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.","With that, please turn to slide 4, and let me hand the call over to Debbie.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thanks, Rick. On today's call, I will discuss several topics. Our 2016 achievements and update on the key items our management team is focused on in 2017 and our 2017 earnings guidance and dividend.","This morning we reported full-year 2016 earnings of $5.46 per share or $5.05 per share on an adjusted basis. Our 2016 adjusted earnings include a net $0.11 per share benefit related to several additional items.","The adoption of a new accounting standard for share-based compensation and a change in our planned repatriation, both partially offset by a revaluation of deferred income taxes related to Peruvian tax reform and the impairment of the north south pipeline.","This net benefit largely offset the loss of earnings resulting from the sale of our interest in the Rockies Express Pipeline. In 2016, we delivered on our financial targets and positioned ourselves for future success by resolving some key issues that I will discuss in a few minutes.","We are pleased to announce we are raising our 2017 earnings guidance to a range of $4.85 to $5.25 per share, up from our previous guidance of $4.80 to $5.20 per share. Jeff will review the key drivers of our increased guidance.","At Sempra, we have a long-standing commitment of growing our dividend. Consistent with this, our board approved a 9% increase in the 2017 dividend to $3.29 per share last week. As you'll recall, we're targeting 8% to 9% annual dividend increases over the next several years. The strength of our projected future cash flow gives us confidence we can grow our dividend at a higher rate than our utility peers. It also reinforces our commitment to maximizing total shareholder value through a combination of dividend and earnings growth.","The next few slides will highlight our key areas of focus in 2017, beginning with our California utilities on slide 5. Earlier this month, we reached an important proposed agreement on the cost of capital extension. The agreement sets SDG&E's and SoCalGas' authorized return on equity to 10.2% and 10.05%, respectively through 2019. In 2018, we will true-up long-term debt costs to actual debt costs at both are our California utilities. The debt true-up impacts earnings at the utilities by about $36 million per year, which we had already assumed in our financial plans.","This proposed agreement is an important step in gaining greater certainty to our planned utility earnings. Since we had already forecasted a debt true-up in 2018, the settlement has no material impact to the assumptions discussed at last year's Analyst Conference regarding utility capital structure and returns. CPUC approval is required, which is expected in the first half this year.","Moving to Aliso Canyon, SoCalGas has resolved a number of key issues, we sealed the leak over a year ago. The Department of Public Health conducted indoor and outdoor testing, which facilitated residents returning to their homes last summer. We've entered into two settlement agreements with governmental agencies, including the recent settlement with South Coast AQMD and at the facility we've strengthened the infrastructure and filed for approval to begin injections.","Our focus going forward is to resolve the remaining issues as expeditiously and safely as possible, including resuming injections at (5:57), continuing to collect insurance proceeds and resolving remaining legal claims. Turning to SONGS, the final decision in the arbitration hearing against MHI is expected in the near future.","The existing SONGS settlement agreement calls for an even split of their war between ratepayers and shareholders after reimbursement of attorney's fees. As a reminder, at the end of last year, the CPUC directed the parties to revisit the 2014 SONGS settlement agreement.","By April 28, all parties must come to an agreement, or the CPUC will begin further proceedings. Two all-party meetings have been held. We maintain that the existing settlement agreement is consistent with regulatory precedent and takes into consideration the best interests of the parties.","Please turn to slide 6 for an update on Cameron. I want to assure you that completing Cameron JV Trains 1-3 and putting them into service is a top priority for Sempra and the other owners. The JV continues to monitor the construction activities as well as the quality of the work and provides weekly progress reports to Sempra and other owners. Since the owners received the updated working schedule in early November, executive management from Cameron JV has had multiple meetings with Cameron's contractor to discuss and review the schedule and path forward.","Sempra management has also had discussions with the contractors. Cameron JV continues to engage additional independent resources to provide further insight into the construction process and progress. And the contractor has implemented a number of additional measures, which we think are important. The measures include improvement of drainage at the site to help mitigate effects of adverse weather conditions and re-sequencing the work to minimize risk and improve efficiency among other things. Cameron's contractor believes the current schedule is achievable and calls for in-service timeframes of mid-2018 for Train 1, end of 2018 for Train 2 and mid-2019 for Train 3. When we provide our 2018 earnings projections at the Analyst Conference, our results will reflect these estimated dates.","It is important to note that Cameron JV's exposure is safeguarded in two important ways. First, the lump sum turnkey contract is generally designed to transfer certain cost overrun and schedule risk to Cameron's contractor. Second, Cameron JV's tariff adjustment mechanism is designed to materially preserve its IRR in connection with cost overruns and schedule changes.","Sempra's focus continues to be delivering the overall long-term value of our interest in the Cameron JV to our shareholders, while reducing risk.","Before I hand the call over to Jeff, I'd like to take a moment to address the current political and business environment. I will take a minute to address potential policy implications to Mexico and later Jeff will discuss potential tax reform.","The current administration is focused on addressing the U.S. trade imbalance. The value of U.S. energy exports to Mexico in 2016 was more than twice the value of U.S. energy imports from Mexico, improving the U.S. trade imbalance.","IEnova's business supports this by helping build the backbone of Mexico's energy infrastructure. We continue to see great growth potential in Mexico and will highlight some of the opportunities we see at the upcoming Analyst Conference.","With that, I'll hand the call over to Jeff for his first earnings call as CFO. Please turn to slide 7.","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","Thanks, Debbie. I have the good fortune of starting my new role on a positive note. We've updated our plan and are increasing our 2017 EPS guidance range. Our new 2017 guidance is $4.85 to $5.25 per share. Our new range is up from the previous guidance of $4.80 to $5.20, provided at last year's Analyst Conference.","Next, I'll briefly discuss the key drivers of our updated guidance. First, both SDG&E and IEnova had strong performance in 2016, and we expect the improved performance to continue.","Given the strong international growth opportunities, we're no longer planning to repatriate cash from current earnings from Mexico or Peru. Our plan is to indefinitely reinvest the cash locally in capital projects. Compared to previous guidance, our tax expense is lower because of this change.","These benefits were partially offset by higher insurance costs at SDG&E and SoCalGas, that are not fully offset by cost savings included in our prior plan.","Let's turn to slide 8 to discuss our financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $379 million or $1.51 per share. On an adjusted basis, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $383 million or $1.52 per share. Full-year 2016 earnings were $1.370 billion or $5.46 per share. This compares favorably to 2015 earnings of $1.349 billion or $5.37 per share. On an adjusted basis, 2016 earnings were $5.05 per share. This year you'll also see the organizational changes we announced last fall. Our operations are now combined into two groups, Sempra Utilities and Sempra Infrastructure. Individual financial results for each of our businesses can be found in the appendix.","Next I'll go through a comparison of 2016 to 2015. This slide highlights our recent results and that they were impacted by several items. Debbie addressed the first five items earlier in her remarks. Please note that the change in our planned repatriation resulted in a reversal in 2016 of a $20 million tax charge taken in 2015.","The other main drivers of the year-over-year comparison are as follows; $9 million of net higher earnings at the California utilities, offset by $14 million lower favorable impact from the resolution of prior year's taxes at parent and $25 million lower favorable impact from foreign currency and inflation effects at Sempra Mexico and the South American utilities.","Next, let's please turn to slide 10. I'd like to end with a discussion on tax reform. There are a few proposals being circulated and we've evaluated several scenarios. At a high-level, we believe that most likely outcomes would not materially impact our projected earnings. At our California utilities, which represent almost 80% of our 2016 adjusted earnings, we don't expect any significant impact.","It's important to remember there's been a history of flow-through treatment for major tax reform dating back to 1986 and we expect any differences to be recorded in the memo account established by our final 2016 GRC. Under that decision, you will recall, we're required to track the impacts of tax changes with amounts reviewed in the next rate case. There are also opportunities to offset any potential reduced rate base from 100% expensing with additional capital spending.","When you consider the potential impact to our EPS five years from now, we expect there's a potential range of a negative 5% to 6% to a positive 5% to 6%. The low end assumes 20% corporate tax rate, 100% expensing of capital, immediate non-deductibility of interest, and a potential to use some foreign cash to reduce U.S. debt.","In contrast, the high-end scenario has the same assumptions except Cameron qualifies for the border tax exemption and the non-deductibility of interest is confined to new debt only. We've also looked at additional scenarios, which we believe are more likely and involve some form of mitigation resulting in a range of negative 1% to 3%. To be clear, we found this to be the most likely outcome.","It's uncertain if there'll be any material change to our current tax laws, but if they are the impacts to our earnings profile to be materially different than what is shown here. In the interim, we'll be working with key trade associations and independently to ensure that the unique aspects of our industry and our company are fully understood and fairly represented.","Next, please turn to slide 11 for a few closing remarks from Debbie.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thanks, Jeff. In summary, we were able to meet our 2016 adjusted earnings guidance, while positioning ourselves for long-term success. We executed our operational plan and continue to resolve key challenges, including finalizing the GRC at our California utilities and most recently reaching a proposed settlement on the cost of capital extension, closing the PEMEX JV acquisition, winning the marine pipeline bid jointly with TransCanada and executing the successful IEnova equity follow-on offerings in Mexico.","Selling REX and our Southeast utilities to more closely align our assets with our long-term growth strategy and making significant progress related to Aliso Canyon. These are just some of the accomplishments that have established our foundation for future success and give us confidence in our 2017 dividend growth and earnings guidance discussed today. We look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming Analyst Conference here in San Diego on April 4 and April 5 and talking more then about our future.","Finally, I'd like to take a minute to acknowledge Mark Snell for his extraordinary contributions to the success of Sempra. It has been a pleasure to work with him over the last 15 years, and we wish him well as he moves into the next chapter of his life.","With that, we'll conclude our prepared comments and stop to take any questions you have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will take our first question from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good morning.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Hi, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","I just wanted to be \u2013 a couple of questions. First is, I just wanted to make sure it's clear that you're going to assume Train 1 mid-2018, Train 2 end of 2018, Train 3 in mid-2019, when you give us the guidance in April, but you have not formally agreed to a change in the contract in terms of the delivery dates, is that right?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Let me hit the high level and then I'll have Joe talk a little bit about where we are on that. As we look at the schedule on the trains, the schedule that you laid out is the schedule that has been confirmed by the contractors, the schedule that they believe that they can deliver the trains on. And we've been doing a lot of due diligence work both with the Cameron JV and then some follow-up meetings that the Sempra team has had with the contractor.","And so, when we give our guidance \u2013 assuming nothing changes between now and the time we give our future guidance, we will be using that estimate that the contractor has affirmed to us as their current estimate. In terms of contractually, we're still working through all of those issues, but we've basically been using that as the schedule for the trains.","Joe, do you want to add?","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Thanks, Debbie. Hi, Greg. The concise answer to your question is no, we did not change the contract, but the contractor still has earlier dates in it. This is their working schedule that they're working with and the one they think is achievable.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. So that's important for our understanding of the safeguards, right, that you're not giving \u2013 you're conceding that they won't owe you liquidated damages if they're late?","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","We have not \u2013 that's correct, we've not. And as you might remember, our IRR pretty much stays intact, whether there is a change in cost or a change in schedule. The most important thing is our earnings are protected it's just a question really of what happens to the tariff with respect to the issue that (19:24).","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. And then Jeff I had a question for you, you commented on a decision to not undertake tax repatriation from South America, because of the better growth prospects there. So not to jump the gun on the Analyst Day presentation, but is it safe to assume that we're going to see higher regulated capital expenditures in Chile and the Peru versus the prior plan as a result of that reassessment?","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","Greg, thanks a lot for your question. I mean I think one of the things I would say in response is we had our largest ever capital campaign last year of $5.3 billion, that was driven largely by our California utilities with $2.7 billion. But we are seeing a lot more deal flow outside of our regulated utilities, a lot of that showed up last year in Mexico. I think from a repatriation standpoint, we're really looking at whether we can put those earnings to work in a more efficient way there locally. And that currently is our assumption going into our planning period. So this is something we probably as you indicated, we'll give you a lot more visibility on in April.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay, great. And then can I ask you know I know \u2013 this is last question for me, the list of changes on page 9 from 2015 to 2016. As I think about what the old guidance was and how you did significantly better than old guidance on what you delivered in 2016, thank you for that. So what were the key changes that happened as you sort of got into the fourth quarter that moved you from the middle of the old guidance range to where you actually delivered?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","I think...","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","I would assume, they were some of the tax changes in the repatriation and some of the order tax things.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yes, so I mean those were the major things that occurred, there were, we tried to delineate pretty much everything that was happening for the quarter and for the year. So you could get a good picture of it. And I think that the major issues were some of the tax things and then there was a change in the accounting methodology for stock-based compensation and that also had an effect for last year's results.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thank you.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Good morning. One other clarification on Cameron, when you last talked about this, the contractors never had told you why there was a delay. So, have they clarified to you why the delay in the schedule?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yes. I mean, what they've claimed is that much of the delay was due to weather conditions and as we've all known that there has been a lot of rain that's occurred. What I'd like to do though, was \u2013 Joe actually met with the principals of the CB&I yesterday with the lead director on our board for our \u2013 actually the chair of our LNG construction committee, and he is the prior CEO of Fluor. And so they both went and met with the principals of CB&I yesterday, and I thought \u2013 I think it might be helpful to add a little bit more color on what came from that meeting. Joe?","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Thanks, Debbie. Hi, Steve. These are complex projects. There's thousands \u2013 there's over 20,000 line items of things that they're working on. So there's lots of things that go on in the project. Certainly weather is a factor among other things. One of the things that we spoke about yesterday when we talked about their confidence in meeting the working schedule is, they're making sure that logistically they're doing things in the best way possible. So, for example, they were talking about how they're going to move pieces of equipment directly to locations, reducing the use of cranes. There's so many different things, it's hard to characterize and pin anything on one particular item, because there are so many. But we had a good meeting with them yesterday and spoke about a number of issues. Again, remember that the Cameron joint venture is, the one in-charge of the contract with them and working with them on a daily basis and our director and I were there to basically do due diligence for Sempra to understand where they were and their confidence level in moving along and keeping to the working schedule and keeping that on track.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Want to \u2013 maybe just a little bit of a logistical question for the Analyst Day. Is your intention to still do the same kind of year-ahead outlook and then five-year outlook, as you've always done?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Our intention is to give the 2018 numbers and then to give a growth rate through 2021, consistent with...","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","...ahead of our past practice.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And just at a high level and again I'm not sure this is fully possible right now, but just you mentioned like the repatriation changes, you have the updated schedule for Cameron, but is there any kind of things that we should just be kind of noting that have changed a lot versus the long-term outlook given then?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","I think those are the things you named are the most significant things and we'll give you the details of that when we get to the Analyst Conference with laying out our 2018 numbers and then what has changed from when we last forecast 2018, which was several years ago. So, one thing as an example when we last forecast 2018, we still were forecasting REX in it.","So, I mean I think most of those things you know about and I don't think that there is anything that I'm aware of that you probably don't already know about, but how it all comes together we'll share with you when we get to the Analyst Meeting.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. And I guess last question just on Mexico, you talked very briefly on it, but just maybe a little bit more color on how you're looking at the kind of political economic implications of the new administration and the like, and just maybe a little more color on, is it impacting future bids or kind of strategy around IEnova.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","No. We really haven't seen anything impacting our business in Mexico. We see amazing growth opportunities in Mexico, and what we see there happening is that the markets that are opening are creating additional opportunities for us. We see some electric transmission bids coming, renewables is a big focus, they've set a renewable portfolio standard. Those bids we see going forward and then we're really interested in some opportunities we see with liquids pipelines and receiving terminals.","And so, we see that business continuing to move forward and in discussions that we've had with the officials in Mexico and then with some of the administration that this \u2013 when we look at energy imports, exports, the U.S. export is twice as much in the energy space to Mexico as we receive from Mexico. So it really meets what the focus is, is to correct any trade imbalances. And so we see that opportunity for us to continue to grow in the energy space in Mexico remaining under the administration. And so going forward, we'd be talking about a lot of opportunities that Carlos and his team have on the drawing board right now, when we get to our Analyst Meeting, and are very excited about it.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. Thank you.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll now go to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. Hi. One housekeeping question and then one maybe more structural question. On the housekeeping side, can you just talk about the impact of bonus depreciation over the next couple of years, and also your position under current tax law in terms of cash tax payments levels over the next couple of years?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. I'm going to have Jeff and Trevor talk about that. As Jeff mentioned, when we looked at the provisions of tax reform going forward and the impact of bonus depreciation beyond the time that we had envisioned in our plan, because when we gave you our plans, we always looked at the bonus depreciation effect in the plans as far as that had been continued.","Now if that continues beyond the timeframe, Jeff indicated to you that we thought it would be \u2013 it's about a 10% more capital or about a $100 million of each utility that would need to be spent to offset that, and we feel that that is very achievable with the kinds of long-term projects that we have like PSEP underway. So, but I'll have Jeff specifically talk on the cash tax impact.","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","Good morning, Michael. I will just start by saying that when you get back to what the policymakers' priorities are in California, you think about safety and reliability and grid modernization. I mean, these are kind of ride in the wheelhouse. So we think it is important to our customers.","So, if you go back to the original conversation on bonus depreciation several years ago, I think what you've really seen is the company is spending more capital to meet the policymakers' requirements, and no real change in terms of the impact to our rate base. And I think to Debbie's point, the bonus depreciation rules, which are in place today, were really reflected in the guidance we laid out last summer. And then on a going-forward basis, if you did move under tax reform to a 100% expensing, I think what we've laid out is, to Debbie's point again, it would require us about another $100 million of incremental capital at each of our utility to not have any erosion to our rate base. So, I think one of the things that we're kind of embolden by as we spend about \u2013 invest about $2.7 billion in 2016, which is one of our highest shares ever in terms of capital deployment at SoCalGas and SDG&E, we have lots of opportunity going forward. So I think there is a fair amount of enthusiasm of getting to the Analyst Day and kind of laying out that larger capital plan.","And then with respect to cash taxes, currently, we had an effective tax rate last year of 21%, we think that probably goes up slightly going into 2017, but currently, we are not in a cash taxpaying situation.","Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy","Yes, we're not in a cash taxpaying situation throughout the period of the plan that we will be presenting.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And then, Debbie, thinking a little more structural, you made the organizational shift kind of creating a Utilities Group and an Infrastructure Group. Are you rethinking the broader structure, meaning are you and the board rethinking the broader structure of Sempra at all about what pieces fit well together and have natural synergies with each other across the multiple different businesses and multiple different geographies you serve, and whether there is a greater opportunity to create value, if maybe some of the pieces aren't part of the same corporate puzzles?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","I mean, Michael, we always look at that, and that we always assess the structure of our company, we look at the assets that we have and which assets we want to keep and which we want to dispose of. I mean I think you've seen us do that clearly. We \u2013 in the last year we sold REX and we sold the Mobile Gas and Willmut Gas. And so, we always look at those things, and there is nothing in the near-term offing for that, but as those businesses continue to grow; we've tried to preserve optionality. I mean that was one reason we did the IPO in Mexico, we have an ownership in Peru that is outside of our ownership and we tried to structure these things in a way that will give us flexibility. The businesses no longer fit together in a portfolio that we would have the option of changing the way the businesses are structured, but there is nothing that we have \u2013 you should not read this as a sign that anything is planned now.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you, Debbie. Much appreciated.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good morning.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Hi, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","So, on Cameron, in terms of \u2013 I mean if I heard your comments, you sound like you guys were a little bit more oriented maybe towards reducing risks, and I didn't hear as much about expansion or potential expansion, is there been a change or are there any thoughts that, just basically how you guys always have thought about it or is there any sort of reassessment or any change in how you look at the risk or opportunity at Cameron?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","When we \u2013 what Joe was going through is, when we structured Cameron, we were very clear on the risk that Sempra was willing to keep and the risk that we wanted to lay off to other parties. And for Trains 1 through 3, it was very clear to us that we did not want to take the construction risk associated with either pricing or timing of construction, because we were not doing the construction and we were not \u2013 you have a joint venture overseeing the construction, it wasn't Sempra alone overseeing the construction. So, we fashioned this in a way that we protected our shareholder interest and keeping the economics of the project solid, regardless of what happened with the timing or the cost of construction. We laid those risks off intentionally. That's not to say that we're not looking at expansion and when we did that contract, we also looked at the expandability of the facility and we had terms in the agreement that went through, how we would expand to a 5-train facility.","We've commented before that one of our partners has not been willing to provide the equity for the expansion and that we are working to resolve those issues with that partner, so that we can expand to a Train 4, that we've had meetings with that partner and the principals of that partner and are in discussions with them to see, if we can reach a resolution on that. And then, once we get that resolved, we are very interested in continuing forward with Cameron Train 4, because we think it's going to be one of the lowest cost options in the marketplace and it's a really good option.","And so, nothing has changed in that, but as we told you before, we've got to resolve this partner issue in order for us to move forward with expansion and we're diligently working on that now.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Great. And then, I apologize for being \u2013 if I missed this. But the border tax adjustment, it just isn't intuitive to me why that would apply, what is it that \u2013 how does that work I guess, why would...","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yes, I'm going to have \u2013 go ahead with your question. I am sorry.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I'm just wondering, I guess, just simply, why would it apply to Cameron in the first place, I guess?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Okay. I'm going to have Jeff go through that for Cameron and as we indicated, we think it's not a highly likely scenario, but there are, depending on how this is drafted in terms of the final tax provisions, and we all know that's a moving target now, so that there are some ways where it could apply and be a benefit. Jeff?","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","Good afternoon, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good afternoon.","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","I think just as you think about it, under a border adjustment, the taxes will apply to where the goods are consumed rather than produced. And the thing that hits us most directly as you recall, we have two facilities that actually we import power in the United States from. The first one is our Mexicali Power Plant referred to as TdM, that one is held for sale, so we expect that will resolve itself by middle of the summer.","And then secondly, IEnova has the ESJ wind farm that dispatches into the California grid. We've done some assessment around that and the applicable taxes, if border adjustment did go forward and we think that's a non-material issue to our company. But what's a little bit interesting is, if you think about the Cameron facility, it's probably unlikely, Paul, that it would apply to us, but there have been scenarios in different bad countries, where the export exemption has applied upstream.","So think about that as a towing facility, no different than a power plant, right? Our customers bring gas to the facility and they are ultimately the ultimate exporter from the facility, it's just something we want to track closely, because if you did see a decline in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, if the border adjustment did apply, it would be reducing the tax on Cameron an incremental 20% to 0%.","So again, to Debbie's point, it's probably speculative at this point. It will really depend on how the legislation is written, but it's something that we'll be actively following.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Great. And then I guess the sundry item on the balance sheet went up about $100 million I think from Q3 to Q4. Was there any earnings impact associated with that?","Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy","Yeah. Paul, it's Trevor. No, there is no earnings impact with that. Primarily what the increase there is it's the greenhouse gas allowances and then also the assets associated with the pension benefit. So, those are really the drivers on the increase, but no P&L impacts on those items. We used to combine the Rabbi Trust in there and then that, any movement in the Rabbi Trust would have a small P&L impact, but there we've broken it out a couple lines above.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks so much.","Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy","Thanks.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","And we'll go next to Faisel Khan with Citigroup.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah. Good afternoon. Faisel from Citi. Have you guys looked at this sort of the smaller scale LNG or modular scale LNG sort of concept that we've seen both Cheniere talk about and this new start-up, Tellurian, talk about, have you guys looked at that as sort of a competing technology to the expansions at Cameron?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","We have looked at that technology. We specifically looked at it for ECA and whether or not something like that would be better than trying to convert the facility at Costa Azul. Joe, do you want to comment on that?","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Yeah. Faisel, as Debbie said, we continue to look at many of these things, we look at a lot of projects. We're very mostly focused on the three projects, the Cameron expansion, the Port Arthur and ECA facility and building the larger scale trains, we think those will have the best economics and in terms of getting to the large scale customers. I think a lot of these smaller scale wins work well in the emerging markets things and some of the other ones, but that's not where our current focus is.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Yeah. Because some of these facilities are modular design, but they're still large facilities like 50 million ton, 20 million ton facilities, but I guess with what these new companies are advertising or our technologies are advertising is that they can get the cost structure sort of down below a certain number to make them competitive, so it sounds like you guys have looked at this technology and it's not necessary \u2013 you don't think it's cost competitive with the bigger scale trains.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yes. And what I would say is that we've looked at this several times and that it depends on the market that you want to serve, and when we looked at it, as we were looking at potentially serving the Hawaiian market out of Costa Azul and something like that for a smaller market may make sense. I mean most of what we're looking at is the focus on the lowest cost for the volume of the facility and we don't see that technology as being the best technology when you have the kind of facilities that we have, that have great shipping up lanes and docking potential and all of that. If you had to serve islands in the Caribbean or Hawaii, it's by application and by the market you are going after and that we tend to go after the larger markets with long-term contracts and that's kind of our business plan.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","These might eventually turnout okay, but when you are dealing with the big utilities, you're looking for something that has sustained reliability over long periods of time and they want to make sure that when they sign up for something that you are going to be able to deliver operating results over long periods of time.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Understood. Thank you.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Yes.","Operator","It appears there are no further questions at this time. I would now turn the conference back to Debbie Reed for any additional or closing remarks.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Well, thanks for joining us this morning. We really appreciated the questions and we hope to see all of you at our Analyst Conference on April 4 and April 5 in San Diego. And if you have any follow-up questions our IR team will be available to respond to them later today.

A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section. Here in San Diego are several members of our management team, including Jeff Martin, Chief Executive Officer; Joe Householder, President and Chief Operating Officer; Trevor Mihalik, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Dennis Arriola, Executive Vice President and Group President; Martha Wyrsch, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and Peter Wall, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller.","Before starting, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that we\u2019ll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company\u2019s most recent 10-K filed with the SEC.","It\u2019s important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis, and that we\u2019ll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for reconciliation to GAAP measures. I\u2019d also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, February 26, 2019, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.","With that, please turn to Slide 4, and let me hand the call over to Jeff.","Jeff Martin","Thanks a lot, Faisel. And thank you all for joining us today. 2018 was an exceptional year for Sempra both operationally and financially. It was also a transformative year marking our company's 20th anniversary and the continuation of our strategic mission to become North America's premier energy infrastructure company. As I mentioned at our Analyst Day last June, since our formation, we\u2019ve proactively managed our business portfolio. Over the years this has greatly improved our earnings and cash flow visibility while bolstering a lower risk profile. ","Importantly, our recent accomplishments have laid a solid foundation for us to build on and include completing the Oncor transaction, closing the sale of our US solar business, closing the sale of our natural gas storage assets, announcing the sale of our US wind business, announcing Oncor\u2019s InfraREIT acquisition, announcing the sale of the South American businesses and making very important progress on our LNG projects, among other successes. ","Over the last 12 months, we've accomplished a tremendous amount. The amounts of activity we've had is uncommon and even more uncommon are the results. I cannot be more proud of our team and what we've done to improve our portfolio. Notably, we expect our renewables and midstream divestitures to yield approximately $2.5 billion in proceeds. This is an excellent result and provides a valuable opportunity to pay down debt and redeploy capital to support our growth ","I also want to highlight that this past year SDG&E received the prestigious Edison award from EEI for its efforts to enhance wildfire preparedness and grid resiliency. This award is presented to only one US investor-owned utility each year. At Cameron LNG we have entered the critical commissioning phase of construction and also have an excellent safety record with over 67 million hours worked without a lost time incident. ","Additionally, we were recently added to the Dow Jones Utility Index, a strong testament to the continued focus on execution and commitment to delivering shareholder value. ","Now, turning to our financial results, earlier this morning we reported full year 2018 adjusted earnings of $5.57 per share, one of the strongest years in our company's history. This puts us above the midpoint of our full year 2018 adjusted earnings guidance. ","In addition, our Board approved a dividend increase of 8% for 2019. This marks the ninth consecutive year we've raised our dividend and represents 47% growth over the last five years. This is important for a number of reasons because it clearly demonstrates our commitment to a healthy dividend policy. ","I'm also pleased to say that we\u2019re affirming our full year 2019 adjusted earnings guidance of $5.70 to $6.30 per share. Trevor will review the key drivers influencing guidance later on the call. ","I\u2019d also like to spend a few minutes on California. ","Earlier this month, we filed our Wildfire Mitigation Plan related to Senate Bill 901. This file is a continuation of our ongoing focus on safety, reliability and wildfire prevention that we\u2019ve been implementing for over a decade. And during this time, we've invested about $1.5 billion in these efforts. ","Regarding the State's efforts to reduce wildfire threats and their potential impacts, we are very encouraged by recent statements by the governor and as well as the formation of the Blue Ribbon Commission and the Governor Strike Team. There is widespread recognition among the Governor, Legislature, Utility Commission that the current liability rules for California utilities need to be fixed to support a long-term solution for the state and to allow it to meet the State\u2019s energy policy goals. ","To be clear, these goals cannot be that without strong financially healthy utilities that support the infrastructure investments needed to deliver cleaner and lower cost energy solutions. We anticipate solutions being brought forward will fall into three key categories. ","First, help reduce the threat of wildfires across our State. Second protect the interests of our State\u2019s rate payers. And third, provide a clear legislative pathway for timely and adequate cost recovery for prudent system operators. These potential outcomes will help create a longer-term sustainable framework for the State and its energy future. ","Finally, I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t take a moment to recognize Martha Wyrsch. Martha will be retiring at the beginning of the March. On behalf of everyone here at Sempra I wanted to thank Martha for her tremendous contributions to the company. We wish Martha and her family all the best in retirement. ","Now, please turn to Slide 5, and I'll hand it over to Trevor.","Trevor Mihalik ","Thanks, Jeff. As Jeff mentioned, we accomplished a lot in 2018 making great progress to refocus our efforts on the strategic mission to become North America's premier energy infrastructure company. ","Additionally, with two months of 2019 behind us, we\u2019ve already announced the completion of the evaluation of the South American businesses. Bank of America and Lazard will act as our financial advisors and will begin the sales process in March. We\u2019ve also started implementing the next round of continuous cost improvement initiatives, which I'll touch on in a few minutes. ","All of these developments demonstrate this management's theme to focus on execution and commitment to creating shareholder value. Please turn to the next slide.","The decision to sell the South American businesses was not something we, nor our Board, took lightly. The six-month evaluation process was comprehensive. The primary criteria we looked at are laid out in the slide. Both businesses screened well in many areas but we concluded that they no longer remain a strategic fit for us. ","As part of this evaluation we assessed the benefits and rationale for holding and growing or partnering and growing. However, we determined the sale of these businesses and redeployment of the proceeds into North American infrastructure should maximize value for our shareholders while giving us the opportunity to strengthen our balance sheet while paying down parent debt. ","There is no doubt that the South American businesses are considered some of the most desirable companies in the region with strong company-specific and macro fundamentals. We certainly have received robust inquiry from global financial and strategic buyers ahead of our formal sales process commencing. ","Although, we expect this transaction to be EPS dilutive, it could be value accretive, as we deploy the proceeds into North American T&D infrastructure and strengthen our balance sheet.","Portfolio optimization is not something new to our company, and we've talked about this many times over the years. We have a long and successful track record of actively managing our portfolio, including exiting businesses that are either no longer consistent with our strategy, or provide greater long-term value through selling rather than holding. A great example of this is the sale of our US solar assets late last year. ","The decision to sell the South American businesses is a continuation of this philosophy and demonstrates our commitment to maximizing value for our shareholders. We're targeting a transaction announcement in mid-2019 and closing the transaction by the end of this year.","Please turn to Slide 7, where I'll review our efforts around cost improvement initiatives. At our Analyst Day in June last year, you'll recall that Jeff walked through the evolution of our business portfolio, illustrating how our management team is continuously reassessing our strategy and business platforms, and how they fit with changing market environments. ","In direct alignment with this portfolio of review process, we're always refining and reevaluating our cost structure, in order to optimize the organization to effectively accomplish our strategic goals.","Sempra has a history of being a prudent cost manager. We make thoughtful and deliberate efforts to reduce costs in ways that make our organization efficient, but also very effective. Our continuous cost improvement process is designed to yield long-term savings and instill a cost conscious culture across the organization. A great example of this is the $65 million of annual savings identified a few years ago at our California utilities that was incorporated into the 2019 GRC filings. These savings should benefit our customers, by allowing us to allocate these dollars to continued infrastructure investments in safety and reliability.","Recently, we've initiated further efforts around continuous cost improvements, designed to right size our organization with our evolving business portfolio. The announced sale of our assets and other efficiencies will allow us to reduce our corporate costs. We expect these cost savings to ramp up to approximately $15 million annually on a pre-tax basis, over the next few years. Our management team is committed to reviewing our cost on a regular basis to ensure we run an organization as effectively and as efficiently as possible.","Now please turn to Slide 8, where I'll hand the call off to Joe.","Joe Householder ","Thanks, Trevor. First, I'd like to briefly touch on the IEnova in Mexico. Mexico is the world's 15th largest economy at over $1 trillion in GDP, with nearly 130 million people. The infrastructure needs of the country are expected to remain significant. For example, only 7% of the households have access to natural gas. And residential electricity demand is expected to double by 2040.","For more than two decades IEnova has remained focused on developing energy infrastructure that promotes economic development in a sustainable and socially responsible way. IEnova is working with the private sector on additional opportunities that should benefit the country, such as, refined product terminals that should enhance Mexico's energy security and the reliability of transportation fuel supplies; renewable projects that should increase Mexico's clean energy supply and be a source of efficient, low-cost electricity, and the conversion of Energia Costa Azul project to an LNG export project that should bring additional regional investment, economic development and jobs.","As IEnova mentioned on their call late last week, they\u2019re proactively engaged in discussions with the current administration, related to natural gas transportation contracts that were awarded through public and international tender processes. IEnova has always had a very constructive relationship with the Mexican Government and its institutions. The company that is committed to being a responsible partner, IEnova looks forward to working collaboratively to advance the country's energy goals and build out the infrastructure needed to provide clean, safe, reliable and low cost energy.","Please turn to the next slide. Moving onto Cameron. The onsite teams are relentlessly focused on moving through commissioning towards completion of Train 1. The contractor has made significant progress recently with the completion of the gas turbine testing, commissioning of the boil-off gas compressors, introduction of fuel gas into the system and completion of all three flares ignition testing. In the near term, the contractor expects to introduce speed gas sometime this quarter and it also expects to produce LNG stabilized production and complete performance testing in the second quarter.","With that said, we expect to start receiving earnings by mid 2019. This first phase of construction, which includes Train 1 and the associated support systems, as well as the common infrastructure that will be used by all three Trains represents approximately 60% of the entire project. After many years of development and construction, all the employees involved, as well as the community are excited, that the facility will soon be up and running, further boosting the local economy, while also helping to meet global energy demand.","As you may have heard on McDermott's call yesterday, the same teams are working hard toward completion of Trains 2 and 3. McDermott reported that Train 2 is targeted to be completed by the end of Q4 and Train 3 is targeted to be completed by the end of Q1 2020. This schedule is consistent with what was disclosed on their Q3 2018 call.","Please turn to the next slide, where Trevor will review our financial results.","Trevor Mihalik ","Thanks, Joe. Earlier this morning we reported fourth quarter GAAP earnings of $864 million or $3.03 per share. On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter earnings were $431 million or $1.56 per share. Full year 2018 GAAP earnings were $924 million or $3.42 per share. This compares to 2017 GAAP earnings of $256 million or $1.01 per share. On an adjusted basis, full year 2018 earnings were $1,503 million or $5.57 per share. This compares favorably to our 2017 adjusted earnings of $1,368 million or $5.42 per share.","Please turn to Slide 11, where I'll discuss the key drivers impacting our full year 2018 results. The year-over-year increase in full year adjusted earnings was driven primarily by higher operational earnings in 2018, including $371 million of earnings at the Sempra Texas Utility segment, resulting from the acquisition of our interest in Oncor in March of 2018. $65 million of higher earnings at SDG&E, primarily due to electric transmission operations, $25 million of higher earnings at Sempra Mexico, mainly driven by higher pipeline operational earnings, and $16 million of higher earnings at SoCalGas, due to higher PSEP earnings. This was partially offset by $310 million of higher costs related to increased interest expense and preferred stock dividends at the parent, which includes the impact of our Oncor acquisition financing. And $21 million unfavorable impact from the foreign currency and inflation effects, net of foreign currency hedges in Mexico.","Please turn to the next slide. Several significant business developments since our last Analyst conference, we thought it would be helpful to provide a brief walk through of the key items related to our affirmation of our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance. First, we removed the earnings associated with the US renewables and nonutility natural gas storage assets, subsequent to their respective sale close dates. Second, we added partial year earnings from Oncor's planned acquisition of InfraREIT and our planned acquisition of a 50% equity interest in Sharyland. And third, we added the positive impacts from using the expected $2.5 billion of proceeds from the sale of solar, wind and natural gas storage.","When taking these items into account, we are affirming our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.70 to $6.30 that was presented at the Analyst Conference last year. This is a strong outcome, given the significant activity within our business portfolio.","Please turn to Slide 13. As we turn our attention to the rest of 2019, we'll continue to focus on the positive momentum we've developed over the past year. We've identified several goals to progress on our strategic mission to become North America's premier energy infrastructure company. They include among others, continuing to focus every day on public and employee safety as a cultural imperative, optimizing and completing the remaining asset divestitures, optimizing cost structures, improving the franchise value of our LNG business by progressing on our five development projects, completing Oncor's InfraREIT acquisition and executing on their growth initiatives in Texas, and advancing our 2019 General Rate Case and cost of capital filings at the California utilities among others.","Please turn to the next slide. As I stated at the beginning of my comments, we are very proud of the great strides we've made in the many accomplishments in 2018. We delivered strong financial results and our company is aligned for the future. We look forward to continuing this progress and feel prepared to meet the challenges and capture strategic opportunities that lie ahead.","Looking to next month, we are excited to host many of you in San Diego for our analyst conference. We will cover several topics including detailed segment guidance for 2019 and 2020, the five year capital plan and rate base growth for our three US utilities, our growth outlook in Mexico and an update on the progress of our approximately 45 Mtpa of LNG development opportunities.","We'll also be hosting a tour of our industry leading weather center at SDG&E and highlighting some of the innovative technologies around safety, reliability and resiliency that we've deployed on our systems.","With that, we'll conclude the prepared comments and start to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We will take our question from Greg Gordon. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Greg Gordon ","A couple of questions. Great year. I'm just wondering if you can go into a little bit more detail on how you were able to exceed the high end of the guidance range of the utilities for fiscal year '18? And how do we think about how that sets the stage for going forward?","Jeff Martin","Greg. Thank you for the question and thanks for joining the call. I think for those of you have followed our company for a long period of time, certainly SoCalGas and the SDG&E are kind of the clear drivers underpinning our financial performance. I think you can see that year-over-year there was a lot of growth, particularly at SDG&E, and one of the slides kind of points out some of that oversize growth particularly around the FERC business, which is really a function of increased capital investments in and around our high voltage system and our substations, as well as a periodic for true-up which occurs, which was also helped to last year's results. I'd just like to ask, Trevor, if you like to add any other content around SoCalGas or SDG&E?","Trevor Mihalik ","Yes. No, thanks, Jeff. I think also one of the things that the utilities are focused on are cost savings and certainly driving cost efficiencies in their businesses. But again, I think it's really just great operational results that have driven these earnings.","Greg Gordon ","Great. And I know there's been -- there has been and will probably continue to be a lot of volatility around the peso, and I think the assumption you are using is your baseline is a bit higher than where the peso is today. So how should we think about how that sort of friction inside the guidance range?","Trevor Mihalik ","Yes. I think what I would do is refer you to the rule of thumb that we have in the appendix of the deck, and it shows kind of where we are assuming the peso will go by the end of the year and then it has that plus or minus 5%. I think if you look at that, given where the peso was last year and how we absorbed the peso strengthening in our earnings and we're still well within our guidance, I would just kind of direct you to that and I think there's enough other things that we're working on that could offset a strengthening peso.","Greg Gordon ","Okay. I mean just to keep it high levels, if I start at the midpoint, that should and then flex from their I'd be -- as we go through the year looking at a reasonable approximation of how the peso is affecting your outcomes?","Jeff Martin","I would just say I think that's the right approach. But I think as we've seen in the past Greg, the peso will continue to demonstrate some volatility. I think our goal is to make sure that when we put earnings out there and guidance that we can deliver that. I think the point Trevor was making is we've got enough levers in our portfolio that we will adequately follow the pace up. I think that we feel good -- very good about our 2019 range.","Greg Gordon ","Okay. Final question from me. Despite the progress that you've demonstrated at Cameron, there is still this lingering fear out there in the Ether that that somehow this project is either still going to come on late, even though we're toward the back-end of the construction process, or that there is some way that there is incremental financial remuneration that you may have to give to the joint venture constructing the project to get this thing done. When do we pass the point of no return where those lingering fears that sort of definitively behind us from your perspective?","Jeff Martin","Greg, I think it's a great question. I can assure you that we remain concerned. I think that's how you manage because projects has be on top of these types of things. I would comment that Joe has done a remarkable job with his team, and worked with our partners on the Cameron build out. Also I think if you listen McDermott's call yesterday, they have been quite clear. But what they believe they can deliver and we will remain active with our partners and managing that relationship against the commissioning timeline. Joe could you provide some additional color on your conversations with David and how you're approaching it?","Joe Householder","Thanks, Jeff. I think you'd handled that well. But Greg, look together at Sempra and our partners and our customers we're very excited about the impending start-up at Cameron. And we're all focused on finishing the commissioning of Train 1 and continuing to work on Train 2 and 3. And I talked to David quite often and Jeff just mentioned, he was very strong about his desire to complete this world-class facility and their stocks doing very well today. And we're working hard toward continuing to push forward.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe.","Steve Fleishman ","Great. So just Jeff question on California. So obviously, you've done a good job making -- avoiding fires, invested a lot for your system, but there's still, I think a lot of outside concerned of just as California done enough to limit risk for the companies and credit agencies putting pressure on you too. So I'm just kind of curious what you -- from your standpoint as someone who is not had a fire recently, just what you really want the state to do to help address this concern? What are you advocating for?","Jeff Martin","Okay. Well, I appreciate you making the comment that we haven't had a fire for a while, it's been since 2007, and I think if there has been anything that's allowed us to create kind of a competitive advantage to protect our rate payers it's experience we went through in 2007, and how hard we've worked to basically build a system. I think that provides a lot of leadership on behalf of our customers, but I talked about this a little bit Steve in my prepared remarks.","But here some additional color. I think that we've been in close contact, as you would expect with all the key stakeholders. In fact, we are hosting a lot of key stakeholders from across the state, including members of the Governor staff, here in our building tomorrow, to continue to advance what we think the appropriate actions are. And I would also complement the Governor, I think he's walked into a tough situation with strikes in the LA Unified School District and obviously a lot of the legacy issues in and around the fire areas. And he has pushed forward the Blue Ribbon panel. He's pushed forward to strike force, there's a lot of conversation from the Governor\u2019s Office about trying to deliver results from both of those organizations, earlier in the legislative process rather than later.","On the specifics of what needs to happen, I'm going to be very clear from Sempra's perspective, we do not think a strict liability standard is the appropriate standard for investor-owned utilities. But probably what's most important in our advocacy is to make sure that we always frame our discussions around what's best for ratepayers. I mean, that really is the fundamental issue in our service model and secondly that whatever the outcomes are, either from a regulatory path or a legislative path, there is a very clear and defined pathway for timely and adequate cost recovery for utilities that operates our system prudently.","We filed our wildfire mitigation plan earlier this year. It is really kind of a 4 point plan that really focuses, number one, on fire hardening. Number two on vegetation management. I think we have a world-class vegetation management program and our filing attempts to double the frequency, which we term our trees in our service territory. We're going to add to our aerial assets I think we've led the nation in terms of the type of helicopter support, we've had on station and if someone used to fly helicopters, the Utopian goal is to have a 24 hour capability and part of our filing gives us the ability to operate at night time, which will be another competitive advantage, as you try to fight buyers at one starts.","And then lastly, the fourth part of that plan is we are going to double down our weather stations. I think we unified over 60 different weather stations that we're trying to enhance, so that not only -- so we can really extend our fire science advantage in terms of how we predict whether. But bottom line is, I think there's a lot of different ways to come at this. I'm pleased with the leadership is being shown from the Governor\u2019s Office. And I think that the whole goal here is to create a more sustainable and a more fair framework for everyone that's involved in the system.","Steve Fleishman ","Okay. That's very helpful. One other question, just on the Mexico. The news from two weeks ago on what the government might want to do with the force majeure situation. Was there any better clarity just on that specific issue or is it still added more of a high-level right now?","Jeff Martin","Yes, let me make a couple of comments here. I'll pass it to Joe for some details around the actions relative to that pipeline. I think it might be helpful too for Dennis to talk about what the United States government is doing to support the key nature of Mexico as a partner, particularly around natural gas. But what I'll try to do Steve is remind people that we've been invested in Mexico for over 20 years. We're not a company that began invested in projects a year ago or two years ago.","We have the leading Mexican energy company in the country. We're ranked in the top 50 on the Bolsa, obviously as you know it's headquartered in Mexico, we've got independent Mexican directors and its self-funded from local markets. And one of the things that we're trying to do is we have a long-term view about the opportunity around infrastructure in that country, and we believe that the infrastructure opportunity remains quite large Steve, and as the government continues to focus on expanding services to all the people of Mexico, their reliance on foreign direct investment will go up, it will not go down. And I think our value proposition, every time we are in front of stakeholders in Mexico is to really emphasize our role in bringing new and cleaner sources of energy to the country to help support the economy and give choice and lower cost energy to Mexican families. But on the specific issue of the pipeline, Joe in kind of steps that Carlos and Tania are taking. Do you want to provide additional color?","Joe Householder","Thanks, Jeff. Hi, Steve. You mentioned a lot of the things that I wanted to mention that we are very focused on providing low cost energy into Mexico, and one of the things that you know Steve is really helpful is the feedstock of natural gas into the electricity market. And so obvious pipeline infrastructure is being built around that. The situation with the seven pipelines that they referred to the other day, was they were, as you mentioned in force majeure for various reasons. We are involved in two of those.","In the Sonora pipeline, as you recall, we had that pipeline in operation, it was already earning revenues. So it's a little bit unlike all the other six which our pipelines haven't gone into service. In this case, it wasn't service and then there were sabotage and it was damaged, and we had to take it out of service, and we've been working with CFE. The administration is very focused on making sure that it's getting good value for money than spending. So it's actually an opportune time and Carlos and Tania have been in meeting with CFE, so a little bit unlike some other things that have been out in the press. We have been a first mover here to go in and meet with various members of various parts of the administration, have meetings with CFE and Tania is now -- she is the CEO. She is in charge of meeting with CFE to move this along, I think it gives us a great opportunity actually to get this pipeline fixed. If they could work with us, if the government can work with us to work with the local people that were involved in this, I think within weeks we could have that pipeline fixed and bringing cheap low cost gas into Mexico and I think that will resolve that problem.","The other one that we're involved in is the marine pipeline that TransCanada and we are building, and that one's ready to go into service soon. We're just working on tying in. The thing is substantially done, but the offshore pipeline needs to get tied into the onshore pipeline and they are working on that now. There is some weather challenges, which means wave action that's keeping them from having the vessels tie up these things, but we're working on that should be done pretty soon. So that will also solve that second one.","Dennis Arriola ","Steve, this is Dennis. The other thing I'd add to Jeff and Steve's comments. First on the Sonora pipeline, I think it's important to remember that the auction process there was a competitive process that was run by CFE. The terms and conditions were dictated by CFE. And I think that was one of the things that our team in Mexico may refer to reiterate to the new CFE Director and to the President's administration that this was basically a very transparent and fair process.","The other thing that I had mentioned to you is what we're doing in order to collaborate and support our people in Mexico. We've obviously continued to maintain close contact with the State Department, the Department of Energy, the Embassy folks in Mexico City to remind them not only of Sempra's investment in IEnova, but the importance of what this means to the United States. Remember that Mexico is the largest natural gas trading partner for the United States, and we have a trade surplus from an energy standpoint with Mexico. So making sure that we maintain fair and transparent rules in Mexico for the investments that we have there which are badly needed in the future, not only is good for Mexico, but it serves the interest of the United States and I can tell you that folks in Washington DC are supported by watching this closely.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd ","I wondered if you could just talk a little bit more about your dialog with the rating agencies with respect to risk mitigation in California, as Steve actually mentioned, I mean you have a very strong operational track record, you're a clearly leader in fire risk mitigation. A lot more of your system is underground than other utilities. Is that being recognized, are there real tangible steps in progress that you need to make to avoid ratings downgrades? Could you just give a little more color on that dialog? Please.","Jeff Martin","I appreciate the question, Steve, and I think the answer -- in the short-form is, yes. I think, if you think about all the strategic initiatives we have a company of undertaken in the last two years, we have had very, very close contact with the rating agencies, because we've made it a priority to make sure we maintain an investment grade plus balance sheet and your point of differentiation is important and it does resonate with all three agencies. We have the best safety program. I mean, number one in the country and deserves a higher, not a lower credit rating. We make that point consistently. We have been aggressive about de-risking our service territory and de-risking our overall business model at Sempra and that's one of the reasons, you've seen the agencies move down their target FFO to debt metrics based upon our continued focus on T&D type of investments.","Second, I think there is momentum, Stephen, in the state to correct the market. I made this comment earlier in my remarks and to insure ratepayers are protected, and if there are cost to be absorbed that there's timely recovery for those folks. I guess SDG&E, they are prudently managing their system. So I think the agencies are in a tough spot, right. I think this is largely been a rerating of the state, more so than individual companies, but it's our job to be in front of them, making sure that they understand that there is true differentiation and separate apart from how the rules change or how the laws change, the number one thing to do is to be a leader around how you run your system, when you cut your system off, how predictive you're about whether that impacts your system, and our goal and I think you can see this in our wildfire mitigation plans to take the current leadership we have an extend it based on the investments we're making.","But I would say with respect SDG&E, independent of what actions the agencies taken, I think we're are going be quite aggressive in terms of defending our franchise. We have also taken steps to make sure we have ample liquidity at SDG&E.","Stephen Byrd ","Well, that's super helpful color. That actually that last part Jeff does touch on -- and a question we get often from investors just in the event that for any number of reasons the rating agencies do choose to downgrade, not just you but potentially other utilities in the state further. Obviously that's not good for customers in the sense of the cost of capital obviously goes up, cost of financing in the long run. But in the short run I guess the perspective is you do have quite a bit of liquidity, you are not facing fire liabilities, you haven't had a fire in 12 years. Could you maybe give a little more color just on sort of the short-term protections you have, liquidity et cetera you have just to sort of lay those near-term concerns?","Jeff Martin","Yes, I'll have Trevor go ahead and talk through where we're at with our credit lines with SoCalGas and SDG&E and our ability to flex those lines.","Trevor Mihalik ","Yes, Steve. So we have a fairly large credit line at both utilities that we can draw down, and those are largely undrawn at the current time. And then we also have the ability to continue to issue secured bonds if needed, albeit at higher rates. But again, I think, our view on this is, we're continuing to defend the fact that we are differentiated in California. We had the rating agencies out, to come take a look at our fire mitigation plans and they recognize that we are differentiated. But again, from our perspective, the credit lines are $750 million at each of the utilities.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","Good. Thank you very much. So I want to pick up where a couple of last questions are left off. First going back to the California policies, more broadly, I'd be curious if you could expand a little bit on the current state of legislative affairs and specifically comment a little bit around the funding or the prefunding potential here for the various IOUs. How do you guys think about that versus other solutions on the table. I know it's early days, we've got some draft legislation out there, but it seems to be going in a certain direction. I'm curious if you think that's really where it's going or if there's any other twist that we should be looking at more conceptually, not in terms of hard details here?","Jeff Martin","I'll make some comments Julien and then I'll pass it to Dennis to fill in a couple more details. But now I think at a high level what I'm impressed by is that SB-901 call for this Blue Ribbon panel to be seeded. I think they've got a diverse group of folks that have their head down are working away on that initiative, that report out to the legislature is required by July 1, is my expectation based upon feedback that we've received. That they should be able to finish that work earlier, which I think would be helpful from the legislative process.","The strike team that Governor's put together was intentionally designed, to bring in independent financial advisors, law firms, people that specialize really in issues around credit. So one of the things that we want to be very proactive is that people really understand the power of the fixed income markets and the importance of the credit ratings across this industry.","The bottom line is, we believe, and I think the Governor shares our view based on conversations I've had, that the utilities this state deserve and need to have an A rated balance sheet. And that is the goal of the process that we're undertaking. So, there's a lot more work to be done. We're going to have a seat at the table. I think we're going to have an aggressive outreach. I've been personally involved to make sure that Sempra has a seat at the table to improve the overall risk-reward profile of both SoCalGas and SDG&E.","So the process that the state is undergoing should be an opportunity for Sempra to have a seat at the table and by the end of the year have improved the franchise value of both of our utilities. I'll stop and see if Dennis wants to add any color.","Dennis Arriola ","No, I think, you hit on all the points, Jeff. The only thing I'd mention is, recall that the strike team that the governor is setup has various representatives whether it's chief or staff, people from the finance industry, the legal industry, folks from insurance. So I think it's multifaceted there are a lot of perspectives that are going to be presented in the roadmap and the recommendations to the Blue Ribbon commission, and then their job is going to be really to refine the plan to look at the recommendations of pros and cons of risks and how you can make sure that you can navigate through this process and make those recommendations to the governor and to the legislature by the end of June.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","Got it. Excellent. Then just quickly following up on some of the questions on '19 guidance specifically. First off, I know you guys talked about the $50 million pre-tax cost savings effort. Didn't see that specifically called out here. So just wanted to make sure, just from a timing perspective, how you see that ramping up, as you say over the next few years, but more specifically here? And then also with respect to the California GRC here, you mentioned the assumptions on attrition, certainly there is some early data points, shall we say, how does that figure into the plus-minus math that you show here on the right hand side of slide 12?","Jeff Martin","Let me take a stab at that and if we see it needs more detail, I'll have Trevor jump on it. But I think we've circled to $50 million opportunity, around our corporate center. And we know exactly where those dollars are coming from. We expect to have full run rate of that $50 million, Julien, by the end of the year. This isn't a one-time event. I think you've heard us talk about this before good companies are always pursuing these type of cost savings, and that's why going back to some of Trevor's prepared remarks, we ran a program like this that our operating companies that in general, just over $65 million of savings at SDG&E and SoCalGas, and those dollars are currently in the rate case and this $50 million is incremental to that.","But from time-to-time, we'll take questions on our former ones and so forth, and I was looking at some data recently where, as an example, Julien since 2013 just over five years ago SDG&E electric O&M per customer has decreased by 40%. So we've been able to reduce cost on per customer basis by 12% CAGR for five straight years, and that includes drop in 500 positions in terms of headcount. So we probably in terms of the total O&M and SDG&E, there's probably about 20% that can be directly impacted outside of other required spending. They've done a remarkable job today and that's the type of cost efficiency that was put into our rate case.","The second thing I'll say is, what we've tried to do at the parent company is, as we sell our solar business and our wind business and our natural gas storage business, a lot of these cost savings are costs we can realign more efficiently, increasing span of control of officers and leaders, so that we can have a lower cost platform at the parent company, as we sell and become more focused in our strategy.","And then as to your issues around the 2019 guidance, always remind you that we basically took a $100 million out of earnings, right. So, at the Analyst Conference we forecasted 2019 without any -- without taking out solar and renewables out of that forecast, so, in July of last year we -- we forecasted $5.70 to $6.30 of EPS. And today, that's our exact same guidance after taking $100 billion of earnings out of it, for our renewable portfolio and the way you do that is to use the proceeds to pay down parent debt. You reinvest in capital programs. You go to the investment in Texas within InfraREIT and you continue to find cost savings. And I will tell you I expect a $50 million number to go up by the end of the year because we're going to keep going in terms of making our parent company more efficient.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","And GRC assumptions, nothing to say -- right, nothing to add right now?","Jeff Martin","Yes. I just say on the GRC assumptions, our convention over the last decade has been to always forecast the existing attrition of 3.5%. We've done that at both of our utilities and I think the filings that you can see from ORA and others, you can kind of draw your own conclusions in many cases, they are actually higher than that. But we're not going to guide or change that until we get to this rate case. We are focused on making sure we have a good cost of capital filing by April 1st, and we're pushing very aggressively to make sure that we can improve the timings of our rate case decision.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Shah Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners.","Constantine Lednev ","Hey. It's actually Constantine here for Shahriar. A lot of great questions were answered. And congrats on a strong quarter and a great year. One, kind of short little follow-up on the cost of capital filing. So, any thoughts around, kind of how you're thinking about it, at this point. There has been some kind of early remarks with kind of the FERC ROE is done and all that, but in light of kind of some of the more recent events, kind of, what are your thoughts around cost of capital in California?","Jeff Martin","I'll give you some thoughts and pass it to Trevor. But I would just say this, as you know, at a high level, the cost of capital is always intended to be a proxy of the risk associated with our environment right in our regulatory environment. So, there is no question, given the recent developments, particularly the northern part of the state that you should expect to see PG&E and Edison and SDG&E and SoCalGas revisit how that happens. Right. So you're right, there are some numbers out there for the first standpoint, but we're going to make sure that we're very thoughtful of bringing some independent resources and we're going to put forward something that we think is better reflective of the risk in the marketplace. And if some of that risk is resolved that likewise would impact how we would file this. But Trevor, would you add any color.","Trevor Mihalik ","No, I think, Jeff, you really covered it there again. As Jeff said it's supposed to be a proxy on risk and I think we feel pretty good about where we landed on FERC, but we certainly anticipate that cost capital filing should reflect the risk that we're seeing in the state.","Jeff Martin","And I would add that Bruce Folkmann is our CFO at both of our utilities. He is a very talented person and he really led the last cost of capital discussion, I think on behalf of all three utilities. He has a team in place with outside consultants and they'll be putting together a very thoughtful plan about how they approach this. And I think that you're raising a great point. And this is something that we're very focused on. We're going to try to basically improve the regulatory model this year. We're going to get a great rate case and we are going to get a cost of capital that's appropriately sized for the type of risk that we expect to manage in the state.","Constantine Lednev ","Perfect. Thanks. And one kind of just detailed question, housekeeping on the cost savings program that's being implemented. And you've kind of called out the $50 million in the run rate in the next few -- in the following few years. Is there any detail of how to think about the overall kind of costs at the parent and kind of where that $50 million is coming from and where kind of any incremental opportunities lie?","Jeff Martin","Yes. I would just say that the best way to think about this is probably the most common misunderstanding Constantine. We have an ongoing cost management program every year in the history of the company. So SDG&E will have stretch goals, and one of the ways they reach their stretch goals like you saw the great performance last year and Trevor talked about it is, continuing to have best practices around technology and innovation and cost efficiency. So every single operating company at Sempra is very, very focused on leveraging technology and innovation to lower their per unit cost for customers. What was unique about what the exercise we went through under Martha Wyrsch and Dennis' leadership in the last six months was, we really revisited opportunities at the parent company, because as you sell and dispose some assets and turn your portfolio over, it gave us the opportunity to challenge, what is the proper role of External Affairs and Investor Relations and Financial Reporting. And you have people at corporate that were directly servicing the solar business or the wind business or natural gas storage.","So most of the cost opportunity has been around looking at costs associated with the businesses that we're selling and now as you know, last month we took the decision to sell our South American utilities. That represents another opportunity for us to become more cost efficient at the parent. So the long-term goal is you got to remember, we're going to grow this business at a rate faster than our peers. And as we grow this business, one of the things we're going to try to do is keep the cost at parent, the ones that we control. I'm not talking about interest expense and preferred dividends and so forth.I'm talking about the things that we can normally control. Our job is to keep it flat to declining at the same time that we're scaling the corporate center against a growing set of operating companies.","Constantine Lednev ","Okay. So it's fair to kind of assume that as these transactions close, and as you go through the transformation process, and the savings programs are going to continue further into more than just the 2019 here?","Jeff Martin","That's well said, and part of that is because, we will have ongoing service obligations for short periods of time on the assets that we sold, and part of what you're looking at is those service obligations rolling off throughout the year.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides ","Good morning, Jeff. Two questions, kind of unrelated to each other. First of all the California cost of capital docket. Given what's happened to your neighbor to the North and just how the California utilities have traded? It seems a little bit unusual to meet even half (ph) the stock, I mean how do you calculate the cost to equity for one of the three companies in the state? Just curious if there's potential to kind of push this out to come back and revisit this at -- in another year, at another time or whether the commissioners and the state as a whole is kind of driving to make sure this happens in 2019?","Jeff Martin","Well, it's actually a very insightful question. If you think back to the California utilities track record around cost of capital, you have seen the cost of capital extended for one or two or three years at a time, and you've seen the utilities get engaged from time to time when you see large changes in the marketplace. What intrigues me a little bit Michael is that, there has been a strong voice coming from the credit rating agencies about rerating the state. Right? There's obviously been a very unfortunate bankruptcy in the casualties to the north, obviously this has implications to Edison as it does to SoCalGas and SDG&E.","And part of the process, I think is going on, as you have a change in the governor, you got to change in a lot of the members of his administration, even some of the energy principles or change in off of Governor Brown staff. So basically have a new guard in Sacramento, to have some strong voices coming from the credit markets and have the chance to come back in on a timely basis and really lay down some numbers that really point to the cost of not properly managing risk. These costs inadvertently get passed on to ratepayers. So there is really a hue and cry to fix the market, and I actually think this cost of capital process may be additive to that voice and constructive in long-term toward getting the action.","Michael Lapides ","Got it. And then unrelated question. Just curious, there have been a number of LNG projects in the US and in North America, including Canada. If their environmental impact statements are FERC certificates and just curious how the LNG contracting environment has changed over the last 6 to 12 months and how the economics for new LNG for projects like Port Arthur even ones like Costa Azul or the Cameron expansion look now relative to how they may have looked a year or two years ago?","Jeff Martin","Great question. I think you recall that we were similar to our new management team last summer. We took the time Michael to do a bottoms-up view of what we thought was taken place in the global marketplace, and that we had a better feel for that. We looked at our own team, our own capabilities and you saw us raise our expectations for what we could accomplish Michael, as well as make some change in terms of how we were leading that organization.","I would tell you today that I'm probably more bullish than I was three or four months ago. I mean I think Joe and I are on the road starting this weekend, going overseas to meet with potential offtakers. But to your point, you recall that Cameron was originally constructed really as a tolling agreement, no different you think about as a power plant. Right? You're short gas on one side of the plant and your long LNG on the other, and we structured that really as a tolling situation where Sempra was not really involved in the downstream risk the upstream risk related to that facility.","One of the things is taking place in the marketplace is the number and type of counter parties has expanded to folks like the oil and gas company in Poland, is they now expect somewhat at the terminal to go upstream and source the gas, and frankly as long as we can do that some form of index, where we're not taking the commodity risk. We're certainly a business is quite comfortable with transportation. So you've seen the model change a little bit where you're moving probably from a pure Toll model toward being able to provide the service of bringing the gas to one side, whereas they take all responsibility for the gas on other. And look, a competitive market always puts pressure on the cost side of it, but one of the things I think that I would mention to you is, we have a competitive advantage, and our competitive advantage is, that two of our three sites are brownfield sites, number one. And number two, the fact that we have one on the West Coast of North America is a huge advantage. And you should be expecting us to push that aggressively in all of our marketing meetings, but I'll just stop there, Joe and see if you will add anything to the contract environment.","Joe Householder","The only thing I would say in addition, one thing I want to start with is we're going to spend a bunch of time on this at our analyst conference, which is coming up in a few weeks. So I won't go into too much detail but, we are very focused. The world has changed a little bit and you're right, we are starting to see a lot of action at FERC and our project at Port Arthur is moving through that queue, it's very close in the queue now. So it's moving right ahead.","And so the contracting is indeed important and we have seen a change. There was a law for a while, now we're starting to see that really come together. As Jeff said, we got airline tickets we're -- we're heading out, and so that shows a good sign. We will talk more about this at the conference, but we are absolutely right. We're starting to see quite a change and we're going to see more and more projects go to FID.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson ","Just want to touch base with you on the wildfire, the prudency standard that you guys are looking for at the CPUC. And I was wondering in-light of sort of the recent activity, obviously the bankruptcy at PG&E and stuff. Are you sensing more traction with respect to having the prudency standard of -- you know to be substantially -- substantial compliance with the wildfire plan or how are you looking at that, it sounds like you and Edison sort of have been proposing that in this OIR?","Jeff Martin","What I would say, Paul, is that one of the things that makes the overall conversation quite complex is that there is a basket of legacy fires, some of which were in '17 prelegislation and some of which were in '18 during a gap, because the legislation was effective until the first of the year. From a big picture standpoint I think Sempra has been very much in the position that PG&E has been in for a long period of time, which we don't think is a strict liability standards, the appropriate standard for investor-owned utilities. Right? It was intended for a different set of circumstances.","I think it's very unfortunate, that we moved decisions we got at the PUC. I think that really has been the catalyst for the possibility of there being uncovered or stranded cost actually borne by shareholders. And that's led to the situation we're in now. So, I think the challenge you have Paul is that the legislators put a lot of time in SB 901 last year, and they thought that they had put the appropriate band-aid on the issue, and like what we're really asking for is, I think the whole process as we looked at de novo with a fresh view. I'm really encouraged. I think the strike force specifically and the Blue Ribbon panel is not just taking the fact as they are today, Paul.","I'm really looking at this thing holistically, around all the things that Dennis talked about, the insurance industry, what does this mean to tort claims. What does this mean to the legal industry and the impacts of the utility. So, I don't want to make this sound like this is a small change to legislation. We have a goal of making sure that we have the chance to operate our system prudently. Make prudent capital investments, and as fires occur from time to time, were substantially in compliance with the program as they approved by the commission, there should be automatic pass-through of costs. It's not a discretionary standard.","Paul Patterson ","Yes. I think that sounds great. It would seem to me that regardless of what happens with strict liability or what have you, if that standard is adopted, I mean, obviously there's a lot more that you want to accomplish for a lot of reasons, repair costs to be -- not the least of which but, that would be, I mean this one issue, if you could get that resolved. It would seem to me that would go a long way. Do you follow what I'm saying and that might be one way of sort of -- I mean, I know it's not silver bullet, but it would be something that would seem to go a long way in solving a lot of this without necessarily relying on the holistic thing to be completely sewn-up. Do you follow what I'm saying?","Jeff Martin","I do Paul and I think first off, I think you're spot on. But the only caveat I'd offer to you is, where you start your focus has a direct impact of what you end up resolving. And I think that we need to be very clear that's a strict liability standard is the wrong standard. At the end of the day you may have the practical solution, it may be less relevant is where that standard goes away, or whether that standard is interpreted by rule making that allows for the automatic pass-through for people that operate your system prudently.","So I think you're on to something. What I am encouraged by is, the leadership the Governor is showing the way that he has staffed in saying and asked them to move more quickly and he's asked for them to look at it holistically, with a fresh view de novo. Right. So again I can't forecast the future, except to say that I think a lot of the right activities are under way and we are optimistic.","Paul Patterson ","Okay. And then just finally the McDermott call, the discussion of Chiyoda came up, and I'm just wondering, we couldn't really obviously and I'm not asking you to comment on the Chiyoda situation, but they themselves as you know, said -- raised ongoing -- as a ongoing concern question, could you just remind us what kind of contingencies we have, if in fact Chiyoda isn't able to meet its obligations?","Jeff Martin","I will start and I'll see if Joe wants to add some color, but I think in our remarks, what you've heard is, that the partnership has been very engaged with the EPC contractors, and particularly McDermott has been very clear about what their expectations are for delivering the project. And obviously those two parties are jointly and separately liable","for their obligations under that contract, and it's a full EPC wrap contract, right. So those obligations reside with the EPC. But I got to tell you we have had great conversations with David Dixon. I think he has looked at this with clear eyes. He understands the challenges, and we have confidence and the ability to deliver it. But, Joe if you want to comment further on some of the details around those two parties.","Joe Householder","Thanks, Jeff. I think you really hit the main points. Great EPC contract, joint and separate liability, also, as we said a few times in the past, we do have letters of credit backstopping this, in typical amounts that you would see in a contract of this nature. And so those are the kinds of things. We always have to plan for any risk and so we have a lot of work around all of this with our partners, but we feel really confident, David's, very confident that is going to focus and get this project done. And I believe he is focused on it.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take our last question from Winfried Fruehauf of Winfried Fruehauf Consulting.","Winfried Fruehauf ","I have a question about PG&E, and is a two part question. One is, what lessons has Sempra learned from the bankruptcy filing, or yes, that's the first question. The second question is, are there any opportunities for asset purchases from PG&E by Sempra?","Jeff Martin","Well, thank you for that question. I'll start with the second part of the question first and I'll circle back the lessons learned. I think you recall you followed us for a long time, Winfried that, we don't typically comment on any type of M&A activity. As we've had discussions on our management team, our slate of organic spending in our core businesses here in North America over the next two years, is quite significant.","One of the things you should expect for our management team is to have our head down and make sure we execute well our financial plans for 2019 and 2020. On the larger issue of lessons learned, it's quite interesting, we learned a lot Winfried from our 2007 wildfire, we viewed it like an existential threat 10 years ago, and it really has informed our view that we have to get better and we have to provide leadership, we have to be innovative and everything we do is open source. I mean, all the progress we've made, we're more than willing to share with others.","But I will give you one discrete thing from the bankruptcy that we find interesting is, you'll see a lot of numbers out there about the potential costs that are contingent liabilities related to the renewable contracting. And you'll hear -- numbers above $30 billion being forecasted in large portions of that be an out of market cost. It goes back to over the last four or five years, the deep strategic process that our Board has led, we made the decision, number one, that we wanted to exit fossil fired generation. We've made the decision to exit renewable generation. We do not get involved in lifting natural gas or oil or field processing.","So we've moved further and further away from generation and commodity and procurement, and as early as 2014 myself and Steve and Davis at SDG&E decided to stop all of our renewable purchases at SDG&E because we're well ahead of the game at that time. So I think the lesson that points to here is, it's very important to make sure we're doing all the right things to advance the clean energy transition, but it's also important that we're doing that in a way which is thoughtful around price, diversity of supply in a balanced energy program.","And I think that what you see at PG&E continues to confirm Sempra's business model, number one of focus in on T&D and the prudency I think that we've shown around a balanced energy approach to the commodity side of the business.","Winfried Fruehauf ","That's very helpful. Thanks very much, Jeffrey.","Jeff Martin","I appreciate it Winfried. We hope we see you at the Analyst Conference.","Winfried Fruehauf ","I'm not so sure because I'm physically still not in a position to do much traveling.","Jeff Martin","Okay. We wish you the best and look forward to staying in touch with you.","Operator","Thank you. As there are no further questions, we'll hand the call back to Jeff Martin for closing remarks.","Jeff Martin ","Look, I just like to thank everyone for joining us today. I'll conclude by saying that I'm very pleased with our team, and I think we're excited about the progress we've made on our strategy. And we look forward to seeing all of you at our upcoming Analyst Conference here in San Diego later in March. If you have any follow-up questions, always feel free to contact the IR team. And have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead, sir.","Richard A. Vaccari","Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, we'll be discussing Sempra Energy's third quarter 2013 financial results. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section. With us today in San Diego are several members of our management team: Debbie Reed, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Snell, President; Joe Householder, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Martha Wyrsch, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and Trevor Mihalik, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer.","Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's 10-K and most recent 10-Q. It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and that we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our third quarter 2013 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures.","I'd also like to note that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, November 5, 2013, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. With that, please turn to Slide 3, and let me hand the call over to Debbie.","Debra L. Reed","Thanks, Rick, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Let me begin with our 2013 earnings guidance. We currently expect full year earnings to fall within our guidance range of $4.30 to $4.60 per share. Last week, however, Mexican tax reform moved forward in Congress and we expect it to be enacted this year. The deferred tax impact of this reform would negatively affect fourth quarter 2013 earnings by about $0.05 per share. Prior to the reform, we expected earnings for the year to be near the midpoint of our guidance range. Joe will discuss this issue in more detail a little later on the call.","Moving to the quarter. I'm pleased with our performance, and most notably, progress continued on our many infrastructure projects. These projects, which I will update you on shortly, should drive our long-term growth outlook of 6% to 8%. Based on the projects we have underway, I am confident that our company is well positioned for the strong growth profile we outlined in our analyst presentation.","Before moving on to our financial results, I want to make note of some key management changes that we announced during the quarter. In early September, Martha Wyrsch joined Sempra as Executive Vice President and General Counsel. Many of you know Martha from her time at Duke Energy, Spectra Energy and Vestas. In addition to prior experience as General Counsel, she brings a wealth of industry knowledge and experience to our management team. As you know, we take great pride in the strength of our team and depth of our leadership bench. We also moved people within our organization as part of our plans to develop future leaders. In September, we announced several changes to the management teams at our business units that will take effect next year. Most of these individuals, you already know. At SDG&E, Jeff Martin will become CEO and Steve Davis will take over as President and Chief Operating Officer. Jeff will replace Jessie Knight, who will come back to Sempra as our Executive Vice President of External Affairs. Steve will take over for Mike Niggli, who is retiring after a 42-year career in the energy industry. At SoCalGas, Dennis Arriola will become CEO, replacing Ann Smith, who will retire after more than 3 decades with the company. Bret Lane will replace Dennis as Chief Operating Officer at SoCalGas. And finally, Patti Wagner will replace Jeff as President and CEO of Sempra U.S. Gas & Power. This team brings the strong leadership, financial, operating and technical skills necessary to deliver on our long-term growth plans.","Now let me hand things to Joe to discuss the financial results in more detail starting with Slide 4. Joe?","Joseph A. Householder","Thank you, Debbie. Earlier this morning, we reported third quarter earnings of $296 million or $1.19 per share. This compares to earnings of $268 million or $1.09 per share in the same quarter last year, which included a $60 million impairment charge on our investment in the Rockies Express Pipeline. On an adjusted basis, earnings for the third quarter of 2012, after excluding the impairment charge, were $328 million. You can see from the statement of operations that tax expense was very low last year. The third quarter of 2012 included a $33 million tax benefit at SDG&E related to the prior period effect of adopting a new method for deducting repairs. Excluding this from 2012 would essentially result in relatively flat adjusted earnings between the third quarters of 2012 and 2013. It is also important to note that in 2013, we overcame the effect of the dilution from the IEnova IPO, as well as the $63 million tax impact recorded in the first quarter of this year related to our cash repatriation plan. Excluding the impact of these 2 items and the low tax expense in 2012 that I just mentioned, our core business has performed very well year-to-date.","Now let's go through the segment results in more detail, beginning with SDG&E on Slide 5. At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the third quarter of 2013 were $129 million. SDG&E's earnings were lower due to a $46 million increase in income tax expense compared to 2012. This was primarily driven by the impact of the tax treatment change I just mentioned and was also impacted by $7 million of higher tax expense from unfavorable adjustments for prior years' tax issues and the remainder from a higher effective tax rate in 2013 as compared to 2012. This quarter, SDG&E earned $15 million from higher CPUC-based operating margin and electric transmission margin net of expenses. These earnings were essentially offset by a $6 million effect of a lower rate of return from our cost-of-capital decision, $5 million of lower earnings due to the loss of SONGS-based margin as a result of the plant closure, and $3 million related to the redemption of SDG&E's preferred stock.","Now please turn to Slide 6. Third quarter 2013 earnings at Southern California Gas were $102 million compared to earnings of $71 million last year. This quarter's increase is primarily the result of $12 million of higher CPUC-based operating margin as a result of the final GRC decision net of expenses, and $10 million benefit from lower income tax rate, mainly due to a change in repair expenditure deductions for natural gas pipelines that began in the fourth quarter of last year.","Now let's move to Sempra International on Slide 7. At our South American Utilities, earnings were $39 million in the third quarter of 2013 compared to earnings of $40 million in the same period of 2012. Excluding the impact of the loss on the sale of our Argentine investment, our business in South America is in line with expectations through the first 9 months of the year. Third quarter 2013 earnings for the Sempra Mexico segment were $39 million versus earnings of $42 million in the third quarter of last year. The decrease is due to $9 million from noncontrolling interest at IEnova related to our reduced ownership, partially offset by a $7 million benefit primarily due to negative foreign currency effects, which largely relate to the third quarter of 2012.","Please turn to Slide 8. Moving to Sempra U.S. Gas & Power, the Natural Gas segment lost $7 million in the third quarter of 2013 compared to a loss of $8 million in the year ago period after excluding last year's $60 million impairment charge on REX. The third quarter is typically a challenging one for the Natural Gas business due to the seasonal nature of gas storage, and this quarter's performance is in line with our expectations. Longer term, lower natural gas and power prices continue to affect this segment. But as you know, we have clear actions underway to improve our performance. These include selling and\/or contracting the remainder of our generation plant in Arizona and developing the Cameron LNG export terminal and related facilities.","The Renewables segment recorded earnings of $37 million in the third quarter of 2013, up from earnings of $13 million in the third quarter of 2012. The increase is largely driven by $24 million in gains from the contribution of our assets to the newly formed 50-50 solar joint ventures with Con Ed.","Please turn to Slide 9. Turning to our guidance for 2013. As Debbie mentioned at the outset, we still expect earnings for the full year to fall within our range. Based on events last week though, it now appears that changes to the Mexican tax law are likely to occur this year. The proposed legislation would keep future Mexican corporate tax rates at 30% as opposed to having them drop back to 28% as is the current law. This legislation would negatively impact Sempra's fourth quarter earnings by about $0.05 per share as a result of adjusting the deferred tax balance to the higher rate. The ongoing impact of this legislation should not be significant to earnings. Additionally, we are working to finalize the formation of a joint venture at our Energ\u00eda Sierra Ju\u00e1rez project at IEnova. We plan to partner with BP Wind on ESJ, but their decision to exit the wind development business has caused us to find another partner, somewhat prolonging the process. Our guidance includes earnings of about $0.05 per share related to the formation, which reflects an expected gain on the contribution of the assets to the JV, and some recovery of development costs we have already incurred. We are currently in advanced discussions with potential investors but completion of the deal as planned may not occur this year, which would defer those earnings. I'd like to reiterate the fundamentals of our business remain very strong and we continue to be very optimistic about our future growth prospects. We will talk further about those prospects when we update our 2014 guidance on our next quarterly call. Now let me hand the call back to Debbie.","Debra L. Reed","Thanks, Joe. Turning to our utilities in California. The SONGS dispute resolution process between Southern California Edison and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has ended and will now move to binding arbitration. Edison is taking to hold MHI liable for damages, which are estimated to be in excess of $4 billion due to the defective steam generators that were installed at the plant. SDG&E has also filed a lawsuit against MHI to protect its legal rights in the matter. The CPUC regulatory proceedings on SONGS continue and we expect to see a proposed decision on the first phase, which deals with defining the cost related to the outage by the end of this year. Subsequent phases of the investigation will likely be resolved over the next few years. Parties have been encouraged by the commission to engage in settlement discussion to find a mutually agreeable and comprehensive solution.","Moving on to rate reform. Last month, Governor Brown signed Assembly Bill 327 into law. This important piece of legislation will go into effect on January 1, 2014, and gives the CPUC the flexibility to implement fair and reasonable reforms of the State's residential electric rates and net energy metering program. Additionally, the law grants to CPUC the authority to implement a monthly fixed charge of up to $10 per residential customer as of January 1, 2015. It also allows the CPUC to establish default time-of-use residential rate on or after January 1, 2018. Returning authority to the CPUC to address long-term rate structure issues in California is a very positive step to overall rate reform. The CPUC is expected to issue a ruling on next step as part of its residential rate reform OIR but will likely address AB-327 implementation through various proceedings, many of which are currently underway.","With respect to SDG&E's rate case, an administrative law judge was assigned and hearings have been set for May 2014, with any rate adjustment retroactive to September 1 of this year. Even though we are on a hearing track, FERC encourages informal settlement discussions, and those discussions are currently taking place. Based on recent decision, and the fact that SDG&E does not currently have any incentive adders in relation to existing projects, the outcome of this proceeding may result in an ROE closer to 10%, which is slightly lower than our range of anticipated outcome.","This quarter, we received commission approval to construct SDG&E's new South Bay substation. The project should cost between $145 million and $175 million, and should be in service in 2017. Last week, we received a proposed decision approving our $200 million Aliso Canyon Compressor station at SoCalGas and expect that project to come online in late 2016. Both of these projects are part of our base growth plan, are important infrastructure upgrades for our utility. We are still awaiting a proposed decision on our pipeline safety enhancement plan, or PSEP, and expect that decision to come out this quarter. As you know, we have received authorization to track cost in a memo account and are currently sending capital and O&M in anticipation of a final decision.","Please turn to Slide 11. Moving to our Cameron Liquefaction project, we received EPC bids last quarter from 2 groups, and we expect to select our final contractor by the end of this year or early 2014. Based on the significant front-end engineering work we did and our initial review of these bids, we remain very comfortable that we will find a lump sum turnkey contract, and that total project cost for the liquefaction facility will remain in the estimated range of $9 billion to $10 billion. We are also progressing in our efforts to secure financing for the project and expect to receive credit approved proposals from lenders by year end. There has been strong interest from both Japanese export credit agencies and commercial banks to participate in this financing, and we believe that will allow us to close long-tenor borrowing at very attractive rate. On the permitting front, we are currently second in the queue to receive our non-FTA permit from DOE and we expect to receive that permit by year end. The trend for non-FTA permits continues to point in a positive direction, and we are pleased to see that prior to the government shut down, DOE had quickened its pace between permit approvals. The project remains on track to receive all other necessary regulatory approval, sign an EPC contract, finalize financing commitments and start construction by the first half of next year. This will allow us to begin operations from the first train in the second half of 2017 with subsequent trains expected to come online 6 months after each prior one.","Let's now go on to Slide 12. In September, we acquired the rights to develop the Broken Bow 2 Wind Project in Nebraska. The project has a total capacity of 75 megawatts and has a power purchase agreement with the Nebraska Public Power District. We expect the project to come online late next year. Consistent with our strategy for our renewables portfolio, we anticipate project financing the facility and should have a 50% partner before operations commence. Further exemplifying this strategy, last quarter, we completed the formation of 50-50 joint ventures for Mesquite Solar 1 and Copper Mountain Solar 2. We received cash proceeds of $174 million for the 2 transactions, and as Joe mentioned, recorded a total after-tax gain of $24 million this quarter. We have also launched the partnership process for our 250-megawatt Copper Mountain Solar 3 project. That project will be fully operational in 2015 and has a 20-year agreement to sell the power to LADWP in the City of Burbank.","Let's now go on to Slide 13. Last quarter, the President of Mexico presented to Congress a proposal to reform the energy sector that will allow for a liberalization of the Mexican energy market. The president appears to have broad support for the proposed reform and his administration has indicated they would like to see a bill passed by the end of this year. Even without energy reform, IEnova has very strong growth prospects, and additional opportunities presented by reform should be incremental to projects we currently have in development. Last month, PEMEX announced that it intends to work with our joint venture to develop the 275-mile north segment of the Los Ramones II pipeline, an important project for Mexico that will ensure reliable supply of natural gas to growing industrial centers. We are working with PEMEX to define the terms of the project in the coming weeks. But we expect IEnova's participation in the $1 billion project will be at least 25%. PEMEX will execute a long-term take-or-pay contract for all of the pipeline capacity and the project will earn a rate of return approved by the Mexican regulator.","I'm also pleased to report that we have begun construction on the first phase of the Sonora pipeline project and this phase is on track to go into service in the second half of next year. We also started construction on the ESJ wind project last month, and that project should start delivering energy in 2015 to SDG&E under a 20-year agreement. Two significant projects in our JV with PEMEX, the ethane pipeline and the Los Ramones I pipeline, are also expected to go into service in the latter half of next year. Construction on the ethane pipeline began last quarter and construction on Los Ramones I should begin late this year. Lastly, the joint venture LPG terminal in Guadalajara is scheduled to begin operations this month.","In summary, we had another very solid quarter, and I am pleased that our focused strategy continues to deliver results. We are making progress as planned on our major infrastructure projects and have approximately $2.5 billion of projects scheduled to come online next year. Additionally, Sempra's future prospects are very strong with significant incremental growth opportunities across the company. And I remain positive that the company is well positioned to continue to deliver exceptional performance. And with that, let me stop and take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Faisel Khan with Citi.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I was wondering if you guys could talk a little bit about the potential investments you may be looking at in California to relieve some of the congestion and retirement issues with SONGS coming out of service and how large some of these investments could be. And I just have a follow-up on the LNG side.","Debra L. Reed","Sure, I'd be happy to tell you what we're looking at right now. In terms of quantification, we're still working on that, but I can kind of go through what the needs are, Faisel. In looking at SONGS replacement, I would say that there are 2 areas of focus. One is on the electric side, but the other is on the natural gas side. And both of those will require reinforcement. On the electric side, we will be improving the electric transmission system to provide voltage support, and SDG&E will be doing the construction of that. That's already been allocated by the ISO to -- for SDG&E to give an estimate for doing that. We will also be looking at new electric transmission. And that electric transmission for the state is something that the ISO is working on now and is likely to be competitively bid. And so ourselves and others would have the opportunity to bid on that. And that is expected to be several billion dollars\u2019 worth of work. And then on the natural gas infrastructure side, we've been working with the ISO, because with the gas needs from both the SONGS retirement and once through cooling that goes into place that there is going to be some need to reinforce the gas system to provide for more gas fire generation and basin. And so both SoCalGas and then SDG&E are also looking at that. And we would anticipate laying out a plan with the ISO to the CPUC within the next year on the gas system enhancement.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then just on the LNG project cost. The $2 billion of financing cost, can you just give us an idea what the underlying cost of capital is in that $2 billion number? It seems a little bit high, but I'm just trying to figure out how to calculate it.","Debra L. Reed","Yes. You're taking the $6 billion to $7 billion and you're subtracting that from the $9 billion to $10 billion, is that where you're coming up with the $2 billion?","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes. I mean, I think you guys talked about it in your Slide 2, $2 billion of financing cost.","Debra L. Reed","Yes, let me have Joe kind of go through where we -- first of all, where we are on financing and then how that kind of plays out. And some of it is reserves that we have to do.","Joseph A. Householder","Faisel, it's Joe. Yes, what Debbie said is correct, that we have required reserves and costs around the financing program. But as she mentioned, it's going very well. We have a term sheet and Kate Collier, the Treasurer, and others on the team. And our partners have been going around to visit with the large financial institutions in Japan and New York, and are in -- trying to get the rating agencies to rate the project, which should have a very strong credit rating. But this money all really relates to sort of capitalized interest and the required reserves that the financing is going to require so that they can make their debt service payments.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So the required reserves, is that -- you say it's half that $2 billion?","Joseph A. Householder","I don't think we've said how much exactly it is.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Naaz Khumawala with Wolfe Research.","Naaz Khumawala - Wolfe Research, LLC","Just a couple questions. One is on the FERC ROE, when you guys said it's around 10%. That's so -- I think, Debbie, you mentioned that there's no -- you currently have no incentives on there. Are you going to ask for incentives or should I just assume it's 10% on the FERC rate base?","Debra L. Reed","Yes, I mean, what we're looking at is for new projects that we would have the ability to ask for incentives for new projects that we would do, and we would look at requesting incentives for new projects. For the existing projects, when we put the formulaic rate in place that we've had for a number of years, the condition was that we would not ask for incentives for any of the projects that were under that formulaic rate, so that's how I think you might want to look at. And how FERC deals with incentive requests for new projects, we can't forecast how that will come out.","Naaz Khumawala - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay, so it's going to go from the 10.3% to the 10% based on, I guess, what you are seeing right now?","Debra L. Reed","We're at -- our current is 11.3%.","Naaz Khumawala - Wolfe Research, LLC","Sorry, I thought it was 10.3% plus 100, but I guess I'm mistaken.","Debra L. Reed","Yes, we're currently at 11.3%.","Naaz Khumawala - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay, 11.3% to 10%. Great. And then on like the Broken Bow project and Los Ramones II, when you guys at the Analyst Day gave your 6% to 8% growth rate, when you talked about potential other projects that would be in addition to the growth rate, are these types of -- the wind and the new pipe, is that in addition to or is that inclusive in the 6% to 8%?","Debra L. Reed","Let me kind of go through what are some of the projects that are -- were not identified in the 6% to 8%. And as we said at the analyst conference, that there were some -- based on the projects in the 6% to 8%, they may be sized differently than they were. They may have some time changes and all. So it's not as clear as this is a 6% to 8%, and then here's the 9% to 11%. But I would say we've made significant progress on new projects since we saw you at the Analyst Day. And let me just go through some of the things that we're looking at now. Los Ramones II, I talked about that. We're looking at a minimum of 25% of that project. So $250 million, $300 million of investment there as the -- on the low side. We have 2 Chilean transmission projects that we have agreements on that came after the Analyst Day and that we will own 50% of those projects, and the total is $80 million. So we'll have 50% of that. And those are scheduled for completion in the 2017, 2018 timeframe. We also have the Broken Bow project that we talked about. We have some SONGS replacement needs that Faisel just asked about in the last question, and we're going through the process of trying to quantify some of those right now. And then there are some other projects obviously we're working on that we will announce when we can confirm that we've received those projects. And then finally, the PUC came out with a ruling on battery storage, and that was incremental to any of the plans. But I believe that all of that is likely to be in the later years of the plan based upon what we're looking at right now. And these projects will either -- PSEP, as an example, that could vary from what we had in our plan that we filed 2 years ago because we've identified some additional records that would reduce the mileage on that. But at the same time, the timeframe to get the work done and the cost estimates for doing that have likely gone up. So we're likely to have to file an update on that. And so these projects will either add to or supplement some of the 6% to 8% growth. What I would say bottom line is with everything we have going, I have great confidence that we can achieve that 6% to 8% growth and possibly more.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Matt Tucker with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Matthew P. Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","You pointed out that the pace of approvals by the DOE, the non-FTA approvals, have been improving. I think it was down to about a month between the last 2 approvals. But it's been almost 2 months now since the last one, and you pointed out that we had the government shutdown during that time. But is this latest delay causing any concern for you folks? And have you heard anything from your discussions with stakeholders or decision makers over the last couple of months that makes you more or less optimistic about getting the license this year?","Debra L. Reed","I think everything we're hearing is quite constructive, and that if you kind of look at how long it took them to approve the prior project is something like 35 days, and if you add the government shutdown time to the 35 days, then hopefully, we'll see something coming out within the next week or so on Freeport. And then if they keep to that pace, we do believe that we would be in the -- would be next up in the approval queue. We would be #1 then after Freeport expansion and expect to get that by the end of this year if they kept up that type of schedule. I would say that Secretary Moniz just traveled to Japan. And I think the thing that is very clear is that the Japanese have made a strong case for the need of getting these projects moved forward quickly because of their need to have deliveries in the 2017, 2018 period. And that -- we had read and it's been reported to us that Moniz was quite constructive on keeping this kind of pace of 1 to 2 months approval on the project when he was in Japan.","Matthew P. Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. Just kind of following up on the last question. When you think back to the Analyst Day and you gave us kind of the 2 long-term EPS growth scenarios, 6% to 8%, including projects in your base capital plan, and an 8% to 10% with some opportunities not in the plan. As you just pointed out, there have been at least a couple, if not more, of those other development opportunities that now seem to be getting pulled into the plan. So I guess, can you just put -- help us put into context of the 2 different growth rates you described? And are we starting to get towards the upper end of the base range or the lower end of that high range or crossing over, if you could just help us? And if -- put in context a little bit more.","Debra L. Reed","I would just repeat the statement. I think we have great confidence and visibility to the 6% to 8%. And that when we give you our outlook at our analyst conference next year, we'll lay out for the 5 years again. But you can look at those charts we gave you and see that we have made progress. So we'll go through all of that when we can update all of our numbers at our analyst conference.","Matthew P. Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. Can you just remind us, as a last question, what the initial range of anticipated FERC rates, you are thinking of was?","Debra L. Reed","Well, we don't ever do a public forecast. But I mean, we kind of monitor and set our plans based upon kind of what is coming out from FERC. So as I said, we're looking to be slight -- in the low end of the kind of range that we had anticipated going in. So we don't give any kinds of ranges. They are factored in though when we give you the guidance ranges, and that's why we give you by business unit guidance ranges so that there's some flexibility as to where some of these things might come out that we don't know the outcome of.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","The first question I had was just on where you stood on forming an MLP for Cameron and whether or not you think you have enough assets that would kind of get you started there until Cameron comes online, and then I have a follow-up.","Debra L. Reed","Somehow, we anticipated this question. So I'm going to have Mark talk about that. Mark?","Mark A. Snell","Rajeev, obviously, as we get Cameron moving, we are looking at this MLP opportunity. We think it would be a great asset to anchor an MLP for us. And I think, really, the question is as we look out at it is when will it start cash flowing and when would be the most opportune time to do that. So I think as an anchored -- as sort of the anchored tenant of our MLP, I think we're looking probably around, as we approach the first cash flows from the business, which should probably be 2016 or '17.","Debra L. Reed","I would just add on this, too, is that when we look at -- just like what we did with IEnova, when we look at forming an MLP, when we look at doing an IPO, we really feel that it's absolutely critical to have a growth strategy and to have clarity on how you grow beyond the initial dropdown of the assets. And I would hope that with our highly successful IPO of IEnova that you see, we're not hesitant to consider these types of financial structures, but -- that we try to time that when they align with our business interest. And with IEnova, I think that was a great example. We knew the Mexican reform was coming. We had some projects we thought we could show some clear growth on. We launched the IPO, and the stock is up something like 51%. So that's the type of transaction we like to do around here. So I would hope you would have some confidence that we'll look at all of these kinds of structures in light of that.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow-up, probably, a question for Joe. But in terms of your cash position at the end of the third quarter, you had about $1 billion or so. Can you just talk about the large number there and expectations of using it going forward?","Joseph A. Householder","Sure, Rajeev, absolutely. And I mentioned this a little bit on the last call. A lot of that actually is cash from the IEnova IPO. There's about $500 billion in Mexico that's being used as we talk building the Sonora pipeline. We expect to use that over the course of the next several months, and then, possibly go back and raise some more debt to finish the pipeline off next year. As we've mentioned before, we have about $350 million in Chile in the holding company above the Chilean utility. And we are looking and have some active projects going on right now that we haven't talked about and we will once we have a chance to firm it up and be able to talk about that. So we're actively working to use that money. And about $167 million of it was at SDG&E because we did an offering, a bond offering at SDG&E. And part of that was used to redeem the preferred stock in October. So the cash is pretty well spoken for.","Operator","We'll go next to Neel Mitra with Tudor, Pickering.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","First question is on Los Ramones II. Could you kind of explain the progression from not bidding in to eventually getting a 25% or more stake in the project, and what's changed and maybe how that affects your outlook for investment in Mexico going forward?","Debra L. Reed","Sure. We'd be happy to. I'm going to ask Mark to comment on that.","Mark A. Snell","Okay. Neel, good question. Well, first on the reason that we didn't bid is, I think, the -- when the proposal was put out, we looked at it and we really didn't feel like there was enough time being allowed for us to do an effective bid. And while we did lobby to try to get extensions, that didn't happen. And PEMEX went forward with the bid. And so we've decided that because we didn't feel like we had enough time to do a fulsome bid and really have a number that we felt very comfortable with, we decided not to bid. As a result, I think partly because of the timing and other issues, the bids that came in didn't meet their expectations, nor did they conform with the bid instructions, and so they were rejected. Or the one bid they did get in was rejected, then they went back and talked to the potential bidders and worked out a program to really get this pipeline done on time and meet their -- and help meet their expectations. And they came back to us, I think, because we have a, a long history with PEMEX of doing projects with them. We have a joint venture in place that has been very, very successful. And I think they felt very comfortable in dealing with us and making sure that if we did commit to something that we can make sure that it would happen on time and within the kind of monetary restrictions that they were looking for. And so as a result, we've been able to -- we're negotiating with them to get this project done. We'll have at least 25%. And we expect that they have sort of a regulated rate of return.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Great. And on the second question, you mentioned once-through cooling as a reason as to why transmission might need to be built. How committed do you think the state is with the existing schedule for shutdowns for gas plants that have that problem right now? And do you think maybe they'd push out that schedule in light of SONGS and some of the reliability issues that they didn't anticipate for that?","Debra L. Reed","I will just tell you on past history, when it comes to environmental issues in California, I have not seen them generally delayed. So the ISO is very actively planning for the restrictions on once-through cooling and looking at the needs that come from SONGS and from some potential low growth over time. So the way we look at it is that, that is going to be happening. And if it's like everything else in California on the environmental front, it doesn't appear too likely to be delayed.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Mark Barnett with Morningstar Equity Research.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","A couple of -- you answered a lot specifics earlier. And I am wondering, maybe on a more general level, when you look at the potential for a reform bill, based on what you've seen and what the government's really looking to incentivize, what do you think the most kind of relevant items you expect to be addressed in the high -- kind of highest probability stuff that we'd see?","Debra L. Reed","Yes, I'll take a first crack at that, and then I'll ask Mark to add to it. I mean, we look at reform and a lot of the reform deals with the oil side of the business, clearly. And we do have some interest at Sempra and possibly going into the gathering and processing. And one of the things that they're looking at under the reform is trying to get more participants in offshore and in some of the leasehold areas, so that PEMEX can have their investments go in and more of the conventional plays and bring in some of the oil from the conventional plays to the market, but I think there's good opportunities for us to expand out of natural gas. We're doing that right now with PEMEX in the area of ethane. We're building an ethane pipeline. And so we see a lot of gas opportunities obviously with the reform. They're trying to convert all of the power plants in the state from fuel oil to natural gas, and so we see continued construction of pipelines occurring, but I would not limit it to that as kind of how we look at the future for Sempra. Mark, do you want to?","Mark A. Snell","Yes, I would just say too, that I think one important thing to note is, is that with or without reforms, we're very well positioned in Mexico to continue to build out energy infrastructure. And I think the reforms, to the extent that they come, will only enhance our ability to do -- to continue to do that, because they'll bring on -- more fields will be brought on. There'll be more need for pipelines. There'll be more need for treatment facilities. There'll be more needs for the kinds of things that are in our wheelhouse. But as that's happening and as there's more and more emphasis in Mexico on the fact that they need to divert more monies into E&P, there's going to be those opportunities for us to continue to fund their infrastructure needs. And so we -- no matter how this comes out, we think, even without reform, we have a pretty bright future there. And with perform, it gets even better because there will just be more activity. So we're pretty excited about it.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","That's very interesting. And I guess, one last question on Mexico. With the proposed tax reform that you are -- have already sort of addressed with the deferred tax issue, but is this fairly firm at this point? Are there any incremental changes that might actually -- you mentioned on a look-forward basis it's not a serious issue given the small size of the change, but is there anything that might be meaningful for energy assets in general?","Debra L. Reed","I'll have Joe address that. I think just last week, Congress moved it forward. And we think that this is going to pass this year. And that's why we wanted to give you the heads-up on this call. But I'll have Joe address kind of the future view.","Joseph A. Householder","Sure. When this -- when the energy reform was proposed and the economic and tax reform, part and parcel, they need to work together a little bit because the energy reform affects PEMEX cash flow and then they need a tax reform to drive more revenue. So a lot of the tax reform was driven around individual tax reforms, so they increased rates in the individual level. And for corporations, they just changed a few things. We've taken a look at all of that. The one thing they did -- the current tax rate in Mexico is 30% on corporation. It was supposed to go down to 29% and then 28%. And so our deferred taxes into the future were booked at those rates, and we're just having to bring them back to the 30%. But it's a small effect on future earnings. We don't see any other major effects on us. There were some other small wrinkles, but we do expect it to go forward. The Congress has essentially approved it, and we expect it to go forward by year end.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Ashar Khan with Visium.","Ashar Khan","My questions have been answered.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Vedula Murti with CTI(sic) [CDP] Capital.","Vedula Murti","Just to follow up on the MLP question. I'm just curious, given the timeline that you laid out for Cameron and everything like that, given your other assets, I'm curious how you, right now -- clearly, that's a long time in terms of changing around in terms of cost of capital. How do you think about the differential cost of capital now with the possibility of like a transactional type of opportunity, kind of like what you saw with CenterPoint deciding to try to accelerate their development of assets through merger with OGE's Enogex and what we also saw in the E&P space with Devon Energy rather than doing an IPO of a fairly smallish MLP to do a merger as well or a transaction to accelerate scope and scale.","Debra L. Reed","Well, let me just say that, we are very seriously looking at the whole MLP issue and what are the right options for structuring an MLP that would provide the kind of long-term growth that we want in our space. There's nothing that we would preclude doing. But we would also -- I mean, we feel really good about the value of the assets that we would have to go into an MLP. And then when you have something like Cameron that basically we take an existing plan and we put that in as our equity contribution, and then we earn $300 million to $350 million a year off of that, we want to be sure that anything that we do is in the long-term interest of our shareholders. And so I don't feel any desperation to try to move it up. If we found a good partner where we felt we could create greater long-term value and an MLP, we would be very open to that.","Operator","At this time, we have no further questions in the queue. I would like to turn the conference back to Ms. Debbie Reed for any additional or closing remarks.","Debra L. Reed","Well, thank you, all, very much for joining us. And as always, if you have any follow-up questions, you can please contact our IR team, and they'd be happy to answer them for you. And have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead, sir.","Richard A. Vaccari","Good morning, and thank you for joining us. This morning, we'll be discussing Sempra Energy's fourth quarter and full year 2013 financial results. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section. With us today in San Diego are several members of our management team: Debbie Reed, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Snell, President; Joe Householder, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Martha Wyrsch, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and Trevor Mihalik, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer.","Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and that we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our fourth quarter and full year 2013 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures.","I'd also like to note that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, February 27, 2014, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.","With that, please turn to Slide 3 and I let me hand the call over to Debbie.","Debra L. Reed","Thanks, Rick, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. 2013 was another great year for our company, and one filled with many accomplishments on our infrastructure projects, partnership initiatives and regulatory effort. We are extremely happy that our Cameron Liquefaction project received the Department of Energy's conditional permit to export to non-Free-Trade-Agreement countries on February 11. And with a noteworthy progress, we are making and securing our FERC permit. We expect construction on this project to begin this year. We will provide further details later on the call.","Turning to our financial results. I continue to be pleased with our performance of sustained delivery of top tier shareholder return. With the DOE non-FTA permit for Cameron now in hand, we have given greater confidence in the earnings contribution Cameron will provide starting in 2018. This puts us well on our way to meeting our goal of 9% to 11% compound annual earnings growth through 2019. Additionally, I'm confident that we will execute on some of the growth opportunities we've identified which are not yet in our plan. This would allow us to get to the higher end of that range, and I look forward to discussing these opportunities with you at our analyst conference next month.","Now let me hand things over to Joe to discuss the 2013 results in more detail, starting with Slide 4. Joe?","Joseph A. Householder","Thanks, Debbie, and good afternoon or good morning to everybody. Our results for the fourth quarter exceeded the expectations we've provided on our third quarter call and resulted in a strong finish to 2013. This morning, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $282 million or $1.13 per share. This compares to adjusted earnings of $268 million or $1.08 per share in the same quarter last year. Including both the impact of the $77 million 2012 retroactive benefit from our General Rate Case in California and the $119 million loss on the closure of SONGS, we reported 2013 GAAP earnings of $1,001,000,000 or $4.01 per share. For guidance purposes, we reported 2013 earnings per share of $4.49, above the midpoint of our guidance range of $4.30 to $4.60 per share. These earnings per share exclude the loss on SONGS, but they include the retroactive GRC benefits.","Full year 2013 adjusted earnings, which exclude both the SONGS loss and the retroactive GRC benefit totaled $1,043,000,000 or $4.18 per share. There were 2 major factors to 2013 adjusted earnings that arose from our previously announced repatriation strategy and the IEnova IPO. Both of these strategic decisions were designed to create and have in fact, increased total shareholder value.","Just to recap those in more detail. 2013 was the first year of our plan to repatriate cash from international operations back to the United States. While we pay little in cash taxes on this repatriation, we do have to book an income tax expense when we bring the funds back to the U.S. For 2013, this tax expense was $63 million or $0.25 per share. The cash flow to the U.S. from this plan supports our strategy to continue growing our dividend.","Second, in March, we completed the IPO of IEnova in Mexico which has been tremendously successful, creating significant value for Sempra shareholders. Since the IPO, IEnova's stock is up over 70% and the value of Sampra's investment has increased by more than $1.5 billion. This increased value has more than compensated our shareholders for the $26 million or $0.10 per share dilution we reported in 2013. In addition to those factors, as discussed on our third quarter call, the Mexican government enacted tax reform that keeps the Mexican corporate tax rate at 30% after 2013, as opposed to a scheduled reduction to 28% under prior law. This change will have only a minimal impact to ongoing earnings, but did negatively affect 2013 results by $13 million due to the required adjustment to our deferred tax liabilities.","When taking these items into consideration, I can see that the health of our underlying business remains strong and in line with our long-term growth aspirations.","Now let's go through the segment results in more detail, beginning with SDG&E on Slide 5. At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the fourth quarter of 2013 were $119 million compared to earnings of $110 million in the fourth quarter last year. Fourth quarter earnings were higher primarily due to $28 million of higher CPUC base margin, net of expenses, partially offset by a $10 million impact of lower authorized CPUC and FERC returns, and $4 million of lost SONGS earnings due to the plant closure. For the year, SDG&E reported adjusted earnings of $471 million as compared to $484 million in 2012. Earnings in 2012 included a $22 million higher income tax benefit resulting from the change in the treatment of repair expenditures that relates to the year 2011. In 2013, we also partially offset impacts from the lower authorized rates of return and loss of SONGS earnings with higher CPUC base margin, net of expenses, as SDG&E identified operating efficiencies to improve their performance.","Now please turn to Slide 6. Fourth quarter 2013 earnings at Southern California Gas were consistent with the last year at $98 million. This quarter's results were impacted by $30 million of lower tax benefits as earnings for the fourth quarter of last year included the full year's impact of the change in tax treatment for repair expenditures. This tax impact was offset in the fourth quarter of 2013 by $19 million of higher CPUC base margin, net of expenses, and $12 million of reduced tax expense related to prior year's income tax issues.","SoCalGas increased annual adjusted earnings by $50 million to $339 million in 2013. This increase largely reflects $36 million of higher CPUC base margin, net of expenses, in part due to operating efficiencies that SoCalGas identified to improve performance. Higher 2013 earnings also includes $15 million in pipeline integrity expenses that are now being fully recovered in rates.","Now let's move to Sempra International on Slide 7. At our South American Utilities, fourth quarter 2013 earnings were $43 million compared to $46 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Full year 2013 earnings were $153 million. Excluding the $11 million loss on the sale of our Argentine investments, this segment was in line with our expectations.","Fourth quarter 2013 earnings for Sempra Mexico segment were $26 million versus earnings of $35 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Fourth quarter earnings reflect a $13 million increase in deferred income tax expense due to the change in tax law I discussed earlier and an $8 million decrease resulting from our noncontrolling interest at IEnova. These effects were partially offset by $9 million of higher net earnings as a result of recording AFUDC earnings for pipeline construction. For the full year 2013, Sempra Mexico's earnings were $122 million compared with $157 million in 2012. Similar to the quarter, the decrease in earnings resulted from the end of year change in Mexican tax law and a $26 million dilutive effect from the IEnova IPO.","Now please turn to Slide 8. Moving to Sempra U.S. Gas & Power, the Natural Gas segment earned $9 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to a loss of $6 million in the year-ago period after excluding the $25 million payment received from Kinder Morgan for tax impacts related to the sale of their interest in REX. Higher fourth quarter earnings were due primarily to a lower of cost or market adjustment that occurred in 2012 related to the purchase of an LNG cargo in the fourth quarter of 2012, and the change in intercompany marketing agreements that reduced cost in 2013. For the full year, Sempra Natural Gas reported 2013 earnings of $64 million. Included in this amount is a $44 million gain on the sale of one block at the Mesquite Power Plant.","Fourth quarter 2013 earnings for the renewable segment was $6 million compared with earnings of $14 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. Higher earnings in 2012 reflect $12 million of higher deferred income tax benefits as a result of assets placed into service in 2012. For 2013, annual earnings of $62 million include $24 million of gains associated with our new solar joint ventures.","Let's please turn to Slide 9. Turning now to our guidance for 2014. We are reaffirming expected consolidated earnings for the year to fall within the range of $4.25 to $4.55 per share. Overall, our near-term and long-term prospects remain very strong and we are looking forward to giving you more detail on our outlook at next month's analyst conference. In addition, the Board voted in February to increase our annualized dividend by approximately 5% to $2.64 per share. We recognize that returning capital to shareholders is important and we remain committed to providing a strong and growing dividend to the owners of Sempra. Once Cameron is in construction, we intend to recommend a higher dividend growth as an alternative to a larger one-time increase after Cameron is operational.","Now let me hand the call back to Debbie to discuss Slide 10.","Debra L. Reed","Thanks, Joe. As I mentioned at the outset of this call, we were pleased to receive our permit to export to non-FTA countries from the Department of Energy on February 11. We are also the first on the list of proposed LNG projects to have received our Draft Environmental Impact Statement from FERC. FERC schedule calls for issuance of the final EIS on or before April 30, 2014. This is the last major step in securing our FERC order authorizing the construction and operation of the project. And we expect to receive that order this summer.","In addition to progress on permitting, we are finalizing terms on the lump sum construction contract with our preferred EPC contractor. The cost estimates for the project remains in line with the $6 billion to $7 billion of construction cost, and $9 billion to $10 billion of total cost that we have consistently projected. We have also made substantial progress in securing financing. We are working with the Japanese export credit agencies to finalize their loan commitment. And earlier this month, we signed a commitment letter with commercial banks worldwide as part of our very successful commercial bank syndication. Given this development, we continue to have confidence we will be able to close long tenure borrowing at very attractive rates.","Subject to FERC's final approval, the project remains on track to start construction in 2014, and we still expect all 3 trains to come online throughout 2018, with the first full year of 3-train production in 2019.","Concerning the progress of our Cameron LNG facility, we want to take this opportunity to update you on our thinking around the potential MLP strategy. We have a great asset in Cameron. And we know that it could serve as a very strong and anchor for an MLP, as it will provide natural drop-down given its significant cash flow underpinned by 20-year contract. Since those cash flows don't start for several years, we continue to explore ways to jumpstart an MLP using our own storage of pipeline assets or by developing or buying other assets. After much analysis, we've determined that, currently, our existing assets don't provide the certainty of cash flows to support the formation of an MLP that will generate the premium valuation our shareholders deserve.","We will continue to assess this. In fact, the assets, like rocks [ph], are well positioned to secure contracts for transport of that out of the Marcellus and Utica, and could help jumpstart an MLP. As you saw with our IEnova IPO, we are focused on structures that increase value for Sempra shareholders both today and into the future, and we will time a possible MLP accordingly.","Using Cameron as a strong foundation for future MLP is bolstered by the many exciting prospects we have to grow in and around the LNG and gas infrastructure businesses. Mark will provide you with more information on these emerging opportunities at next month's analyst conference. At that time, Joe will also go into more detail about our MLP thought process.","Let's now turn to Slide 11 for an update on regulatory proceedings for our California utility. In January 2014, SDG&E filed an uncontested multiparty settlement agreement with FERC on our Electric Transmission formula that establish an authorized return on equity of 10.05%. The FERC order approving the settlement should be issued by the end of the third quarter in 2014. But will be retroactive to September of last year, and this settlement will be in effect through December 2018. The settlement specifically allows SDG&E the right to apply for incentive adders on future projects and determines the equity ratio based upon actual equity recorded on December 31 of each year. Terms of the settlement are reflected in our fourth quarter 2013 earnings and in our 2014 guidance.","Second, on SONGS. The CPUC's proceedings remain ongoing and while the commission is encouraging parties to engage in settlement discussions, we expect the final resolution of all proceedings to take some time. We continue to believe that the amount of our remaining regulatory asset is reasonable and will be recovered.","Now please turn to Slide 12. In Peru, our Santa Teresa Hydro project remains on schedule and should be completed later this year. The 100-megawatt project is our first generation project in Peru, and I'm confident it will be the first of many additional projects we will execute there. In fact, Mark, Joe and I recently visited South America and are enthusiastic about prospects for growth in Chile and Peru. We will discuss more specifics at the conference next month, but there are a number of possible projects in South America that fits very well with our strategy, including gas pipelines and electric generation and transmission opportunity.","In Mexico, we also continue to move ahead on our many infrastructure projects. Construction of the first phase of our Sonora Pipeline project is on schedule and on budget, and this 300-mile segment is expected to be completed in the second half of 2014. The second segment of the pipeline is projected to start operations in the second half of 2016.","In January, construction began on the Los Ramones I project as part of our joint venture with PEMEX. And that pipeline is also expected to be completed in the second half of 2014. We continue to work on finalizing the contract for our participation in the Northern Phase of Los Ramones II and I anticipate these negotiations will conclude very soon. As you'll recall, we expect to have a 25% share of this segment of the pipeline.","Finally, in Mexico. Last quarter, we've started construction on the 156-megawatt ESJ Wind project, which is supported by a 20-year contract with SDG&E. As we discussed last quarter, formation of a 50-50 joint venture for this project was delayed due to our original prospective partner's decision to exit the wind development business. However, negotiations are progressing well with other interested parties and I'm confident we will finalize the JV very soon.","Finally, in the first quarter of 2014, we made the decision to hold for sale the second block of the Mesquite Power Plant in Arizona. It continues to be our goal to complete our exit of the merchant generation business, and we are making good progress on the sale of this asset. However, since we do not yet have a contract for sale, we are not including the transaction in the guidance that we reaffirmed today.","Now let's finish by turning to Slide 13. In summary, 2013 was another very good year for our company. Demonstrating how well our business strategy performs in our changing market and regulatory condition. We have already made significant progress on planned infrastructure projects, and with over $2 billion of projects scheduled to come online before next year, I'm equally optimistic about future earnings. Sempra's diversified portfolio and focused strategy on long-term contracted cash flow positions us well for growth in the years ahead.","And with that, let me stop and take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Greg Gordon of ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Can we take the commentary around the time horizon for the sort of ability for you guys to flow the -- an MLP, part and parcel with your willingness to be more aggressive on the dividend in the intermediate term, and sort of the financial sort of balancing act you're making in order to try to drive the best shareholder value for your investors until the point where you get to a viable portfolio of MLP-eligible assets?","Debra L. Reed","Well, as I said -- I mean, I think, just the Cameron asset alone, has great potential for an MLP with the ability to drop down that in pieces over time and have clear visibility to that. And I thought, as the debt is paid off, the earnings increase and that there's some good upside from that asset. Right now, as we look at the other assets we have, we don't feel that it would be in our shareholder's interest to do a bridge strategy without those assets. But I will say, we're constantly looking at other assets that we could potentially acquire. And if we found some good assets that would create a good bridge strategy, we're not opposed to do that. On the dividend issue, we have a great deal of confidence now about Cameron coming online. After getting the non-FTA permit and being where we are in the FERC process, we're feeling very confident about this project going online with all 3 trains coming on in 2018. And then full 3-year operations -- 3-train operations in 2019. And so, as we look at our dividend, we've had a policy of 45% to 50% payout ratio. We see the earnings coming in 2018 and 2019, and we really think that we can do that dividend and it not be inconsistent with any MLP strategy. Joe?","Joseph A. Householder","Yes. Greg, I'm just making another point. I don't see them as a very linked at all. I think that we have really strong earnings and growth in our other businesses besides just Cameron. And so this dividend is in response to our continually growing earnings from that. And as we look forward and study the MLP, we'll have enough cash flow from LP and GP units to keep our dividend even post an MLP. So I don't see that as any kind of a bridge, it's from the strong earnings that we have.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","A follow-up question. Have you considered -- given so successful in the IEnova transaction, have you considered as a -- instead of an IPO of your MLP-eligible assets, doing a strategic transaction with another entity with an existing GP, where you contributed your assets for a GP stake and, thus, helped to drive further growth for that other entity and, therefore, added value to the GP shares that you would be acquiring?","Debra L. Reed","I would say, we look at all of those things, Greg. That -- the thing that we have got to be sure is that, with the Cameron asset, we want to be sure that our shareholders get the right kinds of splits, have the right kind of long-term structure for our assets that we're going to put in. And if we found something that would work with that, we would definitely be open to considering that. But we're not going to rush to get something out that devalues our assets in the long-term.","Operator","And we'll go next to Neel Mitra with Tudor, Pickering.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","I just had a follow-up on the MLP question. So you're not willing to use a bridge strategy with REX right now, but with where mid-stream assets are going for in terms of valuation, how do you expect to compete without having an MLP in place to buy some of these assets?","Debra L. Reed","Well, what I said was that if we look at our existing assets right now, putting them in MLP to do a bridge strategy, we don't think that was the best thing. What I also said, though, is that, some things are changing with those -- the value of those assets that we might see in the future. And as you know that after we basically have REX flow, bidirectionally, are moving forward and that, that could offer some opportunities if we can have contracts that extend beyond the expiration of the existing contracts. So -- and we just did a nonbinding open season and that had some -- it gave us some promise that there's some real upside with that asset, potentially. So we will continue to look at that. And if we had to make an acquisition for a bridge strategy that made economic sense in the long term, we would look at doing what made economic sense in the long term.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. And secondly, on the 9% to 11% growth rate. Kind of bridge that with the previous 6% to 8% growth rate before -- I guess, you guys included Cameron for 2018 and 2019. So does the 9% to 11% include projects that are not in the development plan or not in the earnings plan right now? Do that exceed 11% or is it kind of -- you'd be the closer to 9% without those projects and towards the higher end of the range if you executed on some of the growth projects?","Debra L. Reed","Yes. We'll go through this in detail at the analyst meeting. But when we look at that range of 9% to 11%, the 9% basically includes what we have in our base plan without incremental growth and Cameron at full operation in 2019. We will go through the upsides that we have in our -- that are not in our plan but are upsides to that plan at the analyst meeting. But there are a lot of things happening in that regard and a number of bids are coming out in 2014 even that could add to that and get us towards the high end of that range. And that's what I commented on, as if we pick up some of those projects, we could definitely be towards the high end of that range by 2019.","Operator","And we'll go next to Matt Tucker with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Matthew P. Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Apologies, I just want to beat up once more on the MLP topic. Assuming you don't make any major acquisitions and your existing assets don't change in such a way that you'll be even [ph] more MLP-able between now and when Cameron does start operating, should we assume that it is your plan to form an MLP with Cameron as the anchor in 2018 or 2019? Or are you still not sure that you'd go that route when you get to that point?","Debra L. Reed","Well, I mean, these are discussions that obviously we will have our Board of Directors as we get closer. But if everything stays as it does today and if there's opportunities to grow at that midstream business with cheaper equity and do that, then that would be our intent. But that's a while off, so things could change, tax laws could change, interest rates could change. But as we look at it today, that's the direction we would be headed.","Matthew P. Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And just to clarify on your comments around the dividend growth, you're planning to propose accelerated dividend growth starting, I guess, next year, assuming that Cameron enters construction as opposed to staying on the same trajectory you've been on recently and waiting all the way until 2018 for more of a step change. Is that correct?","Debra L. Reed","That's generally correct. Let me just have Joe talk about kind of how we're thinking about the dividend.","Joseph A. Householder","Yes. As we said, we right now today have a dividend payout ratio that is higher than the 45% to 50% that we've set with the board long term because of the repatriation plan. And we just recommended and they approved an increase of almost 5% now for this year. And what we said is once Cameron is in construction later this year, then we go to next year's dividend, we think we will suggest a slightly faster pace that will allow us to get to the 45% to 50% in 2019. So you can kind of assume that we'll be suggesting something more of a straight line from 2015 to 2019 that you gets to that 45%, 50%.","Matthew P. Tucker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just on the Cameron financing, is that pretty much just waiting for FERC approval before that gets secured? Or are there other issues that you're still working through?","Debra L. Reed","Mark, why don't you talk a little bit about where we stand on Cameron, in general, including the financing?","Mark A. Snell","Well, I think, in general, we're in very good shape. And I would point out that just to comment on, in line with the dividend question, just to remind you all that this whole project, we're committing existing assets and we fully expect to finance and use the contributions from our partners to finance construction. So that's not a drain on our cash, so we certainly are able to raise the dividend without -- that there's no concerns there. As far as financing goes, and Joe can comment on this as well, but we have a very, very robust response to our financing efforts. And we are highly confident of being able to completely finance this project without any problems.","Debra L. Reed","Another comment on where we are with the EPC, too.","Mark A. Snell","We're in the final kind of final weeks of negotiating the EPC contract. And what I will say is that we will have -- we will come out of with this with a contract that is a lump sum turnkey project contract that shifts the construction risk to the EPC contractor. And I think there was always some concern whether that would happen, but the market has been good around that and we have a very nice contract that we're very happy with, with a very experienced builder.","Operator","And we'll go next to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I want to ask about the underlying assets within the U.S. Natural Gas business. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing with gas storage economics, given the volatility we've just seen over the last couple of months and whether a change in the economics have started to appear in gas storage or whether the gas storage market appears somewhat depressed still?","Debra L. Reed","Sure, Michael. Let me just start generally, and then I'm going to turn it over to Mark to add a few more detail. We did talk about REX and what we see happening there. And many of you have written about what's happening in Marcellus and Utica. And you've talked about a lot of the pipelines reversing flow going into the Gulf area. And what we see in the Gulf area is we see colder gas conversion and in the Southeast in that region. And we also see all the LNG export occurring. And that -- we think that is going to change some of the dynamics relative to storage certainly. And what we're starting to see is an interest in contracting on longer-term basis for some of the storage assets because I think others are seeing the same thing and think that it will be good to get some long-term contracts. Mark, do you want to add a little bit to that?","Mark A. Snell","Yes. A couple of things I would just say is that -- and I know you can appreciate the technical nature of some of my comments here. But what we've seen in the past is we've had a very depressed storage market with really the only value being recognized is the summer, winter spread that frankly has been relatively small and weak over the last few years. We're certainly seeing that change now, we're seeing a higher value for that. But then I think even more importantly for the first time in probably 4 years or so, we're seeing a real return to some extrinsic value. So valuing that volatility around the gas market, we're seeing a value put on that, and we're getting that in our storage rates currently. So I think that part of the business seems to be coming back a bit. And in fact, I think for the first time we've actually sold some storage to marketers, which we haven't done in a long time. So there is something going on there. I'm a little bit reluctant to say that it's back to where it was 7 or 8 years ago. But it's certainly a better market today than it was 6 months ago.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And when thinking about REX and kind of the reversal of REX back to or at least a part of REX back to Midwest, how long do you and your partners think you could -- how long do you think it likely will take before you sign up a lot greater percentage or a greater portion of REX to move gas from either the Marcellus or Utica into the Midwest?","Debra L. Reed","Well, we would hope to do that very soon. That, as I said, we had a nonbinding open season. And there seemed to be a lot of interest in that, and so we would like to pursue that. And then you've also seen all the announcements through the pipeline, some of which actually connected to REX, the reverse flows going from north to south. And so we think this is going to happen relatively soon with the need for takeaway capacity out of the Marcellus and the Utica. We also are working on the lateral that we talked to you about previously, and that will be in service very shortly in 2014, probably by April. So the whole dynamics of that are changing that area is going to change rapidly and we need to be able to respond rapidly, and we will.","Operator","We'll go next to Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I have 2 questions. One, can you just talk about what you're seeing as it relates to the market for buying existing midstream assets as it relates to pricing, things like that? And second question, specifically on Cameron, with more clarity on financing costs, et cetera, do you still feel good about the numbers you laid out before in terms of the EPS contribution, et cetera?","Debra L. Reed","Yes. Let me start with the last question on Cameron. And yes, we feel very good about the numbers that we've talked about at Cameron. With everything we've seen with the EPC contract, the financing and all, as I reaffirmed today, those numbers look good. I'll talk a little bit about at a high level, the midstream. And I don't want to go into details on assets. But what I think you're starting to see now is a cycle that's kind of been interesting and it's repeated itself multiple times in the E&P business, where you're starting to see more of the E&P companies look at selling off some of their midstream assets so that they can invest that stream. So I think what we saw a few years ago is starting to change a little bit. And so we will continue to look at opportunities as these changes occur. Chevron has looked at some asset sales. Chesapeake is looking at some asset sales. And it's very typical when E&P companies decide that they need to invest more upstream for them to look at the selling off some of those assets, and so we'll be exploring that. And in terms of asset pricing. Obviously, you're competing with MLPs and that are interested in getting those assets. And so we will continue to look at every opportunity that is out there and whether it fits for us. The good thing is that we have some opportunities in the LNG space that Mark will talk about more at the conference. But I'll let him just maybe give a little bit on that right now.","Mark A. Snell","Well, I would say that if you think of LNG as being sort of a midstream asset that's certainly MLP-able, we are starting to see opportunities in the LNG space. And I'm going into some detail on some specifics at the conference. But I think we are kind of starting construction on Cameron with a mindset that this isn't just a single-asset business. It is a business that we believe we can grow, and we can continue to add to it. And we're very excited about the opportunity to really have an LNG business and not just an LNG asset. So I think that's what's very exciting. And I will say on the other midstream stuff, it's a very competitive market. And the stuff that we've seen that's been priced reasonably is stuff that we typically don't want. And the stuff that we've looked at that we want is either not for sale or very, very expensive. And so we certainly are taking that into consideration. And I think most of you have enough confidence in us that this is a management team that's pretty thoughtful about how we make investments in these kinds of things. And we're looking to do -- we are certainly anxious to do something that builds shareholder value. But we're also very willing to be patient.","Joseph A. Householder","I'd just add to that one thing, too, is we're a very strong company with a very strong balance sheet. And where the 10-year debt is, is very low. And our after-tax cost of capital for borrowing money to buy something is pretty low. But as Mark said, we're going to be very disciplined about looking at things and make sure they were the right thing to do.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And just a quick follow-up. So you talked about the asset side. What about actually buying an existing company or sort of that idea?","Debra L. Reed","I'll ask Mark to add because I've already given some kind of my view. So I'll ask Mark to add...","Mark A. Snell","When you say buying an existing company, you mean as far as -- in which state.","Debra L. Reed","With a general partner or...","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes. Or rather than buying -- doing a piecemeal and buying assets to put into an MLP, maybe buy an actual company that has existing assets, kind of existing MLP or something else?","Mark A. Snell","Well, I get it. Look, I think exactly the same comment applies, which is, I mean, the valuation metrics around assets and existing MLPs is pretty much the same, which is the ones you really want are very, very expensive and the ones that look like they're reasonably priced, there's usually something wrong and something we don't want. So I think the same -- all the same caveats apply. But as Joe said, we're more than willing to move on something if we find the right thing. We just haven't found it yet.","Operator","And we'll go next to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I'm not going to ask you any more about the MLP. But just -- since a lot of my questions have been asked, just a few quick ones. Is there any interest -- you guys have previously been in merchant power, you guys have really walked away from that, et cetera. Given where prices are and things coming up for sale, do you guys have any interest at all in that? Or is that pretty much still off the table?","Debra L. Reed","No. I mean, really our model now and our strategy, I think that works very well for us and that we have plenty of growth opportunities within this model is to do long-term contract and infrastructure. And so merchant business and the volatility of the merchant business doesn't really work well with our other assets. And so if we could do a long -- a 20-year contract or something and build a plant, but I don't consider it merchant, yes, we would do something like that. But to be in the market, like what happened when our DWR contract expired, is not where we want to be.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, makes sense. Just some real quick cleanup things. The Mexican taxing, did I understand it correctly that's mostly nonrecurring, that there really shouldn't be any impact going forward?","Joseph A. Householder","This is Joe. Going forward, it's $3 million to $4 million a year. It's 2% change in the tax rate on our pretax income, if not greater.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","And then sundry items, the asset balance sort of increased again. Was there any impact on earnings for the quarter?","Trevor I. Mihalik","Yes. This is Trevor, Paul. Very limited there. On the sundry items, the increases there were primarily associated with the PBOP assets and the greenhouse gas allowances that increased there. So the PBOP assets and the pension assets increased by about $95 million and the greenhouse gas allowances were about $60 million and then we also had some workers' comp insurance increases there for about $40 million. Then included in there is also the Rabbi Trust. But year-over-year, that was about the same. So that was really the driver in the increase of the $263 million on sundry.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. But I mean, for the quarter, was there an EPS impact?","Trevor I. Mihalik","No, there was very minimal impact really associated with it.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","And then just finally, your stock has moved up a lot. Any thoughts of the stock split? I know it's kind of a cosmetic question, but just since I got you on the phone.","Debra L. Reed","I mean, people always ask us that question. I think when Berkshire Hathaway trades as it does, you kind of feel that most of the buyers can afford the stock as it is. And so unless there's some other compelling reason, it's not something that we spend a lot of time on most likely.","Operator","And we'll go next to Kit Konolige with BGC.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","A couple of kind of cleaning-up questions. So on the dividend growth going forward. The comment was that we would potentially see a slightly faster rate of growth. Did I write that down correctly?","Debra L. Reed","Well, we had said before a 4% to 5% growth. And if you look at a 4% to 5% growth and you look at what happens when Cameron comes online with the earnings, you don't quite get to a 45% to 50% payout ratio. So we're looking at rather than wait and doing a 4% to 5%, and then waiting to have a step function increase when Cameron comes online, to smooth that a bit. So that should yield the dividend growth rate, that would be slightly higher than we would have done otherwise.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","All right. Okay, fair enough. Okay. And your discussion of SONGS, it sounds as though your expectations are pretty low for any settlement. Is that a fair assessment?","Debra L. Reed","No. I wouldn't assess it that way. But I really can't talk about any settlement discussions. So I wouldn't conclude that it's not possible or that it is possible, I just really can't talk about any kind of confidential settlement discussions.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Right. How about in the absence of a settlement discussion, how long -- can you be any more specific about how long it might take until we get a fully litigated result?","Debra L. Reed","Well, I can tell you what the phases are. And there's 4 phases in the case. And we have a schedule for the first 2 phases, and we just heard that the first phase is already being delayed. It was supposed to come out in February. It will be delayed now until the end of March. And so we're thinking this will certainly take through this year and probably into next year if you just look at their schedule.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Okay. More CPUC delays, right? They never announce that it's coming sooner. And then one other area that I just jotted down. So on the impact of tax expense on the repatriation, is that going to be a steady impact in years going forward now? In other words, year-over-year, will there be any change in that?","Debra L. Reed","Let me ask Joe to handle that. The thing that I just would remind you all is this year, we did the IPO, so it was a little different this year and we repatriated about $200 million associated with that. Our plan called for us to repatriate about $300 million a year, henceforth. Joe, why don't you talk about the tax on that?","Joseph A. Householder","Yes. So I think what we said a year or more ago when we announced this plan was that it would go on for about 5 or 6 years and that we would have with earnings impact, which would be roughly $0.25 or up to $0.30 a share. It might move around a little bit, just depending on some issues around the tax rules, the way they work and with our other income. But it should be in that neighborhood for about 5 or 6 years, so pretty [indiscernible].","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Very good. Okay. And one final area, just to get my thinking straight on this. The growth rate of 9% to 11%. Can you give us a sense of kind of what are the building blocks there? In other words, is that simply the kind of prior growth rate plus a CAGR that would get us to the addition of Cameron when it comes online? Or are there other things going on there?","Debra L. Reed","Yes. Basically we'll go through this as an update at the analyst meeting. But we showed you those charts last year that had kind of our growth rate through 2018, 2017. And then it showed, if you added Cameron to that, the 9% to 11%. That's basically what we're talking about. We basically take what our 2018 earnings would be on our base business, you added a full year of Cameron and thats what gives you kind of the 9% range. And then there's upside, as we showed you last year, in terms of additional opportunities that could get you towards that 11% range. And we'll go through those in detail at our analyst meeting.","Operator","And we'll go next to Mark Barnett with Morningstar.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I learned a new term today, MLP-able. Outside of the U.S., you've been doing obviously some really good building business down obviously in Central America, focused on Mexico. But I guess, maybe with that growing base of assets and maybe with a growing relationship, particularly with a partner like GDF SUEZ, do you see maybe some of these partnerships as a beginning of a larger platform for Latin America? And I guess, second part of that question would be I know your positions are already fairly strong. But is there any benefit to maybe a more formal agreement pursuing projects? Or is an ad hoc approach better suited?","Debra L. Reed","Yes. I mean, I will say that we're looking at some bids that will be coming up, and we're looking at partners that would be good partners for us for those kinds of bids. And that we -- as you can see with our Cameron facility and what we've done with our Renewables business, we are not at all opposed to partnering. And especially if you can create a bigger pie by partnering, we really like that. So I think there's every opportunity that we would look at partners in Mexico, especially if we want to get into, as we would like to, some of the gathering and processing and areas like that in Mexico, it would be ideal to have a partner to work with there. And then the same thing, South America, and I would say the same thing in the United States.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And maybe a further question on Mexico, in particular. I know it's still in progress and you mentioned the gathering and processing, and obviously gas infrastructure is kind of appealing. But do you think that there -- given some pretty, I guess, impressive growth fundamentals and investment needs, does electric distribution have any interest in the longer term for Sempra?","Debra L. Reed","This is something that I would just say we are watching, and that the thing that we're really watching is what happens with rate structures that really allows you to be competitive. And we think the electric businesses is a good business. They have a lot of capital requirements in that business in the long term. We have aging infrastructure throughout the U.S., so there's a lot of opportunity to invest in transmission as well. So there are parts of that business that we like a lot. And so I wouldn't rule it out. We happen to own the largest gas distribution company and we love the gas business. So with that, a lot of our growth is really focused on the gas side, as you see. But that doesn't mean that electric is not of interest to us.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I guess, in particular, for Mexico, there's still, I guess, a lot of rate formalities as it were that have yet to be ironed out around electric distribution is my understanding?","Joseph A. Householder","Yes.","Debra L. Reed","That's correct.","Operator","And we'll go next to Joe Zhou [ph] with Avon Capital Advisors.","Andrew Levi","Actually, it's Andy Levi. And I apologize if the question was kind of asked because I see the headlines, but I was at a different meeting, so I kind of just got back. But just on the MLP front, would you guys consider purchasing? I know since you're on the headlines on Bloomberg that you'd purchase assets to create an MLP. But would you actually consider buying a small MLP to kind of jumpstart that process?","Debra L. Reed","Yes. We would consider that. What our focus will be on though is creating the greatest long-term value. And if we saw something like that, that was reasonably priced, we thought we could grow it with some other assets we have. And we would be particularly interested in something where if you combine the assets that they have with the assets that we had, 1 plus 1 would equal more than 2. And if we could find something like that, then yes, we would be open to that. Mark stated earlier that what's been shopped, usually if it's priced reasonably, it's not something we would have much interest in. And that a lot of the other things just seem already having every potential growth priced in. And so if it looks like it would be good for our long-term shareholder interest, we are absolutely willing to consider that as an option.","Andrew Levi","And I assume you have obviously the currency to do that, so...","Debra L. Reed","Yes.","Andrew Levi","Yes. I guess, that gives you some options, a better way to put it.","Operator","And we'll go next to Josh Golden with JPMorgan.","Joshua Golden","I'm so sorry for asking the question upfront. This probably isn't the best place to ask you. But can you talk a little bit more about the LNG, Cameron LNG terminal? So from the producer side, where exactly is this gas going to be coming from? Is this more Marcellus-Utica gas? Or is it more Eastern Texas-type of gas? And I guess, I'm just sort of thinking in combination, many years ago, you guys made the acquisition of EnergySouth and the storage assets down there. So I'm just trying to think about how all this works together. And really curious, where do you see the gas coming from for this terminal?","Debra L. Reed","Yes, let me ask Mark to answer that. But I just want to be clear on one thing. We don't buy the gas through the terminal. Our customers will be buying the gas through the terminal. Basically, our contract to the terminal is almost like a take-or-pay contract with the pipeline, where when the facility goes in service, whether they use it or not, we get paid and that they buy the gas and they sell the gas. So I just want to be sure that you understand kind of the structure before Mark answers your specific question. Mark?","Joshua Golden","Yes, I sure do.","Mark A. Snell","Okay, yes. Look, I think, well, this answer is going to sound a little bit like the current administration. It's kind of an all-of-the-above strategy. Our customers are going to acquire gas both -- there will be Marcellus gas that we expect to flow south into the facility and we'll also -- obviously the Texas production will flow there as well. And there could even be Midcon and other production basins that will flow into this facility. And if you think about our facility and the other LNG facilities that are in that region, even with and coupled out with the petrochemical businesses and the proposed petrochemical plants all in that Gulf region, this is going to be a very, very large area of consumption for natural gas, and so supplies will come from all over. All of the producing regions will end up supplying this region. And we're seeing that now. And it's actually -- that's what one of the things that's creating value for not only our storage assets, as you mentioned, but also some of our pipeline assets that you might not even think about. REX is looking like becoming more of a header system for the whole north part of the country. And that header system is going to feed both going north and south. So we do think there'll be some interplay with our other assets.","Joshua Golden","So that's interesting. Now just one follow-up. So if you look at the basis spread differential, it's really collapsed year-over-year and hence, all the feedback storage, et cetera. What do you think will happen to basis spread differential between north, south, et cetera? I mean, do you see those increasing again? Or how do you see that shaking out?","Mark A. Snell","I think because we have found gas in so many places across the country, and some of those places are so close to the consuming regions, basis spread has collapsed around the country. And I think what you're going to really see is -- and like all infrastructure, we do have a lot of pipeline infrastructure, it's just some of it is not going in the right direction. So as we make the incremental investments to be able to move gas in the direction that we need it to go, you're going to see the basis kind of reduced down to the tariff on those lines.","Operator","And we will take a follow-up question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Real quick. I'd like to turn back to the original -- one of the original businesses, the utilities in California. Can you just talk a little bit about how the agreement with the FERC on FERC transmission impacts revenues for 2014?","Debra L. Reed","Sure. Let me go through exactly what the settlement is, and then talk about the impact. So it's a multiparty settlement. It's uncontested. It sets an ROE at 10.05%. And it's based upon the actual equity as recorded on 12\/31 of each year. It will go from September 1, 2013, to December 31, 2018. So that's gives you kind of the duration of this. And if you look at where we were at 11.3% ROE to a 10.05% ROE, that's something like $20 million to $30 million a year of impact in that production of ROE based upon the FERC assets, the FERC rate base that we have. And that has been included in our guidance. So the numbers that we gave you, we started having this effect in 2013. Once we knew a settlement was pending, we were booking to the settlement amount. And it's reflected in our 2014 guidance.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So when you say it was in the 2013 numbers, meaning that full amount was, so there's no incremental year-over-year delta? Or was part of that '13 and part '14?","Debra L. Reed","Yes. Well, the only incremental would be as the rate base increases. But it was in '13 for the fourth quarter from September 1 forward when the prior rate expires.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And on the O&M side at both utilities, I mean, you guys over the years have been one of the best, if not the best, operator at the utility level. Just curious what some of the operating efficiencies you've been able to find and how we should think about kind of directional trends from 2012 onwards for the next few years in terms of utility O&M.","Debra L. Reed","Well, I mean, I would say that we're always -- this is a constant improvement effort at our utilities, as you well know. And so last year, some of the efficiencies of operations were able to offset some of these [indiscernible] reductions in ROE and SONGS, to some extent. And we would see us continuing to work at that level of efficiency and looking for other opportunities to improve. What I will say is safety is our first priority, and we will not do anything that would reduce the safety of our service. And so that is the key focus for our people. But new technologies come in all the time. We have opportunities to change the way we dispatch workers, change the way we time appointments, change the way we use technology to answer customer calls, route customer calls. Those are the kinds of things we really focus on that can improve customer service, improve safety and reduce cost.","Operator","And we'll go next to Winfried Fruehauf with W. Fruehauf Consulting Ltd.","Winfried Fruehauf","Regarding Energ\u00eda Costa Azul, what was the net income contribution in 2012 and '13 and also the fourth quarters of each year?","Debra L. Reed","Yes. We don't break it down. We share data at segment levels, Winfried, so we would not break it down to that kind of a level. You can kind of look at the Mexico segment and see.","Joseph A. Householder","We've decided it's relatively stable because it's under a long-term contract, so there's very little difference between '12 and '13. So it's the same, but we don't give that kind of detail.","Winfried Fruehauf","Okay. And another question, if I may. What was the total foreign exchange impact in 2012 and '13 and also the fourth quarters of each year?","Trevor I. Mihalik","Across all businesses, it was fairly small. I don't have the number right off the top of my head. But in the fourth quarters, it was approximately $5 million to $6 million in the fourth quarter of '14. But I need to pull the number to get that specifically for you and not much different from that for the full year.","Winfried Fruehauf","Okay. And that was negative?","Trevor I. Mihalik","That's right.","Joseph A. Householder","The dollar would strengthen.","Winfried Fruehauf","Yes, okay. Well, if you could maybe get back to me please with the numbers, that would be appreciated.","Operator","And we'll take a follow-up question from Kit Konolige with BGC.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of items. On the 9% to 11% growth rate, to get back to that, what's the base EPS that you're using there? Is it the 2013 actual now?","Debra L. Reed","No. We'll go through that at the analyst meeting. I don't have all of that in front of me right now. We'll update all of that for 2014 through 2018, and then the show you 2019 at the analyst meeting. And I'd rather do it that way versus giving you pieces of information because I don't want to create confusion around that. And we'll have slides on all of that at the meeting.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Sure, okay. One other item, I noted that the Energen, according to reports, is selling Alagasco. You guys have been in that part of the world for a while. Do you have any interest in gas distribution in Alabama?","Debra L. Reed","We can't really comment on any kind of transactions like that.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Ms. Reed, at this time, I will turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Debra L.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead, sir.","Richard A. Vaccari","Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm Rick Vaccari, Vice President of Investor Relations. This morning, we'll be discussing Sempra Energy's third quarter 2012 financial results. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section.","With us today in San Diego are several members of our management team: Debbie Reed, Chief Executive Officer; Mark Snell, President; Joe Householder, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Trevor Mihalik, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer.","Before starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's reports filed with the SEC.","It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and that we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures.  Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our third quarter 2012 earnings release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures.","I'd also like to note that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, November 6, 2012, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.","With that, I will turn it over to Debbie.","Debra L. Reed","Thanks, Rick, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I know many of you on the East Coast are recovering from the effects of Hurricane Sandy and we appreciate you taking the time to be on this call. SDG&E has sent more than 40 employees and 20 pieces of heavy equipment to help Con Edison repair overhead power lines damaged by the storm, and we will continue to do whatever we can to provide assistance.","Moving to our call, today we'll review our third quarter financial results and provide updates on operational matters at all of our businesses, on regulatory matters at our California utilities and on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Let's begin with our financial results.","Earlier this morning, we reported third quarter earnings of $268 million or $1.09 per share. Excluding a $60 million after-tax non-cash charge related to our investment in the Rockies Express Pipeline, or REX, adjusted earnings for the third quarter of 2012 were $328 million or $1.33 per share. In the third quarter of 2011, we reported earnings of $289 million or $1.20 per share. This quarter, we were able to grow our adjusted earnings despite the loss of the CDWR contract, which you'll remember expired in September of 2011. And I remain very pleased with our operating performance.","We continue to execute on our strategy through the sale of 50% of our Mesquite power plant, our plans to build a new pipeline in Mexico and our continued progress on the liquefaction project at Cameron.","Now let me pass things over to Joe to take you through the details of the financial results, beginning with Slide 4.","Joseph A. Householder","Thank you, Debbie. At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the third quarter were $174 million, up from $113 million in the year-ago quarter. The primary driver of the increase was a $38 million reduction in tax expense due to a change in IRS tax law regarding how repairs on electric transmission and distribution assets are treated. $22 million of the benefit recorded in 2012 is related to the 2011 tax year, while the remaining $16 million relates to the year-to-date tax benefit for the 2012 tax year.","Also benefiting the quarter were $12 million of increased transmission earnings, including the impact of Sunrise Powerlink, which is now in rate base.","I want take a moment and discuss recent developments in our Wildfire Expense Balancing Account or WEBA proceeding. Last month, the CPUC issued a proposed draft decision denying SDG&E's request for approval to establish a mechanism to record claims paid out in excess of our insurance. They instead suggested we use an alternative mechanism, the Z-factor, for recovery, which is the same mechanism we use for excess wildfire insurance recovery. The assigned commissioner in this case issued an alternative draft decision approving a rate recovery mechanism for fires occurring after July 2010. Similar to the proposed decision, this alternate decision indicated that SDG&E can seek recovery for 2007 wildfire costs through the same Z-factor mechanism.","After reviewing these documents, considering the statutory and regulatory precedents and communicating our concerns to the assigned commissioner through an ex parte meeting, we continue to believe that it is probable that SDG&E will be permitted to recover substantially all costs related to resolving wildfire claims in excess of our insurance through customer rates customer and from amounts recovered from other responsible parties.","As of September 30, 2012, we have recorded regulatory assets arising from wildfire litigation costs pending regulatory approval of $326 million. Of this amount, $292 million is related to CPUC operations, while the remainder is related to FERC operations. In February of this year, FERC approved a settlement allowing for the recovery of wildfire-related costs extended through March of 2011. Each quarter, we must determine the extent to which it is probable that we will recover costs and be able to reasonably estimate the recovery. As we have disclosed previously, any negative assessment of the probability of recovery would likely have a material adverse effect on SDG&E's cash flows and results of operations.","If the commission fails to act, or it acts in a manner which results in a negative assessment of the probability of recovery or in a manner that affects our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of the recovery, we will record a charge against earnings at the time such conclusion is reached. As of September 30, this would have resulted in an after-tax charge to earnings of approximately $175 million. But to be very clear, we will continue to pursue recovery of substantially all of these costs and given statutory and regulatory precedent, believe it is probable we will be successful in those efforts.","Now moving on to Southern California Gas. Third quarter 2012 earnings were $71 million compared to $81 million in the third quarter of 2011. The decrease was primarily attributable to higher depreciation expense, with no increase in authorized revenue due to the delay in our GRC decision. Keep in mind that until we receive final decisions in the SDG&E and SoCalGas general rate cases, we will be recording revenues based upon 2011 authorized levels, plus an adjustment for recovery of incremental wildfire insurance premiums at SDG&E based on recent CPUC decisions for recovery of prior year's increased premiums.","Once the general rate cases are decided, we'll record the cumulative impact of the decision from January 1, 2012. In the event that a final decision is not reached until next year, the cumulative impact from the decision will be recorded in 2013 earnings, not 2012.","Now please go to Slide 5. At our South American Utilities, earnings were $40 million in the third quarter of 2012 compared to $50 million in the year-ago period. Last year's results included a $19 million nonoperating foreign currency gain related to cash held in Chile at that time. Third quarter 2012 earnings for the Sempra Mexico segment were $54 million compared with $47 million in the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to improved operating results across our businesses in Mexico.","Now, please turn to Slide 6. Moving on to Sempra U.S. Gas & Power, the natural gas segment lost $68 million in the third quarter of 2012. Excluding the $60 million charge related to REX, the segment lost $8 million. The loss in the quarter was driven primarily by lower natural gas prices affecting our U.S. LNG business. The decrease from the third quarter of 2011 was mainly attributable to lower natural gas and power prices, including the impact of the exploration of the CDWR contract which, as Debbie mentioned, expired on September 30 of the last year.","As you may recall, Kinder Morgan, a 50% owner of Rex, has agreed to sell its interest in the pipeline to Tallgrass Energy Partners. In the third quarter, as part of this sales process, additional market information became available that required us to reconsider the current value of our investment and as a result, we recorded a $60 million after-tax noncash charge. As I mentioned last quarter, we continue to expect to effectively recover our original investment in REX on a cash basis through a combination of distributions and tax benefits prior to the end of the existing contract period.","When the sale closes, which is expected to happen later this month, we will receive a $41 million cash payment from Kinder Morgan related to a tax make-whole provision in the LLC agreement. This will partially offset the impact of the charge on full year 2012 results by $25 million after-tax, which we expect to be reflected in fourth quarter results, assuming the deal closes.","The Renewables segment generated earnings of $13 million in the third quarter of 2012, up from $1 million in the same period last year. The increase was driven by the addition of solar and wind assets.","I am also pleased to announce that we are finalizing agreements with the Salt River Project, a utility in Arizona, to sell a 625 megawatt block of our 1,250 megawatt Mesquite natural gas fired power plant. We expect to receive a price of approximately $600 per kilowatt, which is in excess of our book value. The transaction is contingent on executing definitive agreements and receiving necessary regulatory approvals, and the deal should close by the first quarter of next year.","And with that, please turn to Slide 7 and I will hand the call back to Debbie.","Debra L. Reed","Thanks, Joe. Last month, Sempra Mexico announced plans to build a 510-mile pipeline project that will transport natural gas from the US-Mexico border south of Tucson, Arizona, to the Mexican state of Sonora to the northern part of the Mexican state of Sinaloa. This project, which should cost roughly $1 billion, will support Mexico's initiative to convert more of its electric generating capacity to natural gas. We expect to fund this project entirely through Sempra International's operating cash flows and Sempra Mexico\u2019s ability to access external capital. The pipeline will be supported by a 25-year take-or-pay contract with the Mexican state-owned electric utility CFE, which will be denominated in U.S. dollars.","We expect the project to come online in 2 phases. The first phase should start operations in the second half of 2014, and we expect the second phase to be online in the second half of 2016. This project represents a great growth opportunity for Sempra International, and will add another asset with attractive returns to our portfolio of operations in Mexico.","Now let me provide you with an update on what we've been doing to move forward on our plans to develop a liquefaction facility at Cameron LNG. Work on the front-end engineering and design of the project is ongoing and should be done by early December. With that process complete, we will be able to file our formal FERC application later that same month. As you'll recall, we made our pre-filing with FERC in April. And that document, which was well over 1,000 pages long and contained detailed project and environmental information, paved the way for our formal FERC application. We've always planned to complete a full environmental impact study or EIS as part of our application to ensure that FERC has comprehensive information upon which to approve our project.","The completion of the engineering work will also allow us to go out for EPC bids in early next year, as planned, and we expect to get the bids back in the second half of 2013.","In September of this year, the Department of Energy announced that it was delaying the release of its study on U.S. natural gas export until the end of 2012. We continue to expect to receive a DOE non-FTA permit late this year or early next year, and we don't anticipate that the delay in the report will have a material impact on the overall time line of the project.","We expect to finalize negotiations on both our tolling agreement and our JV participation agreement by mid-2013, and continue to believe that we will have received all necessary regulatory approvals by the end of next year, at which point, we will begin construction on the facility.","Now let's go to Slide 8. I'd like to update you on some of the key regulatory proceedings at the California Utilities. As we mentioned earlier, we continue to await a final decision on our general rate cases and the current CPC calendar calls for a decision by year-end. However, as Joe mentioned, if a decision is not received by year-end, the retroactive impact of the decision back to January 1, 2012 will be recorded in 2013.","Turning to our cost of capital filings at SDG&E and SoCalGas, evidentiary hearings concluded last month and all briefs have been filed. A draft ALJ decision is expected by November 20, in time for us to receive a final decision as scheduled on December 20. The new rates set in this proceeding will be effective January 1, 2013.","As a reminder, for SDG&E, this cost of capital filing only covers CPUC jurisdictional assets. SDG&E's electric transmission assets are regulated by the FERC, which currently has an authorized return on equity of 11.35%. The currently authorized FERC return on equity is effective until September 2013. Our pipeline safety enhancement plan is proceeding on schedule. We continue to expect the decision on our PSEP in the first half of next year and continue to receive public comments from commissioners that our filing and past performance are viewed positively.","Finally, as Joe mentioned earlier, we did receive both the proposed and alternate decision on our WEBA request and we continue to expect that we will be permitted to recover substantially all these costs either through rate settlements with third parties.","Let's move on to Slide 9. At this point in the year, we would typically have good visibility on our full year results, but due to the delay in our general rate case proceedings at SDG&E and SoCalGas, we are not currently in that position. However, due to the strong performance across our businesses, we currently believe that assuming we receive a final rate case decision in 2012, our full-year earnings will be at or slightly above the high end of our prior guidance range of $4 to $4.30 per share. In the event that a decision on the GRC is delayed into 2013, we believe that full year 2012 earnings will be around the low end of that range. This full year guidance excludes the $239 million year-to-date charges related to REX and a $47 million year-to-date tax benefit related to company-owned life insurance policies, which we discussed on the second quarter call.","Now let's go to the final slide. We are on track to execute on our strategy and meet the goals we laid out for you in March. Through our sale of 1\/2 of Mesquite, we will further reduce our exposure to merchant generation and we will redeploy that capital to areas of the business that fits better with our long-term strategy. Our operational results were solid again this quarter, and our ability to more than offset the loss of the CDWR contract shows the strength of our businesses. We are excited about our future prospects, and I'm pleased that we continue to find excellent growth opportunities as we've done with our new Mexican pipeline project.","With that, I'll stop and open up the call to take any of your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll now take our first question from Faisel Khan with Citi.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just I had a couple of questions, one on LNG and then one on the Mexico pipeline. On the LNG liquefaction proposal, there was recently some statements made by a DOE official stating that he didn't think that the DOE would be granting non-FTA export license until 2014. And then he went on to say that there's really only 2 projects in the queue that are on track to meet all these requirements to get that approval by 2014. Can you just -- can you talk about a little bit like how this differs from -- why this differs from kind of what you're saying and that you expect the DOE will be both be looking at your filing in 2013 and maybe even later this year? Then I have a follow-up on the Mexican pipeline.","Debra L. Reed","Okay, sure. Well, let me address your first question and then we'll go to your second. In terms of some of the comments that have made on non-FTA permit and timing of that, there've been a lot of comments that have made in different presentations that have been made from members of DOE. I would say that one of the comments that was made was an error and actually there was withdrawal of that comment and I think it was related to the comment that you're referring to. What we're hearing is that the report will be out later this year. And that after the report is out, that there would be a comment period of about 60 days. And then after that comment period, the decision would be made regarding non-FTA. So we feel that we will be seeing that sometime in early 2013. Mark, I would ask if you have any additional comments you want to make on that.","Mark A. Snell","Yes, Faisel, it was unfortunate, but the comment that was attributed to a member of the DOE staff was actually not made by a DOE person. And it was made by an outside consultant that was speaking at the same event. And it wasn't really intended to be -- it was more of a reflection on market conditions, not on regulatory permit restrictions. And we really think it really has almost no bearing on our permit or any of the others that are being processed now through the DOE and the FERC. We expect to go forward. Yes, as you know that there has been a delay in the issuance of the DOE report. We don't expect that to affect our project. We're moving forward. We should have our full engineering study done by the end of the year and we expect to file our FERC permit sometime in late December, so with the full engineering study. So we're moving forward on this, and we really haven't -- we really don't expect this to be a big deal.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, great. That makes it clear. My second question is on the pipeline development in Mexico. In the past, you've talked about dividend-ing out cash flows from your South American operations and taking a tax hit up here in the U.S. through repatriation of that capital. With the development of this pipeline, does that change how you're allocating your cash flow from these international assets into this project, or potentially the dividends you're receiving back from those assets in the U.S.?","Debra L. Reed","Well, as you will recall that we were planning, as you mentioned, to repatriate dollars back over the 5-year plan period beginning in late 2013. We're still planning to do that, and the amounts that we were looking at over the 5-year period we believe are going to be consistent with what we showed you in the 5-year plan. So we don't see any real change in that as a result of this pipeline.","Operator","And we'll now go to our next question from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So I just wanted to be clear on the earnings guidance. So presuming you get a decision from the GRC this year, which hopefully you will, your guidance at or above the high end of the range excludes REX, excludes the parent life insurance, but includes the tax benefit that you spoke in the third quarter at the utility operating companies, correct?","Debra L. Reed","That is correct.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, I just wanted to make sure.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Naaz Khumawala with Bank of America.","Naaz Khumawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have a 5-part question on the wildfire case. Sorry, Steve made me say that. So actually, real questions that I have. One is on the REX write-down. Philips also took a write-down this quarter I know you guys know that. Their write-down, I think, was a little bit bigger than yours was. I don't quite understand how these determinations are made and if it\u2019s the same pipe, is it just based on your forward projections on how this is done? And what more could kind of trigger a write-down past this point?","Debra L. Reed","Sure. Let me address it at a high level, and then we'll have Trevor or Joe kind of fill in more detail. What I would say is in going through the process of assessing this, is our best estimate and we consider all factors involved. There is a ROFR and at this quarter, we had information on the ROFR. We also had the opportunity to have discussions with Tallgrass and understand their kind of strategy long-term for the development of the pipeline and what they might do to change the operations, the flows on that pipeline. We did market modeling and had various models that we consider. And we did a full assessment of all of the data that was available to us, and put a significant amount of weight on the ROFR and made our determination of what we felt the value of the line was. In terms of in the future that we have to assess as information becomes available to us if that changes any of our modeling, if it changes our assumptions, if there was a sale by one of the parties, and we had information on the prices that pipeline share would sold at, whether it's a fourth sale, or if it's a really full open market sale. All those are things that are considered in terms of the valuation. And that's the process we went through and concluded that the level of $369 million for the value of the line was an appropriate level.","Trevor I. Mihalik","Naaz, this is Trevor. And just to kind of reiterate a little bit of what Debbie said here, again, we got the ROFR in the third quarter and so that was another market level input that we needed to consider in determining the equity value from an accounting perspective. We weighted that, that input, at about 2\/3 of the value and then we utilized the other inputs that we used in the second quarter as about 1\/3 of the value and that's because the ROFR was more of a level 2 input from an accounting perspective and the other unobservable inputs were level 3. And so in determining that, we came out with a fair value of approximately $369 million for the quarter. And so we disclosed that also fairly significantly in our Q.","Naaz Khumawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And then on the Mexico pipeline, just had a couple of quick questions. One is how much Bcf a day of capacity will flow on that? And then when we think about kind of returns on the pipe, should we weight them more toward international returns or more toward the utility-like returns, if you can give firm perspective on that?","Debra L. Reed","Yes, let me just kind of go through the high-level of the pipeline and the returns. In terms of the pipeline, as I mentioned, it was going to cost about $1 billion. And it's a little over [ph] 500 miles. We are expecting returns on that pipeline that are slightly higher than what the ROEs are that we have authorized by our California utility. So that's the kind of returns that we would expect for this pipeline assets that are contracted with CFE for 25 years. And in terms of the Bcf a day, I'll have Mark talk about that.","Mark A. Snell","The pipeline is in 2 phases. The first phase is a little under 800 Bcf a day, and the second phase is a little over 500 Bcf a day.","Naaz Khumawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, so 1.3 Bcf in total?","Mark A. Snell","Well, no. I wouldn't add it together. It's a little under 800 Bcf coming down to a certain point and then it gets sold [indiscernible].","Naaz Khumawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, I see what you're saying.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Kit Konolige with BGC.","Kit Konolige","So just to follow again on the Mexican pipeline, can you give us an idea then. Sounds like you will finance it at the project level.  And so what -- how should we view how much equity you would have in that business, either parent level cash and net investment or even parent of level equity that would be attributable to that? And then if you could discuss a little bit what under the contract do you get dollars that can be repatriated immediately? Or is this generating more cash that's held overseas?","Debra L. Reed","Kit, Let me just try to give you a very high level and then I'm going to have Joe go into our thinking on the financing. At first, I would say, as you know, that we have a lot of debt capacity still in Mexico. And we've talked about that in prior meetings. And so that we have -- are looking at all the options for the financing of this and what ends up being the best for us in terms of the goals that we have and lower rates and security and all. So let me turn it to Joe and he will go through kind of where we are. Let me just also say that we haven't made a decision. I mean, we just really got the notification that we received these and so we're going to look at all of our options there. So Joe?","Joseph A. Householder","We're very excited to have this new project be part of our growth profile and the sources of the capital that we're going to use to fund it will depend on minimizing our cost, maintaining the strong credit quality we have and enhancing our financial flexibility, and part of that will be looking at the dividend as you mentioned. And as we begin to incur significant expenditures as we start to develop this project, we'll work on finalizing that approach and let you know as we know more about how we're going to do that. But it will produce dollars, but those dollars will be part of the retained earnings and then depending on how we finance it, we'll have to look at what we do to bring that money out. It doesn't immediately just come out. It obviously will be part of our whole Mexico franchise and we'll have to evaluate those dividends. But as Debbie mentioned earlier to Faisel's question, we will be continuing with the program of about $300 million a year into the near-term as we see that go on, unless something happens here in the election and we see a different tax regime.","Kit Konolige","Okay. And on a separate topic then, your guidance for 2012 now, assuming that you did get a decision in the GRC by the end of the year and, therefore, you\u2019d then, I gather, be indicating you\u2019d be at or slightly above the high end of the current range. But that's with what I calculate as something like $0.15 of the tax special item or kind of onetime sort of item. A, is that an accurate way to look at it? B, compared to at the Analyst Day earlier in the year, which segments are stronger and which are weaker than you had thought at that time?","Debra L. Reed","Yes, first, let me say that the special tax item that I think you're referring to, we had the -- we're taking out the COLI, which was not a tax item. We're taking out the REX, and that's what our guidance includes. And then we had the tax item at SDG&E this quarter, which is really not a special tax item. It's an ongoing change in how taxes are calculated for SDG&E. And so we should see that impact continuing into next year, some of it. Part of it, about $0.09 a share this year was retroactive to 2011, and the remainder of it was for 2012 and would continue, subject to no other changes, into 2013. So I just want to clarify that it wasn't a onetime item or the majority of it was not a onetime item.","Kit Konolige","Very good. Okay. And so then segments compared to the Analyst Day, which are doing better than you'd thought and which not as well?","Debra L. Reed","Yes, if you've kind of looked at our segments, SDG&E has had a very, very strong year. And that -- when we get a rate case decision, SoCalGas will have had a very strong year. I mean, we are booking based upon 2011 revenues with no attrition at those 2 utilities. And so -- and we are booking based upon the depreciation and the interest expense and all that we had in 2011, and that, that is much higher this year than it was actually in 2011, but we don't have any additional revenues we're booking for that until we get a rate case decision. So those 2 segments are doing extremely well. Our International segment is doing extremely well, and our gas and power segment is pretty much on track with what we expected.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just another question on Cameron. Assuming you don't get non-FTA approval, what then happens? Do you only do a train or do you do -- you just cancel a project? And then I have a follow-up.","Debra L. Reed","Yes, let me have Mark talk about that. I don't think there's much of a change in our view from what we've talked about before but...","Mark A. Snell","No, I think what we've said publicly is that the projects would be smaller, and that means this probably goes from 3 trains to 1 or 2 trains and we'd have to evaluate that at the time. But let me stress that none of the feedback we've gotten from the FERC or the DOE and none of the -- and the way are rules are written and what we expect to go forward and the rumblings we've heard about the report at DOE, we fully expect to get this thing permitted and moving it forward. So we don't think that that's going to be a -- that we're going to have to deal with that. But if we do, we do think that there's enough of a market with our partners in the FDA-approved countries already that we would just -- we would continue to do a project, but it would be smaller.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of the remaining merchant power assets, are you comfortable with the amount you have there now? Or are you still looking to monetize the remaining megawatts?","Debra L. Reed","Yes, thanks for that question. Just to clarify, our desire is to exit the merchant power business. We don't see that as part of our long-term strategy, and we've been doing that, and we've sold El Dorado. It's a utility we sold half of the plant we co-loaned with Occidental earlier. Now we've sold half of Mesquite to Salt River project and we have about 250 megawatts sold of the remaining block at Mesquite. So we are on the path to exit the merchant generation business. But as you can see from this transaction, that we were able to transact at about $600 per kW. So we're not in a big rush to sell, that we will find buyers that we can work with effectively to get good value for our shareholders from the assets.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And can I ask one more?","Debra L. Reed","Yes.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","In terms of the tax item at SDG&E going forward, is it just going to be a modestly lower tax rate than we've historically seen?","Debra L. Reed","Joe, do you want to comment on that?","Joseph A. Householder","Yes, sure. Essentially, this change in the rule will allow us to continue this going forward, but we'll have to actually do the calculations after we spend the funds and see what the repairs were. And so it's a little bit harder to predict what it will be going forward, but it will continue forward and if we continue to operate in the way we are, you might consider it to be a similar kind of an amount.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just on the tax thing again, what would be the regulatory -- first of all, what was it exactly that happened? I guess, if you could just flesh it out a little bit more in terms of what the IRS has now determined? And I mean, was that unique to you? And also, just what will be the regulatory treatment with respect to your current regulatory proceedings? I mean, will this just be -- so that would go into -- somewhat would be incorporated into rates or how should we think of that?","Debra L. Reed","I'll have Joe respond.","Joseph A. Householder","Hey, Paul. So this has been an issue that's been going on for a long period of time. I mean when I arrived here at the company in 2001, people were looking at this issue and the IRS was auditing a lot of companies, the Big 4 were looking at a bunch of companies, trying to do this thing, and there was no guidance really. And there was a big question about whether certain repairs that were made should be deducted or whether they actually should be capitalized for tax purposes. And so some companies have early adopted this rule, if you will, without any guidance, and they're under audit. So each company will be a little bit different here. They didn't all take exactly the same treatment at the same time. We're following the Safe Harbor guidance that the IRS published late in 2011. We had to do a lot of work to study because we had to go back to the sort of beginning of time of all of these assets and these repairs and roll forward the study. And then we had to also make sure we have the systems to implement that and carry it forward. And the -- when you change tax bases like this, not through depreciation, it is normally a flow-through item for rate-making purposes. And that's why it's flowing to the bottom line here. And so that's how it's treated for rate-making purposes. And those kind of flow-through items we always have to forecast into future rate cases.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. So would it be captured in these rate cases that you're currently dealing with?","Joseph A. Householder","No.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then just a few quick housekeeping items. There's a U.S. Treasury grant receivable of about $181 million I see. And I was wondering, does that impact earnings? And when would we see it impact earnings?","Debra L. Reed","Joe?","Joseph A. Householder","Yes, that receivable, it doesn't impact earnings. It is a reduction of the basis of the assets. So when we get the receivable, it just reduces the basis of the assets that you're putting into service. And we're using that grant rather than the ITC. It's more efficient for us. And we expect to get that in the early part of the year. So the solar -- I'm sorry, some of the solar assets.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, I got you. And then with the sundry assets, I've noticed that they've been increasing over -- really actually since the beginning -- since the end of 2010 and I just was wondering, the latest it seems to be $55 million. How should we think about that in terms of does it have an earnings impact and just sort of what's driving that?","Joseph A. Householder","Sundry assets, the increase from the end of the year until now is a couple of different things but one of the things is we have a portfolio of assets that are used to cover our various executive plans and other things that's in a rabbi trust. And those went up in value. So those actually do go to earnings. Some of the other changes where unamortized debt issuance cost and things like that but mostly the change was the rabbi trust going up in value.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Is that excluded -- is that part of the COLI thing or -- I mean, was that in earnings [indiscernible].","Joseph A. Householder","Yes, it actually -- some of those assets are in the COLI, some of them aren't, but it's to support our various deferred comp and other benefits.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","So there's like a $55 million benefit in that, is that how to think about it in this quarter?","Joseph A. Householder","That one was not much. I'll see if Trevor has the actual number for the rabbi trust. In the quarter, again, there was about $15 million.","Trevor I. Mihalik","$17 million.","Joseph A. Householder","$17 million.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, and then just finally, we have -- it's election day today, and I was wondering -- a real question here, perhaps not, but any thoughts about how either whoever wins the presidential election might impact you guys at all, if at all?","Debra L. Reed","I would just say that our history has been able to be able to work under any administration, and that I don't think either administration -- or either candidate has been very, very clear on their energy policies as part of the debate. So whoever gets elected that's one thing we'll work on with them from the very beginning of them taking office or continuing. But I think it's really not that big of an issue for us that both are very favorable on natural gas infrastructure and have made public comments to that degree. And so I think that we feel that we can work under any administration and look forward to doing that.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ashar Khan with Visium.","Ashar Khan","Sorry I joined late. Debbie, any -- I mean, anyway where you can handicap, I guess, you got another 2 weeks whether we get the rate cases here or no? Any kind of feedback or anything?","Debra L. Reed","It's very difficult for us to determine what's going to happen in the next. Actually we could theoretically get it through the end of November a proposed decision and they could call a special meeting in December and vote it out. They haven't typically done that, so we're looking at November 20th as kind of being the date. And if we don't see a proposed decision by November 20th, we would anticipate it to be next year. And it's unfortunate that the commission has just had a lot of issues on their plate, a lot driven by San Bruno, which has kind of caused their normal schedule to lapse a bit. And it's really hard for us to predict what is going to be the outcome. That's why we wanted to give you a heads up and let you know how it would be accounted for accounting purposes. We would get our dollars retroactively, but in one case it would come into 2012 earnings and in another case it will come into 2013 earnings, which theoretically shouldn't really make much difference, but...","Ashar Khan","Okay. So just to kind of like...","Debra L. Reed","And I would just add that just to be clear, we did not have those earnings in our 2013 guidance so...","Ashar Khan","Yes, that's what I was going to say is that if the case goes into 2013, right, then the 2013, the variance on the guidance is about $0.30. So that would mean 2013 earnings would be higher by $0.13 -- $0.30 from what you had projected at the Analyst Meeting, am I thinking through that correctly?","Debra L. Reed","I would say we're not going to give any information on guidance. I just wanted you to understand that we had assumed we will get the rate case in 2012 when we gave our guidance. And I'm not going to tell you what's going to happen in 2013. We will do that at the Analyst Meeting as we always do and typically we also on our fourth quarter call give you some indication. So we'll do that at that time and then we'll have a better picture on what the actual rate case outcome is at that time.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Mark Barnett with Morningstar.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I guess just a quick question on the pipeline projects in Mexico. You've obviously hit a lot of the details on the current project that you've announced, but you said it's more of kind of a $2 billion total opportunity and that there might be some more beyond the announced project. And I was wondering, are all bids in for that remaining? And kind of how do you feel about your prospects for the remaining maybe $1 billion or so of investment?","Debra L. Reed","Yes. We've looked thoroughly. There were different segments that were biddable, 4 segments that were biddable and we elected to only bid on 2 of those and we got the 2 that we bid on. So as far as we're concerned for this, the full length of the pipeline, we got the 2 segments that we had bid on. We received the go ahead on those.","Unknown Executive","And that's $1 billion. Just $1 billion.","Debra L. Reed","And that's $1 billion, yes.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","So there are no other projects that could be announced later on from this?","Debra L. Reed","Not from this solicitation, but obviously Mexico is doing so much to change from an oil-based economy to a natural gas-based economy, so it's a great growth area for us. But in this solicitation, again, there will be no more.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And one just minor thing. I missed your comment on the mitigation payment from Kinder and maybe around some of the timing and maybe an earnings impact from that?","Debra L. Reed","As Joe mentioned, that there was a $41 million payment that we would receive in fourth quarter most likely assuming that the deal closes. And that would have an earnings impact that when we took out the REX amount and kind of looking at our guidance, we take out both the impact of that and we take out the write-off for that. So as we're giving you guidance of the $4 to $4.30 range and where we would be depending on the GRC, we've taken into account the potential of that payment. And not including it in the guidance estimates.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Winfried Fruehauf with Winfried Fruehauf Consulting Ltd.","Winfried Fruehauf","I have a question on the accounting treatment of repairs on the IFRS.  Does it make a difference if the repair not only restores the asset to the pre-repair value, but results in a betterment; either in terms of life extension or higher quality, higher capacity or not?","Debra L. Reed","I'm not sure that I understood your question clearly. It was a little muddled here. But I think it had to do with the IFRS and...","Unknown Executive","The IRS treatment of this. And really under the Safe Harbor, it just really gives guidance as to what amount of the line can actually be subject to capitalization or what amount of the line is subject to really expense based on the repair. And so that's what really the IRS is giving guidance on is even though that the repairs may not add longevity to the line or increase the capacity of the line, you're still allowed to capitalize a certain amount of the repairs and that's what this Safe Harbor ruling does, it allows you to capitalize some of the amount that we historically would have expensed.","Joseph A. Householder","Winfried, this is Joe. I understand what you're saying and those betterments and all those rules are kind of the old way that the IRS looked at these sort of things. What they've done with these rules is they've tried to define what a unit of property is, so they're looking at a certain number of feet or miles of pipe or in this case, a transmission line or distribution line. And if you only repaired a certain amount of that, and it's less than the whole unit, then you get to expense that as a repair rather than capitalize it. And so that's what this has to do with and it's kind of getting away from a little bit betterment language that you're referring to.","Winfried Fruehauf","Okay, that's helpful. The other question I have is on the largess at natural gas resulting from lower natural gas prices which impacts your LNG business, is there a metric that would allow one to determine the impact for, say, a $0.10 up or down change in natural gas prices, the impact on LNG?","Debra L. Reed","Yes, we generally use for the LNG business a rule of thumb of $13 million per dollar change in gas prices, is what we traditionally use as a rule of thumb for that. And that applies to the LNG business. There's also some variability in some of other businesses, but those businesses depend on what our hedge positions are. I know they are not so easily done by a rule of thumb, but for LNG about $13 million per dollar change.","Mark A. Snell","And SoCal board of price was down $0.66 from what it was at the end of last year and that's what's causing this $8 billion or $9 million effect.","Debra L. Reed","I'll remind you though that for our utility businesses, we are not at risk for any of the commodity changes so gas price impacts are really in our U.S. gas business and our International for the LNG so.","Winfried Fruehauf","And this $13 million, is it pretax or after-tax?","Debra L. Reed","Pre-tax.","Unknown Executive","After-tax.","Debra L. Reed","After-tax.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go now to our next question from Vedula Marti with CDP Capital.","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","And it appears there are no further questions at this time. Ms. Reed, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Debra L. Reed","Well, I again want to thank you all for joining us this morning.

Good morning, and welcome to Sempra Energy\u2019s first quarter 2018 financial presentation. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section.","Here in San Diego are several members of our management team including Jeff Martin, Chief Executive Officer; Joe Householder, President and Chief Operating Officer, Trevor Mihalik, Chief Financial Officer, Dennis Arriola, Chief Strategy Officer and Executive Vice President of External Affairs and South America; Martha Wyrsch, General Counsel; Peter Wall, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller, Allen Nye, Chief Executive Officer of Oncor.","Before starting, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that we\u2019ll be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the Company\u2019s most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC.","It\u2019s important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis, and that we\u2019ll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and the Table A in our first quarter 2018 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. I\u2019d also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, May 7, 2018, and the Company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.","With that, please turn to slide four, and let me hand the call over to Jeff Martin.","Jeff Martin","Thanks, Faisel and welcome to the team. As much as we enjoyed filling your questions in the past, it\u2019s nice to have you on this side of the call today. I\u2019ll start by thanking Debbie Reed and acknowledging the pivotal role she\u2019s played in Sempra\u2019s growth and success. This Company clearly would not be in a position it\u2019s in today without her leadership and vision. Our succession plan was designed to ensure continuity of leadership, and the recent executive appointments demonstrate our commitment to continue our focus on delivering long-term value creation for our shareholders. I\u2019d also like to welcome everyone into their new roles as well as the Oncor team and to thank Allen Nye for joining us today.","We were just in Dallas a few weeks ago meeting with our top 200 leaders and could not be more excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. Oncor\u2019s strong, pure play electric T&D business solidifies our footprint in the Gulf region and just as importantly, improves the scale and diversity of our domestic utility earnings. With these changes, I\u2019d like to reiterate that Sempra\u2019s value proposition still holds true. Our team remains focused on pursuing strong growth with the utility like risk profile. We remain committed to maximizing shareholder returns through strategic, disciplined investments, and growing dividends. Lastly, we\u2019re reaffirming our 2018 adjusted EPS guidance of $5.30 to $5.80 per share. In doing so, it\u2019s also important to point out that we\u2019re tracking two non-cash items that could impact this guidance range later in the year. Trevor will cover those later in the call.","Please turn to the next slide. As we highlighted on the fourth quarter call, we have four near-term priorities. First delivering on our growth strategy; second, executing on our California regulatory goals; third, ensuring that all three trains at Cameron produce LNG in 2019; and fourth, continuing to analyze opportunities to strengthen our balance sheet to support future growth, which we\u2019ll address in greater detail at our upcoming analyst conference. Let me start first with growth.","We have improved visibility into our long-term growth strategy with the closing of Oncor, almost one month earlier than planned. Oncor\u2019s a substantial addition to our business mix and creates a significant platform for us. We\u2019re expecting our portion of Oncor earnings for the partial year of 2018 to be in the range of $320 million to $360 million. Also, you\u2019ll recall that to support that transaction, we executed on a $9.6 billion financing plan. The $5 billion of debt that we raised was approximately five times oversubscribed and the $4.6 billion of equity and equity linked offerings were well over three times oversubscribed. Additionally, it\u2019s worth noting that over 80% of our equity offerings were allocated to existing shareholders.","Second, we\u2019re moving forward with our California regulatory priorities. In April, our California utilities submitted updated rate case testimony that includes projected impacts from tax reform. We\u2019re pleased to say that this will benefit our customers through lower projected builds at SoCalGas and through increased wildfire mitigation investments at SDG&E with no expected impacts to bills. Additionally, ORA recently submitted their testimony which keeps the process moving forward. We expect TURN and other interveners\u2019 testimony will be submitted shortly. We\u2019re focused on advancing these rate cases as they will help our California utilities continue to provide safe and reliable energy to the communities they serve.","With regard to protections for wildfire risk, we along with other stakeholders continue to execute a three-part strategy to help protect our customers, and just as importantly, help ensure the long-term health of our California utilities. In fact, we\u2019ve seen good progress over the last several months. First, together with others, we\u2019ve helped lead an education campaign with the Governor\u2019s Office, Legislature and Public Utilities Commission. In mid March, the Governor\u2019s Office legislative leaders issued a statement recognizing the need to sign a comprehensive solution to the increased threat from natural disasters and climate change, which includes updating liability rules and regulations around inverse condemnation, recognizing the need to build and operate infrastructure to increase resiliency, examine availability of insurance in areas at risk from wildfires, and needing to modernize utility practice and procedures around fire prevention.","Second, there have been positive developments on the legislative front with several bills being introduced. Two notable concepts were introduced in these bills. The first of which was the need to adopt standards across the state to reduce wildfire risk; and second, the need to establish objective and measurable criteria that can form a part of a new prudent manager standard for utilities going forward. While the current text of the bills don\u2019t specifically address inverse condemnation, we and other stakeholders are also looking to separately address this issue in Sacramento.","Third, we are making great progress with Cameron trains one through three. To be clear, this is one of our top priorities. We continue to expect all three trains to be producing LNG in 2019. Recall, at the end of last year, we reached a settlement agreement with our contractor to resolve all claims. This was important because it better aligned the parties\u2019 interest with the goal of having all three trains producing LNG in 2019. We continue to believe this agreement puts both the contractor and Sempra in a stronger position to meet the current schedule. We are also pleased with the recent shareholder approval to combine McDermott and CB&I, which we believe improves our contractor\u2019s overall delivery capabilities and financial strength.","And finally, on the growth front, IEnova recently announced award of $130 million liquid fuels project with two strong multinational counterparties. The project has 15-year U.S. dollar denominated contracts for 100% of its capacity. It also capitalizes on the continued build-out of infrastructure related to Mexico\u2019s energy reform by increasing fuel supply capacity in Mexico. In turn, this further helps Mexico\u2019s energy mix become more reliable and gives consumers more fuel choices.","Please turn to the next slide where Trevor will walk us through the quarterly results. Trevor?","Trevor Mihalik","Thanks, Jeff. Earlier this morning, we reported first quarter earnings of $347 million or $1.33 per share. This compares to first quarter 2017 earnings of $441 million or $1.75 per share. On an adjusted basis, we reported earnings of $372 million or $1.43 per share. This compares to first quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $438 million or 1.74 per share.","Let\u2019s turn to the next slide where I\u2019ll discuss the key drivers impacting the quarterly results. I\u2019d like to start off by highlighting our operational performance, which included $22 million of higher earnings at SoCalGas, primarily due to the effect of a lower income tax rate in 2018 on the higher margin of the first quarter, $15 million of equity earnings from our investment in Oncor, beginning March 9th and $8 million of higher pipeline earnings, primarily attributable to assets placed in service in the second quarter of \u201817 in Mexico.","Our adjusted quarter results were also impacted by the following, $94 million of higher losses at parent, which include higher net interest expense and preferred dividends and $23 million of lower earnings due to the recognition of AFUDC in the first quarter of \u201817 at Mexico. This was partially offset by $14 million of higher earnings due to the application of revised seasonality in 2018 at SDG&E. I would note however that this does not impact their full-year results.","Now, let me talk about two non-cash items that we are tracking that could impact our full-year adjusted earnings guidance, which Jeff briefly mentioned. First, we you\u2019ll recall that our primary foreign exchange-related exposures in Mexico are related to the taxes on our U.S. dollar denominated debt and deferred tax balances. Consistent with prior years, we continue to hedge the monitory positions so our upside and downsides are limited with respect to large currency movements. Related to this, we\u2019ve updated our 2018 FX rules of thumb. You can find these rules of thumb in the appendix. Importantly, we\u2019re closely monitoring the currency movements but it\u2019s still fairly early in the year.","Second, we\u2019re continuing to evaluate tax reform and its impact. While the territorial tax system increased the value of our international businesses, we believe the component of it, the global intangible low tax income is impacting us as an unintended consequence of tax reform. A law was intended to prevent transfers of intangible assets to low tax jurisdictions, which clearly is not our case. This quarter, the tax was an $8 million expense with an estimated full-year impact of approximately $24 million. It could also reduce our earnings in future years by similar amounts but declining over time. We\u2019re hopeful that this issue will be fixed with updated regulations or legislation before the end of the year. But until this happens, we\u2019re recording the tax as part of our earnings.","Now, please turn to the next slide while I hand it back over to Jeff.","Jeff Martin","Thanks, Trevor. We\u2019re excited to be hosting our analyst conference next month in New York where we\u2019ll be providing important updates regarding our future business plans. We\u2019ll review our overall strategy and vision, updates on each business segment and our overall capital and financing plan including how we expect to recycle capital. We\u2019ve spoken to many of you and consistent with the feedback we\u2019ve received, will be updating our approach to guidance by laying out our earnings expectations for the next three years. In doing so, our goal of this year\u2019s conference is to provide a detailed view of how we plan to create shareholder value well into the future. We hope you will be able to join us in New York. The date of our conference is June 28.","And with that, we\u2019ll conclude our prepared comments and stop, to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will hear first from Julien Dumoulin-Smith. Go ahead, please.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hi. Good morning. Congratulations. So, a couple of quick questions here. Can you elaborate a little bit further on the pace of sensitivity and just how you think about your set of hedges to the extent at which that they might not necessarily be linear with the previous disclosures? And how to think about the sensitivity impact you\u2019ve just announced just to get that out of the way for \u201818 but more importantly beyond?","Jeff Martin","You\u2019ll recall that we tend to focus on two different baskets, Julien, when we talk about FX as we\u2019ve got the deferred tax assets and into the future we also kind of hedge as we\u2019ve talked about in the past our current monetary liabilities. So, for the quarter, we had FX and inflation impacts of roughly negative $30 million. The two key takeaways I\u2019d give you is you got to remember that IEnova and all those projects are U.S. dollar denominated. So, that impacts how we account for those cash flows. And you can see this in table F. If you look at table F, it gives you a better sense of underlying economics of the IEnova. And the second point to reiterate is it\u2019s a non-cash impact. So, what we do is each year we use some form of costless collar, and that reflects how we hedge our current monetary liabilities.","And then, as you think about future years, so the second part of your question, that gets reset every year. So, as you go into next year, those hedges roll off and we hedge the forward year. So, from a guidance standpoint, we don\u2019t think about the future any differently because of results in Q1.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Perhaps just a follow up on that. Obviously, over the last few days, we got some developments in SoCal around some gas pipeline effort. Can you talk about some of the mitigating factors there on that specific project more broadly? And also just maybe, to hit the gas demand question for SoCal, obviously we\u2019ve seen a number of developments throughout thermal projects more broadly. How do you think about gas demand and more importantly gas infrastructure demand in light of the latest pipeline developments with PD?","Jeff Martin","I think you are referring to our pipeline safety and reliability project. And for some context, Julien, this is part of the overall PSEP program that the Commission kicked off back in 2011 where they asked all of the natural gas transmission operators to ensure that these are either pressure tested or replaced pipelines. Typically, these are pipes that are old or vintage that had not been previously tested. And the pipelining question is referred to as we refer to as line 1600. This is one of two lines bring gas north to south into San Diego. It is either old or vintage. And what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve filed for that project really under the PSEP program with a view toward replacing the larger diameter pipe. And in this proposed decision, what it appears is they\u2019re focused on that we -- they prefer that we either pressure test it or rescission portions of it, replace portions of that pipe. I think at this point in the process, it\u2019s relatively early. But our goal is just to make sure we work with Commission and staff and stakeholders really around one view, which is to make sure the pipe is safe. So, that\u2019s kind of our approach going forward. And I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll read into it in terms of how we think about gas demand going in the future. We have got over 90% of the state\u2019s heating and cooking that\u2019s done with natural gas. So, this is more about a safety issue, making sure that we are being responsive to the 2011 order from the Commission.","Operator","And now, we will take a question from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon","Just to confirm what you said earlier that these impacts -- these currency impacts are noncash. So, the ongoing impact on the underlying economic value of the business is really not material, [multiple speakers] right?","Jeff Martin","That\u2019s correct.","Greg Gordon","And then, what form might we -- in order to look forward, so we understand the implications of the potential for clarification on this tax issue? Is that something that the treasury could fix through issuing a rulemaking? Does there have to be a formal legislative patch? Could it be one or the other? Can you explain to us what the paths for clarification on that issue are?","Jeff Martin","I\u2019ll touch and then I\u2019ll pass to Trevor to provide additional clarification. But, this is one of these things that inadvertently came up as part of the overall tax reform package. And the way the calculation works is it picks up companies like ours that actually own controlling interests in foreign jurisdictions. And so, we\u2019re planning on working with treasury to get some technical corrections. But Trevor, you might want to provide additional color for Greg.","Trevor Mihalik","So, yes, we are looking at trying to see if treasury would be willing to work with the companies to get a technical correction on this. Right now treasury is working through it. But if you take it as the black letter of the law, treasury is saying the way the law reads it\u2019s inadvertently and they acknowledge that it\u2019s inadvertently picking up companies. So, we\u2019re looking at a path either through a technical correction or through some kind of legislative fix on this.","Greg Gordon","Thank you. Joe, if you don\u2019t mind, could you give us an update on how things are going vis-\u00e0-vis productivity at the Cameron site? There has been some concern that A, at a high level, the unsolicited bid for McDermott could cause some inadvertent risk to your revised transaction, to the revised structure of the deal. And then two, away from your project that CBI recently announced the delay in another project which caused people to then move back and start worrying about Cameron. So, can you give some -- to the extent you can give us some of comfort or color around those things that would be helpful.","Joe Householder","Yes. I was just at the site two weeks ago. And I was there and we had our Cameron LNG board meeting at the site. And we toured the site and I can tell you, it was pretty impressive. There was substantial progress their compared with the last time that I had visited with the other board members from Japan and from France. And we had a very good meeting. We took a long tour. The substantial work going, CB&I and Chiyoda still maintain that they are on the path to get us LNG from all three trains in 2019. It\u2019s looking very good. I was very impressed with the productivity I saw with the number of people there with what they were doing. So that was all going well.","As to your question about the CBI McDermott merger, yes that was two weeks ago a little bit of a scare, but both companies voted to approve the merger. So that\u2019s moving ahead and supposed to close on the 10th. So, we expect that is moving ahead. Certainly, when we saw the Subsea offer to McDermott, we all started looking at that and what would it do. But frankly things are going well at the site. So, we were prepared to deal with that, should it have gone that direction. But, I\u2019m happy to say that it\u2019s moving down on the right path.","Greg Gordon","And then, the Freeport delay, is there any reason for us to make a read through there as to the ability of your -- the JV to complete the project on the current schedule?","Joe Householder","Thanks. Look, I\u2019m not going to talk about the Freeport project, but I don\u2019t think there is any read through there. They reported that I can say through the scope, but that wasn\u2019t little bit surprising. A lot of it I think had to do with the floods that they had in Houston which has more impact on them than it had on us.","Operator","And now, we will hear from Ryan Levine with Citi.","Ryan Levine","The recent movement in Permian gas differentials and recent competitor pipeline announcement push out the time line to develop P2K, or is everything moving unchanged?","Jeff Martin","Thanks for that question, Ryan. And congratulations on your promotion. That\u2019s an important project for us. We are monitoring that situation. At this point, we don\u2019t have an update on P2K other than what we\u2019ve said publicly in the past.","Ryan Levine","And then, could you frame the incremental investment opportunity regarding SDG&E\u2019s wildfire, potential wildfire mitigation program?","Jeff Martin","One of the interesting things about that program is we\u2019ve started back in 2007, I think our experience back then has really informed our approach hardening the system, improving our standard operating procedures around wildfire and climate change risk, including I think just probably over half decade ago, actually starting an active program of deenergizing the circuits on a case-by-case basis when we are in extreme weather, and we thought that safety was in doubt. And in terms of the capital programs, the biggest one we have going forward right now is obviously the Cleveland National Forest program that\u2019s between $600 million and $700 million capital project. And what it\u2019s doing Ryan is it\u2019s upgrading over 80% of our 69 kV and above circuits in the backcountry, most of which are in the most dangerous wind condition areas. And moving that from wood to steel poles and they are using wider conductors or spreads, but they will be continuing to assess ways to take and deploy capital, make the system more safe.","Ryan Levine","And then, last question for me, what\u2019s the current outlook for ICA\u2019s midscale projects and what size trains are currently being contemplated?","Jeff Martin","One of the things we are looking forward to doing at the analyst conference is providing full update on each of our development projects. Obviously, over the last three to four years, we have been relatively bullish on that 2023 to 2025 window. So, that\u2019s something we are looking forward to providing updates on. But, Joe, do you want to give a quick update on kind of how you think about the size and the midscale versus the full scale project down in Baja?","Joe Householder","We have the project, as I mentioned before, fully permitted for the large scale facility at this point in time. And we are getting a lot of interest, as I\u2019ve mentioned in the midscale facility that could be done more quickly and get to market sooner. So, we are talking to potential customers on that but also continuing to talk to customers about the large-scale. And we will see through this year how we think about which way to go there, and the site and accommodate both. But, we currently are permitted for the large one we are seeking potentially to have a carve-out of some of that permit for the midscale. So, we could move forward with that more quickly. And that\u2019s what we choose to do. But there is a lot of customer interest for getting the LNG earlier in the cycle and that\u2019s what we are focused on today.","Operator","And our next question will come from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides","I\u2019m looking at slide -- and could you remind me the rate base -- the weighted average rate base on an apples-to-apples comparison, so excluding FERC assets for San Diego Gas and Electric? What that was in 2017, the California rate base for 2017 for SDG&E and SoCalGas?","Jeff Martin","We will track that down for you on the call. I\u2019ll give you one feedback is in the revised GRC filing, which we noted, just in terms of eliminating the bonus depreciation for 2019 adds $400 million of rate base in 2019 going forward. And I\u2019ll pass the comparison to Trevor and you can give that feedback to him, Trevor.","Trevor Mihalik","Sure. Good morning, Michael. The rate base for SDG&E at the end of the year for CPUC was about 5.4 billion and for SoCal it was about 5.9 billion. And roughly that\u2019s pretty close to where it is today. They\u2019re roughly equal.","Michael Lapides","Got it. And could you just remind us, that\u2019s a pretty big growth rate year-over-year of I think about ending 2017 versus weighted average 2019. If I think about that as a compound growth rate, that\u2019s a pretty big uptick and then I assume it\u2019s kind of pretty similar as you filed going out into \u201820 and \u201821. What are the biggest drivers of that?","Jeff Martin","I think if you think back over our analyst conference, year-over-year we\u2019ve always been messaging, Michael, around kind of a five year capital deployment at both utilities of around 12 billion and that backs into roughly 1.2 billion a year per utility. And that will vary depending upon the year and the cycle. But most of SDG&E\u2019s investments have come around modernizing its distribution transmission grid. A lot of this has to do with improvement to substations, line extensions, adding to new growth. And some of the capital programs we\u2019ve put in place at the time and honestly, even utility like I referenced to Cleveland National Forest project is a big driver currently. The two SDG&E I\u2019d refer to would be a Cleveland National Forest project and the SOCR project, which is the Southern Orange County Reliability project which was an important upgrade for us. And then at SoCalGas, most of this has been driven by their tip and dip programs as well as some of their PSEP work. ","Michael Lapides","Got it. And how -- in the ORA testimony, it seems there\u2019s multiple things that one could take as a positive. Just curious, how are you looking at the potential for your even settling a rate case? I know, it\u2019s been a long time since we\u2019ve seen a California utility actually settle one. But, you never say never.","Jeff Martin","Well I would start with saying, it\u2019s early in the process and it\u2019s probably too early to read too much into the ORA filing. Two things, I thought that we were somewhat optimistic about which was their recognition of the need, Michael, for a four-year rate case cycle. I think, probably over time, this is probably the path I think California is heading towards. And secondly, they also picked up our request to have two way balancing for wildfire insurance. But to the larger issue is, this is obviously an important rate case for us. It\u2019s one that we\u2019re following closely. You\u2019ll remember being premised around the ramp filing. So, this is really important that we\u2019re kind of trading hierarchy of capital requests regarding what we think is most important from a safety standpoint. And I\u2019ll pass it to Joe to provide some more color.","Joe Householder","Thanks, Jeff. I just wanted to go to your question about settlement. Our history has been that we seek to find common ground with the other parties and believe settlements are efficient and effective for everybody. So, we\u2019d continue to certainly work with the parties towards that end. We think that the other interveners are filing testimony next week. And so, expect for our last cycle when the Commission just wasn\u2019t in a position to move forward on that, we\u2019ve always worked to settle our cases.","Michael Lapides","Got it. One last one, guys, I apologize for monopolizing some of the time. What significant capital investment opportunities that either of the two utilities -- and that aren\u2019t necessarily approved yet today are outside of the TRC filing, meaning might be done in separate side dockets at the CPUC or might be FERC related assets?","Jeff Martin","Look, I think probably the best place for us to address that is probably at the analyst conference. But, one of them we talked about it earlier was the PSRP project which is a Pipeline Safety and Reliability Project that\u2019s between 600 million and 700 million. That\u2019s the one that we got a PD on where they recommended a different solution. Also, when it came up in the ORA filing is issue of OMEC. You may recall there was kind of the put call feature with Calpine relating to the their Otay Mesa. That\u2019s something that could come into our plan depending upon the outcome of that. But, you are right, there will be filings outside of the rate case. Cleveland National Forest was an example. But, in terms of forward-looking projects, those are ones we\u2019ll try to address for you later in June.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thank you, Jeff. Much appreciated, guys.","Joe Householder","Just one point of clarification with regards to the GRC, we have received ORA, we just haven\u2019t received TURN. We expect to receive TURN later this month.","Operator","Now, we will move to a question from Paul Patterson Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson","Just to circle back on the tax thing. Do you guys have intangibles overseas? And is there transfer pricing or transactions occurring or is it just -- could you just elaborate a little more?","Jeff Martin","Yes, Pau. This is the global intangible tax. We don\u2019t really have any intangibles overseas. This thing was designed to target folks that were moving intangible earnings from one jurisdiction to a lower tax jurisdiction. We are not involved in anything like that. We just got controlling interest in foreign companies. And this has inadvertently picked us up. And by the way, it\u2019s hitting other industries beside the utility industry. And that\u2019s why we just want to make sure we get the technical correction as soon as we can.","Joe Householder","Hey, Paul. This is Joe. The other interesting thing is now with tax reform, the U.S. has the lowest tax rate of the countries we are in, so it will make no sense for us to transferring it. But, Jeff is right. I mean, we have intangible technology, but we are not transferring it from one company or one country to another.","Paul Patterson","And then, just on the -- it sounds like, if I heard you correctly, the inverse condemnation issue, you plan to have separate legislation in Sacramento. Is that correct? And just if you could elaborate a little bit more on the timing or how you thought that might show up?","Jeff Martin","Paul, we\u2019ve got kind of this three-tiered approach, so obviously we are going to exhaust our regulatory remedies of the commission related to our WEMA, [ph] request for rehearing. We are also working with stakeholders up and down the states to try to find a legislative solution. I think you saw in our prepared remarks, there\u2019s been several different bills have come forward, some of which are constructive and some of which are less constructive. But in terms of whether we expect legislation this year and next year, our goal to work with all the parties and states to see if we can get something done this year that remains our goal.","Paul Patterson","And do you think inverse condemnation be part of these bills or do you think it will be separate bills? I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m little bit confused by the statement.","Jeff Martin","The bills have come forward today have not fully addressed inverse condemnation. So, we are hoping to have a bill that comprehensively addresses that. But, I think what\u2019s interesting is, the dialogue across the state now is really starting to recognize that this is not an industrial and utility issue. This is the state of California issue. This has to do with residential owners and whether they can procure insurance. It impacts municipal utilities and impacts insurance companies, the trade unions are involved. So, this is a large issue across the state. And I think what we\u2019re looking for is a bill that comprehensively addresses all the impacts from land use management to liability rules impacting utilities. ","Operator","Next, we will hear from Lasan Johong Auvila Research Consulting.","Lasan Johong","Couple of things. First of all, you had a month and a half to look under the kimono at Oncor. Any surprises, good or bad, or any changes, CapEx changing at Oncor?","Jeff Martin","We\u2019re pleased to have Allen Nye, their CEO join us today on the call, Lasan. And as I indicated above, I attended my first Board meeting there with Debbie who is also on the Board with me. We\u2019ve gone out there and met with their top 200 leadership group. I think, one of the things that\u2019s most exciting is from a cultural standpoint in terms of how they lead that Company, their priorities, their commitment to using capital to lower the cost of Texas consumers is very much in line with how we do business. So, I think just from a starting point, the culture and the fit is going very, very well. And I thought, I might just past it to Allen to talk about anything that he\u2019s seen on the horizon. He is excited about in terms of his capital plan and some of their priorities.","Allen Nye","Yes. Thanks, Jeff. And I couldn\u2019t agree more, after all we\u2019ve been through, we\u2019re thrilled to be here. We agree with you, it couldn\u2019t have gone any better so far. So, thanks for that. With regards to capital, we already have a robust $8.4 billion capital plan over the next five years. We\u2019re in a state that\u2019s growing. There is good growth in our state. We are seeing residential premise growth at 2% and consumption growth around 1.5%, consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in the last few years. So, there is good growth. We\u2019re going through the planning process with our Board and we\u2019ll look at a capital plan again in October. That\u2019s kind of where we are right now and again we\u2019re really glad to be here.","Lasan Johong","Jeff, until Oncor acquisition, most people looked at Sempra as gassy company. Obviously acquisition of Oncor has just dramatically changed the make-up of Sempra. Going forward, do you care whether it\u2019s an -- Sempra is more electric or more gas or do you want to maintain an even 50-50 kind of split or does it matter at all to Sempra and its shareholders?","Jeff Martin","Lasan, it\u2019s a great question. And given your coverage over the last 10 years, you\u2019ll recall in the middle part of last decade, we had a very large commodity business. We had a an IPP fleet in the west that was close to 3,000 megawatts. I think what you\u2019ve seen us do really is pivot over the last five to seven years to be more of an infrastructure company. So, we\u2019ve moved away from all of our combined cycle plants. I think we\u2019ve got one last plant down in Mexicali that we got held for sale. We obviously disposed off our commodity business. And look, we certainly think the whole theme of electrification is a hard trend. We think that natural gas has an important role to play in terms of supporting move toward cleaner energy. But, there is no question that our company is focused on businesses just like Oncor where we can participate more in the infrastructure side of our business and then from a procurement and generation of electricity.","Lasan Johong","So, you don\u2019t care whether that\u2019s from gas or from electric?","Jeff Martin","No, we don\u2019t care necessarily. But I certainly think we have growing interest in a lot of the very positive trends that are taking place around batteries, renewable energy, electrification, transmission and distribution, particularly Lasan, in growing markets like Texas which is a core opportunity for us.","Lasan Johong","Last question for Joe, I guess. You talked about the need for more demand to be filled out in Asia. Does that mean that Sempra is likely to try and do a midscale LNG facility first and then build a larger second phase or would you be doing at -- would you be looking at two smaller midscale opportunities back to back?","Joe Householder","Thanks for that question because it is an emphasis. LNG is definitely a part of our strategy and so gas is important to us. And with respect to ICA, we haven\u2019t made a firm decision yet about how we are going and we are going to use the market to tell us a little bit about what direction to go here. There is tremendous interest in that facility because the buyers do not have to take LNG through the Panama Canal. And so they really would like to see if it\u2019s already built there. And I think the market is going to tell us the right answer. I think we would not be likely at all to build two midscale facilities. If we go to large scale facility we will do that and we could still build a midscale on top of that. If we build the midscale first, we can still go with the large one. There wouldn\u2019t be a circumstance probably where we would do two midscale facilities. They are going be in two different locations on the site.","Operator","And next Ashar Khan with Visium. Go ahead please.","Ashar Khan","Jeff, can I just ask, so I don\u2019t get this wrong because there is a lot of confusion. So, as you correctly pointed out that the currency translation is a noneconomic number for 2018. And as you said in your presentation that you will be providing us with forecast for 2018 and \u201819 and \u201820 at the analyst day. So, will that noneconomic number or the number that you\u2019re showing for this year, the sensitivities, will those sensitivities also have an impact for 2020, because the currency has moved against us, the Mexican currency, since December 31 of last year or is that only in reference to the year 2018 and hence it has no impact when you share with us your updated 2019 and \u201820 numbers?","Jeff Martin","Ashar, let me start with saying thank you for joining the call, and I appreciate the question. The impacts we are talking about are confined to 2018. So, it won\u2019t have any impact. We will update our numbers at the analyst conference and any changes to our rule of thumb. But I\u2019d also mention to you that over a longer period of time, the peso has been weakening against the dollar. So, you go back to the time that we did our IPO of IEnova several years ago, the peso was at a much lower exchange rate. And even since the end of Q1, the dollar strengthened pretty strongly against the peso. So, you\u2019re going to see these types of moves quarter to quarter. But in terms of for in guidance now this confined to 2018. There obviously will be ongoing impacts to the deferred tax assets but primarily what we are focused on is the current monetary liabilities, and that\u2019s a 2018 issue.","Operator","And now, we will hear from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman","Just curious upon the asset rationalization and rest of the financing plan. First of all, have you had any discussion with the rating agencies subsequent to closing and how did that go and kind of maybe give us a sense of what you are targeting? And secondly, I guess, you could have just done this all with equity. So, if you pursue whether options to complete the financing, it would be better than having done just more equity?","Jeff Martin","Maybe I will give you a little bit of context. But, if you go back, one thing you may want to reference is we have this conversation on slide 14, there is a little bit of the recap of our financing. I think to start with kind of the key takeaway\u2019s we raise $9.6 billion in January. We had innumerous meetings with the rating agencies last fall and as part of that they\u2019ve asked us to kind of target a equity ratio of 65% and that we would fill that out over 18 months or so, which is really the second half of 2019. And if you apply that 65% target ratio against the 9.6 billion, it meant that we were looking to raise roughly $6.24 billion of equity. And you\u2019ll recall we\u2019ve got about $4.6 billion that we\u2019ve addressed so far. So, we\u2019ve got another $1.64 billion of equity. And I use that number notionally. I\u2019m just harkening back to those rating agency conversations.","And to your point, yes, we\u2019ve met with the rating agencies this year in New York around both of those issues including how the agencies think about increased risk from the regulatory model in California. So, as we go through this capital rotation process, as we look to optimize our repatriation program and also optimize our internal cash flows and management across our business, our goal is to try to preempt as much of that $1.64 billion of future equity as we can. So that\u2019s one priority.","Secondly, one of the interesting observations from the credit rating agencies was how much they valued the diversity of our model. So, as opposed to being a company that has the majority of this assets just in California, they view the acquisition of Oncor and the diversity into another regulatory market quite constructively. And interestingly, Steve, they also felt like the diversification in Peru and Chile also had notable benefits from a qualitative standpoint.","Steve Fleishman","And then, maybe just in terms of on the LNG and Cameron, so any better sense of kind of the timing within 2019 for the trains to produce LNG and just how long is there between starting to produce to being officially commercial?","Jeff Martin","Right. Just as a brief comment, I\u2019ll pass it to Joe, if he wants to add some color. But I said this in my prepared remarks, then this is essentially the top priority for us. We understand, Steve, the impact that this means to us from a credit standpoint and from an earning standpoint. And we have had delays in the past. We are working very aggressively with our partners to stay on track here. So, our fundamental view of turnkey in all three trains next year, so they are in a position to produce LNG is unchanged. But Joe, just because you were at the site briefly, do you want to add any additional color in terms of how we\u2019re thinking about it?","Joe Householder","Look, we\u2019re not going to give a pinpoint date of each. We definitely have dates that we are working toward, but we still have one more rainy season, one hurricane season to get through. So, look, I think, you are going to see the three coming on line earlier in the year, mid part of the year, later in the year. And I think that\u2019s what we are moving toward. As we get closer to having the first phase done, we will be able to give you a little bit more color, but that would be later in the year when we will have more certainty. And then each one takes several months to get the commissioning done and then get into revenue. So, clearly, we are going to have revenues from train one and train two as we move through. And then, the question about train three will sort of be when do they get done, towards the end of \u201819 and we just don\u2019t have a precise date for that yet.","Steve Fleishman","And then, lastly, just thoughts on ability to get new contracts. I think on the last call, you said hope for maybe even MoU sometime by the end of this year, is that still possible?","Joe Householder","We certainly [multiple speakers] that is possible. We believe that\u2019s possible, Steve, and we are working hard toward that.","Operator","And now, we will take a follow-up question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides","Hey, guys. Housekeeping ones, probably for Trevor. Can you remind us the impact that tax reform has in terms of the interest deductibility for Sempra?","Trevor Mihalik","Yes. We put that out last year. Largely, what we said is -- we spoke about the overall impact last year of approximately $0.30 -- $0.25, $0.30 for the impact of tax reform in 2018. But with regard to interest deductibility, it\u2019s largely neutral in \u201818 and going forward.","Michael Lapides","One other thing, can you remind us size at the year-end of 2017 or now the size of the NOL and what kind of cash tax payers Sempra expects to be in the coming years?","Trevor Mihalik","Right now, what we\u2019re saying is we have roughly -- I think it\u2019s a little over 4 billion of NOLs and we don\u2019t foresee being a cash tax payer over the next four, five, six years.","Jeff Martin","Outside of our plan.","Trevor Mihalik","Yes, outside of our plan.","Operator","And that will conclude our question-and answer-session. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Jeff Martin for any additional or closing remarks.","Jeff Martin","Let me just conclude by saying how much we appreciate everyone joining our call. And we\u2019ll hope that you will mark your calendars for the 28th of June to join us in New York. Also, if you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to contact the IR team. Wish you all a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference for today.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Faisel Khan, please go ahead, sir.","Faisel Khan","Thanks. Good morning, and welcome to Sempra Energy\u2019s second quarter 2018 earnings call. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our Web site under the Investors Relation section. Here in San Diego are several members of our management team, including Jeff Martin, Chief Executive Officer; Joe Householder, President and Chief Operating Officer; Trevor Mihalik, Chief Financial Officer; Dennis Arriola, Chief Strategy Officer and Executive Vice President of External Affairs, South America; Martha Wyrsch, General Counsel; Scott Drury, President San Diego Gas & Electric; and Peter Wall, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller.","Before starting, I\u2019d like to remind everyone, we\u2019ll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the Company\u2019s most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC.","It\u2019s important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis, and that we\u2019ll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and the Table A in our second quarter 2018 earnings press release for reconciliation to GAAP measures. I\u2019d also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, August 6, 2018, and the Company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.","With that, please turn to slide four, and let me hand the call over to Jeff Martin.","Jeff Martin","Thanks a lot, Faisel. Before we get started, I\u2019d also like to thank everyone who joined us at our analyst conference in New York. We enjoyed the opportunity to talk about our strategic goals, planned assets sales, financial projections and long-term vision. Since the analyst conference, we've had the opportunity to continue this dialogue and I've met with over 100 investors. We appreciate the positive feedback we continue to receive on our plan and are committed delivering and long-term value to all of our shareholders.","Our management team continues to focus on three things; number one, advancing our strategic vision to become the premier North American energy infrastructure company with leadership positions in the most attractive market; number two, strengthen our balance sheet to support our strategic initiatives; and number three, making progress on our existing and new projects that fit our transmission and distribution and long-term contracted business model. As we discussed in New York, our focus is on delivering shareholder value through superior earnings per share and dividend per share growth.","On today's call, I'll provide an update on some of the topics covered at our Analyst Day, new project announcements and the progress we're seeing in our LNG business. Afterwards, Trevor will review our second quarter financials, the key drivers influencing our results and our guidance. I'd like to highlight that we\u2019re reaffirming our full year 2018 adjusted earnings guidance of $5.30 to $5.80 per share.","Please turn to the next Slide. In late June, we communicated our strategic vision. It's focused on high grading our portfolio with transmission and distribution investments and long-term contracted assets in tier 1 markets, all with a focus of becoming America's premier energy infrastructure company. In conjunction with this effort, we announced the planned sales of our U.S. wind, U.S. solar and certain U.S. midstream assets. Since then, we've launched the sales process and hired advisors and we continue to be very encouraged by the substantial market interest we received.","Also you recall at the Analysts Day, we discussed the need for an additional $1.6 billion of equity in order to reach our targeted capital structure for the Oncor transaction of approximately 65% equity to total capital. Related to this, in mid-July, we executed on the issuance of $1.1 billion of common equity forwards and $500 million of mandatory convertible preferred shares. We're pleased to say that both offerings were very well received by the market. In fact, both offerings experienced robust demand and in combination were 3 times oversubscribed. Additionally, the green shoots on each of the securities were fully exercised by the underwriters, bringing the total expected gross proceeds to $1.85 billion.","As I mentioned earlier, the funds raised we used to complete our targeted financing structure that we provided both to the market and the Public Utilities Commission of Texas for the Oncor transaction, and will help ensure that our company is positioned for success going forward. Also as we laid out at our analyst conference, our long-term vision includes providing industry leading earnings per share and dividend per share growth, while maintaining an investment grade plus credit rating over the long-term. Notably, our initiatives to high-grade our portfolio and reduce our risk profile have allowed Moody\u2019s to consider revising our FFO to debt threshold down to between 16% and 17%. We believe this is appropriate and achievable range, and should allow us to effectively execute our capital plans.","Moving on to the wildfire issue. We along with other stakeholders continue to execute our three pronged strategy designed to help mitigate the risk to our customers and help ensure the long-term health of California Utilities. Given the recent progress from the formation of the special legislative committee, bills in the legislature and Governor Brown's proposal to specifically address inverse condemnation, we\u2019re optimistic that appropriate legislation could be put in place to address this issue by the end of this month.","Also I\u2019d like to briefly touch on our recent conversations with Elliott Bluescape partnership. We\u2019re highly engaged in constructive dialogue at the highest levels of each organization and have had multiple face-to-face meetings. Most recently, three of our Board members met with members of the Elliott Bluescape partnership with their offices in New York. In our view, all parties had strong interest in maximizing shareholder value and constructive conversations are continuing. At the end of the day, our management team believes our disciplined North American focused strategy should create significant long-term shareholder value, and we\u2019re extremely focused on executing the strategic vision.","Now please turn to the next Slide. We continue to make great progress on our existing and new projects. Let me start by discussing our LNG projects where we believe we\u2019re well positioned to help meet the world's growing natural gas demand with Cameron and three other LNG development opportunities. First, the construction of Cameron trains one through three continues to progress. The facility remains on track for all three trains to produce LNG in 2019, which McDermott recently affirmed on their earnings call. In addition, in mid-July Total completed its acquisition of on Engie\u2019s LNG assets. We\u2019re actually quite excited to have Total as the new partner. It is a well-led company and has a growing leadership position in the space and we look forward to work with them on this project and potential expansion opportunities at the facility.","Shifting to our other LNG opportunities as highlighted at the recent analyst conference. We\u2019re highly encouraged by our progress. We recently selected an EPC contractor for ECA and continue to receive significant market interest given the project\u2019s West Coast location. We also selected an EPC contractor for Port Arthur and announced the heads of agreement with the Polish Oil and Gas company, outlining terms for a 20-year proposed agreement to supply two Mtpa of LNG, which is in addition to the memorandum of understanding signed with KOGAS just last year.","Please turn to the next slide where I\u2019ll review new projects and our other businesses. Starting with the IEnova, we continue to establish a dominant market position in the liquid storage business and we\u2019re recently awarded the Topolobampo Marine terminal project. Additionally, we announced an expansion of the Veracruz terminal and redistribution of capacity at the Mexico City and Pueblo terminals. Related to these updates, the total investment for the terminals at Veracruz, Mexico City and Pueblo is now expected to be $315 million, which is $40 million increase. In Chile, Chiquita recently announced the acquisition of two operating transmission lines for $220 million subject to customary regulatory approvals. A good portion of these operating assets are within Chiquita service territory and are already integrated with their existing distribution infrastructure.","The transaction is likely to close in the second half of 2018 as expected to be funded with cash on hand in Chile. The projects in Mexico and Chile support the strategy we developed along with our board, which seeks to high-grade our portfolio through a T&D and long-term contracted assets. Just as importantly, they\u2019ll help improve energy accessibility and resiliency in both countries.","Turning now to California. We recently submitted an application for a natural gas leak abatement program per Senate Bill 1371. We requested a CapEx amount of approximately $115 million. It would be deployed over a three year period. This program will help ensure the delivery of safe, reliable natural gas and further the state\u2019s goal of reducing GHG emission. An additional cost to development was the CPUCs mitigation report released at the beginning of July, which directed us to increase the storage volume of Aliso Canyon from approximately 24.6 bcf to roughly 34 bcf. This further supports our stance that Aliso and and natural gas are an integral component of energy reliability and affordability in Southern California.","More than 90% of Southern California residence depends on natural gas for the daily needs. By some estimates converting to all electric appliances could cost the average household to over $7,000 upfront and upto $1,000 per year and increase appliance and energy costs. That\u2019s why from a customer perspective, we certainly support trends towards electrification while also supporting the ongoing role of natural gas.","With that, let me hand it over to Trevor who will review our financial results.","Trevor Mihalik","Thanks Jeff. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter loss of $561 million or $2.11 per share. These results include the impairment charges, primarily related to our U. S. natural gas storage business, which we discussed at our Analyst Day. This compares to the second quarter 2017 earnings of $259 million or $1.03 per share. On an adjusted basis, we reported earnings of $361 million or $1.35 per share. This compares to the second quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $276 million or $1.10 per share.","Let\u2019s turn to the next slide where I\u2019ll discuss the key drivers impacting our quarterly results. Our adjusted quarter results were primarily driven by the following; $114 million of earnings at the Sempra Texas Utility segment due to the acquisition of our interest in Oncor in March of 2018; and $46 million of higher earnings at the Sempra Mexico segment, primarily due to favorable foreign currency and inflation related impact net of hedges. This is partially offset by $81 million, primarily related to higher interest expense and preferred dividends at parent, which includes the impact of the Oncor acquisition financing. With these results, we are reaffirming our 2018 adjusted earnings guidance of $5.30 to $5.80 per share and GAAP guidance of $1.78 to $2.28 per share but we continue to monitor the peso movements relative to our guidance assumptions.","Please turn to the next slide and I\u2019ll hand it back over to Jeff.","Jeff Martin","Thanks a lot Trevor. I want to emphasize that execution of our strategic plan to create long-term shareholder value remains top of mind. In the near term, our management team is focused on the following items: Resolving our general rate cases, executing the sale of our U.S. wind, U.S. solar and certain U.S. midstream assets, progressing the construction of Cameron and advancing our California wildfire risk mitigation strategy. Also, I\u2019d like to take that opportunity to again thank everyone who participating in recent equity offering, the shareholder support we receive is important to us in terms of delivering our long-term vision of delivering quality growth and value creation.","With that, we\u2019ll conclude our prepared remarks and start to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd","Jeff, you mentioned at the beginning of your discussion a targeted FFO to debt level. And I was just thinking through Sempra has a number of upside growth potential areas of spending. And as you look at it now when you look at your projected financials, your projected FFO to debt level, if you were successful in some of those incremental growth opportunities, what does that debt target level tell us. Does that imply you have some degree of dry powder with respect to leverage? Or does it mean we should assume a more traditional need for incremental equity if you have incremental applied CapEx?","Jeff Martin","I\u2019ll give you a few comments and then pass it to Trevor. But in general, we\u2019ve been impressed from time-to-time about what is your specific FFO to debt target. And as you know, we spent a lot of time choreographing our strategic plan with all three credit rating agencies. I think what we\u2019ve tried to do really is make sure that we are very, very clear that we expect to maintain an investment grade plus credit rating. I think the second thing we tried to do is spend a lot of time explaining where we were a decade ago, where we\u2019d exposure to IPP businesses, where we\u2019d exposure to commodity businesses and how we pretty concerted effort of trying to high-grade the portfolio where we can have a lot more transparency about our future cash flows.","We really found that to be around the transmission distribution type of assets. So what we've done in Texas, we announced that we recently had in Chile this is really the ongoing focus. And what that's really resulted in is the type of dialog and conversations you see come out of Moody\u2019s where they are open minded about reducing our overall risk profile. So our goal is to make sure that we\u2019re really doing everything as a business in terms of cash flows, repatriation and divestitures to support the type of growth initiatives you\u2019re referring to. I\u2019ll stop there and see Trevor if you want to add any comments to that.","Trevor Mihalik","Stephen, the only other thing I\u2019d add really is one of the things once Cameron comes online that is a significant change in the cash flows for the organization, which will certainly support the FFO to debt metrics. And so depending on what we monetize the wind and the solar assets for could significantly help with the growth prospects. And again, what we laid out at the analyst conference with regards to the $15 billion capital plan and the incremental equity offering that we just completed, we believe over the period of time, we will be in a position to support our investment grade plus credit rating.","Stephen Byrd","And then shifting gears to California. So I think the very large recent wildfires highlight the seriousness of the issue and we certainly hear regularly from investors the urgent need to have legislation. I was curious in your dialog you mentioned you were I think optimistic or hopeful that we\u2019d see legislation in the session. Can you talk little bit about the dialogue you\u2019ve had, what gives you some optimism in terms of ensuring that we get legislation that the investment community very much wants to see?","Jeff Martin","Well, I\u2019m glad you asked that question and obviously this is top of mind to lot of investors. I\u2019ll provide a couple of comments and ask Joe to provide some comments as well. I think the way I thought about Stephen is last fall it was really a process of problem identification. Obviously, the CPUC ruled on our WEMS decision, which put a lot of this in play in terms of how people thought about the problem. In the first quarter of 2018, there was a large education process. I think part of that was really aimed at making sure that people understood that this was not a problem, it was unique to the California investor-owned utilities, the impacted municipals, impacted the residential communities\u2019 ability to procure insurance, it had a broad impact to the state.","And I think one of the things we could be more pleased about now is to see the type of leadership coming out of both houses of the legislature the governor has really stepped forward. And I think the conversation today is less about one particular bill number or one particular assembly bill number, and really about the value what\u2019s taking place in the conference committee. So there's a committee meeting tomorrow on safe and reliable energy grid and there's a committee meeting on Thursday on inverse condemnation and electric utilities. I think the dialogue has progressed to the point that is right where it should be. We\u2019ve got the right people focused on the right issues, it\u2019s being redefined more broadly as a statewide issue and not an investor and utility issue and I think that's part of my calls for optimism. Now I\u2019ll see Joe if you like to supplement that.","Joe Householder","I would just add a couple of things. I think that the governor wants healthy utilities, he wants to further his energy policies and his agenda and the IoUs play a large role in that. So I think as Jeff mentioned two weeks ago, the conference committee had their first meeting. We have the opportunity to participate in that meeting. We were the only investor owned utility that was at that meeting. But our director of the Firesign's employment adoption, he was there at that meeting and now tomorrow they\u2019re having this meeting. And it\u2019s not only members from each of the California investor-owned utilities but also people who are representing the municipals. So this is a statewide issue it\u2019s not just investor-owned. So we\u2019re encouraged that they\u2019re having that meeting tomorrow followed by another meeting on Thursday. The agenda for that meeting isn\u2019t out yet. You can see these other agendas on their Web site. But we are encouraged about this. We\u2019re working with the various stakeholders in this and we see the opportunity for some movement this month while the legislature finishes its work this year.","Operator","Moving on we\u2019ll take our next question from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman","Maybe is it possible you give a little more color on maybe where there\u2019re areas of agreement or disagreement on?","Jeff Martin","As I mentioned this in my prepared remarks and obviously we went -- took a team back to New York. Jesse Cohen is the Head of the National Practice and that\u2019s who I\u2019ve been dealing with directly. I think all of the conversations you expect us to be having they\u2019re being had, the conversations are quite constructive. And I think that the most important thing is the issues that we\u2019re all focused on are the right issues. It\u2019s really around making sure that we\u2019re continuing to try to find a way to not only have an identity ventures with Elliott Bluescape but also making sure we\u2019re thinking of the interest of all of our shareholders. So I am actually quite optimistic that the tone of the conversations are good, all the right people are engaged and I remain very optimistic about it.","Steve Fleishman","And then just on the -- you mentioned Moody\u2019s in the 16% to 17%. I assume you\u2019re saying that\u2019s consistent with where your plan roughly gets you to then, that kind of range\u2026","Jeff Martin","I appreciate that question, because we spent a little bit of time at the analyst conference talking about how much time we\u2019ve been spending with the credit rating agencies, a lot of that as you know, was as we approach the Oncor transaction last summer we had laid out our long-term plans with a view of making sure that we can accommodate that type of transaction. So we've always been fairly high touch with respect to the credit rating agencies. But over the last nine months, in particular, it's been a very engaged process. So when we got to analysts conferences, it\u2019s really about laying out the fact that, yes, we're doing all the right things to make sure that we're managing our cash flows and supporting our balance sheet and I've talked about some of those. But it was also about making sure that we got the message across about what impact our focus on the portfolio should have to our risk profile. And I think that's reflected in what Moody's said. So it's probably less about whether we've created a cushion or not created a cushion. We need to make sure that we're executing the way that we've laid it out, because we do think there's a lot of opportunities in front of us and making sure we're very closely aligned with agencies is important to us.","Steve Fleishman","And do you have an idea of when they're going to resolve their review, or outlook?","Jeff Martin","I'll pass it to Trevor.","Trevor Mihalik","They have come out and recently published on us. And as Jeff said, they have given us a period of time as a result of the Oncor acquisition and the Oncor financing associated with that. That over a period of time, we could get to the appropriate equity structure of 6535. And while we have done the equity offerings, a lot of those are under forward contracts. And so the expected proceeds will come in over time. And so the agencies gave us approximately 18 months to get the Oncor financing in place. And then of course it also -- like we said earlier, the proceeds from the expected sale will also have a significant impact.","Jeff Martin","And what I would add to that, Steve, too is I think part of the value here, just like as management communicates with The Street, part of it is making sure that when you sit down to credit rating agencies, you deliver what you tell them you're going to deliver. So just last year we actually exceeded our FFO to debt metrics, which was one of our goals. We set out some goals about the targeted capital structure, not only do we deliver, we delivered it early and that's one of the things we're trying to make sure is that we follow through on these types of things. I think the wildcard continues to be the issues that Stephen raised which is what takes place with the California regulatory environment.","So I would expect that the agencies will be very much geared to seeing what takes place in the legislative environment. And that really was one of the wildcards that was not factored in last fall when we were talking about the Oncor transaction. So part of this is to stay closely aligned, deliver what we think is some improvements from the legislation going forward. And I think there is some alignment in the state to do that.","Operator","Moving on we'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Joe, I wanted to follow-up on the two town developments, obviously, well anticipated. But how does that change the marketing efforts on the Cameron expansion [Technical Difficulty]? And then secondly I suppose in tandem hard to ignore the developments in China around their tariff. How does that impact thus far your efforts across the portfolio of projects you\u2019re pursuing?","Jeff Martin","I'll kick this off and pass it to Joe, but let me just start with Total. I think I may have mentioned this at the conference. But when we were at the World Gas Conference with Octavio and Joe, we have a chance to have dinner with Patrick Pouyanne at Total. And I am personally impressed with them as a company. I said him up in my prepared remarks I think it's a very well led company. And I think they have a very ambitious view of an integrated natural gas strategy. They've targeted having about 40 million tons per annum as part of their portfolio by 2020, both balanced between roughly half of that being equity owned gas. So that\u2019s a conversation we\u2019re going to continue. And I think we\u2019re glad to have them as a partner at Cameron. And certainly, they\u2019ve even said publicly that they\u2019re very interested to participate in the expansion process there.","So as you think about the marketing activities, I view Cameron, one, is more of relationship management and advancing the interest of our existing customers at that facility. And then in terms of the larger issue you\u2019re raising about China and tariff issues, at this point, it\u2019s tough to -- maybe even premature to forecast the impacts of that. But I think what I am a little bit confident about is LNG is an important part of China\u2019s future. We certainly see that as the key field that will help push coal off of their grid. And frankly, the United States will always be one of the lowest cost suppliers and we think this just bodes well for the future. But I\u2019ll pass it on to Joe to see if he\u2019ll make any more comments about the marketing impacts.","Joe Householder","I think you pretty much summed it up, but I will say in a number of conversations that I had with as they were working with us to request all they approvals needed to make that acquisition. They emphasized a number of times that they really only did this because they wanted to have the access to the expansion. And so they\u2019re very open about that and want to engage in that topic. And I had some conversations with some other partners and I think we\u2019re all starting to see that, especially as we see one, two and three coming toward . And so our focus is staying on one, two, three but I think we have to start engaging in discussions around that. And I think that Total will bring a lot to that discussion. And I don\u2019t have anything else to add on the tariffs evolving\u2026","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And then maybe can I just bring it back to another issue to get a little bit more clarity on the credit side. Obviously, the 16% to 17% thresholds mentioned a couple of times here. But it\u2019s predicated in part on the business mix change I presume. What\u2019s the timeframe on the sales, and is that what\u2019s linked here to get the affirmation of the outlook, I suppose separately and distinctly from California resolution? And maybe to tackle on the second piece, to that end in terms of business mix, obviously, you\u2019re making pretty explicit efforts on several of your assets. Should we read by the acquisition of the Chilean assets of late that perhaps that\u2019s maybe firmly off the table?","Jeff Martin","I think there\u2019s about three questions in there, Julien. So let me make a rundown. I think that I would probably decouple this first issue of whether this 16% to 17% is tied to the divestitures. The 16% to 17% is a reformed view by Moody\u2019s about the measures we\u2019ve taken over the last three to five years to reposition the portfolio. So it\u2019s based upon their view of the existing portfolio and really the Capstone investment in that trend line around Oncor. Secondly, I do want to emphasize that how we handle the divestiture is really important to us. There is a fairly wide range of outcomes that could occur there. Our Chief Strategy Officer, Dennis Arriola is leading that divestiture campaign and we\u2019ve been very aggressive rile to shoot to get that moving, so that\u2019s something we look forward to making comments on to in the future.","And then to your third question about Chile, it\u2019s definitely not off the table. I think what we\u2019ve tried to say is we\u2019ve laid out a very disciplined phased approach to our strategy about what we\u2019re going to basically articulate, both with our Board and the market in Q1 of next year and then in the following Q1 of 2020. And what we\u2019re trying to do is to say that acquisition is reflected of how you run the business, whether you\u2019re a buyer or seller you\u2019re looking to partner. So we\u2019re going to look at our international business with fresh eyes, I mean the legal term is de novo. We\u2019re going to start from the bottoms up and we\u2019re going to try get to the best possible answer near term and long term for our investors. So there is absolutely nothing off the table that was an ordinary course bolt-on to the existing franchise, which we quite frankly think makes it more valuable.","Joe Householder","One thing I\u2019d say is that that transaction we discussed at our analyst meeting too, so that was in Dennis's slide deck as well.","Operator","Moving on we\u2019ll take the next question from Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners.","Shahriar Pourreza","So you just actually did touch on my Chilean question that Julien just asked. But I\u2019m curious whatever decision you guys choose with South America. Is there an opportunity to reach a conclusion and a decision before you built Cameron, or should we thinking about any strategic decision you think about with South America would have to be as you get closer to Cameron?","Jeff Martin","We\u2019ve talked about the fact that we're trying to improve our balance sheet and part of what we tried to explain at the analyst conference was the choreography that there's a timeline that allows you to look more aggressively at the portfolio and that timeline was choreographed against how we repatriate cash today and improve our balance sheet near term. Obviously, to your point Shahriar it\u2019s really an inflection point in 2020 and we expect to have obviously all three trains fully up and running. And that gives us a lot more flexibility with respect to our balance sheet. But prior to that time, you can sell assets like wind or solar once which are not, quote-unquote credit dilutive","But as you look at transactions which could be credit dilutive, there are scenarios where those can also be advantageous to our shareholders we just have to choreograph those. And that\u2019s why we laid it out in a three-phase approach. The ones which can be beneficial to our balance sheet today, at least in the near term we've articulated is phase one. And we will look at the South American and international businesses between now and Q1 of next year, because we're getting closer to obviously having each of the trains producing LNG. So there is a certain timeline to that. But certainly we can make a decision on South America prior to the full commission of every train at Cameron.","Shahriar Pourreza","And just let me ask you one last one, because it -- sometimes it\u2019s a source of confusion is. I mean clearly from your slide decks in your prepared remarks. I mean, you echo becoming a premier North American infrastructure company. So that inherently assumes LNG and IEnova remain very strategic to us for Sempra [Multiple Speakers]\u2026","Jeff Martin","Well, I think this goes back to the timeline question as well, which is what we tried to say is that phase one is the opportunity to transact on assets today in North America where we think we can redeploy the capital more effectively. Phase two is going to be bottoms up review of our international businesses with the focus on South America. Obviously, that's choreographed against the strength of our balance sheet. You\u2019ll recall that I described the fact that each of the credit rating agencies have assigned more value to Peru and Chile from a credit standpoint, because of the regulatory diversity and they are very, very high FFO to debt right. So as we go forward and continue to improve our balance sheet, it gives us more flexibility there.","And with respect LNG, I think we talked about this. We were very intent on trying to highlight value with our LNG business as part of our TRV vehicle, much like an MLP, as that market went away, we\u2019re going to continue to develop that business. And it\u2019s really, Shahriar about looking for that efficient frontier whereas we develop that business and build scale and greater visibility to cash flows, we certainly would welcome the opportunity to that to market to create value for our shareholders. Joe, would you like to add anything to that?","Joe Householder","These two businesses are important parts of our growth. And since 2012, they created $40 a share value in our stock price and we think that that can be significantly higher. So we think both of those are great infrastructure growth areas. I think there is lot of complementary parts to them and so I think those are keen focus for us. What we do with them over time, we\u2019ll see but I think that for us right now they are priority.","Operator","Moving on we\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides","Of the three LNG projects in the growth pipeline, which of the three whether Cameron 4 and 5, Port Arthur and Costa Azul, do you think is further ahead in the process relative to the other ones, and why?","Jeff Martin","Well, I\u2019ll take a shot at this Joe and you can chip in with me. But I think what\u2019s interesting about your question is each of them have their own unique attributes from a marketing standpoint. I described in an earlier question that the Cameron expansion feels more like a relationship management issue. Obviously, we\u2019re focused on getting trains one through three done, that\u2019s the laser focus of our entire LNG business obviously. But having Total in the mix now, I think makes it more important that we\u2019re building great relationships with those three customers, being able to build trains four and five will be a huge opportunity for us. On the West Coast, clearly as you see more and more natural gas coming out of the Gulf. It\u2019s pretty intriguing if you can actually develop a project where you can access San Juan or Permian gas and take it off the West Coast of North America.","So as you can imagine, those people that want destination flexibility want to have a shorter time to the Asian markets without going through the Panama Canal and the issues there. That certainly is drawing a tremendous amount of interest. And frankly, Port Arthur is very well situated geographically. There are lot of folks who understand the value of the Port Arthur, particularly as you saw some affirmation of that Michael with the recent HoA we signed with Poland, which by the way, most people were surprised to see that that was a 20 year agreement. So I think each of these three facilities provide some unique marketing advantages.","One of the things that\u2019s intriguing before I pass it to Joe is much like back in the IPP days Mike when you used to talk about system sales that was how the California Department of Water Resources contract was structured, there's a lot of interest in some of the conversations with Octavio\u2019s team is having around participating in more than one project, which I think is also interesting. And Joe, perhaps you can add some color to the question.","Joe Householder","Michael, I think I\u2019ve said this before. We don\u2019t particularly prioritize them that way, because each of them has a little bit different situation and each of them has a lot of interest, as Jeff was saying. And so when we were at the World Gas Conference, Jeff and myself with Octavio and some of his team, we talked to a number of different important buyers who each have different interest in them. So clearly, there are some at Cameron we have permits. At ICA we have permits. We\u2019re working on and hope to finalize our permit at Port Arthur this year. We\u2019re working with EPC contractors now at both the other facilities. And so each of them is a little bit different, we like them all and don't prioritize one over the other in like we want that one first and put all the team on that one. At this point, we're looking at all of them because they all have good opportunity.","Michael Lapides","And can I ask just a question about ICA, regarding the energy , meaning the pipeline infrastructure in Mexico needed to get Permian, let's say, Permian gas over to ICA. Just curious how difficult, how easy or hard would it be to actually permit those. Do you have some of the same issues that some of the other developers, folks like TransCanada seen getting pipelines built in Mexico? Just curious in terms of how realistic this is.","Jeff Martin","Well, I would just say, we talked a little bit about the mid-scale project, Michael, which is 2.5 Mtpa. We expect to use existing American pipeline system for that by enlarge to get it to this part of the country. If we go to the larger scale project, which is 11 Mtpa, we expect that that\u2019s probably a new pipeline. I don't think we've determined yet whether the route is most efficacious to bring it across Northern Mexico or bring a portion of it across the United States. But I can tell you the key is having access to Permian. If you can actually do that in a way that's cost effective and basically launch LNG off the West Coast, it is hugely -- has a lot of interest from the market. Joe, you want comment on the pipeline?","Joe Householder","I would only add on to that. We've built in or partnered with 11 of the 14 pipelines built in Mexico, so we have not had a problem getting them permitted.","Operator","Moving on we'll take our next question from Ryan Levine with Citi.","Ryan Levine","What's the impact of the recently announced and potential future Chile investments on the expectation for cash repatriation from South America? And what's the return profile for the recent announced projects?","Jeff Martin","I'll pass it to Trevor. Go ahead Trevor.","Trevor Mihalik","Right now the repatriation that we announced with $1.6 billion over five years with, call it roughly 400 to 500 coming in 2018, none of that cash is coming from Mexico, that's all cash coming from Chile -- or none of its coming from Chile, it's coming from Peru and Mexico. So the cash and we're going to be using for the investment in that transmission lines is just cash that is the cash in Chile.","Jeff Martin","The second part of his question was the return expectations, it's immediately accretive and Dennis you want to add anything to those investments?","Dennis Arriola","We look at this and one of the things that we really liked about this was that is strategic, because the operating assets are actually part of our system right now. When you look at the vast majority of the transmission assets there, they are already associated with our, so there's their synergies there. But from a return perspective, we were -- I think we're smart about it. We're looking for double-digit leverage returns, high single-digit unlevered returns. And again, we're using existing cash from our business. This is a good investment regardless of whether we continue to stay in the country and grow, or if we decided to monetize in the future it only enhances the overall value.","Joe Householder","The only thing I would also add to that is that these assets are in into service territory as well, so it's a natural follow on.","Ryan Levine","Are there any additional opportunities in Chile?","Dennis Arriola","We're looking at it. Obviously, given where we're located outside of Santiago, there are some additional add-ons. We're continuing to look at some of the zonal transmission bids and the national ones. But again, we're only going to do this if it makes sense or if it\u2019s complimentary to our existing system. We\u2019re not just going to go chase an investment because it\u2019s in the country of Chile.","Ryan Levine","And could you comment on the current appetite for additional U.S. acquisitions?","Jeff Martin","We don\u2019t comment on M&A generally. I think that what we\u2019ve laid out right now is we\u2019ve got a fairly aggressive capital program going forward. We\u2019ll continue to look at things if we think it\u2019s strategic to us. I think we\u2019ve been very clear about the types of things we\u2019re interested and particularly in transmission and distribution, so that\u2019s an area we\u2019ll continue to follow. But I think we\u2019re really focused Ryan on executing our plan and we\u2019ll stay close to the markets which are most important to us which are California, Texas and Mexico.","Ryan Levine","And then regarding the ICA mid scale project, what\u2019s the current outlook for permitting for that project? And are there any developments on that front?","Joe Householder","We basically have the full permit for the larger scale project and we\u2019re working with government agency to modify that to accommodate this and hope to do that over the next couple of months.","Operator","Moving on we\u2019ll take our next question from Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson","So want to just follow up on the asset sale. The $1.87 billion approximately assets held for sale, the vast majority of that I assume is the in wind and midstream and what have you. How much should we think is the tax basis for that?","Jeff Martin","How much you think the tax basis is for what we\u2019re selling?","Paul Patterson","Yes.","Trevor Mihalik","Well again I would just say on the $1.87 billion, the impairment was roughly $1.5 billion associated with that and then 900 after-tax. On the tax basis for those assets, you can assume that the tax basis is actually fairly low in those assets, mostly from bonus depreciation and then also on the wind side associated with a lot of those, and we\u2019ve sold down half of the interest on the wind side through the tax partnership structures.","Joe Householder","And Paul, you know we have large NOLs so it will not be a big cash impact with the tax effect.","Paul Patterson","And then just could you remind us what the earnings associate with those assets are?","Jeff Martin","You can see that we\u2019ve published that at the analyst conference call, so you can see those assets for \u201918, \u201919 and \u201820 in the guidance ranges because we gave at that segment level. It goes up to roughly -- it goes from about $80 million to $100 million per year on the wind and solar side, and the midstream assets that we\u2019re selling are at a loss today.","Paul Patterson","I just want to see if there has been any change in that. And then just finally on the -- I guess we\u2019ve been having ex parte discussions at the California PUC. And I was wondering if there was any -- if you knew what that was about, or just what is that about, do you what it is about?","Jeff Martin","As you read any ex parte notification and talks about the overall scope of the ex parte conversations and afterwards they make a filing relative to that. And I\u2019ll refer you to the public record on , Paul.","Paul Patterson","I did see the record on it. I guess just wondering if that's a normal thing or I don\u2019t -- I hear you, I\u2019ll just -- I appreciate your comments. Thanks so much.","Operator","Moving on we\u2019ll take our final question from Lasan Johong from Auvila Research Consulting.","Lasan Johong","I\u2019ll just ask two questions. First of all, what's your California risk appetite? And what I mean by that is if you had opportunities to make additional acquisitions or as a muni call for IOU. Is that something that would be interesting? And a follow up to Ryan\u2019s question, and the reason I why ask is obviously PG&E announced that they maybe splitting up the company. My second question is with regard to President Trump's comments to Angela Merkel about importing Russian gas in light of that comment has Sempra seen an uptick in interest from either Eastern Europe or Europe in general for U.S. LNG. And is this something that is real or is it just political?","Jeff Martin","With respect to the M&A question, obviously broadly speaking, we don\u2019t typically comment on M&A. But I\u2019d probably answer it this way that last summer before we have these wildfire issues here in California, we have made the decision that we thought Texas was a great market from a regulatory standpoint, that they had good demographic growth, constructive regulation, and it was something that was a target of interest for us but calls of the T&D focus. But I think that gave us a great opportunity, number one, it gets more regulatory diversity. And given where we're at in our discussions with the credit rating agencies that guides you to thinking where you\u2019d be more focused at this point in time.","And then on your second question, we certainly have followed both pipelines in the Germany, both Nord Stream 1 as well as Nord Stream 2, and I think the President has been spot on. I think you go back to the 2014 EU charter there has been an emphasis for the entire EU community to diversify their fuel supply for their energy markets. So I think this is really an opportunity, that\u2019s why we talked about little bit earlier about the importance of Port Arthur and the ability of some of these facilities that we have in the Gulf to access to Western European marketplace. We continue to think that the drivers there are more around energy security and energy independence, which was somewhat different from the drivers that we discussed at the analyst conference for Asia. So we certainly think it\u2019s a political statement that the president has made, the work he has done with the EU is actually quite constructive for the entire LNG industry here in the U.S.","Operator","At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Martin for any additional or closing remarks.","Jeff Martin","Well, look we\u2019re very appreciative of everyone joining our call today. Per custom, if you have any follow-up questions feel free to contact the IR team and have a great day.","Operator","And that will conclude today's conference. We do thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."],"18979":["Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) Q3 2016 Earnings Call November  2, 2016 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Richard A. Vaccari - Sempra Energy","Debra L.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead, sir.","Richard A. Vaccari - Sempra Energy","Good morning and welcome to Sempra Energy's third quarter financial presentation. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investor section.","With me in San Diego are several members of our management team: Debbie Reed, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Snell, President; Joe Householder, Chief Financial Officer; Martha Wyrsch, General Counsel; Trevor Mihalik, Chief Accounting Officer; Dennis Arriola, Chief Executive Officer of SoCalGas; Jeff Martin, Chief Executive Officer of SDG&E; and Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es, President of Sempra LNG.","Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q.","It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis that we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our third quarter 2016 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures.","I'd also like to indicate that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, November 2, 2016, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.","With that, please turn to slide 4, and let me hand the call over to Debbie.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thanks, Rick. During the third quarter, our strong operating and financial performance continued across the company. Our third quarter financial results keep us on track to achieve our 2016 adjusted earnings guidance of $4.60 per share to $5 per share.","I would like to start off with an update on Cameron LNG. Last week, Cameron JV's EPC contractor gave indication that the project is facing delays. Cameron JV and the partners are assessing the information. Any delay would likely cause 2018 and 2019 Cameron earnings to be lower than anticipated, but those earnings would be made up over time. Most importantly, our NPV should be substantially maintained as the tariff adjusts as a result of the delay. I will go into further details in a moment.","Moving on to other important elements of our base plan, I'm pleased to say that since our Analyst Conference in July, our team has been successfully executing on our projects. At IEnova, we have closed the approximately $1.1 billion acquisition of PEMEX's interest in the joint venture and issued $1.6 billion of follow-on equity.","At the California utilities, we continue to make progress on our $12 billion five-year capital plan. Most recently, the CPUC has approved the Sycamore-Pe\u00f1asquitos electric transmission project at SDG&E. We've also made progress on securing development opportunities that can enhance our value propositions.","At IEnova, we plan on adding approximately 400 megawatts of new renewable projects. At SDG&E, we received CPUC approval to own and operate 37.5 megawatts of energy storage that we expect to be placed into service in the first quarter of 2017.","Now, please turn to slide 5. Let me start with an update on Cameron Trains 1 through 3. Last week, Cameron JV received indication from its EPC contractor, that the in-service date for each train may be facing delay. The contractor's information reflects updated in-service dates as follows: mid-2018 for Train 1; late-2018 for Train 2; and mid-2019 for Train 3. Sempra and our partners are assessing this new information and ways to mitigate any impact.","We are disappointed with the short-term delay, because at Sempra, we take great pride in delivering projects on time and on budget. But under a lump-sum turnkey construction agreement, the contractor retains the responsibility and overall control of the project schedule. The good news is that EPC contract does provide for liquidated damages for certain delays. Those damages would be factored into the tariff and would alleviate some of the impact to Cameron's customers.","As a reminder, our JV partners are also our customers. The terms of our agreements provide that EPC schedule delays and changes in costs results in tariff adjustments. The adjustments are designed to substantially maintain the expected NPV on the project. Therefore, delays are not likely to impact the project's overall NPV. However, any construction delays would likely defer a portion of 2018 and 2019 Cameron earnings.","We had originally anticipated all three trains being in service by the end of 2018. To give you a sense of the impact, Sempra's expected quarterly earnings from the project when all three trains are in service in 2019 are approximately $80 million.","Moving to Cameron Train 4. Any expansion of Cameron beyond the first three trains requires unanimous consent from our equity partners. One of the partners has indicated they do not want to invest additional capital for an expansion. Discussions among the partners have been going on for several months, and we are considering a variety of options that may result in a clearer path to an expansion. Although we can't project timing until we receive the necessary approvals, we continue to believe a Cameron expansion would be well positioned as one of the lowest-cost sources of global LNG supply. As a reminder, LNG expansions had never been part of our base plan.","Now, please turn to the next slide for an update on IEnova. We are proud of our recent accomplishments in Mexico. Our new investments in IEnova are underpinned by dollar-based long-term contracts consistent with Sempra strategy. They enhance Sempra's Mexico's value of proposition by diversifying its growth platforms and customer base.","IEnova recently completed the purchase of PEMEX's 50% equity interest in our shared joint venture. In October, IEnova raised $1.6 billion in a follow-on equity issuance, primarily to finance the PEMEX acquisition and other growth. The equity offering was the largest follow-on deal in Mexico in the last two years. It was substantially oversubscribed and priced at a 5% premium to the launch of marketing. Sempra purchased $351 million of IEnova stock and now owns approximately 66% of the company. The strong deal showing is market confirmation that we have been successful with our strategy in Mexico.","In September, IEnova announced nearly 400 megawatts of additional renewable projects that are in addition to the base plan. This includes the acquisition of the 252-megawatt Ventika wind facility. Ventika went into service in April of this year and is the largest wind farm in Mexico. We expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter. And 141 megawatts of solar capacity awarded in Mexico's second renewable auction. Operations are scheduled to come online in the first half of 2019. We continue to see a large amount of growth opportunities in Mexico that fit our strategy.","Now, please turn to slide 7 for several other business updates. As noted in the press, we are working on an agreement to purchase a 50% equity interest in the Southern Peru Pipeline project. It is an approximately $6.5 billion natural gas pipeline. We are hopeful an agreement can be reached, but there is no assurance and we are still resolving several significant issues. We are not able to comment on this further at this time.","Moving on to Aliso Canyon. SoCalGas has made significant infrastructure technology and safety enhancements to the facility. We are continuing the process to resume injections by requesting authority from DOGGR and the CPUC this week, which could be approved by year-end. Regarding the root cause analysis, we expect to receive the final report sometime in the first half of 2017, but the timing is dictated by DOGGR, the CPUC and Blade Energy.","Next, we've settled the only criminal suit with the LA County District Attorney's Office for approximately $4 million. The settlement covers a small fine and penalty and enhancements to safety and methane monitoring at the site. The settlement is still subject to court approval.","Also, if you'll recall, we previously stated our insurance coverage was over $1 billion. We are now providing a more precise range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. We have received a total of $94 million of insurance proceeds to-date.","The total cost estimate has increased to $763 million. The increase is primary related to updated cost estimates for the third-party root cause analysis and the claims recovery process associated with the temporary relocation program. Please refer to our third quarter 2016 10-Q for more detail on the costs included and excluded from our estimated cost and our insurance coverage.","Before I hand the call over to Joe, let me discuss the management changes we recently announced. Mark Snell is going to retire in March of 2017. Although we are sad to see Mark leave, we appreciate his many contributions to Sempra.","We also announced several other management changes as part of our succession planning. One of our strengths is the ability to develop an experienced and diverse leadership team. We strive to identify talented leaders within our organization and expand their experience across different areas of our business. These management changes are part of our succession planning process to ensure all leadership transitions can be made smoothly with no disruptions to our business.","With that, I will hand it over to Joe for his last time as CFO to review the quarterly financial results, starting on slide 8.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Thanks, Debbie. Earlier this morning, we reported third quarter earnings of $622 million, or $2.46 per share. On an adjusted basis, we reported third quarter earnings of $259 million, or $1.02 per share, compared to third quarter adjusted earnings in 2015 of $248 million, or $0.99 per share.","This quarter, we have three adjustments to GAAP earnings. First, as Debbie mentioned, we completed the acquisition of PEMEX's interest in the GdC joint venture and recorded a gain of $350 million, which represents the step up in value of our previously existing ownership interest.","Second, U.S. Gas & Power closed the sale of its southeast utilities and recorded a gain of $78 million. And finally, as part of the TdM sales process, additional market information became available this quarter that required us to reconsider its current book value. As a result, we recorded a net $65 million non-cash charge at Sempra Mexico. All three of these items are excluded from third quarter 2016 adjusted earnings and our 2016 adjusted guidance.","I'd like to point out that this quarter, we adopted a new accounting standard on stock-based compensation, resulting in a benefit of $34 million retroactive to January 1, 2016, which is reflected in the results for the nine months that had no impact on third quarter results.","Please turn to slide 9, and I will discuss the key factors impacting our quarterly earnings. Quarter-over-quarter, adjusted earnings were impacted by the following items. At the California utilities, we had $21 million of higher earnings, primarily due to higher CPUC base margin, net of operating expenses.","Sempra International had $13 million of lower earnings, including a $4 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency transactional effects, and inflation in the current year, compared to a $16 million favorable impact in 2015 as a result of significant devaluation of the Mexican peso versus the dollar in 2015. This was partially offset by $5 million of higher operational earnings in Mexico and Peru.","I would also like to mention an item that didn't impact this quarter, but it could moving forward. Now that we have closed the PEMEX JV acquisition, we have larger deferred tax balances in Mexico. This increases our exposure to Mexican peso movements in the future. You can find individual financial results for our businesses in the Business Unit Earnings Section.","I will wrap up by going over a few of our highlights. Based on our financial results, we are reaffirming our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $4.60 per share to $5 per share. Our 2016 GAAP EPS guidance is $5 per share to $5.40 per share.","Our primary focus as a company is executing on our base plan. We had a strong quarter with IEnova closing the PEMEX JV acquisition and completing a $1.6 billion equity issuance. We are also working to drive additional growth with new development opportunities. Just this past quarter, additional battery storage was ordered at SDG&E and approximately 400 megawatts of renewable projects were announced at IEnova. Incremental projects like these that fit our strategy can enable us to grow during and beyond the five years of our base plan.","With that, we will conclude our prepared comments and stop to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will take our first question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Hi, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. So, quick question, following up on the LNG piece first. Can you elaborate a little bit of what the impact is to 2020? Just \u2013 if you suggest that the NPV remains the same, does that mean the tariff is actually adjusting up the NPV for you? And so, what does that mean for EPS? And then secondly, can you elaborate a little bit on the nature of the delay?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. Let me try to just give a little more color around the situation. We received notice last week of this, and what they indicated when they gave us notice was just the in-service dates that they anticipated were the three trains that I went over in the prepared remarks that that will be Train 1, mid-2018; Train 2, the end of 2018; and Train 3, mid-2019. They didn't give us any indication officially of the cause of the delay, but on their call, they indicated that there has been rain at the site and at their fabrication facility that's located near Baton Rouge. And apparently, they have some flooding, particularly at their fabrication facility.","In terms of 2020, we're not going to revise any guidance for 2020 at this point. Obviously, we have a lot going on between this and potential of the Peruvian pipeline. And so, we're not going to do any update to guidance. But we try to give you an indication as kind of the economics of the three trains \u2013 of all three trains that are operating. And what this delay would be, because we had said previously we expected all three trains to be in service by the end of 2018. So, I think with what we've given you, you could kind of calculate what you would anticipate.","In terms of the NPV, and this is very important, the way the tariff works is that the IRR was established that when we signed the contract for the project. And at the end of construction of the first train, then all of the assumptions are trued up, what the capital costs are and then what the amount is of the toll in order to maintain the IRR that was agreed upon. And so, that will occur.","And then, so we will collect those dollars to achieve the same NPV on the project as we would have, had it gone in service on the originally planned day. And the toll actually goes up in future years as the way that it's calculated. But this will cause a delay in 2018 and 2019 earnings, as I stated in my comments. I hope that was clear, Julien. Was that helpful?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Absolutely. Thank you. And then just quickly, if you can actually, on the Peru piece. I know you don't want to comment too much, but what is the nature of the, I think, \"significant issues\" that you're resolving?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Well, that mean, there's commercial issues that are in the final stages of resolution. And then, we will have a number of conditions precedent if we can reach conclusion of the commercial issues in order to be sure that we have done the kind of diligence we want on the assets. And so, I would not at all say that this is near a done deal, but we're working on it. There's still meetings going on. And so, we're hopeful but we're also cautious.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Absolutely. Thank you very much.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thank you.","Operator","And we will go next to Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Just to clarify your answer to Julien on the IRR, so it doesn't sound like it would have a material accretive impact on any one given year, given that you probably \u2013 one presumption would be that you just have an increase in the levelized toll over the course of the life of the contract in order to get back to your IRR. Is that a fair way to think about it?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","That's a fair way to think about it. And then when you calculate the NPV with the delay or without the delay, it ends up being basically the same number, close to the same number. And so, that's exactly what happened. So, it increase earnings in future years as a result of a delay. And the same thing happens if there's an increase in project costs then the toll gets adjusted.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. At what point would you be in a position to start to get liquidated damages? Are you implying that a six-month delay does not tip you into that zone in the contract, but a further delay would?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Liquidated damages would apply depending on what the source of the delay is. And that's one of the things that is going to be a subject for discussion. As I said, we just got this notice last week. And the partners have not had the opportunity to sit down with CB&I and Chiyoda, and really understand what is the source of the delays, what can be done to mitigate some of those delays. None of those discussions have occurred since this notice came last week.","Those will be occurring in the next several weeks. I will say many of us visited the site last week. Construction is progressing and that there's a lot of work that's been done on the site, but until we really sit down and understand what's driving some of the schedule changes, it's too early to speculate what the liquidated damages would be. But the contractor does have delay liquidated damages as part of their contract. And those go against capital cost for the project in reducing capital cost, so that's the way it works.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Got you. What was your peso exposure before and what is it now?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","I'm going to have Joe address that in terms of the change with the \u2013 I think you're talking about looking at the change now with the acquisition of the...","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","In other words, before the deal, what was your exposure to a given change in the exchange rate and what is it now?","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Yeah. Hi, Greg. So, what we wanted to do here is make sure that everybody had the visibility into the fact that we have monetary assets and liabilities and we have deferred taxes. And because the tax system calculates all of our taxes in pesos, these dollar-denominated items, when they're converted to pesos, obviously, can move. And so, we see some impact of that.","Over the last number of years, it's generally been a pretty close push between what was happening if the currencies are all moving in the same direction, what's happening in Chile, Peru and Mexico kind of offset each other. What we've wanted to explain is because we have more deferred taxes now, because we're acquiring the other half of this joint venture, our exposure to peso-dollar movement will move on that deferred tax liability and some of our monetary assets and liabilities.","It's hard to predict because, obviously, we would have to forecast what the effect of the dollar-peso movement would be over the course of the year. Last year, we actually had a positive, a significant positive benefit to earnings because of this.","Just to remind everybody, we do hedge our current tax liabilities. So, if there's a cash impact, then we hedge that to make sure we don't have a cash impact, but we don't hedge the deferred tax liabilities because it's just an accounting item that moves up and down and that would be costly to do.","So, I can't give you a precise number. What we wanted to give you some visibility into is, we've been saying for the past five years or so, that we have a natural hedge between Chile, Peru and Mexico when the currencies are moving in the same direction against the dollar. Now, it'll be a little bit more tilted to Mexico. It can move up and it can move down and it will. And so, there'll be a little bit more exposure, but again, it's a non-cash exposure.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Got you. Final question. Can you give us what the earnings impact is of the renewable energy projects on page 6 that you won are relative to the base case that you gave out at Analyst Day?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","No. We don't \u2013 I mean, we don't give project-by-project earnings. What we'll do is when we give you our updates on the February call for 2017, and then we give you our update at the Analyst Conference for 2018, we'll give you that information as part of our adjusted projection. So, we don't do them by projects. But they're the same. What I would say is, our renewable projects are all like high single-digit returns and that, this is about 400 megawatts in total of the adds that will come in over the next three years or so.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","When you say returns, you're meaning return on equity, IRR? How should \u2013 something like that?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. Non-levered IRR. Yeah.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thank you.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Chris Turnure with JPMorgan.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. Sticking with Cameron Trains 1 through 3 for a second. I just wanted to understand maybe some context with other larger projects that you guys have done in the past and any issues that you might have had there? When you see something like this kind of get announced by the contractor this early in the process and taking the consideration that you have built in kind of time and cost contingencies into the overall package so far, where do we shake out here, is this the contractor being especially conservative and maybe there's a chance down the road that they get back on schedule or is this kind of a sign of something even worse to come?","And then just a point of clarification as well on the kind of NPV staying whole, are you guys being made whole for that if the contractor is not responsible then just I guess, mathematically, it would be the counter-parties that are absorbing all of that potential risk, if that's correct?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Okay. Let me try to address \u2013 I think there were multiple questions in there, so let me try to address those. If you look at the delay notice, like I said, we just got it last week. We have not had the opportunity to sit down with the contractor and discuss, we'll be doing that within the next week or so. What I will say, though, is that the project is about 57% complete in total. And all the materials are on site for the construction. We were there last week. All of the cooling units were on Train 1. I mean, there's been a lot of construction progress and so it's not like early \u2013 not really early on, I would say, in the progress of the project. And it's the contractors' responsibility when they feel that there is a potential for a delay to give us those notifications and that's what they did just last week.","As I said, all we know is that on their call, they said that there was rain at the site and at their fabrication facility that caused some flooding. We don't know what the actual cause of the delay is, until we get in and have a chance to have them explain to us what they're looking at, and then look at what the potential is to mitigate some of those. It's really hard for us to assess the likelihood of it getting better through those discussions, but we'll be making every effort to have that occur.","I'm not sure if I answered all of your questions with that. I think there was one other thing that I might have missed, but...","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","About the NPV...","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","NPV.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","...if it's not the contractor, does it go to a customer?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. And it does go through the toll to the customers. And that was the agreement that was established, that all of the LDs (28:08) would go against the capital cost which would also reduce the toll to the customer. So, to the extent there's a delay that's caused by the contractor, the customers benefit from that in a reduced toll, because it reduces capital cost, but to the extent that there's a delay and that that increases the toll.","And that's the way we designed it. Everyone was full knowledge. I mean, part of the thing that's actually very good is that when we did our contract, we really tried to mitigate the risk for Sempra in terms of the long-term value of this project. And so, we set it up to where we were not the ones that bore the risk for these things. And that the NPV of the project remain the same and that the contractor has responsibility for delay. And the contractor has a lump sum turnkey contract. The only way that they can increase cost is by change orders.","So, that was the design of the project, to really mitigate the risk long-term to our shareholders. And I think it's showing that it's pretty effective in doing that in the long-term, while it may affect some of the shorter term.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","I think it's important, too, to have perspective about over four-year construction project starting when we took up ID (29:25) in 2014 and going through now. And this is moving from their information to us, a fairly small amount in terms of that, but we wanted you to all understand what the impact could be to some of the earnings numbers that we've given you, because even though it's a small percentage on the construction timeline, we wanted everybody to see the visibility to that.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for that extra clarity there. That's helpful to hear. And then just on the Peruvian project, I understand that you can't give us much in the way of detail around the negotiations right now or kind of maybe the timing of that specifically. But were you to be successful, would this require Sempra level equity and what would that mean in terms of the current plan to end the repatriation of cash at the end of, I think, 2018?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","All I can tell you on that is, those are all things we're looking at right now and looking what the alternatives are. And that, until we know if we have the project and we know what it would cost and we know what the cash flows are going to be on it, it's really difficult to give any speculation. I'm not going to speculate on that.","When we update our numbers, you'll see some of that. And we will \u2013 if we get the project, then our numbers will be updated when we do the call on the Analyst Conference.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And that was something where previously when you were negotiating for that a couple of years ago, you hadn't given any numbers out at that time either?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. And, no, we haven't given any numbers. We don't give numbers if we don't \u2013 until we know we have something, until we know how we're going to finance it, and that we have some confidence in the numbers. So...","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's clear. Thanks, guys.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thanks.","Operator","We will go next to Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Good morning, Stephen.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Most of my questions have been hit on. I just wanted to discuss Aliso Canyon. You've given an updated insurance range. I wondered if you could just talk at a high level as to what caused the adjustment to that range. And then, sort of related, when you look at all the claims, how are you generally feeling in terms of ability of your insurance to cover those claims?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. We're still feeling good about our insurance ability to cover the claims. And when we looked at \u2013 we looked at our reserve on an ongoing basis, based upon new knowledge of cost. One of the key things that caused our estimate to go up is the work that's being done on the root cause analysis and the fact that the third parties that are doing work on that are expecting a delay. And with the expectation of a delay in getting the outcome there, we would expect the cost to be slightly higher. And so, we took that into account.","And then the other thing is, we're going through now recovery with our insurance on all the relocation expense, and validating all of the claims, so we have full insurance recoverability. And that \u2013 and going through that, that has taken a lot more detail type of work to get the claims ready, and so we included some of the costs associated with that. Those were the two drivers for the change in cost.","I will say, these costs will be updated over time though, as we get into litigation, as we get into \u2013 knowing what legal costs we're incurring and knowing what litigation claims, any settlements that have been reflected with parties on any of the potential claims, fines or penalties, or other claims.","As an example on this reserve, we did reach a settlement with the LA County DA, District Attorney, on the criminal charges and reached a settlement on that. And so, once we could quantify that, then that goes into the reserve number that we give you. So, those are the kinds of things that would continue to flow through in updates of that reserve.","We've also spent, though, time looking at our insurance. And looking at what the types of claims we have, the types of claims that have been filed and what the insurance coverage is and being able to refine that a bit. And so, we're able to give you kind of a better estimate of what the range of insurance we believe is available.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. That's all I have. Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Faisel Khan with Citigroup.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Hi, Faisel.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good morning. I just want to understand with the delay in Trains 1 through 3, does that affect the marketing at all of Train 4?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Not directly, but I think indirectly in that, in order to go forward with Train 4, we need a few things. We need our partner consent. And as I said, we're working with one of the partners to try to get their consent. They've decided to not put equity in. And so, we're trying to look at how we would structure to move forward without them contributing equity, and have been having numerous ongoing discussions and communications with them about trying to resolve that.","The other thing is, we need lenders' consent to move forward with Train 4. And the lenders are going to want to see that we've made reasonable progress on Trains 1 through 3, before giving that. So, that would be how I would see it having some impact, but it's not a direct impact.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Got it. And then, on the renewable projects in Mexico. I'm just trying to understand at a high-level, just trying to understand the potential growth in the renewables business within Mexico. Is the transmission system within the country well-developed enough to sort of handle all this wind and some of these solar projects coming online? I'm just trying to understand if these megawatts make it to market or are we getting too far ahead of ourselves before the transmission's developed?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Actually, that was one of the things that we looked at very carefully when we looked at \u2013 the one we acquired is already in operation. So, the transmission is there. And the two projects that we bid on, the solar projects that we won, we looked very carefully at what the transmission was, and we were very selective on what we bid based upon that. But there's great opportunity in transmission in Mexico. They're expecting two bids to be out within the next \u2013 in 2017 that would each be about $1.2 billion for transmission upgrades to their system. And that's a great opportunity for IEnova to participate in those bids.","I think you will see a lot more. As you've seen in other markets where renewables start getting integrated, I think you will see a lot more investment in electric transmission occurring in Mexico. But, in the near-term, they've already announced those two bids.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Got you. And then you guys' decision to participate in the equity offering, the amount that you guys decided to take down the equity offering, was there some calculus behind that in terms of how you came to that amount?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","I'm going to ask Joe to talk about that, because there was some \u2013 a lot of thought about where want it to be and where we want to position ourselves for now. But I'm going to ask Joe to address that.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Thanks, Debbie. Hi, Faisel. Yeah. We said last year when we announced the deal for the PEMEX JV that we would basically take two years of the dividend flows from IEnova to us, hold those in our Mexican holding company and reinvest that. And we said it would probably be in the $300 million to $350 million range.","And Mark and I spend a lot of time with Carlos talking about how much we should take. We got a lot of advice from our IEnova investors of how you guys should maybe not do it, we want to own more. So, definitely there was a lot of demand for this equity which was great. The roadshow was very similar to the IPO. We got a lot of orders every day and it was a really amazing roadshow with the investors.","At the end of the day, we wanted to make sure, because we really love these assets and this business that we maintained a strong ownership interest in it. And so, we kind of went to the max, because we were actually issuing more equity than we originally put on the table when we started the roadshow and upside to that amount. So, we did about the top end of what we said we were going to do.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Got it. And then just on Aliso, I mean, is it possible \u2013 can the in-service date or the return of the service of the storage facility, can that be before the root cause analysis is done or do we have to wait for that to get done? I'm just trying to understand if there's \u2013 if that can actually happen before there's a resolution.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yes. It can happen before the root cause analysis is done. Let me have Dennis kind of walk you through what the process is that DOGGR and the CPUC will use over the next month or so. As we did make our filing yesterday to put the field back in service and for DOGGR and CPUC to do the certification that's required. So, Dennis, do you want to kind of walk...","Dennis V. Arriola - Sempra Energy","Sure. Hi, Faisel. Yeah. When the new law SB 380 was put in place, it was put in \u2013 it was established independently of when the root cause analysis was going to be completed. There are basically two different tracks there that we've complied with everything that's required under \u2013 we believe, under SB 380 and that's why we made the filing yesterday.","So, the process now is that DOGGR and the Public Utilities Commission are going to be reviewing all of the data and the information that we submitted. They're required under the law to hold a public hearing, which they have to give 15-day notice to. And we expect that sometime soon, they'll establish the date for that and they'll go through the process. But as Debbie mentioned, they are independent tracks all together, the root cause analysis, as well as the satisfaction of the comprehensive safety review that's laid out in SB 380.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Okay. That makes sense. I just want to wish Mark well in his retirement in case I didn't get a chance...","Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy","Thanks, Faisel.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","...to talk to him before the next quarterly call.","Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy","Yeah. Okay.","Operator","We will go next to Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Hi, Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Hi. Hi, Debbie. I know you don't have specifics on why the six-month delay, but could you maybe just \u2013 is there a way you can make us more comfortable that six months doesn't turn into 12 months or 18 months? Could you talk about that or less, but why should we be worried about it being more?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. I mean, I think that if you look at where construction is now, a lot of the major pieces of construction have been done. And some of the issues that were the most critical that have more time sensitivity dealt with all the foundational work, and that's all been done.","So, I mean, I think when you see the progress, and some of you will see the progress when you visit the facility, you'll get a sense that the work is moving forward, it's up to the contractor to give us their best estimates of the timeframe, and it's probably not in their interest to give us something that they don't feel like they're going to be able to meet. And so, at this point in time, we feel all we had is their estimate and that we have to have some credibility.","I think our view is that there are some things that might be done that could actually shorten some of the timeframes. But we don't know what the issues are that were driving the delays. And so, that's one of the things that we need to spend some time on. And so, I'd love to give you comfort, but until we get through some of those discussions with the contractor, I don't think it's a thing that I should be doing.","I think we need to go through those discussions, have those discussions, understand the delay, look at the mitigation plans to the extent possible to try to reduce delays, and then come up with what we really all feel is the correct information.","And we did not want to not tell you about this, because we got this notification. We all know it also puts us in a difficult position because we feel that we can work some of this, but we haven't had the time to do that yet. And we will, and by the time we talk to you again, we will have that information.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","I don't know, Oct\u00e1vio, do you want to add anything to that?","Oct\u00e1vio Sim\u00f5es - Sempra LNG Corp","No.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Okay.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","And just one other clarification on Cameron is the \u2013 are weather conditions and flooding and things like that something that would be kind of like a force majeure on a timing or no?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Not just weather conditions, no. There are certain provisions of the contract that are very well-defined as what constitutes the force majeure. And just having rain and bad weather would not be a force majeure.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Great. Switching gears just to detail clarifications. The $34 million of stock-based comp change, is that pre-tax or after-tax? And would you still be in your range for this year if that did not happen?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Let's have Trevor talk about it.","Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy","Yeah, Steve, this is Trevor. That's a tax item, so it's really an after-tax adjustment.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then would you still be in your range this year if that had not happened?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yes.","Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy","Yes. Yes, we would.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then just on the PEMEX currency volatility, should we assume that it's still kind of goes the same way as in the past, i.e., if the peso weakens, it tends to be a benefit; and if the peso strengthens, it tends to be a hurt, or is that also unpredictable?","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Steve, this is Joe. Yeah. I would say generally that is correct. Because it measures deferred taxes and monetary assets and liabilities, it could swing around if we had cash positions or debt positions and the deferred taxes, of course, over time will move. So, I think, directionally, you have it right, it should be in the same direction.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Yes.","Operator","We will go next to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Couple of questions. First of all, your thoughts on U.S. renewable opportunities for Sempra. Just curious in terms of whether you still see significant opportunities at all or none for either contracted wind or contracted solar growth for U.S. Gas & Power?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","We see some great opportunities for growth in renewables. And we're working on several projects where we've secured kind of the rights and the contracts and that are in early stages of development. We have the ability to expand the Mesquite side. We have the ability to expand the Broken Bow Wind side. And so, we think that with all of the RPS standards that are coming across the country that there are some good growth opportunities for renewables.","I will say that the returns on renewables have gone down over time. And so, what we look at is, we really have good projects that have decent returns on them, because otherwise we can invest our capital. And so, we always look at the allocation of our capital to the projects to give us the highest returns. And since we're not \u2013 renewable is just one of the things we do. We're not going to just go after building megawatts. We're going to go after building megawatts that give us good return on our capital.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you, Debbie. One other question back to the U.S. utilities and sorry if I'm staying a little U.S. centric here. What's not in the CapEx guidance that you laid out at the Analyst Day this summer, but that could provide upside to U.S. utility rate base growth? I'm thinking things like Otay Mesa, which I don't think was in that guidance. But what else is kind of in there that when I think about the next three years to five years could lead to higher rate base than what you laid out in July?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Well, you actually named one. So, let me turn it to Jeff, and he can talk about SDG&E, and then Dennis can talk about SoCalGas, because there are a number of things that we're working on right now including the potential of a DC transmission line. So, Jeff?","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","Good morning, Michael. We laid out at our Analyst Conference some of these green box items, which were not in the plan that could provide some additional upside. Now, just to give you a brief update, I mean one of the things I think we've done relatively successful is you've got to be able to manage both your GRC capital and the capital for projects which are proved outside the GRC.","So, just recently, we've had, just to be sure, we've had $1 billion of incremental projects approved, that's not incremental to the plan, but that's outside the GRC. That's the Cleveland National Forest Project, Sycamore-PQ as well as the batteries which were discussed earlier on the call. So, we're making great progress there for our 2016, 2017 and 2018 capital plan, it was roughly $3.5 billion, $3.25 billion of that has already been approved and it's going forward. So, that really gives us a lot of confidence in terms of the certainty of our future capital plan.","In terms of things which are not in the plan, Debbie touched on the DC line, this is the Southwest Power link which originates in Arizona. We think there's an opportunity as we think about providing more reliability particularly into the LA Basin of giving access to more renewables and more power from that Palo Verde, generating center in Arizona back into California, that's one project of about $1 billion.","Secondly, we think there's an increased opportunity for batteries. At San Diego Gas & Electric by the end of Q1, we will have just over 50 megawatts of utility-owned batteries. And we think there's an incremental 200 megawatt opportunity. That's really associated with this new bill which was passed this year, which is AB 2868, which called for 500 megawatts of new batteries to be installed, split one-third between the three industrial and utilities.","Otay Mesa you referenced, which is a 600 megawatt combined cycle plant in the heart of our load center, that is subject to a put-call arrangement with Calpine. And as you may recall, I think correctly from our last Analyst Conference that was not included in our five-year plan.","And then the last thing I'd mention is electric vehicles. I mean, with the passage of SB 32, we're now required to drive our greenhouse gas emissions footprint in California 40% below 1990 over the next 14 years, and almost 50% of that has to come from the transportation sector. In fact, that's close to 53% or 54% in our service territories.","So, big picture on this greenhouse gas issue, Michael, is you've only got about 10% of the greenhouse gas emissions coming from electric generation that sits inside the State of California. Maybe another 8% to 10% outside the state. There's no question, if the state is serious about meeting its goals, we have to have a revolution around the transportation sector. And I think almost in every scenario, the California utilities will play big in that space.","Dennis V. Arriola - Sempra Energy","Hey, Michael, this is Dennis Arriola. Let me just touch on three things real quick. One is, we expect that going forward, there's going to be new national or state rules or regulations on storage. And I think that that's an opportunity as we continue to enhance the overall infrastructure and the safety of all of our facilities. That's number one.","The second, and we've touched on this a little bit but we're seeing more momentum here in the state, is focusing on using natural gas for heavy duty transportation, so the fueling infrastructure around that.","And then thirdly, focusing on the gathering and cleaning of renewable natural gas from landfills and dairies and things. So, we're not going to give out dollar amounts for those yet, but I think those are three areas that we definitely see opportunity and upside for our gas companies here in California.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated. Mark, congrats, and look forward to seeing you out fly fishing at some point.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","And we will go next to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good morning.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Hi, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just want to follow-up on the LNG just a little bit more. The joint venture contractors, can you just review the credit support and what you have with respect to their ability to \u2013 just their financial wherewithal to, their guarantees and what have you for the project?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Sure. I'm going to have \u2013 I can give a high level, but I'm going to have Joe or Mark address more details. We do have performance assurances with CB&I and Chiyoda; they have a joint and several guarantee from each of the parties and a letter of credit as a backstop. So, we have that. And I don't know if you guys want to add anything more to that. Okay.","Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy","We have \u2013 there's very strong credit support.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. I just wanted to review that. And then the \u2013 I mean, is it unusual for them to sort of call up and say, we've got a problem, but not tell you what the cause of the problem is?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","What they have to do is they have to lay out the detailed schedule of everything that they expect to happen like with the construction and the new detailed schedule. And we just go that, I think it was Friday of last week. And so, that's how they begin the discussion on this is that they lay out a new detailed schedule, and then the discussion comes around that new detailed schedule. So, as I said, we just got that Friday, I think it was of last week. And then, that will begin the discussions. So, I mean, that's kind of the process. They are the ones responsible for giving official notification. And that was the process that they followed.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then, the Train 4, the partner who dropped out, can you tell us a little bit more about which partner that is and why they dropped out?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","No. But...","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","...I can just tell you why they've indicated that they don't want to do it. It's a company that's changed their strategy, and is really focused on some downstream more now and more clean green energy. And so, they are looking not to invest major portions of their capital in LNG, and that's what they indicated to us. It was a strategy change.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then, the accounting change, the $34 million stock compensation, what triggered that? What was the reason why that happened? And is there any impact past this year for 2017 or beyond?","Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy","Yeah. This is Trevor. That was as a result of an accounting standard update which was 2016-09 that we implemented and we early adopted this year. So, historically, what you've done is you've taken that tax benefit and it's gone straight to APIC or accumulated \u2013 or paid-in capital. Now, it's trying to simplify the accounting associated with that, and so you take that tax benefit and you push it through the P&L. So going forward, we'll treat it the same way.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Meaning going forward, will \u2013 I'm sorry to be slow, but what that does mean in terms of...","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Yeah. There'll be earnings going forward...","Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy","Yes.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","...of similar amount. It won't always be the same, because it will depend on what restricted stock and other stock is vesting. Many other utilities have also adopted it this year.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. So, that should be good for earnings going forward. Am I right?","Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy","That's right.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then maybe in a similar amount.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Well, assuming \u2013 it could go...","Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy","Yeah, it can go either way.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah, I don't want to give an \u2013 yeah, inference that you can add $34 million a year. That's not the way it works. So, why don't you discuss how it works.","Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy","Yeah. The way it works is \u2013 when the original grant is issued, that stock-based compensation is an expense. And you take that tax benefit. If it vests at a higher amount and the stock price increases, then there's more of a tax deduction in those future years. And so, historically, the stock price has been rising. And the grants have been vesting at the multiplier, meaning that there is a higher tax benefit in future years.","That tax benefit has historically gone through adjusted trading (55:20) capital. And now, the accounting standard says, put it through the P&L. So, going forward, we anticipate, assuming that the stock price continues to rise, and that the multiplier effect is in place, like it has been in the past years, we would get a similar type benefit. If it doesn't, if the stock price were to go down and it still vests, it could actually have a decrement to earnings in the future, but that's just how it can go both ways.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","What if there was no change in the stock price?","Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy","Then there would be \u2013 then you would not have that tax benefit when those stocks vest because you take that tax benefit when you issue the grant over those periods.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks so much for the clarification. And congratulations to Mark.","Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy","Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Andy Levi with Avon Capital.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital","Hi. Good morning still.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Hi, Andy.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital","On the letter of credit that you mentioned, how large is the letter of credit?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","You're talking about the Cameron letter of credit?","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital","That's correct. How big is it?","Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy","I don't know offhand. I don't remember offhand.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. We'll have to get back to you.","Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy","Yeah. I don't remember offhand. We'll get it to you.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital","Is it hundreds of millions or $100 million or...","Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy","No, no. We'll get back to you.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","We'll get the information.","Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy","I don't want to give you a bad number.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","We'll get the information.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital","That's fine. And what triggers it?","Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy","It would be a default.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Non-performance.","Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy","Non-performance, yeah.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital","It's non-performance. Okay. And then, are there any, like, surety insurers like surety bonds or anything like that or nothing like that?","Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy","No. No. This is \u2013 keep in mind this is a very, very large project. There's really not that much bonding capacity in the market.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","And one very large credit-worthy counterparties on the other side and a big joint venture.","Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy","Yeah. Well, yeah. And keep in mind the \u2013 you're talking just about the contractor here.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital","Yeah.","Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy","These are very large credit-worthy companies, and so it would be unusual to have that kind of a bonding capacity and a project that size.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. I want to stress, as I said, that between CB&I and Chiyoda is a joint and several guarantee.","Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy","Right.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","So, they basically assume each other's responsibility, so...","Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy","And I don't \u2013 but I also think too there's no indication that they're not performing. But they have an obligation under the contract to tell us if they think there's going to be a delay. They've notified us of that, and we'll work through it to see if we can mitigate it. But they're not saying that they can't finish the job.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital","And I know that you haven't spoken to them, but it's just based on your comments, it seems that the delay seems to be around the flooding, right, and all the rain that you had down there, is that correct? Is that kind of your plan?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","All we can say on that is that what they think, didn't give us any official notification and the information that they sent to us. So, when we listen to their earnings call, on the earnings call, they said that there was rain at the site and the site of their fabrication facility that's located near Baton Rouge that caused some flooding, and that they expected some delays in construction. That's what they said on their call. You can listen to their call and get the precise language. I'm just kind of reiterating what they've said.","But we don't have any official notification. And we will be meeting with them soon. It's something where all the partners have to sit down with them together. So, it's not something that you can do instantly because this is a joint venture. And so, it will be our self and our three partners sitting down with CB&I and Chiyoda. And I think it's scheduled within the next week or two for that meeting to occur.","To really go through, as I said, they give us this massive package that has a detailed schedule that they produced on the construction. And someone asked me, what gives you some assurances, well, part of the whole effort is to go through that detailed schedule that they gave us and to ensure that everything has been given consideration. And that's the process they need to go through.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital","Okay. The last question I have and I apologize if I'm not as familiar. I'm very familiar with CB&I. But Chiyoda, how are they \u2013 I guess what they're a separate company unrelated to CB&I or they're a subsidiary that does this type of work with them or what's the relationship?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","It is a huge multinational company that's not at all private CB&I other than through this joint venture. It's a Japanese-owned construction company. I don't know what their market cap is or but it's, yeah.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital","I get it. Yeah. I'm not that smart. Okay. Thank you very much.","Debra L.

(Operator Instructions). At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead, sir.","Rick Vaccari","Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today we'll be discussing Sempra Energy's third quarter 2014 financial results and business update. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the investor section. With us today in San Diego are several members of our management team.","Debbie Reed, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mark Snell, President, Joe Householder, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Martha Wyrsch, Executive Vice President and General Counsel and Trevor Mihalik, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer.","Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today.","The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and that we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our third quarter 2014 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures.","I would also like to note that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, November 4th, 2014 and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.","With that please turn to slide 3 and let me hand the call over to Debbie.","Debbie Reed","Thanks Rick and thanks to all of you who are joining us today. Our third quarter earnings were very strong and I am confident that our 2014 earnings will be near the upper end of our guidance range. We are also well-positioned to execute on our five year growth plan. As we begin today, I'd like to start off a little differently by giving you an overview of the progress we are making on key business initiatives and strategies.","This will give you a good sense of how we expect to achieve our growth rate of 9% to 11% through 2019. Over the past few months I've been on the road meeting with many of you. Since I most often asked about our long-term growth prospects, I thought it would be helpful to start with a progress update. So today I will begin with a review of some of the projects in our five-year plan and the status of additional development opportunities that could add to our long-term growth. After providing you with this broader context, I'll hand the call over to Joe to discuss the quarterly earnings and then we will take your questions.","Please turn to slide 4, for several years we have chartered a path to exit merchant generation as it no longer fits with our long term contracted infrastructure strategy. On October 29th we signed a definitive agreement to sell the last block of Mesquite power plant. The book value of the plant is approximately $300 million and the sale is at a premium to book value.","We expect to close this transaction around year-end subject to regulatory approval and transfer of the existing contract. Any gains in the sale is not included in our 2014 guidance.","Shifting to our U.S. midstream business, we now have 20 year contracts for the full 1.8 Bcf per day at East to West capacity on the REX pipeline. Due to significant additional demand for capacity out of the Marcellus and Utica, we conducted a nonbinding open season for expansion. The REX joint venture is finalizing precedent agreements with interested shippers and we should be able to report results within a few months. Other market developments that could enhance REX's long-term value include the build out of additional laterals such as the proposed Prairie State Pipeline.","Growth in our REX distributions from these recent developments is an important factor as we consider the structure and timing for a potential MLP or YieldCo which we will discuss later on the call. In addition to REX our U.S. Gas and Power business is preparing bids for two natural gas pipeline lines in Texas that are being tendered by Mexico's Electricity Commission, the CFE. We expect to hear the results of those bids early next year.","Now, let's turn to slide 5. A significant component of U.S. Gas and Power's natural gas strategy is to leverage our core competencies and asset positions to build a broader LNG business. The progress we have made getting Cameron Liquefaction into construction positions us well to expand our LNG footprint. In October, the joint venture for Cameron became effective. We contributed our asset to the JV and our partners made their initial capital contributions and reimbursed us for their share of development costs.","We began drying up on our financing and issued the full notice to proceed to our EPC contractors for construction. The combination of forming the joint venture and moving from the development phase to the construction phase where we have a fixed price turnkey EPC contract is another huge step that gives us confidence the project will be successful and profitable for Sempra. We remain on track to complete all three trains in 2018.","Moving to the next steps and growing our LNG business, our U.S. development efforts are progressing on two fronts. We are assessing opportunities to develop Cameron trains four and five and a liquefaction plant at Port Arthur and we continue to receive strong customer interest for both.","As we advance our analysis, we will gain more clarity on the prospects and timing for development of these two projects. With regard to Cameron trains four and five, the JV is progressing with a permitting work and we expect to initiate our FERC filing in the first half of 2015. At this time, we would expect to complete the permitting process within about two years after filing.","Since trains four and five will likely replicate the current design at Cameron, we may be able to accelerate the environmental review process and shorten approval time frames. Sempra has the contractual rights to 50% of the equity and capacity in the expansion. Unit costs should be comparable to the current project and therefore quite competitive. Our goal is to have the contracts in place and approvals necessary to allow for continuous construction following completion of trains one through three.","For those of you who are less familiar with Port Arthur, we have a 2900 acre land position with three miles of waterfront connecting directly to the Gulf of Mexico. The location is on a deep water channel that could accommodate LNG carriers of all sizes.","Port Arthur has been permitted in the past for both LNG and crude import facilities. We are assessing the site for the possible combined use of LNG and\/or liquids export and are discussing its development with several potential customers. Initial studies suggest the site could reasonably accommodate four trains similar in size to those at Cameron as well as other uses.","Our goal is to complete our site plan, negotiate contracts with customers and initiate our FERC filing next year.","Now, please turn to slide 6 for developments in our international businesses. In Mexico, we are making progress on our gas studies to determine the size, structure and economics of an LNG export facility at ECA. We should have a better sense of these factors and potential timing in the first half of next year. We continue to see strong interest from potential off-takers, but since this facility is fully contracted as an import facility through 2028, we must consider the impact on contracts with existing customers and the resulting project economics before proceeding.","Another infrastructure, IEnova is continuing to meet key construction milestones on its major projects. The first phase of the Sonora pipeline was completed in October and Los Ramones 1 pipeline should be completed in December. Together, they represent about $1 billion in capital expenditure.","IEnova is also in the final stages of construction on the ethane pipeline and ESJ wind generation project. Near term development opportunities include the 17 natural gas pipelines outlined in the government's five-year infrastructure plan. Although the process is running a few months behind initial scheduling, the CFE is moving forward and making progress on the tenders.","IEnova has submitted a bid for the contracted pipeline and is preparing a bid for the second. As I mentioned, our U.S. Gas and Power business is preparing bids for the third and fourth pipeline. You can refer to the appendix for additional details on all 17.","Turning to energy reform, we see a long runway of opportunities resulting from the country's energy transformation. In addition to the $13 billion of investment expected in natural gas pipelines, the government identified $14 billion of power generation projects, $2 billion of electric transmission projects and over $250 billion of energy investments in other sectors.","We are working to build upon our past success and become a first mover in several of these new areas of opportunity. While we expect to have increased competition for projects, we\u2019ve worked over many years to develop our competitive advantage in Mexico. For example, IEnova has the largest in country presence among competitors with over 560 local employees. Based on our large and ongoing construction program, we\u2019ve a deep and experienced team who has demonstrated the ability to deliver projects on time and on budget.","We also have a long history of being able to work success successfully with local communities. This is essential for secure sing rights of way. Moving to Peru, our electric distribution company has received regulatory approval for a transmission plan that entails building several substations and transmission lines in Lima. The plan will require about $150 million of incremental investment from 2015 to 2017. Capital expenditures will earn the regulated 12% rate of return.","Let's go now to slide 7. At our California utilities, both our basic operations and projects are performing well and we continue to pursue additional growth opportunities. At SoCalGas we received regulatory approval of our framework and are currently ramping up on 17 pipeline construction projects and a valve enhancement initiative, all part of our $1.5 billion PSEP program.","The advanced metering program at SoCalGas is also ahead of schedule and we expect to have about 2.9 million meters installed by year end. As you are aware, SoCalGas has made a filing at the CPUC for an $800 million to $850 million Southern gas system reliability project designed to reinforce the gas transmission system and provide stronger access to supply points and gas storage. This is very important for both gas and electric system reliability.","As expected, several alternate proposals have been filed, but we continue to believe our plan is superior. We expect the CPUC to rule late next year. At SDG&E, we are on track with our $1.1 billion capital plan for 2014 and received notice from the ISO that we were awarded an additional $60 million electric transmission project in our service territory.","On the regulatory front, we have two important matters at the Commission and both are moving forward. We reached an amended settlement agreement with key parties on the Son's [ph] plant closure and expect CPUC approval this year. The revisions made to the settlement address all issues raised by the assigned commissioner and these revisions did not result in a material impact to Sempra's 2014 financial results. We submitted our notice of intent to file our 2016 general rate case at both utilities. The Office of Ratepayer Advocates recommended acceptance and we expect to file our official applications by year end.","Let's turn to slide 8 for an update on our ongoing assessment of MLPs. We\u2019re focused on finalizing our analysis of the pros and cons of different structures. We continue to look at the traditional MLP structure as well as a variety of YieldCo like structures that are designed for growth and distributions. To simplify terminology we refer to the latter as total return vehicles or TRVs. The key issues for us include alignment with our strategies and growth initiatives, value creation for Sempra shareholders, flexibility and the potential asset mix, liquidity and size of the potential investor base and volatility and trading history of existing entities.","We are on path to conclude our analysis by the end of the first quarter 2015 and hope to provide you more detail around our strategy at that time.","With that, let me hand the call over to Joe to provide additional context on this topic and to walk you through the quarterly earnings. Joe?","Joe Householder","Thanks, Debbie. Turning to slide 9, we discuss certain factors we\u2019re analyzing to inform our decision regarding a potential MLP or TRV. First and foremost, as Debbie just mentioned, the structure must be aligned with our strategy and enhance long-term value for Sempra shareholders. The earnings per share, dividend per share and cash flow impact for Sempra are a focus of our analysis.","If an MLP or a TRV is pursued, we will work with the rating agencies to maintain our solid investment grade credit ratings. In our decision process we will follow the same discipline we used in launching the highly successful IEnova IPO. One important factor is the asset base. In our portfolio, we have assets with long-term cash flows that are currently available for formation of a vehicle. In the case of an MLP, we could include our share of REX distributions and potentially the U.S. based contracted revenues from the ECA re-gas terminal.","In the case of a TRV, we could include these assets as well as certain of our wind and solar assets. We also have a variety of assets we expect to be available for future growth. In either an MLP or a TRV, Cameron Liquefaction could be the asset providing the largest cash distribution growth after all three trains are online. We could also have available LNG development projects, our Cameron pipeline, other qualifying midstream and storage assets, if market conditions improve.","Additional renewables in operation or in development as well as other non-qualifying infrastructure could also be available for future growth in a TRV. Let's go to slide 10. On this slide, we break down the key attributes often used for comparison between an MLP and a TRV.","As you know, the traditional MLP relies on qualifying assets while a TRV could include any asset with certainty in its long-term cash distribution profile. You are likely familiar with differences in the investor base between an MLP and a TRV. Governance and tax impacts, however, are becoming more common between the two. While we were initially focused on an MLP structure, we understand that the tax shield for a TRV is essentially equivalent to the tax shield that MLP unit holders enjoy.","For a TRV, a tax loss can be carried forward to offset potential future taxable income. Analysis suggests that similar to an MLP, a TRV's tax yield can be maintained over time through growth. With regard to potential sponsor implications, asset quality and incentive distribution rights are important for valuation in either structure. As Debbie mentioned earlier, we\u2019re considering these issues and are on a path to conclude our analysis by the end of the first quarter 2015.","Let's now turn to slide 11 and I will conclude with a discussion of our third quarter earnings. Sempra's third quarter consolidated earnings were $348 million or $1.39 per share. This compares to consolidated earnings of $296 million or $1.19 per share in the same quarter last year. As we normally do, we\u2019re providing individual financial results for each of our business units in the section of our presentation entitled business unit earnings.","For this call, however, I'm going to focus only on the key drivers of our consolidated third quarter earnings, beginning on slide 12. Increased quarterly earnings relative to 2013 are due largely to five items. The California utilities had a combined $13 million of increased earnings due to higher CPUC based margin and improved operating performance.","In 2014, the California utilities had a combined $10 million favorable impact for prior year's income tax issues, compared to a $2 million unfavorable impact in 2013. IEnova finalized the sale of a 50% equity interest in. As a result of the transaction, we recorded a $14 million after-tax gain, of which of half or $7 million is attributable to the re-measurement of our retained interest to fair value. In Mexico, we recorded $14 million of AFUDC equity earnings associated with construction of the say another ray pipeline.","U.S. Gas and Power recorded a $25 million benefit related to the release of a Louisiana income tax valuation allowance. In past years we incurred losses for operations located in Louisiana. We recorded a valuation allowance against the deferred income tax benefit at that time, due to the lack of offsetting income. With advancement of Cameron Liquefaction and prospects for future earnings in Louisiana, we were able to release the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. Partially offsetting these five drivers were two items. One item was the $24 million gain recorded in 2013 from the sale of a 50% interest in two solar projects. The second item relates to $8 million in higher income tax expense for South America in 2014, primarily related to Chilean tax reform. As I mentioned on our first quarter call, Chile was considering a tax reform proposal that would increase the corporate tax rate.","The President of Chile signed the tax reform bill into law on September 29th, and the $6 million impact reflects the re-measurement of our deferred tax balances.","Now let's go to slide 13. To conclude, our businesses are performing well and we are on track to execute on our five-year growth plan. Cameron is in construction and new contracts on REX are also in place. IEnova's construction on major projects is progressing on time and year-to-date earnings for Sempra Mexico operations are higher than last year, despite $16 million of higher non-controlling interest in 2014. In South America, earnings reflect a couple of items worth mentioning.","Year-to-date earnings primarily for Chile continue to be impacted by a weaker peso to dollar exchange rate. As we have discussed previously, tariffs in our South American utilities are generally adjusted for foreign currency changes over time. Chilean tax reform also impacted earnings this quarter. Despite these considerations, our South American utilities remain fundamentally sound and show continued growth in customers and sales.","Finally, our California utilities have their major capital programs in place and earnings continue to reflect a higher CPUC base margin and improved operating results. As Debbie noted earlier, based on third quarter earnings and our year-to-date financial performance, we expect to be near the upper end of our 2014 earnings guidance range of $4.25 per share to $4.55 per share.","With that, we will conclude our prepared comments and stop to take any questions that you may have.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). We'll go first to Greg Gordon with Evercore.","Greg Gordon \u2013 Evercore","I've got one question on the quarter and one question on some of the drivers. I guess I'll start with the quarter. As I look at the summary on page 13, it looks like the \u2013 I'm sorry, not the summary on page 13, the summary on page 12 with all the items impacting the quarter. The income tax swing, the ESJ wind gain and the release of the allowance, I understand that you had \u2013 there are offsetting things that happened in the prior year like the gain you had on Copper Mountain, but as we look forward into 2015 and we look at your \u2013 the guidance range you gave for us for 2015, is that already \u2013 should we assume they contemplate such gains or losses in there?","Debbie Reed","Greg, let me just say for 2015 we're going to update our guidance as we always do in February. What I would just say is that when we do our guidance we contemplate what we know at that point in time. So to the extent when we gave you the guidance back at the analyst meeting in March, we knew things were going to occur in 2015. We would have put those in our guidance at that time. But we will update that guidance because there's been things that have happened since that time and we'll update that guidance in February as we always do.","Greg Gordon \u2013 Evercore","Okay. So that switches to my next question. As I look at page 4 of your \u2013 the guidance section from the Analyst Day, you did a pretty good job outlining what was in your aspiration and what wasn't and based on the update you've given us today, looks like on the California utilities you've got a small transmission project that wasn't contemplated. You've got a fairly large potential gas infrastructure project that wasn't contemplated. You've got the SFE pipelines in Latin America and Peru transmission that wasn't contemplated. And then refresh my memory. I just want to be clear, the 1.8 Bcf of day of REX backhaul was not \u2013 was also not contemplated in that guidance. Is that correct?","Debbie Reed","Yes. Let me just go through to summarize those so that everyone kind of hears the same thing. When we look at what we showed you back in March and we look at some of the things that were in the additional opportunities that have already been secured that we have the 1.6 Bcf from REX for the east to west flows and that's incremental to what we had in our plan of the 0.2 B's. We also have the second piece of REX which is the Clarington West Flow [ph] that we haven't announced contracts on yet. And as I mentioned, that should be coming out in the next couple of months.","Renewables, we have the 92-megawatt contract with Edison for CMS-4. And on electric transmission, this quarter we got $60 million of incremental investment. We also have some other projects that were incremental to our plan at SDG&E and then we also had the $150 million of electric transmission in Peru that I mentioned on the call.","So those are things that where we basically have either been assigned them by the ISO or by the regulators in Peru or we have contracts with REX or with renewables. Then we have a lot of bids for additional development and we're bidding two CFE pipelines in Mexico, two CFE pipelines in the U.S., some additional renewables where we are offers out and we mentioned trains four and five in Cameron. Those are things we're actively working on as well.","Greg Gordon \u2013 Evercore","You've also got this $800 million to $850 million gas infrastructure proposal where you'll find out late next year if that's approved, right?","Debbie Reed","Yes. And part of that was in the later years of our plan, because that \u2013 we would expect to get the decision towards the end of next year but construction doesn't ramp up on that until some of the mid to later years of the plan.","Greg Gordon \u2013 Evercore","And when would you roll out explicit 2016 earnings guidance range?","Debbie Reed","We'll roll those out 2016; we usually do at the analyst conference. And so we do 2015 on the call in February, generally, and then we give you both of those and then our long-term outlook at the analyst conference. And that would be \u2013 the one thing I want to be sure to mention is that when I went through all of these growth opportunities that \u2013 and using the Southern reliability system as an example, not all of these projects are going to affect 2015 earnings. Some of the projects, like REX comes in part of it in 2015, some of the additional contracts would not come into place until 2016, when we look at the Peruvian transmission it's 2015 to 2017 and so a lot of these things are going to not affect just the 2015.","The other thing that I want to mention is that with the additional bids that we have under development, we are going to also be incurring development costs during 2015. And we are planning on getting trains four and five with the permits filed and same thing for Port Arthur and for projects like that, plus all these CFE bids that we expect there to be development costs. So all of that kind of information will be updated when we give you our guidance in February.","Greg Gordon \u2013 Evercore","I do have one more question. So there's been a lot of oil price volatility over the last couple months and the people's \u2013 it seems that investor's expectations for the probability of incremental LNG export kind of ebbs and flows with the oil price a as it balances between where it is today and the prices we saw earlier in the year. Is there a \u2013 can you give us some sense of whether the appetite from your counter counterparties who are discussing with you the potential for these incremental trains, at what oil price they're no longer interested in ex ordering gas from the U.S.?","Debbie Reed","Let me just mention one thing and that is that all of the joint venture parties agree for us to move forward with some of the initial work and preparation of our FERC filing for trains four and five. So I mean, that in itself is a good indication. But Mark has done a lot of work in this area and we expected that there would be questions on oil prices, so I'm going to turn it to Mark to kind of say why we think our facilities are very well positioned in terms of the global markets.","Mark Snell","Greg, I think you know that this LNG business is a long-term business and what we're seeing from our partners is an interest in securing long-term supply of LNG from the United States with all the stability and the continuity that that can provide. And we really haven't seen that interest abate even as we've seen oil prices fall in the last few days here. If you look at the underlying numbers and I'm not going to get into all the details now, but generally speaking we still have \u2013 the U.S. gas and U.S. LNG especially from the Gulf has a pretty good cost advantage over just about everything else that there is in the world today. And that continues down to gas or oil prices as they drop even down to the $70 range.","One thing I think it's worth noting is a lot of these foreign contracts, oil linked contracts for LNG have S-curves in them with sets a floor and a ceiling on prices as oil prices fluctuate. And so it's not a point where even if oil were to drop to levels that we haven't seen in 15 or 20 years, LNG wouldn't necessarily on a worldwide basis fall to those levels, except other than on the spot market. There's some built in price levels there. And I think we're competitive with those, given where price is. And I think the other thing that's really, really important and that these folks focus on is diversity of supply. And that includes geographic diversity.","Obviously the United States being a real favorite these days of trying to get some supply out of the U.S., also diversity of facilities and geographic locations within the U.S. So I think at the end of the day we feel very confident that our partners are interesting \u2013 interested in moving forward on trains four and five. We see other outside interest for Port Arthur. We are having discussions on, on maybe conversions there.","So we're kind of looking at all of these opportunities and we think we can be online with some of these as early as 2020. And we're going to kind of prioritize which ones that we think need to come online first and we'll just kind of move through the list. But we're pretty excited about what's the level of interest and the opportunity for us to continue to grow our LNG business.","Operator","We'll go next to Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research","Couple questions, first on the Cameron four and five filing at FERC next year, would you anticipate you would have contracts in place by the time that you file at FERC?","Debbie Reed","I'm going to have Mark go ahead and go through that and kind of go through the schedule a bit with you as to what we're envisioning.","Mark Snell","It's a good question. I don't know that we would have firm contracts in place. Usually, the contracts aren't firm until we take FID, the firm investment decision, and we wouldn't expect to do that until sometime after we get the permit, 16 or 17. We're working with our partners and we obviously have customers that we have put in the queue that are looking at this opportunity, but it's sort of a chicken and egg thing. They want to make sure that we're going to do it and we have the facility and getting the permits will cement that in their minds that this facility is moving forward and I think they'd be much more comfortable than to commit to that supply.","So as we look at this, I think we would expect sometime after that we would probably firm up contracts. That doesn't mean we won't have MOUs and other kinds of indications of interest and I think that's very likely that we will. A firm contract really doesn't exist until you take FID.","Debbie Reed","I would say it would be very parallel to what we did on trains one through three where we had with partners, we had commitments that if the facility was built at a certain pricing point that they would move forward with it. But that's very different than getting to FID, where the partners now have to you put their money on the table and all. So I think it would be constructed very much the same in terms of contracts.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research","Okay. Maybe my terminology might have been too specific there. I guess it seems that there's a little bit more of an interest in approving projects that have more likelihood of getting done, which having some kind of initial commitment helps along that way. So do you expect by the time you file there would be some kind of initial commitment for the LNG?","Mark Snell","Yes, I think that we'll have initial interest. And also too, I just want to remind you that now that FERC or that DOE has changed the way that they look at this and let FERC is taking the lead, you're not really going to move forward with a lot of this activity because it is, as Debbie mentioned, there's fairly expensive development costs in moving this through the permitting process. And so we're not going to do that without some indication of interest and that we're going to be able to move this to completion. So I think the change in the process that was recently announced a few months ago is also leading to people being much more secure about what's going on as they move forward.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research","Okay. Second question, this might be a little silly, but just do you guys have something against the term YieldCo or what's the thought or is there a message underneath kind of recalling it a TRV instead of YieldCo?","Debbie Reed","I'm going to ask Joe to answer that, because he and his team came up with that term as we were looking at it. I think it is pretty descriptive and kind of what the option we're looking at, but Joe?","Joe Householder","Look, I think, Steve, really it's us thinking pout thinking about what this is and I think the YieldCo term is a little bit funny, you think a YieldCo is something that's at a high yield. What we really see is this is going to be very highly valued because of growth and yield and so we just didn't really like the term and didn't really fit us and it didn't fit our strategy and we think that it's really a total return vehicle and that's why we are talking about that. One of the problems we had internally is we're looking at a couple different types.","Everything we're looking at is MLP like in structure but it might be the tax is a little bit different depending on what we do so we needed a term to talk about these things that weren't traditional MLPs and this is what we came onto.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research","Okay. One last question with respect to just the decision on MLP YieldCo. The other companies that are moved forward with MLPs, YieldCos, the stocks generally have done well into it. Once they've actually executed there hasn't been a lot of follow-through. Do you have any kind of thoughts they the way you're looking at it, where you might either do it differently or communicate differently to benefit to Sempra holders if you go forward?","Debbie Reed","I think the key is that whatever we do has to bring greater value to Sempra shareholders in our minds and that we'll be able to articulate why we think that that would occur. I would say the one thing that we feel very good about is if we do something, if we don't do something, whatever we do, we have a really great set of assets. I think how a company fundamentally has long-term value is the growth, the potential on assets that they have, the ability to grow their business, the ability to really have steady cash flows that are growing and I think we're in good position regardless of the structure that we have to do that. So that's kind of how we're looking at it. And I would just turn it to Joe to talk about a little bit of what we're looking at on the shareholder value side and the work that's under way.","Joe Householder","Steve, this is part of the reason we put a lot of content into this call because later once we make a decision, we'll be filing some stuff and then we won't with able to talk about it. So we wanted to be able to explain how we're thinking about this, that we really are focused on the long-term value for Sempra and we wanted you to all understand what the things we're looking at. And so we've described on page 9 and page 10 how we're thinking about it, the kind of assets we're looking at, how we expect these things to work.","And I don't want to talk about really the other company's stock values and what's happened to them but we believe that the strength of our underlying business and the execution that we have on our growth plan is going to be reflected in how our shares perform and if we choose to create one of these vehicles then as it's been with other large high quality sponsors, they're kind of small at the outset but I think that's one of the things you see is these things are pretty small for some of these large players. And so I don't think it's moving the stock much around. And it might do the same with us, it's hard to tell. Once those IDRs become significant and that value is very transparent, I think you'll see that in our stock very clearly.","Debbie Reed","I would just add to that and highlight IEnova and kind of what was done there and we were the first energy company to trade on the exchange and we took a lot of time to determine what was the best approach, what was the best timing, is this something that's going to bring value to the Sempra shareholders. Is it going to give more transparency to the value of those underlying assets. And we would make the same kind of considerations as we decide whether we're going to do a vehicle and if so, what type of vehicle we would do. I think you'll l see that same kind of disciplined behavior for us as we analyze this.","Operator","We'll go next to Chris Turnure with JPMorgan.","Chris Turnure \u2013 JPMorgan","Could you give us a little bit more color on. You certainly talked about contracting conditions in general for LNG. You mentioned that the kind of interest remains strong. So did IEnova when they talked about it. Could you mention kind of if anything has changed for that project specifically over the past couple months?","Debbie Reed","I would say that, Chris, there's nothing really that's changed. We've been doing the gas study and we're completing some of the work on the gas study to look at gas availability. The issue there that's been there and we've always talked about it is that we have contracts through 2028 as an import facility. So the economics of taking a facility that, I don't know, it's about $150 million or so cash flow from that facility, and making it into an export facility, we need to look at what the benefits of that would be and that there has to be a compelling story for that.","And so looking at gas, looking at the sizing of the facility, looking at the customers, looking at the existing customers, are all the things that we've always talked about with that facility and they're still present for us. We're working it and we're definitely working trains four and five and definitely working Port Arthur. We're working all three of them.","Chris Turnure \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. And then could you give us a little bit more color if you could on timing with ECA. I know it's hard to do at this point but you've definitely been more specific with four and five, I think, and even Port Arthur at this point than you've been down there.","Debbie Reed","Well I mentioned in my talking points that what we were looking at is having all the gas analysis done and then really looking at what kind of a facility could be there and having some conversations with our customers in the first half of next year. That's the kind of timing for that. There is a regulatory process. I guess the rules just came out in Mexico with some of the details on what is required in order to get regulatory approval. But it's a different process than in the U.S. So I mean, I think that within the first half of the year, just as with the other projects, we should have a good sense as to what we think about sizing, what we think about timing, and what we think about the economics of the project.","Chris Turnure \u2013 JPMorgan","And then my follow-up question is just on year-to-date earnings and the third quarter specifically. There's kind of an unusually large number of one-time mostly tax related items. Do you have a sense of what a normalized number would be if you moved all of that stuff?","Debbie Reed","I'm going to have Joe or Trevor go through that. And I would remind you that if you kind of look year to year, last year we had a gain on CMS-2 that came in the quarter and it was almost the same size as this LA tax valuation. So if you kind of take those things out, you still see a growth of double-digit growth rate year-over-year which I think is along a path that we're intending to head.","Joe Householder","I think just what she said. You can pick and choose things that tend to be one-time items if you want to call them that. I would say in our renewable business we tend to have gains on sales fairly often. Last year we had $24 million in the third quarter, this year we had $13 million in the third quarter. This year we had the Chilean tax reform hit us for 6 and we had $8 million of repatriation tax. Where last year this quarter we didn't have any because it all got booked in the first quarter.","So if you try to pull some of those out and you pull out the valuation allowance which was in our plan, but if you pulled that out and say that's the onetime item we have nearly 19% growth over last year and if you take out the tax items at the utilities, we have those all the time, they happen all the time, but if you take those out they're 14% earnings growth.","We have very solid growth in this quarter and year-to-date the numbers are very similar. You can pick and choose. But we have very, very solid growth.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Weinstein with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","It's actually Julien. I have a quick detail here on Mesquite. Do you have a sales price that you could disclose?","Debbie Reed","All we're saying that is our book value's about 300 and we sold it for above book. And we'll remind you all that the gain on that sale is not part of the guidance, so --","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Turning to Mexico, if you will, how much does the U.S.\/Mexican project drive a decision between MLP versus whatever else you you've contemplated? Call it YieldCo, total return vehicle, etcetera.","Debbie Reed","I don't think that that would drive anything in terms of our decision making. We're looking at kind of long-term and so it would be a nice factor for if you were looking at either of those. It would be a nice factor, but it's not a driver.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","So you feel like you have sufficient critical mass to get the MLP off the ground, irrespective of near term project awards, right, just to be clear?","Debbie Reed","We're not going to comment on that. As I mentioned, we're doing the assessment of that and we're looking at those assets. We're looking at where our growth is and we're doing that, all of that work, and I'm just not going to comment on specific assets.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","And then going back to the notion of a total return vehicle, you talk about other infrastructure assets. Broadly speaking, what else would be contemplated within a TRV, if you will? It's midstream, clearly, it's renewables, clearly. What else within the context of your current portfolio or within the context of your organic growth plans would be included potentially?","Debbie Reed","I would refer you back to Joe's comments, but Joe, do you want to kind of articulate that again, some of the comments.","Joe Householder","Sure. Really what we looked at is the strategy for Sempra and it's been consistent for many, many, many years now, long-term contracted infrastructure and we've built and contracted many different kind of assets. And while we're exiting merchant generation now, we certainly had assets like that that could have been put in there. We might look at petrochemical kind of assets, other things that are natural gas related kind of assets. There could be things that just don't fit in the qualifying asset characterization.","And so we could \u2013 I mentioned before, while we're not currently contemplating it, we could put some of these non-U.S. assets in there. We certainly probably won't do that with Mexico but there's others assets that we could put in. It's just a broader group that fits nicely with our strategy.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","And a last little detail here, congrats on Mesquite, first. But secondly, TDM in Mexico, is there a thought process or time line around re-contracting that asset?","Debbie Reed","We have a goal to do something with TDM on a long-term basis. And as I mentioned in my comments, with the energy reform going forward that generation will be kind of one of the next areas that they will be looking at. And we think with TDM interconnected to Mexico it could be one of the best and most economic assets to meet some of those needs. So that's our plan is to work that with the sale into Mexico.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Under long term offtake presumably?","Debbie Reed","A sale of the asset or sale or long-term offtake, PPA agreement, whatever structure seems to work best.","Operator","We'll go next to Matt Tucker with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Matt Tucker \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Just wanted to follow up and make sure I understand about the offtake agreements on Cameron trains four and five. So you've indicated that you expect to start the FERC filing process the first half of next year and I believe you said that you would expect to have some offtake agreements in hand before you go to FERC. So is the implication that you expect to be able to announce some form of offtake agreements in the first half of next year?","Debbie Reed","Yes, let me have Mark go through that again to be sure that it's very clear what we're talking about. And also kind of the schedule at FERC, because you make a pre-filing and then you make the complete FERC filing. And so let's kind of walk you through what we're thinking.","Mark Snell","Yeah, I think where we're going to be is we will start the filing process at FERC with our application. And we would not expect at that moment in the first half of or the first quarter of 2015 to have agreements in hand. As I said before, actually firm agreements would not be done until we actually reached FID, which is a year or so down the road.","But we might have indications of interest and I think you can \u2013 by the very nature of this project, the fact that Mitsubishi and GDF are our partners and they have agreed to move these process forward, they obviously have an interest in that capacity. So I think just by the nature of the players involved, you can see that there's interest in moving the project forward.","But no one's has made a commitment yet to sign on and pay for the \u2013 to pay for these facilities to be built in a firm way. But we're going to move forward with the permitting process. We're going to get that started. We've authorized monies to be spent on development and we think the project looks very favorable compared to others that could be considered. So we're very optimistic that this project will move forward. It's certainly one of the lowest cost projects that you could possibly do in the region because it's an add-on to an existing project.","Matt Tucker \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","So I think I understand. It's a point at which you get \u2013 when you get to the point where you'd be making the full FERC filing, at that point if you don't have some kind of nonbinding let's call it offtake agreements, you'd put the brakes on the project at that point?","Mark Snell","Yes, there's certainly a point if we thought that the interest in the facility was waning or that we couldn't reach a full FID decision, obviously we'd stop spending money on it. We're not in that position right now. We feel like it's got a lot of interest and we're willing to spend some development dollars on furthering that and bringing that \u2013 bringing the project to fruition.","This is very, very similar to what we did on Cameron's one through three. It's really the same process.","Matt Tucker \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","You announced the offtake agreements for trains one through three before the FID. So I guess I'm just trying to understand if we should expect a similar announcement of those agreements.","Mark Snell","Yes, before FID you'll have agreements that require FID as a condition precedent for those agreements going forward. But that's a very typical way that this would be done.","Debbie Reed","If you look back at Cameron one through three, what we had is kind of an MOU with the parties on the joint venture agreement and then the tolling agreement in that case. And then we went forward with some of the more costly developments to allow the FERC filing after we had that to make the full filing at FERC that is necessary for your permitting. It's the same type of process that we would be looking at here, whether it's offtake agreements for LNG or it's a tolling arrangement, we would look at having some type of MOU in place with interested parties before we started spending a lot of money.","Mark Snell","The only thing here is that we're a little further ahead because things like the tolling arrangements and all those agreements have already really been drafted once. They just need to be amended for the additional capacity.","Matt Tucker \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","And then shifting gears to the MLP versus TRV debate. As you walk through the criteria, it really sounded to me like the TRV was the superior option on most of the criteria that you walked us through and largely because of the flexibility it provides. Is it fair to say that's the way you're leaning?","Debbie Reed","We're not leaning anywhere. I just made real clear because I could give you some reasons why the MLP would be interesting too. So what we're trying to do is really look at this without getting hooked on anything and really do kind of the step away, look at this from a Sempra shareholder perspective as what is the best decision and to take our time to do that and to have that completed by the end of the first quarter. So there's no leaning one way or the other. We're looking \u2013 all options are open for us right now and we're watching how things trade.","We're watching how our growth goes and what kinds of assets that we think would be available for each vehicle if we decided to do a vehicle. All of that work is under way and we'll have that concluded by the first quarter.","Matt Tucker \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","At the Analyst Day in the Spring I believe you said that your plan was to do an MLP and it was just kind of a matter of timing and that was before you start talking about the TRV option. Should we still be thinking of this decision in the first quarter as just which vehicle you're going to do or what's the likelihood that you decide to do nothing?","Debbie Reed","I'm not going to comment because we haven't decided. Like I said, there's really options on the table, all of those options are open right now and I don't ever recall saying that we were committed to doing one thing. We had looked at it. There had been a lot of interest in us doing it. We saw that we had assets that we thought would be very good assets for that type of structure and we still feel we have really good assets for either of these kinds of structures. So we'll make those decisions and inform you when we made the decisions after the first quarter.","Matt Tucker \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","And didn't mean to put words in your mouth, just one final follow-up to that. You kind of alluded to a pipeline of renewables projects that could contribute to growth if you go the TRV route. Could you just talk to us a little about what's in your renewables pipeline right now and if the pipeline, what is included in your current long-term guidance?","Debbie Reed","Yes. If you look at our renewables business, the areas where we still have a lot of opportunities for development are with our Copper Mountain facility and we can keep adding there. We also have rose month which we have actually are participating in some RFPs to develop that site right now. There are opportunities to expand some of the wind sites that we're in and we're looking at some of the additional phases on those wind sites. And so \u2013 and then we're always out in the market, looking at other opportunities for exciting new renewables.","So we have projects that we keep working on. I think where we actually have some land positions we're in really great position to develop renewable projects in those sites.","Mark Snell","The only one you didn't mention was Mesquite, create a large facility at Mesquite that we could expand.","Operator","We'll go next to Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Just two quick ones, on REX, did you note the potential for some additional opportunities outside of the Clarington west part of it? I think you noted some laterals there.","Debbie Reed","What I talked about is the Prairie State Pipeline that Telegraph [ph] and AGL have proposed that links in to REX. And if they're doing a nonbinding open season on that pipeline, that ties into REX and takes gas into kind of the hub of Chicago. And obviously if they get a lot of interest on that pipeline they're going to need upstream supply. And so we have \u2013 in the 2.4 Bcf of potential expansions for REX, there's two pieces. There's the piece of about 700 to 800 a day that's from additional compression and then the remainder of it would come from looping the line. And so to the degree that there's more downstream market for the gas, then we think that that gives us additional upstream opportunities on REX.","Rajeev Lalwani \u2013 Morgan Stanley","And then just switching over to Cameron four and five, as it relates to the FERC process, what drives the time line for approval and what's the potential for accelerating it, given that you've got Cameron one through three already approved?","Mark Snell","So if your question is on the regulatory side, how does the process work, I think the answer to that is that it \u2013 the FERC process will drive it and the DOE export process kind of will play off of the FERC process. Under this new regime, the DOE will consider only projects that have gone through a certain amount of the FERC process. One of the things that we talked about was that we may be able to accelerate the FERC process because we have trains one through three.","We may be able to do what they call an environmental assessment as opposed to a full environmental impact report. And that could shorten the process by several months, really. And it would be a little bit cheaper, too. We don't know that we're going to be able to do that. We're looking at it. We're talking with our consultants on it. But that is one way that we could shorten the process a little bit.","Does that answer your question?","Rajeev Lalwani \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","It does, Mark. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Faisal Khan with Citigroup.","Faisal Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Just going back to this MLP versus YieldCo. Is there any reason why you don't do both? The reason why I'm asking, is you don't know if you look down over the next four, five years if you're going to grow your midstream and natural gas and refined product exports, whatever you guys want to do, if you want to grow that asset base that's where the MLP works, if you're going to grow some of the stuff outside the U.S. and the renewable stuff then certainly YieldCo works.","I'm just trying to figure out, it seems like we're talking about one versus the other but I'm just trying to understand if you couldn't do both.","Joe Householder","We think that either can work. I don't see us, and we said this for several years, I don't see us doing a separate YieldCo for our renewable business. Our renewable business is a nice business but it's not a big part of the business and I think that the YieldCo would be too small. It just wouldn't be sufficient of a vehicle and so I don't see us going down that path. But I think that the TRV vehicle or the MLP can work for us and that's why we're looking at both of them very hard.","Faisal Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Just on REX and Clarington West, I just want to make sure that was I thought contemplated to be a 2.4 Bcf a day expansion, I noticed in your slides it says TBD. Is that because it could be bigger or could be smaller?","Debbie Reed","It's largely because there's two pieces of it and we did the nonbinding open season and as I mentioned that we're in the final negotiations with the shippers that participated in that nonbinding open season. We'll announce that later. But if there's additional market pull in Chicago, that that may get all the way to the 2.4 and there's options, always options to expand beyond the 2.4 if you get to that. So how close we get to the 2.4, I think will be more visible to us over the next year.","Faisal Khan \u2013 Citigroup","And then just on the LNG strategy, you said that you guys are going to get reimbursed for the development cost for one and three. Did I hear that right on the call? Is that \u2013 how does that cash come back to you?","Debbie Reed","We did. When we went through the FID and through the lets call effective date which is when all the asset goes in and the financing is arranged and everything, then we did get reimbursed from our partners for our share of \u2013 or their share of the development cost. And then we also got their first contributions to their equity going in to match our equity which was our basically billion dollar asset that we put into the JV. So now we're starting \u2013 that's our equity contribution. They'll continue to make equity contributions until they get up to the levels to match our equity value. And then we\u2019ve the sharing arrangement for all of the costs as we go forward.","Faisal Khan \u2013 Citigroup","","And then for the marketing of volume for trains four and five, how competitive is the environment today, the contracting environment? There's still other facilities out there, some of them Brownfield, some of them greenfield, that are still being developed and just want to understand sort of what you guys commercial inertia is right now in terms of finding customers?","Debbie Reed","I would say that the one thing that we found is that there is a lot of parties in the market. There have not been very many parties that have gotten through the process and into construction. And so the fact that you have a facility that is already being built, that can be expanded or that you've demonstrated your ability to get through all of those processes and get a facility in place, I think provides us a strong competitive advantage in the marketplace. There are a lot of players out trying to market that buyers really want certainty, because if they are contracting for long-term supplies on a certain date to be delivered, then they're counting on that gas to get there, that LNG to get there and they're not delighted with some of the projects that may never get done. So I think we're in a good position. I think, yes there is a lot of people out there marketing but I think we're in a very good position.","Faisal Khan \u2013 Citigroup","And then just in terms of what happens if one of your JV partners wanted to opt out of the expansions at four and five?","Mark Snell","Sure. There is provisions within our agreement that would allow the other partners to take over their position if we so choose to.","Faisal Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. On a pro rata basis or just whoever wants is or \u2013 ?","Mark Snell","Yes, it's effectively pro rata.","Faisal Khan \u2013 Citigroup","Understood. And then last question from me, just with the stronger U.S. dollar, just trying to figure out if there's any sort of longer term impacts to your earnings from overseas?","Debbie Reed","Joe, do you want to discuss that? We have been seeing FX effects and that is something that we commented on and it's clearly impacted our South American businesses this year. What I would say is that if you look at those businesses, the growth and some of \u2013 we're able to offset some of the impact of FX by the growth in those businesses. But it has been an impact.","Joe Householder","We're really pleased with the continued growth we have in the customers and the energy sales in both countries, as Debbie just mentioned, and the utilities are performing as we expected them to and continue to grow. But this quarter the currency movement wasn't very significant but for the year in Chile a lot of that currency movement is offset the growth but not in Peru. In Peru the currency is more stable and we have really solid growth there. So overall between Chile, Peru and Mexico it hasn't been very material this year.","Operator","We'll go next to Mark Barnett with Morningstar Financial.","Mark Barnett \u2013 Morningstar Financial","Just wanted to make sure I didn't miss this. You mentioned the two Texas pipelines. Had you talked about the size of those and what that would be volumetric, I would say?","Debbie Reed","Yes actually, what I would refer you to, because it's a little bit confusing with all these pipelines that are being bid, if you go to slide 22 and 23 in your package it lists all of those pipelines. And the two in Texas, three and four on page 22 and it shows that both the mileage and the CapEx that was estimated by CFE, that's not our CapEx number, that's the CFE estimate of CapEx so that will help you look at all of those pipelines. And then the ones listed below, five through 17 are the ones that they've announced that they're going to be bidding in the near term. And you can see all of those are supposed to go in service by 2018, so they will need to bid them in the near term.","Mark Barnett \u2013 Morningstar Financial","On those CapEx numbers actually, with the estimates that are coming out from the government, are those coming I guess in practice on the ground as these first round of pipes are being constructed, how accurate are those figures?","Debbie Reed","Yes, I think it's not in our competitive interest to comment on their pricing estimates. So I would just say sometimes they're good, sometimes they're not so on track. And I'm not going to say anything more about it.","Debbie Reed","Well being that there are no further questions, thanks again for joining us today on Sempra's third quarter 2014 earnings call. If you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to contact our great IR team and have a wonderful day.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation."],"19128":["Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call November  1, 2019 12:00 PM ET","Company Participants","Faisel Khan - Vice President, Investor Relations","Joe Householder - President and Chief Operating Officer","Trevor Mihalik - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Caroline Winn - COO, San Diego Gas & Electric Company","Conference Call Participants","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Shar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","Sophie Karp - KeyBanc","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Operator","Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Third Quarter Earnings Call. Please note that today's call is being recorded.","And at this time, I would like to turn things over to Faisel Khan. Please go ahead, sir.","Faisel Khan","Good morning and welcome to Sempra Energy's third quarter 2019 earnings call. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section.","Here in San Diego, several members of our management team, including Joe Householder, President and Chief Operating Officer; Trevor Mihalik, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; George Bilicic, Group President; and Peter Wall, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer.","Before starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC.","It's important to note that all the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and it will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, November 1st, 2019, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.","With that, please turn to slide four, and let me hand the call over to Joe.","Joe Householder","Thanks Faisel and thank all of you for joining us today. Normally, Jeff would lead this call, but he and Dennis are currently traveling overseas for our LNG business, meeting with current and future partners and customers. So, I'll be filling in for him today.","I'll start off by saying that this quarter's strong operational and financial results reflect our company's focus on execution and demonstrate progress towards our mission to be North America's premier energy infrastructure company.","I'll provide a more detailed business update later in the presentation. But our recent accomplishments include placing Cameron LNG Train 1 and the project shared facilities into service, while also advancing commission and construction of the two remaining trains, reaching a constructive resolution with the CFE in relation to our two pipelines in Mexico and placing the marine pipeline into service, receiving a constructive general rate case final decision at SDG&E and SoCalGas, with a focus on safety and reliability; progressing the sale of our South American businesses by announcing sales agreements for both Peru and Chile; increasing the CapEx plan at the Texas utilities to keep up with the continued growth Oncor is seeing in and around its service territory; and finally, continuing to progress our LNG development projects as highlighted by the recent MoU announcement with Mitsui.","In sum, it's been a remarkable year for our company. All of the positive regulatory, legislative, and operational developments we've recognized year-to-date give us increased confidence in our financial outlook.","With this in mind, we're raising our full year 2019 adjusted EPS guidance from our previous range of $5.70 to $6.30 and to a new higher range of $6 to $6.50. Additionally, based on California Utilities' 2019 GRC final decision, coupled with the announced sales of our South American businesses, we're affirming our full year 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range of $6.70 to $7.50. As we look towards the rest of the year, we remain focused on our strategic goals to help drive shareholder value and benefit all of our stakeholders.","Please turn to the next slide. You'll recall that we presented a similar version of this slide at our Investor Day earlier this year. We believe it's worth highlighting again, given the progress we've made in repositioning our portfolio.","It's hard to imagine that just last year, we were active in 18 states in United States and three foreign jurisdictions. Now, we've narrowed our focus to three states and one foreign jurisdiction. We believe that we've high-graded our portfolio by exiting our U.S. renewable generation and South American businesses, and replaced them with higher quality T&D earnings. This focused strategy allows us to concentrate on growing our Tier 1 position in some of the most attractive markets in North America, which have strong business fundamentals and meaningful growth opportunities.","Please turn to slide six, where I'll review the recent developments related to our South American businesses. We first announced the decision to sell our South American businesses in January of this year, with a view of recycling capital into growth at our utilities and infrastructure businesses and to reduce parent debt.","The sales of these businesses represent an important strategic shift for our company and is another example of our ability to effectively optimize our portfolio, while increasing value for our shareholders. The combined sales price of over $5.8 billion reflects the quality of these businesses, and we're very pleased with the results of the sales process to-date. We've laid out a general time line of the transactions on the slide and expect the sales of both our Peruvian and Chilean businesses to be completed in the first quarter of 2020.","Before I move on, I would like to recognize George, Trevor, Dennis and the team for a great job getting us to this point in the sales process. I would also like to recognize the wonderful teams in Chile and Peru, run by Francesco and Mile, they have done a fantastic job over the past 20 years and added a lot of value to Sempra.","Please turn to the next slide, where I'll discuss some of the recent business updates at SDG&E. I'll first discuss the general rate case. As a reminder, this is the first time that the risk assessment mitigation phase, or RAMP, process was integrated into the GRC.","Importantly, this takes into account safety and reliability spending as directed by the California Public Utilities Commission. You'll also recall that the GRC usually represents a sizable portion of our capital plan, but does not capture FERC-related investments or CPUC projects addressed outside the GRC. This proceeding also does not change our utilities authorized cost of capital, which is being addressed in a separate proceeding.","Now, let's review the key details of the final decision issued in late September as it relates to SDG&E. Overall, we're pleased with this decision as we believe it fairly balances customer rates and critical investments needed to help ensure the delivery of safe, reliable energy.","The decision approved the following for SDG&E. A 2019 test year revenue requirement of $1.99 billion, which represents an increase of approximately $107 million or 5.7% over 2018 authorized revenues as well as overall post-test year revenue requirement attrition rates of 6.7% in 2020 and 4.8% in 2021.","It's worth noting that the 2020 and 2021 post-test year attrition amounts for capital investments are significantly higher than the O&M attrition amounts. This is a reflection of our commitment to thoughtfully invest capital related to safety and reliability, while efficiently and effectively managing O&M cost. These increased revenue requirements will support improvements in critical energy infrastructure and risk mitigation.","Now, let's turn to the cost of capital proceedings. Regarding the FERC cost of capital, all parties have reached a negotiated resolution and we've submitted an offer of settlement in mid-October. The settlement request an authorized ROE of 10.6%, which includes the 50 basis point CAISO adder. This represents a 55 basis point increase from our currently authorized FERC ROE of 10.05%. We expect the commission to issue an order on this matter in the first half of 2020. For the CPUC cost of capital proceeding, we continue to expect a final decision toward the end of this year.","Regarding our initial and ongoing contributions to the California Wildfire Fund, we are expensing the total contributions over the estimated period of benefit, which we estimate to be approximately 10 years and we would record additional charges if a wildfire event occurs and the fund is reduced.","Please turn to the next slide. I'd now like to take a moment and address the recent wildfire situation across the state. Our thoughts are with the first responders, firefighters, residents, and the broader communities being impacted by these terrible events.","Importantly, wildfire safety and risk mitigation are a top priority for us within our service territory. And we continue to be vigilant, monitoring weather patterns and potential wildfire threats, while remaining engaged with our customers and communities in order to maintain critical lines of communication.","As a reminder, investing in wildfire mitigation is not something new for our company. In fact, we've invested approximately $1.5 billion in related efforts over the past decade. This includes deploying the most highly concentrated weather station network in the U.S., installing over 100 high-definition cameras across our service territory, replacing over 21,000 wood poles or steel poles, developing weather and fire models based on years of collected data, allowing us to forecast potential weather events several days in advance and fire hardening approximately 75% of our electric transmission lines with a goal to fire harden the remaining 25% over the next few years.","Another example is our Fire Safe 3.0 project, which continues to build on our foundation of industry-leading mitigation efforts and includes utilizing artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve situational awareness, introducing a new vegetation risk index, enabling satellite wildfire alerts, and improving our unprecedented weather data network with high-speed capabilities.","In combination, these items should further enhance our ability to deliver safe and reliable energy to the communities we serve. This is just a glimpse of the type of project highlights we'll be providing at our Investor Day next year.","Now, please turn to slide nine, where I'll discuss developments at SoCalGas. The recent final decision in the GRC also marked the first time, the RAMP process was integrated for SoCalGas. It approved the following: a 2019 test year revenue requirement of $2.77 billion, which represents an increase of approximately $314 million or 12.8% over 2018 authorized revenues as well as overall post-test year revenue requirement attrition rates of 7.9% in 2020 and 5% in 2021.","Similar to SDG&E, SoCalGas' 2020 and 2021 post-test year attrition amounts related to capital substantially outpaced O&M. The increase in the revenue requirement related to capital and corresponding increase to rate base should enable us to make critical investments in our infrastructure system around safety and reliability for the benefit of our customers.","An example of this is the continued support for SoCalGas' pipeline safety enhancement plan, and notably, the GRC approved 32 PSEP projects, plus 284 valve enhancement plan projects over the next three years.","Now, please turn to slide 10, where we'll talk about Texas. The macro and business environment in Texas remains one of the strongest in the U.S., and Oncor recently announced another increase to their already substantial five-year capital plan, as shown by the chart on this slide. The increase is mainly related to the growth in and around Oncor service territory with growth CapEx accounting for about two-thirds of this capital plan.","Importantly, these infrastructure investments will help facilitate renewables integration in Texas, keep up with the growth in West Texas and the Dallas-Fort Worth area, and strengthen and expand the grid for the benefit of Oncor's customers and the communities it serves.","Accounting for this increase, they now plan on spending approximately $11.9 billion over the 5-year period between 2020 and 2024. Oncor is clearly a great example of focusing our portfolio on attractive growing markets.","Please turn to slide 11, where I'll discuss Sempra LNG. This past quarter had some notable accomplishments at our LNG business. Specifically, we placed Cameron Train 1 in service and continued to progress our LNG development projects.","I'd now like to discuss the Cameron LNG project in a little more detail. Specifically, I'd like to highlight that the two companies, Chiyoda and McDermott, that collectively make up our EPC contractor, are joint and severally liable. So, if one is unable to perform its duties, the other is required to complete the project.","Both Chiyoda and McDermott, along with their subcontractors, continue to be on-site and active in the project. We remain confident about the Cameron LNG project schedule. Train 1 and the project's shared facilities are already in service, and Train 2 has begun its commissioning process. In fact, Cameron LNG estimates that the project is over 96% complete. Additionally, the schedule for Trains 2 and 3 remain unchanged.","Switching to our other LNG projects, we've recently begun limited site activities at Port Arthur and our teams continue to advance discussions with interested customers for the remaining facility capacity. Based on the current project schedule, we're targeting an FID on Port Arthur around mid-2020.","At ECA Phase 1, we plan on reaching FID in Q1 2020, a bit later than our year-end target. Overall, the project continues to make progress, and we're taking some extra time to evaluate EPC proposals from two highly qualified bidders. We believe this process will help drive the long-term value of the project to Sempra and its shareholders.","Please turn to slide 12. At Sempra LNG, we're committed to advancing our LNG development projects. This slide is a great representation of how active our LNG marketing team has been and the resulting MOUs, HOAS, and SPA that we've been able to secure through these efforts. It's also a positive reflection of the quality of these projects and the confidence in our ability to develop them.","A good example of this is the recent MOU with Mitsui. The MOU contemplates Mitsui's potential purchase of up to one-third of the available capacity at Cameron Phase 2 as well as the potential offtake of approximately 1 million tons per annum of LNG and equity participation in ECA Phase 2.","As I mentioned earlier, Jeff isn't on the call today, because he's traveling overseas with Dennis Arriola for our LNG business, meeting with current and future partners and customers. This is a great example of how these marketing efforts have significant participation at the highest levels of our organization. Our management team realizes our LNG business is a large contributor to the company's projected growth.","With this in mind, we're focusing on bringing our LNG development projects to fruition and securing binding offtake agreements in order to help meet global energy demand and deliver value to our shareholders.","Please turn to the next slide, and we'll go over developments in Mexico. Mexico continues to be an attractive market for us with substantial growth opportunities premised on energy accessibility, reliability and emissions goals.","At Sempra Mexico, IEnova continues to execute on infrastructure projects in Mexico that should help it provide increased affordability and accessibility to cleaner, more reliable energy for its rapidly growing population.","Notably, the team recently reached a resolution with CFE regarding the Guaymas-El Oro and Marine pipelines and subsequently put the marine pipeline in service in mid-September and announced the border solar project, which is contracted with high-quality counterparties.","I'd also like to highlight that given these developments and expected positive momentum, IEnova recently raised its dividend by approximately 5%.","Now, let me turn the call over to Trevor, who will review our financial results, beginning with Slide 14.","Trevor Mihalik","Thanks Joe. Earlier this morning, we reported third quarter 2019 GAAP earnings of $813 million or $2.84 per share. This compares favorably to third quarter 2018 GAAP earnings of $274 million or $0.99 per share. On an adjusted basis, the third quarter 2019 earnings were $425 million or $1.50 per share. This compares to our third quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of $339 million or $1.23 per share.","Please turn to slide 15, where I'll discuss the key drivers of our quarterly results. The variance in our third quarter 2019 adjusted earnings when compared to last year was affected by the following key items: $34 million of lower earnings at Sempra Renewables related to assets sold in December of 2018 and April of 2019; $24 million of lower earnings at SDG&E from electric transmission operations, primarily due to a FERC formulaic rate adjustment benefit in 2018; and $14 million of lower earnings at Sempra LNG, primarily due to lower earnings from our marketing operations, mainly driven by changes in natural gas prices. This was offset by Cameron Train 1 commencing commercial operations in August of 2019. These items were offset by $60 million of higher earnings at the California Utilities from higher CPUC base operating margin authorized in 2019, predominantly driven by the GRC final decision.","Please note that our year-to-date results reflect the additional $196 million retroactive benefit from the GRC final decision for the first 6 months of the year. $58 million of higher equity earnings at the Sempra Texas Utility segment due to impacts of Oncor's acquisition of InfraREIT.","Higher distribution revenues resulting from an increase in volumes driven primarily by weather and higher transmission revenue driven by rates, and $38 million of variance at Sempra Mexico due to impacts from foreign currency and inflation effects, net of foreign currency hedges. This large delta year-over-year was primarily driven by an $11 million benefit in the third quarter of 2019 from a depreciating peso compared to $27 million of expense in the third quarter of 2018 from an appreciating peso.","Please turn to the next slide. We're pleased to say that this was a very successful quarter, both operationally and financially. We're continuing to execute on our goals and are progressing our mission to be North America's premier energy infrastructure company.","In line with this, as Joe previously indicated, we are raising our full year 2019 adjusted EPS guidance range and affirming our full year 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range, driven primarily by the constructive GRC decision at our California Utilities as well as the robust proceeds expected from the announced sale of our South American businesses. These proceeds should allow us to pay down parent debt and fund growth at our U.S. Utility and Infrastructure businesses. Importantly, we remain focused on achieving our goals, including maximizing long-term shareholder value.","Before we open it up to Q&A though, I'd be remiss if I didn't thank Joe for his invaluable contributions to the company. As most of you know, Joe will be retiring soon. He has played an integral role in the growth and progression of our businesses during his nearly two-decade career at Sempra Energy. We'll all miss him and we wish Joe and his family, the very best in his retirement.","With that, we will conclude our prepared remarks and stop to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon","My first question is on the FERC settlement, does that mean that you and the other parties to the case have all agreed on that number and are submitting it for approval? And if so, who are the parties that have agreed that, that's a fair return for your FERC assets?","Trevor Mihalik","Hi Greg, yes, thanks for the question. Yes, this settlement means that all the parties have agreed to push this forward and let the FERC make a final decision on this. We expect that final decision to occur in the first quarter.","At this point, there are some proceedings that will take place in November. But all the parties to the case, and I don't have them all at my fingertips, but we can get you those if that's important to you. But everybody has agreed to go forward with these numbers. So, that's what we would expect to get pushed out in the first of the year.","Greg Gordon","The CPUC is a party, correct?","Trevor Mihalik","Yes.","Greg Gordon","Thank you. My next question is the wildfire amortization, are you guys assuming that, that is going to be amortized through ongoing earnings? Or are you going to consider that a non-operating item because yesterday or the day before on Edison's call, they indicated they would be considering that a non-operating item for earnings reporting purposes?","Joe Householder","Yes. Thank you, Greg for that question. I'll speak to it at first, and then I'll probably have Trevor add to that. I think first, I would say you have to recognize that there is a pretty significant difference in the amounts that we each contributed based on the size of our territory and all the work we've done over the last decade.","And doing all the work we needed to do, the risk view was that our contribution was lower. And so it's less material to SDG&E than it was to Southern California Edison and then further less material to Sempra. But we're evaluating that. I did look at what they did. And the way they do core, noncore is probably a little different than we do adjusted earnings. And let me ask Trevor if he has another comment on it.","Trevor Mihalik","Yes. Thanks, Joe. Hey Greg. Again, from what Joe said, this is going to be a fairly immaterial amount for us and then we're anticipating it could be about $30 million a year given a 10-year amortization cycle on it. And so we're still looking at it.","I think one of the things we probably will do is give prominence to it and try to break it out so that it's very clear, clearly shown on the face of the financials, but we're still evaluating that. But again, from our perspective, we generally do not exclude smaller items, and this would be a recurring item over a 10-year amortization period. So, I think our treatment may be different than Edison's.","Greg Gordon","Okay. My last question is this. In reiterating your guidance is a pretty bullish outcome, I think, because the guidance, as it was set, included the earnings from Chile and Peru. And so basically, what you're telling us is pulling out what was the expected earnings contribution from Chile and Peru, net of the initial savings from deleveraging with the proceeds and the outcome from -- the positive outcome from the rate cases and the CapEx increase in Texas that you've basically be able to offset the removal of those earnings completely, if not almost completely. Is that a fair summary?","Joe Householder","Yes. So, thank you, Greg. Look, we've had a remarkable year, as I said in our opening remarks, thus far this year. And the proceeds that we're getting from the South American sale, the tax savings we've had there and a GRC out of this risk RAMP case that is -- that allowed the capital that we need to run the utilities in a safe and reliable manner.","All of our businesses are doing well and we're very focused on the strategy and we're very pleased that we're able to maintain the guidance for next year based on the operations, based on the GRC, based on South America, all the elements you mentioned; it's very solid.","Greg Gordon","Thank you guys. Congrats.","Joe Householder","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research.","Steven Fleishman","Hi good morning. So, just a broad question on California. Obviously, first, congratulations, you've continued to manage the fire season very well for 30 in a row. And -- but it's just been obviously a kind of interesting two weeks in terms for the whole sector and the state. So, maybe just some perspectives on how you're thinking about any changes from the Governor, the commission, how you're managing your shut-off plans, if at all? And anything about the structure of the sector and the state. I'd just be curious how you're taking this all-in?","Joe Householder","Thank you, Steve. It's a broad question. I have quite a bit that I'd like to say about it. So, bear with me, probably and I appreciate your comment. We didn't have any significant wildfire, catastrophic fire in our territory. This year, we faced very severe weather conditions, but safety is top of mind across our companies in California and in Texas, where we've had some pretty severe tornadoes.","But I want to start out with saying how proud I am and how proud we are of our team at SDG&E. I was actually over there at the emergency operations center the day before yesterday during the peak time, which was sort of between 10 in the morning and noon here. And I've been there many times in non-weather conditions and practice sessions. And that's always interesting, and I'm excited to see it.","But seeing them in action, taking immediate decisions as the conditions change, and it's not just the people in that room that room is buzzing and they're all working together really well, but it's all the people in the field. I'm listening to phone calls back and forth about live conditions in the community, allowing the team to really have see on the ground, right?","We have all these cameras, but now we have people on the ground and that underground experience, helping them make prudent decisions. I saw them turning off lines based on what was going on, on the ground to save lives and reduce the potential for fire.","So, I just want to congratulate our team. I actually ask Caroline Winn, who is the COO at SDG&E to come, and I'm going to ask her to speak about this in a minute, but I want to touch on a couple of other points that you made.","Look, I think the Governor did a really good job coming into office; working with the legislature and the company's; resetting the prudency standards, the presumptions; letting the CPUC consider factors within and outside our control; looking at humidity, temperature, wind speed. It's been an incredible difficult couple of weeks.","So, we've had a big head start, and -- but we're not stopping. You probably saw our Fire Safe 3.0. We're continuing to innovate. And we will help the others try to catch up, but it's been 10 years of hard work, but we just keep wanting to get better and better.","I have to tell you on the power shutoffs, I've advocated to Pedro and others like, you guys have got to, it's the only way you're going to keep people out of harm's way. And I have very strong views on this. We have to do it, okay? I think the Governor believes that we have to do it. The Governor has been very supportive of SDG&E. Power shutoff isn't the first thing we do. It's a tool and we use it when we have to, at the end, when there's no other option.","But we're continuing to learn, innovate, the people really care and they are razor focused. It's not any time for newcomers, no time for a bunch of forms to fill out, reviews, debates, the situation is intense, and we're dealing with people's lives and we have to do it, and we know what we're doing, and we've proven that we know what we're doing. It's still a challenge, but I think it's manageable if you get the right processes in place.","I want to have Caroline take a minute and explain how the last couple of weeks have been. And, yes, she's in charge of making sure that we're all safe.","Caroline Winn","Thanks Joe. Just to give a little context, we're coming off the heels of our fourth Santa Ana Red Flag event of the season. We saw typical wind speeds consistently blowing at 20 to 30 miles per hour and peaking at 60 to 80 miles per hour in our highest elevations during this operational period.","I will tell you that our system held up well given the environmental conditions and there were no major fires, as Joe mentioned. Around 25,000 customers in this last event were impacted by the public safety power shutoff, and I'm encouraged with our ability to minimize the customers that are affected as a result of PSPS.","Our capabilities have been really enhanced over the last several years as a result of our investments in more precise controls of our PSPS plans. And I would also add that in the last couple of years, we have been focused on refining our customer outreach and communication strategy as well as our operational readiness and response.","Just speaking a little bit more about customer outreach. We understand the impact that these outages have on businesses and families. And this is an area that we've been really focused on. And there are 3 areas that I'd just like to mention.","The first is a comprehensive and advanced notification to our customers. We don't want our customers surprise, and we want to provide them with complete information so they can make the appropriate plans for their families and businesses. Having said that, the weather conditions can change on a dime and there are circumstances where we may need to turn off the power to customers that we hadn't anticipated. And we're not shy to do so.","I would say, two, we have worked on the strategic placement of our community resource centers throughout the community to make sure that they're properly placed and make sure that customers have easy in, easy out access, and they have the information and the amenities that they need.","And I'd say, lastly, it's our key to building strategic partnerships. We learned very early on that we can't do this alone. And so in fact, before these events, we had conference calls with our non-profit and community-based organizations so that all customers were notified and had the things they need.","I think a good example is before this last event, we partnered with Meals on Wheels and the Red Cross to provide the senior communities affected by this PSPS with the amenities that they would need during these cooler temperatures.","So, that's just some examples of the areas, and we continue to refine our plan. We continue to improve what we do and learn from every event that we have.","Joe Householder","Thanks Caroline. And Steve, let me just add one more thing because you asked a broad question and one thing I would mention is, as I've watched this and I don't have all the information about the fires up north, where we've had fires in several different territories, not ours, it doesn't appear at this time that the magnitude of those fires will impinge on the fund.","So, I think with the $1 billion requirement for insurance, these were large severe fires and our heart goes out to all these people, but it is such that it doesn't appear to me today that, that's impacting the fund. It's tough. And I can tell you, much the way many of you have been with us for 20 years, much the way we used to manage the commodity business, the CEO, myself, we worry about this stuff every day.","Jeff was calling me, he's traveling overseas on the LNG business, but he's been calling me and contacting me every day about this. He worries about it every day. I worry. Then we call Kevin, then we call Caroline. We're on top of it. And it's just something that we have to manage, much like people in the Northeast or the Southeast have to manage hurricanes or snow events or whatever. We have to manage this and it's a little bit new for California. California is a mild climate. And generally, we don't have outages. This is a different event, and we're learning to deal with it. Thank you.","Steven Fleishman","Great. Great. Thank you.","Joe Householder","Welcome.","Operator","Our next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, good morning or good afternoon.","Joe Householder","Hi Julien.","Trevor Mihalik","Hey Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey. So, guys, I suppose with respect to the proceeds in aggregate from Latin America, I'm curious how you think about the 2020 uses at this point. Obviously, we're hearing you say debt pay down. Obviously, you raised your CapEx here. But just ideally, if we can get a little bit more granular as to how you're thinking about it?","And separately, and I know Jeff is not here, how do you think about more strategic uses of this capital given some of the comments on the last call as well?","Joe Householder","Thank you, Julien. I'm going to turn this over to Trevor in a minute, but we're really pleased with getting full value for these companies. We've run them well for 20 years, and we're getting the right value, and that's really important. And we've talked about paying down debt.","But let me -- let Trevor address your question. You hit on a number of points. And on the very last one, we're not going to talk about M&A kind of activities. But obviously, we're very focused on large capital programs. So, Trevor?","Trevor Mihalik","Yes, thanks, Joe. Yes. So, Julien, with the amounts of the proceeds that we'll be getting in the first quarter after tax, it's, call it, roughly between $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion. We would be deploying that cash in the short-term over paying down our short-term debt and then realigning the debt portfolio and then as well as having it support the CapEx growth.","Certainly, we're seeing increased capital requirements in the California Utilities as a result of the GRC and the RAMP filing. A big portion of that GRC is allocated towards capital around safety and reliability. And then we've also seen an increase in the Texas Utilities with the capital going up there. So, deploying that capital as efficiently as we can.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. And then maybe if I can pivot very quickly over to the LNG side of the business. Obviously, constructive developments of late, would be curious how you're thinking about public developments? And again, however -- in whatever form that takes through the course of the next year, especially given the update on Port Arthur to mid-next year on FID, what is the outcome?","Joe Householder","Sure, sure. Thank you. So, I appreciate the questions. These LNG liquefaction projects are very large, complex and quite competitive. And we are progressing these projects to help unlock North America's energy potential and deliver clean energy across the globe. And I travel around the world a lot as Jeff, and we want to get these projects right for our customers and our investors. And in most of these cases, our customers are also investors in the project.","And as we've traveled around, and I was recently in Japan, just been in multiple countries in the last 10 days, we were both at the Cameron, dedication with all of our current partners and customers at Cameron and others, we find them all committed to ensuring the success of these projects and long-term returns.","So, I know it feels like it's taking time. But this is just us getting it right. We're highly focused on creating value. And I feel really good about the projects and the team. I wouldn't read anything into this. This is us making sure we get the EPC agreements, get the right contractor, get all the things we need to take FID. We are starting to work on financing for Port Arthur. But our partners also have to get comfortable with the returns and everything. Everybody's working toward it.","And so I wouldn't read anything in. These are small months in time when we're talking about four or five-year construction projects and multiple year development projects. We are signing a lot of MOUs, and you see that. Partially, that is, the customers are quite excited about being in some of these projects, and they worry that they're going to get left out and they want to sign something.","And so we're signing these things, but we're not quite ready. So, we signed an MOU for Cameron expansion. The partners are moving forward. We've got Total telling us exactly how they think we should do it. We haven't voted on anything yet. We've got the expansion at ECA. We're not ready to take FID on that yet. We don't have all the designs and everything, but people want to have their place and it's important.","And so we're making that public. I think as we make progress, we'll try to make -- you guys can see all the FERC things, you see that we're actually in commissioning and Train 2 at Cameron now. It's a little bit harder in the development phase. I think as you see us start to do something like financing work at Port Arthur, you'll see -- you'll get the confidence that we have.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Thanks for the time guys.","Joe Householder","Thanks Julien.","Trevor Mihalik","Thanks Julien.","Operator","And now we'll take question from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides","Hey guys. A couple of questions. One on the California Utilities, can you remind us, obviously, you get those GRC step-ups each year for the next several years in EPA, SoCalGas and San Diego Gas & Electric, are those the only CPUC related step-ups you get in these three-year periods? And can you get quantified for us what the FERC transmission step-up will be at SDG&E for 2020? I know a lot of those have already been settled or are part of settlement agreements.","Joe Householder","So, a couple of things to address there, Michael. So, what we've addressed here is the impact on 2019 through the third quarter of the rate cases, the affirmation of our 2020 guidance without all the pieces, some of that relating to the confidence we have in the rate cases. There's nothing in there relating to the cost of capital, which we expect to get settled by the end of this year that starts effective next year.","So, that will be a component that we would expect to see. I think you'll get more details around all of this at the Investor Day. There are some projects that we do at both companies that are sometimes out of the GRC, we'll lay those out, and you've seen those before. But we'll give you a lot more clarity into 2020 and beyond at the Investor Day.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Question-- ","Joe Householder","Sorry, you asked, on the FERC question -- on the FERC question, that one, we expect to get finalized next year. And we would see a step-up from our current rate to the new rate starting then.","Michael Lapides","Got it. And is that new rate -- is that settlement document, a public document with the rate disclosed or the revenue step-up disclosed?","Joe Householder","Yes.","Michael Lapides","Okay. If it's a public document, what's the step-up?","Joe Householder","It's 10.6.","Trevor Mihalik","Yes. Retroactive.","Joe Householder","Retroactive at the beginning of this June -- I'm sorry, June 2019.","Trevor Mihalik","Yes.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Okay. I was thinking more of the dollar-million amount. Sorry.","Joe Householder","We haven't published that.","Michael Lapides","Okay. Finally, on Cameron, is there a material cost change if you finish Cameron 3 before you've made FID decisions on Cameron 4 and 5? I would think there would be in terms of like releasing crews and sending folks home. I mean you're not that far away from sending crews home because you're not that far away from having Cameron 3 done. I'm just curious how you think about that and how you kind of -- how much that plays a role in the negotiation process and in the planning process with both customers and partners?","Joe Householder","Yes, let me speak to that. I mean, first and foremost, all of the partners in Cameron are very focused on getting Trains 2 and 3 finished and into service before we do anything beyond that. So that's a primary goal, and we're getting very close. I mean we're about 96% finished and really Train 2 is in commissioning and 3 not far behind. So, those are almost done, but they still need to finish their commissioning process. Everybody is focused on that.","We are still just in the last couple of weeks have kind of honed in on what we think we want to build there. We haven't announced what that is yet. And we are still deciding how we're going to do that. It's undetermined at this point exactly how we're going to do it or who will do it.","So, I think you probably remember from a few years ago when we were going to try to do Train 4, we were going to try to do continuous construction. That ship really failed because what's going on right now is doing a lot of electrical work. It's being done by subcontractors and the commissioning is being done mostly by Chiyoda people and some McDermott people. It's not the same people that would get -- go in and start doing pilings again. So, the idea of any kind of continuous construction went away years ago. And so I think, I'd leave it with that.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thank you, Joe. Much appreciated guys.","Joe Householder","Sure Michael.","Trevor Mihalik","Thanks Michael.","Operator","And now we'll take our next question from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners.","Joe Householder","Hi Shar.","Shar Pourreza","Hey guys, how are you doing?","Joe Householder","Good.","Shar Pourreza","Let me just follow-up question on LNG and sort of as you're thinking about cash flows as Cameron Trains 1 and 3 continue on pace. But we saw a peer transact and monetize a part of cash flows at a very healthy multiple. So, as you guys sort of think about the existing Cameron 1 and 3, even 4 and 5, ECA, Port Arthur, how do you sort of feel about potentially monetizing some of these cash flows, especially since we just got a pretty healthy public mark?","Joe Householder","Well, look, I'm not going to talk about some kind of an M&A sort of transaction, which that isn't a bit of. But I would say this, remember, we already have 50% ownership. We don't own 100%. So, it's a little bit different situation. We clearly have good value. You can see the cash flow, the EBITDA from Cameron. And we've had good value in the company from Cameron for some time now as we've been constructing it.","But I would say, we're going to build a pretty large LNG business. And I would think that we are going to use that cash flow to help build both the expansion at Cameron and new projects. So, that's what I would think we would be doing to create value -- to create additional value. We're always open to looking at things like that. But know, we've looked at MLP some time ago, that ship sale. But -- we're always looking at things. I actually think we will wind up using the cash for building our LNG business bigger.","Shar Pourreza","Got it, self-fund each other. Okay, that's good. And let me just shift real quick to Texas. Oncor, obviously, it's a very healthy CapEx increase that you guys had. A lot of it was driven on sort of the transmission side. Distribution kind of still remains a little bit modest, totally.","At what point can you start to pull forward some of that distribution spend? Should we think about it as an opportunity when transmission spend slows down and you offset with distribution? I mean you obviously have the economic backdrop to support more spending. So, how do we sort of think about the interim mix between distribution and transmission?","Joe Householder","Yes, I'll start and then I'll ask Trevor to comment. Look, we're very excited about Oncor and the growth in Texas, and there's a lot to do there. And so I think we're very focused on helping them fund that growth. And Trevor, do you want to speak to the details that he is asking about in transition?","Trevor Mihalik","Yes, I think, when we look at this, Shar, the big legs of the stool is really in the growth in Texas are in and around the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex being one of the fastest-growing metroplexes and looking at kind of their 2% premise growth on a year-to-year basis. So that's really kind of on the distribution side.","Then you look at the West Texas with the Permian and all what needs to be built out on the transmission side with the Permian. And then the third leg is, there's, call it, close to 100 gigawatts in the queue, which is primarily renewables based. So, you see kind of that slant towards more transmission right now as opposed to the growth that we're seeing in and around the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. But all three legs of the stool, renewables, West Texas and the Permian as well as Dallas are all very, very healthy growth areas for us. ","Shar Pourreza","Got it. Thanks guys. Appreciate it. Congrats.","Joe Householder","Thank you.","Operator","We will now go to a Sophie Karp of KeyBanc.","Sophie Karp","Hi good morning. How are you guy doing?","Joe Householder","Very well. Thanks. You?","Sophie Karp","Okay. Thank you. Congrats on the quarter. Just wanted to go back a little bit to the guidance. Clearly, we're very impressive that you're maintaining the guidance despite selling and divest in South America. Maybe, could you help us a little bit to bridge how that's -- how much of that's kind of delta is going to be covered by savings on debt versus maybe incremental earnings from Texas and LNG ramp sort of -- maybe if you could provide a little bit more color on that?","Joe Householder","Look, I think that as we were able to finalize the sales agreements for South America, assess the rate case, which just got finalized at the end of September, and look at all of our businesses afresh, we became very confident that our guidance range was still good, despite the sales and that was really good news for us because all the businesses are doing well.","We have confidence in Cameron and the California Utilities, Oncor and then the South American proceeds. They all come into play. We're not going to break down segment guidance until we have our Investor Day. So, we'll give you all that detail at that point in time.","Trevor Mihalik","Sophie, yes, this is Trevor. I would just add one thing, though, that with the sale of the renewables that you saw earlier, we were able to maintain our guidance as we recycle that capital. And likewise, with the sale of South American recycling net capital coupled with, like Joe said, a constructive rate case, that's really focused on capital around safety and reliability, we feel good that we've been able to recycle capital and maintain guidance. So, a huge positive for us in that respect.","Sophie Karp","Yes, yes. And so maybe just to double check, does that assume any particular outcomes in the cost of capital preceding and at the FERC.","Trevor Mihalik","No, that's outside of the cost of capital. So, that's not in the specific guidance. But again, it most likely would be within that guidance range. ","Sophie Karp","Okay. And the FERC settlement?","Trevor Mihalik","Same thing. It would be in the guidance range. But it's not specifically included. No assumption on that is built into it right now.","Sophie Karp","Got it. And then just to confirm on taxes, the incremental CapEx that you are putting in at Oncor; that would be recoverable through TCOS and DCRFs, correct?","Trevor Mihalik","That's right. That's right.","Sophie Karp","All right. Thank you. That's all I had. I'll jump back in the queue.","Joe Householder","Sophie, thanks.","Trevor Mihalik","Thank you.","Operator","And we will now go to Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson","Hey good morning guys.","Trevor Mihalik","Good morning. How are you Paul?","Paul Patterson","All right. So, just to sort of follow-up on Greg's and Steve's questions. If I understand sort of your answer, it looks like you guys are leaning to basically including an adjusted EPS, the Wildfire amortization?","Trevor Mihalik","Yes, let me take that one, Paul. What we're leading to is calling it out prominently probably on the face of the financial statements, but probably not carving it out as a separate adjusted guidance. But again, we're still working through that right now. This quarter, it was pretty small. It was only $6 million of earnings, so we didn't call it out.","But again, I think one way or the other; we will show it pretty prominently that people can identify that number on the face of the financial statements.","Paul Patterson","Okay. And then with respect to the PSPS that you guys have instituted, how would they compare? I mean, I realize that there are separate and distinct situations in every service territory, et cetera. But as a percentage of customers, and I think you guys said, I think, something in the 100,000 customer range. How does that compare to the number of customers that are being reduced in the service territories to the north?","And how long are these people on average being cut off, how long is their power out? Because from our perspective, I mean, obviously, different service territories, different numbers of people, but the reaction to these power shutoffs to the north seem to be rather hostile, which I haven't really -- I've seen complaints about obviously people being disconnected in your area in the past and what have you, but I haven't seen anything to this level if you follow me. I'm just wondering if you could speak to that a little.","Joe Householder","Yes, let me take it first, Paul. And then I think I'll have Caroline also address it. It's quite interesting and I alluded to this earlier, I've lived in different parts of the country and seen power go out for a variety of reasons, generally, weather events, right? You have planned outages; those are usually generally very short in term.","But I've seen weather events across the Eastern seaboard. And nobody likes it, but it happens. And if there's ice and snow or wind knocks trees down and knocks the lines down. This is what happens. And I've been through periods where the utility in and around Washington, D.C. was -- you didn't do enough to keep the reliability up. So, it's always an issue.","I think in California, we've been so used to mild climates and very high reliability that it's a little bit unusual. And what we've tried to do, and I'm going to let Caroline speak to this, is we've -- over the 10 years, we have tried to figure out a way, segment our grid, really take out the power, shut the power off for safety reasons in small areas where the wind speed is just too intense. And that doesn't cause as much issue.","Although at the very beginning, it was difficult, but then we started to build centers for people to go to, got the communications chain. So, we learned a little bit by doing. I think up north, they're cutting off a much larger percentage of people, of course, they have a bigger territory. I don't think they're at the point yet where they can do exactly what we're doing; they can get there. But I think that's what you've seen a little bit of backlash on. It's something people in other parts of the country have had to deal with for most of their lives and people in Northern California haven't.","Caroline, can you talk about this? Because what you've said is something about hundreds of thousands. We had a much smaller number of people out than that. They've had very significant, over 1 million, I think. Caroline, go ahead.","Caroline Winn","Sure. In our last event, we impacted around 25,000 customers, as I mentioned earlier, and I would just tell you that over the past decade, we continue to improve. And one of the things that we did early on after we've had these public safety power shutoff, we set our senior management team to these communities that were impacted to do one thing, and that was to listen to customers.","What were customers concerned, how can we lessen the impact when a PSPS occurs. And that's really where the idea of these community resource centers was generated from us going out and listening to our customers. And in turn, we're showing them the types of conditions that we're seeing and the types of wind speeds that the area is experiencing, and I would just tell you that we're also going out and doing community resilience fares.","So, we're out in the communities that were most impacted. And I have to tell you that over the years, the impact and the response from customers has been actually positive. They're thanking us for turning off the power. And so I'm really pleased to hear that. Now is 100% of the customers happy? No, but I can tell you that customers are more accepting of the practice that we're doing and they know the conditions we're experiencing. And we're listening on how to lessen the impact to them when we do have to do a PSPS. ","Joe Householder","And you might talk too about how long have we had to turn people off and it's different in different areas?","Caroline Winn","Yes, it's absolutely different in the highest elevation, where we've had to do more significant PSPS. But I can tell you, in the last -- the events over the last week, the average duration of these PSPS has been around 24 hours. So, we have tried to minimize that.","However, we're also careful that we're not going to turn the system back on when the conditions prevail. We do 100% patrols of all of our circuitry and the circuit segments that we de-energize to ensure that there's no trees on the line. There's been no damage to the lines.","And surprisingly, we have found things that have happened. We found broken poles. We found broken cross-arms. We found trees on wires. So, that's the importance of doing these 100% patrols before we turn back customers on.","Paul Patterson","Okay. Well, great job, guys. I mean maybe, you guys can profit -- well, I don't know, maybe you guys can help the other guys up to the north, and maybe that could be appreciated some more?","Joe Householder","We do.","Paul Patterson","Okay. Thanks so much.","Joe Householder","Thank you, Paul.","Operator","And with that, it does conclude today's Q&A session. I would like to turn things back to Joe Householder for any additional or closing comments.","Joe Householder","Thank you all for joining us today. I will see many of you at EEI in about a week. In any event, I'd like to express my gratitude to each of you for the confidence you've had in Sempra Energy and support you've given me, and it's been a real pleasure knowing you all.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I am pleased to turn the conference over to Mr. Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead, sir.","Richard A. Vaccari","Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm Rick Vaccari, Vice President of Investor Relations.","This morning, we'll be discussing Sempra Energy's First Quarter 2013 Financial Results. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section. With us today in San Diego are several members of our management team: Debbie Reed, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Snell, President; Joe Householder, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Trevor Mihalik, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer.","Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual result to differ materially are discussed in the company's reports filed with the SEC.","It is important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis. I'd also like to note that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, May 2, 2013, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.","With that, please turn to Slide 3, and let me hand it over to Debbie.","Debra L. Reed","Thanks, Rick, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. During the first quarter, we completed 2 significant transactions that further our strategy.","First, we closed the sale of 1 block of the Mesquite Power Plant for about $600 per kilowatt, which further reduces our exposure to merchant generation consistent with our plan. Second, we completed an extremely successful initial public offering of equity in our Mexican subsidiary, which was preceded by an issuance of over $400 million of local debt. This is consistent with our strategy to create capital structures in our international businesses that allow them to grow with local debt and equity. The success of our Mexican transactions recognizes the value that we are creating in our Mexican business. In fact, the increase in the IEnova stock price places our 81% stake at roughly equal to the total equity market cap based on the IPO price. The stock performance since the offering clearly demonstrates the high value that investors place on this business and allows our investors to use this as a reference to determine what our Mexican segment is worth.","This quarter, we also received a long-awaited proposed decision in the General Rate Case at our California utilities and a final decision on this case should be voted out soon. And finally, we continue to make progress during the quarter on our key projects, including Cameron Liquefaction, where we received a definitive schedule from FERC on their approval process.","We will now go through each of these items in more detail after we discuss the financials. But before doing so, I would like to turn to Slide 4.","There was a lot going on in our reported earnings this quarter, and I want to share with you some of the issues that are included in earnings that caused us not -- to not meet your quarterly expectations. Slide 4 lists a number of items from the first quarter, all of which are either onetime in nature or will turn around before year-end. This list includes: the gain on the sale of 1 block of the Mesquite Power Plant; a deferred tax charge related to the IEnova IPO; an impairment on our holdings in Argentina in anticipation of the sale by year-end; a reduction in our renewable grant receivable due to the federal budget sequestration; mark-to-market losses due to higher gas prices, which should reverse by the end of the year; and adjustment to our consolidation tax expense, which is expected to reverse by year-end; and natural gas transition integrity costs in excess of amounts currently recovered in way that will be balanced under the proposed decision in our GRC.","Of course, one of the most significant issues impacting our performance is the continued delay in a final decision in our 2012 General Rate Case at SDG&E and SoCalGas. And as I mentioned, we will discuss this in more detail a little later. We hope this table helps you reconcile our reported earnings to your projections.","And now let me hand things over to Joe to further discuss our financial performance during the first quarter, beginning with Slide 5.","Joseph A. Householder","Thanks, Debbie. Earlier this morning, we reported first quarter earnings of $178 million or $0.72 per share. This compares to earnings of $236 million or $0.97 per share in the same quarter last year.","As Debbie just mentioned, this quarter's earnings were impacted by a number of issues, including the continued delay in the final decision of our General Rate Case and a onetime $63 million deferred tax charge incurred as part of our initial public offering of our Mexican operations.","As a result of recording the tax related to the IEnova IPO in the first quarter, we will be able to now quickly distribute to the U.S. parent about $200 million due to the taxable income associated with the IEnova transaction. Since we can bring this cash back earlier than originally forecasted in this year, we have decided to defer any further repatriation until 2014 when we will continue with our planned repatriation of approximately $300 million per year.","While we did receive a proposed decision in our utility General Rate Case in the first quarter, we will not update our guidance for 2013 until we receive a final decision. The draft decision is on the CPUC's agenda for May 9, and assuming it is voted out on that day, we intend to provide an update to our guidance at our Analyst Conference on May 23.","We would expect to see some changes in the PD based upon the process Commissioner Ferron has put into place, and Debbie will discuss the key issues a little later on the call. However, if the current PD is adopted as written, we would expect to be at the low end of our 2013 guidance range of $4.30 to $4.80 per share.","Now let's go through the results for each of our segments in detail, beginning with our 2 California utilities on Slide 6. At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the first quarter of 2013 were $91 million, down from earnings of $105 million in the first quarter of 2012. Southern California Gas first quarter 2013 earnings were $46 million compared to earnings of $66 million last year. Earnings were lower at both California utilities, primarily due to higher operating expenses, including depreciation with no increase in authorized revenue due to the delay in our 2012 GRC decision. We have now operated since 2011 with no increase in our revenue requirement as we await the final decision in the GRC.","The first quarter results at SoCalGas were adversely impacted by $4 million related to the after-tax effect of natural gas transmission pipeline system integrity program cost, which exceed the amount currently being recovered in rates. Once the GRC decision is final, the excess cost for this program incurred since the beginning of 2012, will be balanced and all cost will be recovered in rates.","Additionally, as a result of the cost to capital decision, our revenue was reduced to reflect our actual embedded cost of long-term debt, which is lower than what was previously being recovered in rates. This true-up negatively impacted earnings by approximately $5 million at SDG&E and $3 million at SoCalGas in the first quarter of 2013, and we expect a similar impact throughout the remainder of the year.","Finally, SDG&E's first quarter earnings were positively impacted by higher transmission earnings, while SoCalGas earnings in the first quarter of last year included $4 million related to incentive awards associated with the Gas Cost Incentive Mechanism. We anticipate a similar GCIM award to be recorded by SoCalGas later this year once it is approved by the CPUC.","I am cautiously optimistic that this is the last quarter I have to say this, but please keep in mind that until we receive a final decision on our General Rate Case, we continue to record revenues based upon 2011 authorized levels, plus an adjustment for recovery of incremental wildfire insurance premiums at SDG&E based on recent CPUC decisions for recovery of prior years' increased premiums. In the quarter the General Rate Case is decided, which we now expect will be the second quarter of this year, we will record the cumulative impact of the decision from January 1, 2012.","Now please move to Slide 7. At our South American Utilities, earnings were $37 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to earnings of $40 million in the same period of 2012. We recorded higher earnings from operations at our businesses in Chile and Peru, but this was more than offset by a $7 million impairment charge related to our investment in 2 Argentine natural gas utility holding companies. We continue to actively pursue the sale of these investments, and we expect to dispose of them by the end of the year.","First quarter 2013 earnings for the Sempra Mexico segment were $31 million versus earnings of $33 million in the first quarter of last year. The small decrease is due primarily to a minority interest from the IEnova IPO.","Now please turn to Slide 8. Moving on to Sempra U.S. Gas & Power, the Natural Gas segment earned $53 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to $1 million in the year ago period. This quarter's earnings include the $44 million gain net of related expenses from the sale of 1 of the 2 blocks of our Mesquite Power Plant. The increase in earnings for the quarter was also due to $9 million of higher earnings from our U.S. LNG business due to the timing of cargo marketing operations. These increases were offset by $10 million of higher mark-to-market losses related to movement in gas prices.","In the first quarter of 2013, mark-to-market losses were $12 million, which we expect to reverse by the end of the year.","The Renewables segment generated earnings of $4 million in the first quarter of 2013, down from earnings of $10 million in the first quarter of 2012. The decrease is primarily driven by 2 factors. First, due to the federal government sequestration, there's been a reduction of 8.7% in the amount of cash grant awards to be paid by the U.S. Treasury. This resulted in a $23 million decrease in our cash grant receivable and a reduction in earnings of $5 million this quarter. Second, there were tax benefits related to the completion of solar assets placed in service in 2012. The decrease in earnings was partially offset by higher levels of production tax credits from our wind assets, many of which were placed into service in late 2012.","Now let me hand the call back to Debbie.","Debra L. Reed","Thanks, Joe. We have talked about our intent to optimize our capital structure in our international business unit, and I am pleased that we took a big step in that direction last quarter through extremely successful debt and equity offering at our Mexican subsidiary. That subsidiary, previously called Sempra Mexico, now IEnova, raised nearly $1 billion of external capital during the first quarter.","In February, we had 2 successful debt issuances at IEnova that raised a total about $400 million at very attractive terms. In addition to raising capital, the debt offering helped educate investors about our Mexican operations. And the strength of the balance sheet at IEnova allows for further leverage as we continue to grow.","Then in March, IEnova sold almost 19% of its equity at a value of around 10x to 11x 2013 expected EBITDA under IFRS. The demand for this offering was tremendous. IEnova is the second-largest energy company in Mexico and the first energy company to be listed on the Mexican Stock Exchange. The strong demand allowed us to create a shareholder base, which is comprised of a broad group of Mexican and international investors, with the majority coming from Mexico, further bolstering IEnova's position in that market.","Please turn to Slide 10. Even with pricing at the top of the published valuation range for the offering, the market has shown continued enthusiasm for IEnova as the stock is up 22% since the IPO. When we launched the IPO, the implied valuation for IEnova was around $3 billion. And today, that is about $4 billion. As you can see from the chart on the left, our 81% holding in IEnova is worth nearly double today what our book value in those assets was at the end of 2012. This is great for Sempra shareholders as it provides transparency into the value the market ascribes to our Mexican subsidiary and allows IEnova to continue growing without the need for additional Sempra capital.","Both the debt and equity transactions in Mexico represent an important step in optimizing our international capital structure. And since all 3 of our international businesses have substantial ability to increase leverage to fund growth projects, we will continue to look for future opportunities.","Let's go on to Slide 11. In March, we received a proposed decision in the General Rate Case for our 2 California utilities. The proposed decision authorizes a revenue requirement for 2012 of $1,749,000,000 and $1,952,000,000 for SDG&E  and SoCalGas, respectively. This represents respective growth of 8% and 6% over currently authorized levels. The decision also establishes a 4-year GRC period through 2015, subsequent escalation of the adoptive revenue requirements for 2013 through 2015 using the Consumer Price Index and the continuation of the Z-factor mechanism for qualifying cost recovery.","While there were some positives in the proposed decision such as the capital requirement level that are generally in line with our request, we filed a comment on the proposed decision last month requesting a few significant changes. First, these changes aim to address certain inconsistencies between our PD and prior CPUC General Rate Case decisions. We strongly believe that all California utilities should be treated equally from a policy perspective on routine issues such as attrition mechanism and employee compensation.","The most significant inconsistency between the Edison decision that was voted out unanimously just 4 months ago and our proposed decision relates to the attrition mechanism, which calls for the use of the CPI-Urban index. This index does not reflect the true escalation in costs that a California utility faces, and based on historical trends will provide SDG&E and SoCalGas annual revenue increases that are about 1% lower than what the commission adopted in all recent rate case decisions.","Another major inconsistency relates to the proposed amount of ratepayer funding of our employee compensation plan. Our PD calls for ratepayer funding of only 50% of our performance-based compensation, while there have been recent CPUC decisions approving 90% of the same. Given the CPUC's own employee compensation study affirm that our total compensation, which includes performance-based compensation, is at market level, we don't believe it makes sense for our ratepayer funding to be reduced as the record in the rate case clearly support full funding.","We also recommended changes that help to ensure both SoCalGas and SDG&E have sufficient funds to maintain safe and reliable operations and continue providing the level of service our customers expect and deserve. The need for changes in the PD is most acute at SoCalGas where the proposed decision reduced funding for critical operations that are required for that company to do basic work, such as leak detection and locate and mark services. We think it is highly unusual, given its focus on safety, that the commission would choose to reduce funding in these core services. We have made our concerns known, and we expect that with a better understanding of the fact, most, if not all, of this funding will be reinstated in the final decision.","Commissioner Ferron has acknowledged that some errors were made in the PD. He has put in place a transparent process to allow parties to address their concerns for the proposed decision and we have made our case for improvements. We expect him to do the right thing and make the appropriate changes.","We anticipate that a final decision will be reached on the GRC in the second quarter, and as Joe noted earlier, we hope to be able to provide an update to our financial guidance that reflects the outcome at our Analyst Conference on May 23.","Let's now go on to Slide 12. Turning to our efforts to develop liquefaction at our Cameron facility, last month, FERC issued a notice of its schedule for the environmental review of the project. Cameron is the first and only proposed LNG export application currently pending before FERC to have reached this milestone in the permitting process. Based on the published schedule, the final environmental impact statement will be released in November 2013 and the final application should be approved by early 2014. The DOE non-FTA permit is, of course, the other major outstanding permit we require and we continue to expect to receive it in 2013.","FERC's decision to release the schedule shows the relative strength of our project, and we continue to believe that Cameron is well positioned to be among the first applications that DOE reviews and approves. With the timing of these regulatory approvals in mind, the project remains on schedule to start construction next year and begin operations in the second half of 2017.","On the commercial front, we are nearing completion of the tolling and JV agreements with Mitsubishi, Mitsui and GDF SUEZ. We expect that those agreements will be signed later this month, and I expect we will have much more to say on this at our Analyst Conference.","Now please turn to Slide 13. In summary, we took a number of key steps forward during the first quarter in achieving our long-term goals. We look forward to seeing many of you at our Analyst Conference on May 23 in New York where we will discuss our goals and overall strategy in significantly more detail.","With that, I'll stop and open up the call to take any of your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Faisel Khan with Citi.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Faisel from Citi. On IEnova, just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on what your plans are kind of going forward for your participation in the entity. Meaning that you have roughly 80% right now and if the company raises more equity in the future to grow the business, will you maintain your 80% stake or will you let that kind of float down?","Debra L. Reed","I would say, first off, we really like this business and the reason that we wanted to do the IPO was so that we could grow the business. And so I think, at this point, we're very -- we like what we have in both Mexico now and Peru with an 80% ownership, that we feel that that's a good share balance with having local ownership and local debt plus our 80% ownership. And we haven't really thought of anything beyond keeping that kind of structure. I'm going to Mark and Joe, because they were part of the road tour on this, to add any comment.","Mark A. Snell","Yes, Faisel, this is Mark. We don't have any current plans to reduce our ownership below where our current -- where it is. And I think if you look at what we've done in Peru over the years, it mimics the ownership structure that we have down there. And I think we're pretty satisfied where it is. We have a lot of great projects on the horizon for IEnova. But the good news is, is that we still have quite a bit of debt capacity. So it is -- into the foreseeable future, we don't really see it changing.","Joseph A. Householder","Faisel, this is Joe. I'll just add on to that, and I know there are probably people on the call that participated in the road show and I know many of the names I saw. What I said when I was asked this question many times is, just as Debbie and Mark said, that we don't have any plans to sell down. We probably would never sell any of our shares. And as Mark said, we have plenty of debt capacity. But the growth there is tremendous. And if they continue to grow at this pace and they need to raise more equity, I think we would let them though that. We would have to determine at that time whether we want to participate or allow ourselves to be diluted a little bit. But as Debbie said, we really like the business and our stay in it.  On the other hand, we've always said we like the size of our international business, around 30%, 1\/3 of Sempra's overall structure. So as we continue to grow our U.S. business, we get Cameron in, we can have more international earnings. But if IEnova can grow -- I mean, somebody asked me on the road show, can IEnova be bigger than Sempra? I said, I hope so. So we'll see.","Mark A. Snell","I would say this. I don't think that we would see -- we would expect that our earnings share from IEnova over the years will grow. No matter what our ownership percentage is, our share of earnings will grow.","Joseph A. Householder","Absolutely.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. It makes sense. And then, Debbie, can you give us an update on the ROE case filed for the power -- electric transmission assets?","Debra L. Reed","Sure. We made our filing at FERC and we'd used the FERC-prescribed methodology, contrary to some of the other cases that had been in the news. We used the FERC-prescribed methodology, which takes the median of your peer group of electric utilities. And we did that under 4 different methodologies that we filed at FERC. That came out with a 10.3% as kind of your base ROE. And then we added to that the allowance of 50 basis points for being part of an ISO and 50 basis points for our utility's specific risk. And, as you know, in California, we have things like the debt equivalency for the power contract and things like that, that FERC has looked at as being -- had a utility-specific risk to consider. So we made a filing off 11.3, the rate should go into effect on September 1. And we'll wait and see what the outcome, but we do feel we followed their methodology.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","When do you expect an outcome from the FERC?","Debra L. Reed","September 1.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","September 1. Okay, got you. Yes, last question from me. Where are you right now on the FEED for the Cameron facility?","Debra L. Reed","Well, we have the engineering work underway. We actually are in the process of selecting between -- there's 2 parties, 2 contracting groups that are bidding for the EPC. And we that have a pretty well-developed FEED that they can bid on. And then we'll do all the detailed engineering after that. We would expect to select our contractor by the end of this year. And would again, expect to begin construction next year. Mark, you want to?","Mark A. Snell","No, I think you hit all the points. We have a well-developed FEED and it'll get enhanced. But it's out for bid now. So we'll have EPC contracts at the end of the year.","Operator","And next we'll hear from Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","I had a couple questions. Just on that transmission issue. I thought FERC recently, or at least staff [ph] has been pushing single utilities to use a midpoint, not a median, and then if you're in an ISO or RPO, you can get a median?","Debra L. Reed","No. Well, we are in an ISO, and the FERC rules for an ISO is you use the median. And where there have been some issues is when utilities have not followed what the rules are for what their structure. We're an ISO. We're supposed to use the median of the peer group. And then we do 4 different studies using different economic modeling mechanisms of what the ROE comes up under those studies, and that's what we submitted to FERC.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. Switching gears to the -- just a clarification, the tax expense on the IEnova transaction, you're keeping that in -- that's part of your ongoing guidance for this year, the $0.25?","Debra L. Reed","Yes.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","But then you're not going to be repatriating the other -- the annual money that was typically about $0.30 hit every year?","Debra L. Reed","Well, we will repatriate starting next year. But because we had the -- already paid taxes on this and we can bring the $200 million back in the very near future, then we didn't see a need to bring back -- if you look at our cash balances, our cash flow statement, it's very, very strong. And so it just didn't seem to make a lot of sense for us to do additional repatriation this year.","Joseph A. Householder","And I'd just add on to that, Steven. She said we already paid tax. Actually, we're not going to pay the tax for 4 or 5 years because of the NOL, but we incurred the expense on the books.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. And then just at the year end, when you reported you had that slide with the kind of growth rates off of the base, et cetera. I mean, is all that slide all still relevant in terms of the different growth rates?","Debra L. Reed","Well -- yes. I mean there's nothing in terms of our projects and the fact that we have all these projects that we have underway that the majority of them already contracted or part of the utility, that would change in that slide. What we will do is if we can get a final decision in the rate case and enough time to analyze before the Analyst Meeting, then we will give you an update to that at that time. And we'll give you new guidance numbers and new ranges. Without having a final rate case decision, we sure wish we were not in this situation either. It's gone on a long time, and we'd like to be able to give you more than that. But hopefully, by the time of the Analyst Meeting, as I said, that this is on the agenda for a vote of our final rate case on May 9 and so if it comes out then, we should be able to give you all of that at the Analyst Meeting in a few weeks.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay, and just -- but, in theory, the -- to some degree, the GRC just also just sets the base and then the growth rate?","Debra L. Reed","Yes. And that's what -- the growth rate that we showed you, I mean, I don't see anything substantively different in the growth rates that we showed you. But we want to give you better guidance on the range for this year that begins the growth rate and then what that ends up being at the end of the period of time. And we're just not able to do that absent a rate case. I wouldn't ignore all what we gave a before. I just think we would like to further refine that for you at the Analyst Meeting.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay, and one more question, different topic. The DOE non-FTA approvals, what's your sense on the order, essentially the order of the queue at this point and when you think they'll rule on you, on Cameron?","Debra L. Reed","Well, a couple of things. I'm not so sure that there's going to be a queue where 1 project is going to come right after another. It may be very well that the decision is to take a group of projects that have -- are under the level that was in the study that was done last year. And that, that study, I think, went up to 10 Bcf of export and so we think that we are in good place in the queue. We're the only facility that is in the FERC process and that usually tends to be -- that tends to be the critical path is getting that FERC approval. And so we have some dates. [indiscernible] went out with come forward [ph]. But I don't know that the queue is going to come out one by one. If you did that, I think we're #4 or #5 in that queue. But we also think that there's a possibility that they may approve a number of projects all at one time.","Mark A. Snell","I was just going to say, I think when we talk about the queuing order, let's just remind ourselves that that's the queuing order in which the applications were filed. And while they've indicated that, that will place some bearing on it, it isn't necessarily so that that's going to be the order. We don't know that.  But I do think that all of the feedback that we're getting out of Washington, all of the things that we're hearing that we believe our project and the other brownfield projects are likely to be approved.","Debra L. Reed","This year.","Mark A. Snell","This year and we continue to believe that. We haven't heard anything contrary to that. And I will say that there is nothing on the record at the DOE that would indicate that they shouldn't approve these projects. I think that's an important point to remember. There's been no real record made of any reason not to approve them. So I suspect that they will get approved. And we're confident that it's going to happen.","Debra L. Reed","Yes, I would add to what Mark just said too. Monis [ph] who is in the confirmation to head up the agency, made very clear that as the Natural Gas Policy Act stands today, you really have to make a case as to why they shouldn't be approved. The burden of proof is on the other party. So the relevance of what Mark is saying is that someone has to come in and make the case as to why these projects are not in the public good. Everything that's come out has shown that these projects are in the public good and Monis [ph] commented on that during his confirmation period.","Operator","And now, we'll take a question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just thought I'd check in on the overall commercial arrangements. You mentioned fairly soon you'll have tolling and JV agreements in place in Cameron. And I just wanted to check to make -- to see if there's any evolution of your thinking on the commercial terms or the nature of the partnership that you're seeking to form in terms of capital commitment, in terms of degree of risk you're willing to bear, just in general without going into too much specifics.","Debra L. Reed","Well, I would say what we told you is the way that it's absolutely heading, which is that we would be committing our existing facility as our equity contribution. And that ourselves and our partners would then form a joint venture and that the joint venture would finance about 70% of the project. And each of the partners would then put in additional equity. And then depending on what the project costs, there may be some additional requirements for equity, but we would anticipate that to be funded largely via the income from the trains as they each come on. So I mean, that's the structure. There's nothing that we're seeing that would change in that structure. Mark, you want to...","Mark A. Snell","Yes, the only thing I would say is the sort of the broad parameters that we laid out last year at our Analyst Conference, those are all still roughly the same and we've marched along to that. There isn't anything that's coming up in the JV structure, the tolling structure that's significantly different than what we anticipated. And then we'll give you an update at the Analyst Conference, but I don't expect that anybody will be surprised by anything.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And so it sounds like there's nothing in relation to that, that would prohibit you from, for example, pursuing an MLP structure down the road, if that was something you wanted to do with this business?","Mark A. Snell","No, that's a great question. I'm glad you brought it up. We specifically designed the JV agreements and the tolling arrangements to allow for an MLP structure if that's the best available capital at any given point in time. And so that's -- it's definitely still in our plans.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And just a very quick small question on the Argentina business. Should be thinking about in terms of any material proceeds or further accounting adjustments there going forward?","Debra L. Reed","Joe -- I'm going to have Joe discuss that.","Joseph A. Householder","Yes, Stephen, the value of the assets, it's been reported in our previous SEC report, it was written down to about $30 million previous to this quarter. So there's no significant proceeds there. But what's important is because of the impairment that we took many years ago, we still have a large tax basis. So we're expecting, as soon as the sale takes place, to file a quick carryback claim and get about $80 million of tax back on this.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And that tax benefit, help me understand how would that -- I sometimes get confused as to how that translates back up to the mothership, as it were?","Joseph A. Householder","Yes, we'll get the cash here. It's U.S. tax. It'll come to us and there won't be an earnings effect of it. The earnings effect was booked long ago. But we'll actually get the proceeds from the sale plus this $80 million of cash.","Operator","We'll take a question from Greg Gordon with the ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered and I think you pretty much answered the 1 remaining in your script, but I just want to be clear. Did you say that if the attrition mechanism was not put in consistent with precedent, that, that was worth about 1% to revenue annually. Is that right?","Debra L. Reed","What I said is if you look at the difference between what was granted and our proposed decision, which we would hope to get changed and the utility-specific index, which has been used in virtually all General Rate Cases of recent, that, that is about a 1% difference on an annual basis in the attrition.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Right. And so, I'm with you. It does sound like they ought to be consistent in its application, but if they decided to change that and stick with the proposed decision, it would be sort of 1% less revenue in each of the years of the rate period?","Debra L. Reed","That would be the case, but if that were the case, we would obviously have to manage our business to that. And that's what we've made clear is that in -- with the focus that is on the commission right now with their own consultant raising concerns about the order of priority that they place on safety in terms of things, we would find it odd that they would look at doing this type of thing now for our companies when our performance has been so stellar over several years. And so we think that this is something that should be adjusted in the final decision. We've made our case very clear that the basket of bananas and eggs and things like that is not reflective of the cost of utility operation. And so we gave them some pretty specific information on this. There is a lot of support on the record in the case that would justify that this should be changed.","Operator","We'll move to a question from Neel Mitra with Tudor, Pickering.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","A question on Chile. Now that you've sold down about 20% in Peru and Mexico, on the last call, you said you'd consider selling down some of the interest there. What are your thoughts on that? Has anything changed in your thinking?","Debra L. Reed","Yes, I mean we're looking at it. The issue with Chile is that there's an incremental pact that occurs in Chile on -- that we would have to pay for repatriated dollars. And so the benefit of that there and doing the equity issuances there and then looking at that as any kind of repatriation source doesn't -- is not as attractive to us as Peru and Mexico.  The other thing with Chile is that we have a lot of cash there for investments. We have the ability to leverage. We're under leveraged there, and so we're looking at all of that in the context of what we want to do. We like the model of the 80% ownership, but we're only going to do that if it really makes sense and it would do that at a time when it would make sense. We're trying to -- we the transmission projects we're doing in Chile right now. We're bidding on some additional transmission projects there. If we start looking at having all this growth that we hope to see there over the next few years, that would probably be a better time for us to look at doing it.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then second question, now that we're seeing some liquefaction projects, whether yours or others coming online in the Gulf Coast, how is that affecting the value of your storage assets, and maybe some of the actions you're taking with the midstream network, like reversing the Cameron pipeline? Are you taking any incremental action now that we're getting a little bit closer with the midstream assets?","Debra L. Reed","Absolutely. And this is something we're very excited about when we look at how the value -- what we think the value of the storage assets will be as all of those LNG facilities start coming on. And you look at where they are, and other than -- all the brownfield, other than Dominion, are located in that whole Gulf area. So let me have Mark talk about some of the things we've been working on.","Mark A. Snell","Yes, I think that it actually is pretty exciting. We are -- we've done our engineering on turning the flow around at Cameron. We're looking at other -- we're looking at other pipeline developments in the region to allow us to more freely move gas around. And our Louisiana storage, which is the closest developable storage to our facility and to the Cheniere and Freeport facilities, that storage will become increasingly more important as these plants start operating.  So we're actually pretty excited about some of the opportunities down there and the ability for us to really become sort of gas managers or being able to help people facilitate the operation of these facilities to make sure that they can run most efficiently, which is continuously all the time and without interruption. And so having readily available gas storage is going to be a real plus. And we're very well positioned to do that.","Operator","And now, we'll take a question from Leslie Rich with JPMorgan.","Leslie Rich - J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Inc.","Just had a question on the solar grant and the delay due to budget sequestration. Is that the kind of thing that you would expect to happen every quarter? Or I guess, that depends on if congress can...","Debra L. Reed","Yes. No, we would not expect that. We -- the $5 million that we have for this quarter, we would expect that would be it. And then, that there will be a little bit more on depreciation expense down the line, but it's insignificant in future years, very insignificant. So this really takes care of the sequestration issue.","Leslie Rich - J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Inc.","So if sequestration ends and the company [indiscernible] as usual, would that reverse?","Debra L. Reed","Yes, if we don't -- it's an interesting issue because if sequestration ends and then we haven't gotten the grant, then the grant will not be sequestered. And so it's a funny thing. But so they -- I'll ask Joe to -- or Trevor to talk about the accounting of it. Because right now, we don't know what -- when we get our money back and that will depend on -- what happens will depend on what the timing of the money coming back.","Trevor I. Mihalik","Yes, Leslie, when we finished those projects at the of last year, we booked a receivable for the grants that we were going to get, and these are the only grants that we can get the grant programs over, really. So we booked those grants. And then Treasury came out and said, \"These are going to be sequestered and if you get cash back from the government between March and the end of September, you're going to have this cutback.\" So we had to book the cutback. And that's why we took the $5 million earnings. But as Debbie said, if we actually don't get the money until October, we'll get more money. We think we will get it between this time, but who knows. We filed for the grants.","Mark A. Snell","I think the important thing is we booked the -- it's onetime deal, we booked a negative effect. I mean, there are some of us sitting around this table wondering how this can be, how you could do this, why this is legal? And -- but at the end of the day, we may end up getting it back someday but right now, the negative effects are all taken care of.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I want to turn to U.S. business, the utilities, can you just refresh us a little bit? What was the rate base, I guess, the last known or last authorized rate base going all the way back to 2011? What is kind of your recommended rate base for '12 versus kind of where the ALJ proposed decision came in?","Debra L. Reed","Yes, I don't -- I have what our actual rate base is, but I don't have the answer to your question for back to 2011. What I can say is what we requested and what the decision granted. And what we requested was about $4.3 billion at SDG&E, and the proposed decision granted $4.1 billion. The key area of difference there is for some smart grid investment, and what the proposed decision did is that it disallowed that in this case, but set another case down the line where you could try to recover it. I think that there are a lot of parties that would like to have us go ahead and move forward with some level of expenditure on smart grids, so it's very possible that something can be reinstated there now.  And then on the SoCalGas gas side, we requested $3.6 billion and received $3.5 billion. Much of the rejection there was in gas operations. And as I already said in my comments, that I think that the focus on gas operation, I would expect us to get reinstatement of a lot of the O&M and the capital because these are basically core business functions.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And if the proposed decision is largely upheld, maybe not entirely but the -- some of the key components of it are upheld, could this put your utilities in a very unusual situation, one they probably haven't faced in 15 or 20 years, which is being -- struggling to actually earn their authorized rate of return?","Debra L. Reed","We've managed to -- every kind of outcome we've gotten in rate cases and it -- first of all, I would say, I would not expect this to be the final decision. I do believe that we will see changes made. We've had all-party meeting that I would -- give Commissioner Ferron credit. He had an open process to listen to comments on that. There was an all-party meeting where we discussed our issues. I think the people that were at that all-party meeting felt that we had pretty compelling reasons to see changes in here. So we would expect to see some changes, but we also -- I think we're going to live with what we get, and I don't think that that's a good solution for our customers, nor a good solution for our state, after the clear focus that the CPUC needs to be placing on safety now to look at some of the kinds of reductions that have been here, are really penny-wise and pound-foolish in our mind. And so I think that we will see some changes.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Last question, cash balances at the end of the quarter, large, large number bill 4, bill 5. Can you just talk to me about thoughts around the allocation of that capital?","Debra L. Reed","Yes, I'm going to have Joe talk about that.","Joseph A. Householder","Yes, that really comes from a couple of things, which was we had the proceeds from the IPO coming in right before the end of the quarter, of close to $600 million. And we also did the bond offering in Mexico in February and a lot of that -- a lot of those funds actually repaid intercompany debt back up into one of the Sempra International holding companies. We also received the proceeds from the sale of Mesquite and with that, we mostly paid off commercial paper. But now we have these funds, close to $1 billion of that is from Mexico. And a substantial part of the Mexican IPO funding will be used this year to fund the Sonora pipeline project, and the remainder of those funds used next year together with probably some additional borrowings down there. But that's what this is about. The big increase was mostly things that happened right toward the end of the quarter.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. In other words, a large chunk of that cash, almost $1 billion of that cash, is not sitting at the holding company. It's actually sitting down at the Mexico sub?","Joseph A. Householder","That's absolutely right.","Operator","And now we'll hear from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I don't  want to like keep going over this, but I just want to make sure I understand it. This attrition mechanism and the compensation issue, you guys mentioned in our press release that you'd be at the bottom end of guidance if this were to -- if the proposed decision wasn't changed. And I guess what I'm wondering is I think of the attrition thing as being more of a -- and I guess compensation, but certainly -- but I think the attrition thing, and particularly of it being more the long-range kind of EPS impact and I'm just wondering if this were to change, I mean, would that -- you said that you'd work within the -- with what you get, but would that not mean that there'd be an impact on long-term growth rate?","Debra L. Reed","Well, I don't tie this to growth rate. First of all, we'll manage with what we get. But the attrition mechanism would affect 2013 because, as you know, it's taken us 1.5 years to get a rate case decision. So we are basically operating on 2011 revenue requirement. We didn't get an increase in 2012, and then we should have gotten attrition increase to the 2012 level for 2013. So we're basically 2 years behind in terms of having revenues to operate our company. That -- we don't think that what is in the proposed decision is what should be voted out by the commission. We made the case on that. We made a very strong case on this attrition because it's not consistent with prior regulatory decisions. They have just voted out 4 months ago the Edison decision and gave them what is an appropriate utility index attrition mechanism. And so we do expect to get it changed. If it is not changed, then the mechanism here has historically been about 1% a year less in attrition increase than what the utility specific. But if that's what we get, we'll have to find a way to manage through it. But it's not to the benefit of our customers to have that.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I know you guys aren't going to give guidance until we get until we get the final decision, but should we be thinking about any potential change in long-term growth rate?","Debra L. Reed","No. No, I mean, I think I -- at least I tried to articulate that the long-term growth rate would be consistent with what we had showed you before in February, but that what we will do is that if we get a decision, we will give you more definitive information on that and the numbers for 2013 and narrow the range, as we talked to you that we would do, and then give you more detail on that growth rate.","Joseph A. Householder","Yes. Paul, this is Joe. When I showed you guys that chart, I mean, it's been our stated objective to be at 6% to 8%, but as I said, we're working on a lot of new areas of development, new projects, which is going to drive it above that. So our expectation right now is that these growth rates will be the same. And we'll talk more about it when we get to the conference, assuming we get the PD -- or finalized.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","That's excellent. I think that's great. And I guess what I wanted to just finally touch base with you on is, there was this IRS ruling that came out, or letter, what have you, on April 15 regarding the construction date for like ITC, PTC. And I was wondering you guys have probably had a chance to look of this, and what have you. Do you think that, that provides some additional opportunity for some renewable stuff for you guys? Or, I mean, is that sort of -- just any thoughts you guys have on what they came up with, the sort of the language that they use in terms of the construction date and stuff?","Debra L. Reed","Well, we think it's constructive and we are pursuing some additional opportunities to see if we can get under construction by next year as required under those guidelines. So we're moving forward to seek some additional opportunities in the wind space.","Operator","And now we'll hear from Maura Shaughnessy with MFS Investment Management.","Maura A. Shaughnessy - MFS Investment Management, Inc.","Most of my questions have been answered, but I -- 2 quick ones. First, have you actually announced the sale of Argentina? Or are you just hoping that it's done by the end of the year? And the second point on the attrition issue and the compensation issue, were these kind of totally out of the blue? I can't recall these mechanisms ever coming up in California before, with the CPI linkage and sort of random employee compensation? Well, I don't why I would say that, but anyway, yes, those 2 questions, please?","Debra L. Reed","Yes, I'll have Mark hit the Argentina sale and where we are on that.","Mark A. Snell","Hi. With respect to Argentina, no, we do expect to close by year-end. We're in active negotiations to sell our interest and we have been for some time and we're working out the details. But it's -- we're not -- it's not like we're just starting the marketing now.","Debra L. Reed","And then in terms of your other question on the mechanism, let me just say that have a brand-new commissioner. This is his first rate case that he's dealing with. And that the -- you haven't heard about attrition mechanisms or compensation generally because usually in every rate case, the utility-specific attrition mechanism's been adopted and the incentive comp, if it's found is be at market by the commission's own compensation study, is put in rate. I mean, that is really the requirement to allow the utility to recover reasonable costs. And if your compensation is reasonable, you should be able to get that. And if the attrition is based upon utility-specific industry, you should be able to get that. This is our -- a new commissioner with a first rate case decision that he is writing, and I give him credit. He's listening to some of the other commissioners. He had an all-party meeting where parties could make their thoughts known and I'm hoping that what we will see is changes in this based upon him listening to some of the experienced commissioners that have dealt with this issue historically.","Operator","We'll move to a question from Santiago Perez Teuffer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Santiago Perez Perez Teuffer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just wondered coming from you, there is a lot of expectation on how is the Mexican energy industry shaping out. I mean, your IPO is a clear example of the expectations the market has and the value that's rising on it. I wanted to ask if you could please share your expectations in Mexico going forward and any kind expectations you have in new bidding processes?","Debra L. Reed","I'm going to turn it to Mark.","Mark A. Snell","Santiago, we had a little bit of trouble hearing you, but we think, if your question was what is our expectations in Mexico and the growth going forward. Is that your question?","Santiago Perez Perez Teuffer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, exactly. I mean, do you have any kind expectations on new bidding processes?","Mark A. Snell","Yes, good. Look, we're really excited about what -- our opportunities in Mexico. The ones, the projects that we mentioned on the roadshow and the pipeline projects and also the wind project that we have, ESJ, both of those are slated to go here in the near term. Long-term prospects, obviously, the Mexican infrastructure needs and Mexico's desire to wean itself, at least for electrical production off of oil and on to natural gas, is going to allow for a lot of infrastructure development projects in central Mexico and throughout those regions. And so we're pretty excited about it. We've got the right vehicle in place to assist Mexico in making those infrastructure developments. And that's why we're so excited about this company and why we think its growth prospects are so good.","Santiago Perez Perez Teuffer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Do you have any time frames like when will new bids come up in your perspective? I mean, about probably the second phase of Los Ramones or any other project do you believe it's interesting?","Mark A. Snell","Well, we don't have any specific timing, but we -- recognizing that some of these -- the ultimate plants and things and chemical treatment facilities that are going to use the natural gas is being transported or their products that were being transported back to market. Obviously, as those the other phases of these projects all have to come in fairly swift order, otherwise they're kind of pipelines to nowhere. And all of that's happening and so I think -- I don't think any of this is super long term. I mean we're, probably in the next 5 years, we're going to see a lot of development in Mexico.","Operator","We'll take a question from Michael Goldenberg with Luminus Management.","Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management, LLC","I wanted to understand something that Paul Patterson, I think, asked about the growth rate there that I want to get a better understanding. So the guidance for 2013 changed a little based on some items. Does that mean we should be taking the same growth rate off of a new number? Or should we be adjusting the growth rate per future numbers, whatever we were extrapolating earlier?","Debra L. Reed","Well, I'm not going to say how to do the calculation but I will tell you is that what we've said with our growth rate, was what Joe showed in February. If you take the 2013 earnings and then you subtract from that the retroactive piece of the rate case, and then from that is where you would grow. And that we were looking at a 6% to 8% growth rate and we're looking at that same range.","Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management, LLC","So it doesn't change even though -- so even though the base number may have changed, the growth thing doesn't?","Debra L. Reed","The growth rate is still the same, yes.","Operator","We'll take a question from Vanessa Quiroga with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Vanessa Quiroga - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","It's actually regarding IEnova again and in the specifics about your leverage in that entity. Right now it's very low but we would assumed that with more growth, new projects, you would be willing to increase your leverage. But what is the maximum level that you would be comfortable with at the IEnova level?","Debra L. Reed","I'm going -- I would just say that this is exactly why we did this is, in response to your question, is so that we can lever up and that we can grow that business because we think it's a terrific business. And so I'll have Joe talk about how much leverage we could put on that business.","Joseph A. Householder","Yes, on the roadshow, what we talked about was the fact that we would issue some more debt likely next year as we use the IPO proceeds for the construction of the Sonora pipelines. And that when we got the AAA credit rating there, we talked to the rating agencies and they said they'd be comfortable with that credit rating as long we stayed below 3x debt to EBITDA. And what I spoke about was at the Sempra level, we have roughly a 50-50 debt-equity ratio and I need to manage that across the whole portfolio. So as we start to reach those levels, then we'll have to consider where we are. But no more than 3x debt to EBITDA or 50-50. But as they continue to grow their EBITDA, there's going to be a lot of capacity there.","Vanessa Quiroga - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, yes. I agree. I mean, this 3x debt to EBITDA, when you talk about the EBITDA, you don't mean pro forma for -- or assuming when the new projects start generating EBITDA already, right? You would be talking about the current year debt to EBITDA?","Joseph A. Householder","I think if you focused sort of the 50-50 debt-to-equity ratio and the -- hold on one second. I think at that rate, and we're probably looking at the current run rate of EBITDA. But as I said, it's growing fast because these projects are coming on quickly.","Operator","We'll take a question from Ashar Khan with Visium.","Ashar Khan","Debbie, if -- I don't want to go like too deep in it. So how should we follow the proceeding next week if they do adhere to the schedule and -- on the rate case and they do come out with a decision? Will they discuss this in their meeting? Or will we have to wait for a final order to find out whether they made the changes to what we like or didn't make the changes? Can you just tell us how we can monitor it on our end?","Debra L. Reed","Yes, the typical way this would go is that changes would be published before the meeting. And then the commission would vote on the decision with those changes at the meeting. So it's on the agenda for next week. What would typically happen is those changes would come out later this week or early next week. And then all of the commission officers would have the opportunity to review those changes and then the commissioners would then vote on it. If the commissioner had a concern about what was in there after those changes were made, the commissioner could hold it at that meeting and could make an election to write an alternate decision or go back the assigned commissioner to suggest further changes. So that's kind of how the process unfolds.","Ashar Khan","Okay, so that would show up. So that any changes would show up in the docket of the case, right? That's where I should be looking at?","Debra L. Reed","Yes, that's what should happen. And then, of course, we will provide as much information as we can once we get the final decisions out. It does take a while to analyze these decisions, and one of the reasons that we want to be sure when we give you new guidance is that we have the full time to analyze the decisions. Because just looking at the revenue requirement does not necessarily yield what the outcome is going to be. So it will take us a little while to analyze.","Ashar Khan","Okay. And the second question is, I don't it's a new company and all that and I know -- I apologize, there were too many earnings today. Is IEnova going to have an earnings call? Or can you give us any sense of what their earnings were exactly year-over-year?","Debra L. Reed","Yes, we're not going to do subsegment information in our call that -- the plan is in the future, IEnova will have its own earnings call, and we'll provide that information to its investors. And I don't know, Mark or Joe, do you want to add anything to that?","Mark A. Snell","I think that's right. We'll -- they're going to do their own. We will only comment on them to the extent that it affects Sempra and we'll give you that data on our call.","Joseph A. Householder","Yes. I'll just add, the one thing to remember is in Mexico, they're reported under IFRS so the numbers are going to be slightly different. And we don't give, as Debbie said, we don't give subsegment information. So we give you guidance at the Sempra International level, but I think you all could listen in to their calls and, I think, starting next quarter probably is when they'll get set up to start doing it.","Debra L. Reed","And I just was reminded that their release is on our website, too. So you can go to our website and can see their release. But I do believe next quarter, they're going to start the call.","Ashar Khan","Okay, so they do have their own release, which is on your website?","Mark A. Snell","Right.","Debra L. Reed","Yes.","Operator","We'll now hear from Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","One just follow-up question. I'm sure you heard the commentary from Edison the other day on San Onofre. Could you just -- any color to add there? And just in the event that the plant does need to be shut down, what are your recourse actions to take?","Debra L. Reed","The thing I would say is that, that I read the Edison transcript and what they say about kind of their decision point. We are not -- we're a minority owner. We own 20% of the plant. We've never operated the plant. We didn't decide on what kind of steam generators went in. We didn't do any of that. And so we have to kind of look at our own position in this case, and that we are waiting for the NRC to act and we're going to see what they do. And that we're hopeful that we will get something out by early summer from the NRC. And then we're going to make our decisions on our options based upon what's best for our customers. And that's what we'll be looking at. And we may not be on the same time line as Edison is precisely. But we will look at our options as what's best for our customers as a minority owner of that plant. And I can't really add anything. Edison went through, on their call, of the details about the 2 applications, the license amendment and the confirmatory action letter, and they're better to handle those kinds of questions because they're the ones that are dealing with the agencies and operating the facility.","Operator","Our final question will come from Vedula Murti with CDP Capital.","Vedula Murti","A couple of things. One, in your earlier remarks in answer to questions when the question of incremental renewable came up, I think you indicated you were focusing -- you'd be focusing in wind arena. And I think that was all based on production tax credit. What's -- do you have a point of view as to, one, some prospects for the renewable and multi-legislation that's pending? And based on your analysis, I'm wondering whether, if that were to occur, whether that's basically something for things prospectively or given stimulation [ph] of tax credits having been utilized in whatever in the past that historic existing assets would be unlikely to fit into such structure. And I have a separate question after that.","Debra L. Reed","Okay. Well, let me just say that the focus of my answer on wind was specific to that extension in the legislation, but we are developing solar projects. And we have a 250-megawatt project that's going into construction. We have a project that we're working on to be in the queue on the solar side. So I don't want to give any impression that our focus is just on wind, because we are very actively pursuing other projects. But we love your question about the MLP. And actually when I have my meeting with the President earlier this year, that was one of the things we talked about would be very beneficial to the industry is to have some type of a REIT or MLP structure for renewables. But Mark was just involved in this about a week ago. So let me turn it to Mark.","Mark A. Snell","Yes, look, I think we are kind of excited about the prospect for renewables to be put in the MLPs and be given parity with other energy projects in the country. So we think it's a good development. I will tell you it's one of the very few things that has -- seems to have relatively broad bipartisan support. I think the thing that's holding it up from being approved is that it's a -- well, it has sort of bipartisan support. It's not really big deal to the people on the hill. And so at the end, it will probably be attached to some other larger tax bill or something that goes through.  There is -- we have questions about how it's going to work for existing projects and I don't think that's been fully fleshed out. There has to be some other -- besides just making MLP-able because the MLPs have these tax credits, how that will do or if that will be a replacement for the tax credit. Nobody really knows how those things will come to be, but we do think it's exciting. We think it's something that makes a lot of sense, and we'd be well-positioned to put some of our assets and add it to our midstream MLP or create a separate one on its own, whichever kind of investors sort of look to want to do. So we think both of those things they are -- we thing they're exciting and it is something that does look like it has good support right now.","Vedula Murti","Okay. And secondarily, Debbie, you mentioned your meeting with the President. I was going to ask you, based on all your commentary around your positive view from the news, head of DOE and terms of nat gas exports and all the various export facilities, did that come up in your conversation? And do you feel like that that's the view -- that view there is similar as to the view at DOE?","Debra L. Reed","Yes, I mean, I was asked specifically not to share what occurred in the meetings. But I would say that the attendees of the meeting, universally, were quite favorable to the ability to export gas if there were appropriate provisions put in place to deal with all -- environmental issues associated with the frac-ing. And so, I think that's the direction it's heading. I didn't sense anything at all that would run counter to that direction in the discussions I had.","Vedula Murti","Yes. The one last thing, in terms of the approve [ph] status of free trade versus non-free-trade export, my recollection was that earlier this year, there was talk about trying to perhaps give an exemption or something like that to Japan and maybe western Europe since they're kind of allies or whatever. Is there anything going on, on that side at all?","Debra L. Reed","It seems like that has kind of died down a bit. And I think where the focus is now, I mean, we really do hear a number of things that at least -- and you never get definitive answers of when something is going to be approved. But we have heard a number of comments that would lead us to believe that the approvals are forthcoming and the approvals are forthcoming sometime in the near future. And that is not going to be that type of a structure with limited approval. So and you start hearing more, too, I think with the situation in North Korea, that you start hearing more, the concerns about what do we do to help support, generally, our allies? What do we do to have the U.S. be a contributor into the energy marketplace that would help deal with some of these political issues. And so it seems the -- at least the dialogue has gone more in that direction recently, which would say you're probably not going to just get a Japanese exemption or a Europe exemption.","Operator","I was just going to turn it back over to Ms. Debbie Reed for closing remarks.","Debra L. Reed","Okay. I was going just take it. So, thank you, all, very much for joining us. As always, we have Rick and Victor and Diane there to answer any of your follow-up questions from the call. And we look forward to seeing you in New York on May 23."],"18982":["Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) Q2 2017 Earnings Call August  4, 2017 12:00 PM ET","Executives","Richard A.

Please note that today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead, sir.","Richard A. Vaccari - Sempra Energy","Good morning, and welcome to Sempra Energy's second quarter 2017 financial presentation. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section. With me in San Diego are several members of our management team: Debbie Reed, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Martin, Chief Financial Officer; Steve Davis, Corporate Group President of Utilities; Joe Householder, Corporate Group President of Infrastructure; Dennis Arriola, Executive Vice President; Martha Wyrsch, General Counsel; and Trevor Mihalik, Chief Accounting Officer.","Before starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q.","It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our second quarter 2017 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP. I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, August 4, 2017, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.","With that, please turn to slide 4. Let me hand the call over to Debbie.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thanks, Rick. This morning, we reported second quarter EPS of $1.03 or $1.10 on an adjusted basis. With these great year-to-date results, we are increasing our 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5 to $5.30. The increase in our guidance is a direct result of our strong year-to-date earnings which Jeff will review with you later, combined with our expectations for continued strong financial performance for the remainder of the year. Our businesses are performing well, and we've had some great success in securing growth projects for our future.","Some highlights that I will detail later are since our analyst conference, we've made significant progress on our strategic investments, adding over $1 billion in new projects with approximately $500 million coming from projects we filed for at our California utilities. In addition, we received two positive regulatory outcomes that improved the clarity of our expected financial returns and allow us to increase the amount of gas stored at Aliso Canyon by reinstating injections. We expect positive developments across our businesses to completely offset the 2018 impact of a further Cameron delay, which I will discuss in a moment. Based on these developments, we are affirming our 2018 EPS guidance of $5.30 to $5.80. We expect to give updated 2018 segment guidance and 2019 guidance early next year.","Now please turn to the next slide where I will discuss the update to the Cameron schedule. Cameron and the joint venture partners continue to monitor Cameron's construction progress. Our observations are that certain aspects of the work may be ahead of schedule, but many others are behind the schedule we received last October. As a result, Cameron has continued to question the contractor, and recently, the contractor notified us that its Cameron's schedule has changed.","Based on several factors, we think it is reasonable to expect that Train 1 could be delayed into 2019, with Trains 2 and 3 following throughout 2019. These factors include an updated schedule from the contractor, Cameron's own review of the schedule, and the inherent risks in constructing and testing these types of facilities. The contractor and JV partners are assessing reasons for the schedule change and working through the issues. All parties are focused on bringing the three trains into service as soon as practical.","Let me be clear. We are disappointed in the most recent change and the impact on our near-term earnings and cash flow. We have revised our 2018 financial plan to assume no earnings from Cameron in 2018. But as I mentioned, the expected strength of our other businesses allows us to affirm our 2018 guidance range of $5.30 to $5.80 per share. We also continue to expect our earnings from Cameron in 2020 to be in the $300 million to $350 million range. In the long term, we don't foresee any material impact to Cameron's economics. When we developed the project, we built in risk mitigation provisions in our contract such as the lump sum turnkey EPC contract with schedule and cost overrun protection.","I will end this slide on an additional point many of you have asked us about. During large construction projects like Cameron, contractors often assert that they are owed additional compensation, schedule extension, or both. While Cameron has received information from the contractor claiming they are owed amounts beyond the contract value, sufficient details have not been provided to enable an evaluation of the validity or the amount. The contractors informed us that they will supplement the information at a future day. I will reiterate: we expect the protections we put in place to keep Cameron's long-term economics materially the same. We think it is important to share with you the progress that has been made on this project site.","Please go to the next slide. This slide shows a photo of the Cameron site as of mid-July. As you can see, a lot of work is getting done. That said, we will continue to monitor the progress against the schedule to help ensure that safety and long-term reliability of the project is not being compromised.","Now, turn to the next slide. We have listed some of the most important and relevant accomplishments to date, which give a sense of how far construction has progressed. I'll mention a few. 100% of the engineering work has been completed, nearly 100% of the procurement is completed, and all three heat exchangers have been laid on their foundation. Finally, this project has our full attention, and I want to emphasize how important it is to us. I also know that it's important to all of you.","With that, I'll hand it off to Jeff who will walk you through our quarterly results. Jeff?","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","Thanks, Debbie. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $259 million or $1.03 per share. This compares favorably to second quarter 2016 earnings of $16 million or $0.06 per share. And on an adjusted basis, we reported earnings of $276 million or $1.10 per share. This also compares favorably to second quarter adjusted earnings in 2016 of $200 million or $0.79 per share.","Next, let's turn to slide 9 to discuss the key factors impacting these results. Our higher quarter-over-quarter adjusted earnings were driven by healthy operating results that include: $23 million due to higher earnings from LNG marketing activities in 2017 and losses in the second quarter of 2016 that were related to gas price movement on inventories sold forward, $21 million of higher operational earnings, primarily from acquisitions and pipelines placed into service in Mexico, $16 million from higher CPUC base margin, net of operating expenses at SDG&E, and finally, $11 million from higher earnings due to U.S. renewable assets that were placed into service in 2016, as well as increased production across the portfolio this year.","The strong operational results that I discussed for Mexico were more than offset by $12 million of losses in the current quarter related to foreign currency and inflation effects. This compares to a $16 million benefit last year. I'd also like to emphasize that assuming current rates, $30 million of additional hedge income is expected to be booked in the second half of the year and largely offset the year-to-date FX losses at Mexico.","And with that, I'll hand it back to Debbie, who will go over our business updates.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thanks, Jeff. As I mentioned earlier, we've added over $1 billion of new investments. I'll describe several that we've added since our last quarterly call.","Let me start with Mexico. Hopefully, you had a chance to listen to IEnova's Analyst Day in June where the team identified $45 billion of potential market opportunities through 2025. Of this $45 billion, approximately $10 billion are in the newly opened liquids infrastructure business. I discussed at our Analyst Day that I thought this was an excellent growth area for us. IEnova has started to expand its strategic footprint into this area and had some positive recent developments. Specifically, IEnova will develop three liquids terminals, two of which will be in the high consumption areas of Mexico City and Puebla, and the third in the Port of Veracruz.","The facilities all have long-term firm U.S. dollar denominated capacity agreements with Valero. In addition, the expected total CapEx for the projects is $275 million and all are planned to go into service through 2019. Valero has the option to purchase 50% equity ownership in all of the facilities when they go into service. We hope to continue to build our strategic partnership with Valero as projects like these fit IEnova and Sempra's core competency. Most importantly, these projects will lay a solid foundation for us to expand this new business line into additional inland and marine terminal opportunities as well as liquids transportation investments. Just as we did with our natural gas pipeline, we see the opportunities for solid returns and great growth by being an early mover in this market.","Moving to Chile, we were awarded transmission project through our joint venture for approximately $50 million. The project is expected to go into service in 2021 and continues to build on our growing transmission business in Chile. Finally, we are constructing a new 200-megawatt solar project in California. This facility is fully contracted for an average of 18 years and is expected to go into service in phases through the first half of 2018.","Please turn to the next slide. Starting with the cost of capital, we were pleased that the all party settlement was upheld extending, the certainty of our ROEs through 2019. This decision provides greater clarity of our planned earnings at our California utilities. Also at SoCalGas, we received approval to reinstate natural gas injections at the Aliso Canyon storage field to a target level of approximately 24 Bcf, and have started to do so.","While the recent approval to resume gas injections is positive news, we remain concerned about system reliability this summer and in the coming winter given, the length of time it took to receive this decision, as well as the limitations on targeted gas storage levels. We are working cooperatively with the agencies to help ensure we safely operate the Aliso Canyon storage field within the authority we have been granted. Finally, as we discussed last quarter, we have filed applications at the CPUC for two projects, representing an incremental $500 million of rate based investments, comprised of the Master-Metered Mobilehome Park and a new customer information system at SDG&E.","Before I turn to our guidance, I'll highlight that adding and filing for over $1 billion of new development projects across our utility and infrastructure businesses is a testament to our strong growth platforms and our ability to capture opportunities. We continue to make significant progress on the projects and our plans, while also evaluating and advancing projects like those we've added since the analyst conference.","Please turn to the next slide. As I mentioned earlier, for the second time this year, we are raising our 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5 to $5.30. On a GAAP basis, our increased 2017 EPS guidance range is $4.95 to $5.25. The key contributors driving this increase are strong year-to-date earnings, accelerated capital deployment and disciplined cost management across our businesses. We expect these key operational drivers to continue into 2018 and to completely offset the delay in Cameron. This has enabled us to affirm our 2018 EPS guidance of $5.30 to $5.80.","Please turn to the last slide. To recap, we've accomplished a great deal over the last several months. First, we are making significant progress on our strategic investments with over $1 billion added since our analyst conference. Second, we received positive regulatory outcomes at the California utilities on two important matters: the cost of capital extension; and reinstating injection at Aliso Canyon. And third, we raised 2017 adjusted EPS guidance and affirmed 2018 EPS guidance on a strong expected operational performance.","With that, we'll conclude our prepared comments and stop to take any questions that you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go first to Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI. Your line is open, sir. Please go ahead.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks and congratulations on a great quarter.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thanks, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Several questions. Listen, I heard your script and I understand your reticence to get too granular on guidance in the context of the change in the Cameron service date being offset by improvements elsewhere. But can you talk to, at a high level, how much of that improvement in 2018 that's offsetting the Cameron delay is coming from new projects versus just better expected returns in either the utilities businesses or the existing infrastructure businesses.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Sure. Let me kind of walk you through because I think it is important for you to understand that. Because the key thing is that these are improvements that we believe are sustainable going forward. And we've really been working throughout 2017 to put these kinds of things in place and then to build upon them in 2018 and 2019. So, let me hit the highlights of the key areas. First, last year, we got about $1.4 billion of incremental capital approved in our utilities that was outside of a rate case capital. And so these are incremental projects. And we've been really focused on how we can expedite getting those projects in service, beginning the collection of AFUDC and then putting into service in the rate base. And then we filed for another $500 million worth of projects that I mentioned in my talking points.","So, the utility performance has been very strong and it's really based upon the deployment of additional capital largely. And then we are building on another 200-megawatt solar project in California. And that will go into service throughout 2018. And so we will have that on an ongoing basis producing earnings. In Mexico, we've had a lot of new projects that we've announced. We have a solar project with the Pima Solar. Now we have these liquids terminals that we'll be constructing throughout 2018 into 2019. And then we've just had really strong performance from all of our businesses in terms of being very efficient in the operations, which is something we believe can continue. So everything we're looking at in 2018 is, in my mind, totally focused on better performance and performance that we can continue beyond 2018.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Fantastic. Thank you. My second question goes to what's happening at Cameron. And you gave a very detailed explanation, so thank you. But given the track record CB&I has had with other projects with delays, how can you be confident that this is the sort of final straw and there aren't going to be further delays? And have you sort of built in some thinking around that in the new schedule you've given us, or is the new schedule you've given us sort of completely in sync with like specifically what they have told you is their current expectation?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","What they told us is only one piece of the thinking. And trust me, we've done a lot of thinking on this. And then we brought in consultants from the outside who have been working with us to look at all of the scheduled documents, look at the onsite work that have been done, and then give us their independent assessment of the schedule and when we think that the trains can come into service. So what we're giving you today is our best estimate based upon all of the work that's been done by the 70-plus people we have on site as part of the JV, the outside firms that we've been using to validate the information, and then looking at what we've gotten from our contractor, and then just looking at how things can affect projects. And so it's our best estimate based upon all of those factors, not just what the contractor has given us.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. And you commented on the fact that CB&I or this joint venture with \u2013 CB&I has with Chiyoda, has indicated that they'd like to be paid more money. It's not clear to you at this point that their claims are valid. Is there any way for you at this point to sort of quantify the types of dollars we're talking about? And if you can or you can't, that being said, how is the contract structured so that you are protected if you have to deploy more capital?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. I'm going to have Joe go through this because he has been on the ground working on these issues. So, Joe?","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Yeah. Thanks, Debbie. Hi, Greg. So let me talk about that. I've spoken about this before. The thing that we looked at when we entered into this project was a very risk-mitigated approach. And so we did, with our partners at Cameron JV, sign a lump sum turnkey agreement, and we expect to hold the contractor joint venture to that agreement. And like most construction projects, people will come along with claims and ask for different things, and that's the normal course.","I'm not going to go into the specifics of the dollars because we do not have enough information to even review it, audit it, or anything else. And so I don't want to talk about dollars. And one of the reasons is very important for you all to remember. This is really not a Sempra issue. We are protected throughout the agreements that we've signed on this issue, primarily through the EPC lump-sum turnkey agreement, and we expect them to perform under that contract. But also through our other contracts, we're protected. Our economics are going to be protected. Of course, as Debbie said, we're disappointed in the earnings movement. But we're confident about getting the value out of this project. And I think that's what we should focus on when you're talking to us about Sempra's impact from these kinds of cost issues. Does that help?","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","That's the best you're going to tell me, then that helps. Thanks, guys. Take care.","Operator","All right. And we'll take our next question from Faisel Khan from Citibank. Please go ahead.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Hi, Faisel.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, Debbie. Did you guys issue any change orders to the contractor at all?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","No, we didn't issue change orders to the contractor.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Let me just \u2013 let me just \u2013 throughout the course of the contract, there's been one change order for $12 million. That's it.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","That's it.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Okay, understood. That's the only question on Cameron. And then just on the sort of CCA issue that sort of seems to be ongoing in the news, do you guys have any update on what's going on in your territory with some of these aggregation sort of topics?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah, that's a great question because from the Sempra standpoint, we really support the customers having choice and we like the ability of customers having the choice to go to a CCA because we basically earn our money based upon them using our transmission and distribution systems. And so if they want go to another party for procurement, that's great. The problem that we have in California is ensuring that when those customers exit, they take all of the costs with them.","So, I'm going to have Steve talk about the work that we're doing at the Commission now to have them meet the state law in California, which requires customers exiting to take all of their costs.","Steven D. Davis - Sempra Energy","Thanks, Debbie. Hi, Faisel. As Debbie mentioned, our focus really is on ensuring that the Commission complies with current law, which requires departing load to take their fair share of costs. And the three IOUs have put forward a solution to that at the Commission that we're hopeful will be voted on by the end of this year. So to the extent that when there is departing load and they take their costs, that's fine and we just need to make sure that going forward, the Commission complies with that law and we have a solution to do that. I would like to just say, though, keep in mind that in California, our rates are decoupled and our generation rate base investment is less than 10%. So, we're not long on generation obviously.","In San Diego, we don't have any CCA providers. We do have some cities that are looking at it. And one of the key issues in variables as they look at this issue is what the Commission is doing in compliance with state law on the departing load charges. So that's a key issue in variable which is causing the cities to take a second look at things.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, got it. And actually I misspoke. There's one more question on Cameron just on \u2013 follow up to Greg's question on the schedule. Does that include any sort of disruptions from weather at all in the hurricane season?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. I'll let Joe come in, too.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Thanks, Debbie. Hey, Faisel. So let me tell you why I have confidence in what we're projecting for you. We have \u2013 and Debbie said, 70 people. We actually now \u2013 we keep increasing. We have about 120 people on the site, and the engineering capacity is looking at what's going on in the site. So we know what's going on in the site. We also have multiple external consultants there reviewing the work and the process. In reviewing the forecast forward, what do we see going forward? And as the work continues to progress, as you see in the photograph, there's lots of work to finish so that would naturally cause you to be a little bit more confident in it, yet we do have to take into account things like weather, so as our consultants and we look at it, we take into account the normal course of events in the Gulf Coast. What I would say is not in there is unexpected events. If there was a major disruption from a major hurricane in 2017 or 2018, that would probably cause some change, but it's hard to say because it depends where the hurricane hits, how much time is away. You know that recent storm, Cindy, that they had, they were away from the site like a day-and-a-half. So it kind of depends on the severity of it, but we do, in our own analysis, build in the normal kind of weather issues that confront contractors in the Gulf of Mexico.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, great. Fair enough. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it.","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","Thanks, Faisel.","Operator","And we'll go next to Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good morning, or afternoon. I guess, first, a couple of questions on Cameron. So the third point you made in terms of the delay that kind of you included the inherent risk in constructing and testing. So that is it fair to say, there's some cushion that you've kind of put into this update? I mean, we'll hear from CB&I I guess on Monday when they report. So, there could be some maybe difference potentially in the timelines there?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","We just used all the data that we had available and really looked at the work being done by our outside consultants against what the contractor had given us and gave our best estimate of when we think the trains will come on in 2019. So I mean, we looked at all the factors we had before us and it's our best estimate for that.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then also, any color that you could give on how the relationships are with the partners going through this process and the like? Any color there?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Well, since Joe meets with them about every week, I'll have Joe talk about that.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Thanks, Debbie. Hi, Steve. We have a good relationship with our partners. I mean, remember, our partners are also our customers. And we had a pretty lengthy call with them yesterday. I met with them a couple of weeks ago in Houston. I'm in Houston quite a bit. As we got these schedules, I was poring through the schedules with them and with our engineering teams. I think it's a very constructive relationship, and they have two roles to play there. They're both our partners on the equity side and they are our customers. And so we are working closely together. We're all aligned even with the contractor consortium to try to get this done as soon as possible. But obviously, people have different views on things, but I think we have a good relationship with them.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then last question just on the offsets, specifically on the utility side, I guess, Debbie, you mentioned like $1.4 billion of capital approved outside the rate case. Could you just give a little better sense of are these other projects getting recovered through other mechanisms outside GRC, or it's kind of AFUDC type benefits they are \u2013 yeah.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. Most of the projects that are in the $1.4 billion are FERC projects. So you get AFUDC on the projects during construction and then as they are completed, they immediately go into rate base because we use like actual rate base for FERC. So you don't have to go back to the CPUC and try to recover the rate base amount after, it just trues up on the actual rate base based upon what actual rate bases that you are in and so the majority of these are at SDG&E and the majority of them are FERC related. And then on some of the other areas, there are regulatory mechanisms that are put in place outside of the rate case to recover costs that are CPUC related. So we don't have to wait for a rate case.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Chris Turnure from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. I wanted to talk about new LNG in Port Arthur in particular or you had an announcement during the quarter there that you had I think signed a preliminary agreement with Korea. Could you just maybe put that in context and specifically talk about the MOU that you had at Port Arthur already, how this would work and maybe how if at all this is differentiated from some of the other companies that made announcements at the same time in regards to agreements with Korea?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. We had an agreement with KOGAS and we made an announcement about having a memorandum of understanding with them to hopefully come to some conclusion for them to become a buyer and potentially a foundation buyer which would allow them to take some equity in the Port Arthur facility. And I think part of the differentiators that we found in the market is that there are some buyers who like to take some equity in the projects as well and as KOGAS has expressed an interest in that, we're hoping to get one to three foundation buyers that would take equity positions, and then sell the rest of the gas that's produced to other.","So, it was really great to have the biggest \u2013 I guess, the second largest LNG buyer in the world want to be in our project and want to have equity in our project. And so, we're in the process of marketing now. We'll also be continuing our discussions with KOGAS to finalize agreements. But we thought it was really positive news.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And then, shifting gears back to Cameron. I know we've had a couple of questions on the topic already, of course, but you used the language that kind of indicated the project could spill into \u2013 start in 2019. So I think one of the earlier questions spoke to a range of potential outcomes. What's the base case start-up for each train right now? And is your assessment here something that was kind of pushed to you by CB&I, and then you felt like you had to kind of give us this information, or conversely do you feel like you were kind of getting out ahead of what they're saying and this is a relatively I guess conservative view on what could happen?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. Let me just kind of talk about what's happened and how we got to this point because I think it's important for you to understand the level of monitoring and meetings and questions and everything that we have with a contractor.","Once they gave us a detailed schedule back in October, then we've hired outside firms to work with us, and then we have all these people on site to monitor performance against the schedule. And what we started to see is certain things on that schedule being done sooner than the schedule indicated, and other things being done on a schedule later than was indicated.","And what we wanted to understand is really kind of what the critical path was on the project and what does that mean to the end day on the project, because when you have a combination of things getting done faster and things getting done later, it's really hard to determine what the overall impact was.","So we brought in outside consultants. We spent time with the contractor that \u2013 they gave us some dates that they felt that they could meet. We had our consultants, and I'll review all of that type of information, and we came to some of our own conclusions.","And our conclusions are that, from our standpoint, we feel that we don't want to have any earnings in our financial plans for 2018 for Cameron. We don't want to assume that risk, and we want to give you guidance without any earnings from Cameron.","If something wonderful happens and it comes in early, that's great. But from our standpoint, from the information that we have, we just felt it was best to take all of the earnings out for Cameron in 2018, and then focus on what we could do as a management team to get to our guidance without having any of Cameron. And we have some great opportunities to offset Cameron. And we just thought it was the right thing to do and that's the way we approached it.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's very helpful context and color there. You mentioned that CB&I came to you with an updated version of the schedule when that was one piece of the equation in your overall analysis here. If they had not done that, I guess I would ask, would you have kind of come to the same conclusion? Would you have given us this updated schedule as it exists right now?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","We would have...","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And the work that you had done preceding that.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. I mean, we would have used all the information available to do our assessment of what's the right thing for our company and our guidance that we gave you. And that's exactly what we did in this case.","And then the schedule that we have from CB&I doesn't have a lot of details and everything on it. So we still have to work through that. But we have to tell you what we believe based upon all the data that we have, and we would have done that whether or not we had a schedule.","Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Got you. Thanks, Debbie.","Operator","All right. We'll take our next question from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey guys. A couple of different ones. First of all, SoCalGas in the second half of 2017, is there anything unusual when we should think about the earnings bridge from the second half of 2016 and the second half of 2017 at either SoCalGas or SDG&E?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","No, not really from year-to-year at the two utilities. I mean, I think the big thing that happened at both utilities is we got our attrition allowance year-over-year. And then to the degree we manage costs within that attrition allowance, that gives us some upside.","But year-over-year, the companies have done pretty well, when you look at quarter-to-quarter. If you look at on an annualized basis, as you know, there's seasonality at SoCalGas, but there was seasonality at SoCalGas last year as well.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. And one thing, can you talk a little bit about you've got the new renewables -","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","One thing, Michael. I just want to remind you, and we had this and all the data last year and I was assuming you weren't talking about things like this, but we did have an impairment last year at SoCalGas within our South pipeline that we reported in the quarter last year. But that was in the information that we had disclosed (37:47). But there was nothing else between the two companies that was really different year-to-year.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And on Sempra Renewables, how are you looking at over the next couple of years, the potential to add to that backlog or add to that pipeline of potential solar plants? And can you remind us, what's the amount of \u2013 I don't know the right term for it, but literally the land or the sites that you currently control, what's kind of the amount of megawatts you could add over a very long period of time, if you were able to get the contracts?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. I mean, there's several hundred megawatts capability at each of those locations. I think you're talking about our two solar locations. And there are several hundred megawatts of capability there. We're focused on developing those and we have been bidding those into RFPs, and then looking at other ways that we might be able to add value on those sites with maybe adding some batteries and being able to do peak-shaving.","So we have our existing sites that are expandable and then we're also developing new sites. And a lot of our new sites are really developed in the Midwest area with customers we've already done business with and adding wind, which is very economical in a lot of those locations. And we have a lot of customers that we've already done business with that are interested in either expanding an existing site or adding a new site. So we're doing a lot of work in that area. And then as I mentioned, we have contracts now to build a 200-megawatt solar project in California as well that we just talked about.","So I mean it's a business that we think has growth potential. There's a lot of states that are very interested with renewable portfolio standards and with the economics being there for wind and solar now. But it's one of our growth areas but I wouldn't say that we have changed significantly our capital plans in that area from what we showed you at the Analyst conference.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks Debbie. Much appreciated.","Operator","All right. And we will take our last question from Leslie Rich from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.","Hi. Just following up on that question. The 200-megawatt solar contract that you just announced, that was not at your existing facilities. This is a new project altogether to do \u2013 because it's coming online so soon, is it something that was already in development when you bought it?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yes. It was a project that was in early-stage development. We bought the project and are building it out.","Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.","And do you have a contract with I guess one of the IOUs in California?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","We have average 18 year contracts with a number of parties, some municipalities, a variety of parties where they offtake.","Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.","And in terms of the cost, you talked about having over $1 billion of new capital since the Analyst Day. But adding it all up, unless you got this solar project virtually for free, it must be more than $1 billion. So just wondering if you could give any indication of the CapEx associated with that?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","No. We don't give the CapEx associated with individuals but it is over $1 billion. If you add everything up, it's over $1 billion, so.","Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.","Okay. And then, just on Cameron. I'm a little confused about the contract terms. You said today that it was a fixed price turnkey contract. And in the past, I thought you had said that to the extent that there were incremental costs associated with building Cameron, that the cost to build would go up, but that your ROE would stay the same. And the way that would happen would be that the higher cost to build would be essentially passed through to customers. So, where am I wrong?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","You're not wrong. That's the way that contract is written.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","That is what I tried to say.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah.","Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.","So...","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","I said it's not a Sempra issue, Leslie, we're protected. We have the contract protections with the contractor, that's the primary. But we also have other protections in our other contracts that keep us whole on a return basis and you have exactly right.","Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.","And so, how are you thinking about Train 4 at this point? Has your thinking shifted on that?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","I would say our focus is on Train 1 through 3 right now and getting those done. So we have been having meetings with the partners to look at development of further trains on the site. And Joe just was at a meeting a few weeks ago. I think we're making some progress but I don't expect anything to be resolved before the end of the year.","Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn it back over to Debbie Reed for closing remarks.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Well, thank you all for joining us today. And if you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to contact the IR team. Have a great day. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you so much for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"19267":["Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) Q1 2016 Earnings Call May  4, 2016  1:00 PM ET","Executives","Richard A. Vaccari - Sempra Energy","Debra L.

Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead, sir.","Richard A. Vaccari - Sempra Energy","Good morning and welcome to Sempra Energy's first quarter 2016 financial presentation. The live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section.","With me in San Diego are several members of our management team: Debbie Reed, Chairman and CEO; Mark Snell, President; Joe Householder, Chief Financial Officer; Martha Wyrsch, General Counsel; Trevor Mihalik, Chief Accounting Officer; Dennis Arriola, Chief Executive Officer of SoCalGas; and Jeff Martin, Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric.","Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q.","It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and that we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our first quarter 2016 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures.","I'd also like to note that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, May 4, 2016, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.","With that, please turn to slide 4 and let me hand the call over to Debbie.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thanks, Rick. On today's call, we are following a slightly different format. As you know, the final GRC decision for our California Utilities has not been issued. However, we expect to receive a proposed decision relatively soon. Because we have reached a multiparty settlement agreement, we continue to believe the most likely GRC outcome is one consistent with the settlement. We also believe we have made a strong showing to support our historical treatment of tax repair allowance benefits.","Therefore, today, we are updating our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance and providing you with our long-term growth rate, assuming a GRC outcome consistent with the settlement. We think the best approach is to postpone our Analyst Conference until we have a final GRC decision. We are tentatively looking at the month of July in New York City as a possible date for the conference. Once we received a PD, we will confirm the date and location.","In our other businesses, we recently announced the sale of Southeast utilities and our interest in REX. We expect to receive about $760 million of cash proceeds to invest in projects that align better with our growth strategy. As you know, our strategy is to provide growth that is roughly twice that of the utility average but with a commensurate risk profile. I will discuss these transactions later on the call.","Our updated 2016 adjusted guidance range is now $4.60 per share to $5 per share. This range reflects approximately $60 million of reduced earnings from REX. The sale of our Southeast utilities does not affect current or future earnings. These earnings reduced from the sale can largely be offset by lower interest costs.","Looking forward, we are well positioned for strong growth over the next five years. We expect our base plan to provide earnings in 2020 at $7.20 per share to $7.80 per share. The resulting adjusted compound annual growth rate for 2016 to 2020 is about 12%.","Prior to the sale of REX, the comparable growth rate would have been about 11%. Joe will address the growth rate further in his remarks, but I want to emphasize that we expect to have significant credit capacity in the latter years of our plan which will provide us with flexibility in capital allocation. We will discuss our plan assumptions, business unit projections and growth strategy in more depth once we reschedule the Analyst Conference.","Turning to our financial results, we reported first quarter adjusted earnings of $370 million. As a reminder, until we receive a final GRC, we are recording revenues based upon 2015 authorized amount. Once we receive the final decision, we will report the impact of the 2016 authorized margins back to January 1. If the GRC had been finalized by January 1 and was consistent with the settlement agreement, utility first quarter earnings would have been in line with last year despite the fact that approximately $60 million of annual tax repair benefits will now flow to customers under the new GRC.","Now, please turn to slide 5. There are several updates related to Aliso Canyon. First, SoCalGas is cooperating with DOGGR and the CPUC on the root cause investigation through their contractor, Blade Energy Partners. We expect the investigation to take about six months to nine months with the results be issued by the agencies late this year or early next year.","Second, we are working to get the field back in service for injection. Consistent with DOGGR's proposed safety review, we have implemented a plan to prioritize and test wells, with the goal to have the facility in service by the end of this summer.","Third, we are working with state and local agencies to address electric reliability concerns. Aliso Canyon currently has about 15 Bcf of gas available for withdrawal. When deciding how best to use that gas, reliability for both the summer and winter seasons must be considered.","Fourth, we are completing our estimate of the total amount of gas lost from the leak and formulating a plan to mitigate that amount. Fifth, the temporary relocation program has been extended to allow the county to complete in-home testing, with results expected this month. SoCalGas and public agencies have conducted numerous tests of outdoor air quality. Results continue to confirm that air quality in Porter Ranch is at normal level. Finally, we are addressing the litigation that has been filed related to the leak.","With regards to costs, we have incurred additional amounts, primarily from continuation of the temporary relocation program, as ordered by the court. The court has scheduled a follow-up hearing on June 7. Based on an expectation that the relocation program continues through June 7, we estimate the costs for amounts paid and forecast to be paid at approximately $665 million. We have recorded an insurance receivable of $660 million. Our cost estimate does not include certain potential items as described on the slide. Please refer to our 2015 10-K and first quarter 2016 10-Q for more detail on costs and our insurance.","Now, let's turn to slide 6 for an update on our other businesses. Sempra constantly looks at our assets to determine whether they fit with our long-term contracted infrastructure model and whether they integrate with other assets to offer strong long-term growth prospects. We identified three assets that are no longer a strategic fit for us: REX, our Southeast utilities and the TdM power plant in Mexico. For the first two, we have announced sales agreements, and for TdM, we are conducting a sales process. For REX, we expect the sale of our equity interest to close in the second quarter and to provide $440 million in proceeds. The sale also allows us to forego expected future contributions for capital investment and debt repayments. We believe our capital can be better utilized to further enhance our strong growth outlook.","As a result of the sale, we forecast a reduction for partial year 2016 earnings of approximately $60 million, which is included in our adjusted EPS range of $4.60 per share to $5 per share. It is important to note that had we held our interest in REX, we expected 2020 earnings to be immaterial and dilute our growth, largely due to loss of earnings from west-to-east contracts that expire in 2019.","In addition, we plan to permanently release uncontracted capacity held by Sempra. The negative earnings impact of this capacity release is projected to be between $100 million and $120 million and will be recorded in the second quarter. This amount reflects the acceleration of estimated losses that would have otherwise been realized over the remaining contract term. It is excluded from our 2016 adjusted earnings guidance.","Moving to our Southeast utilities, we finalized the sales agreement last week and expect to receive $323 million in cash proceeds with the buyer to assume $67 million of debt. We did not see significant additional growth potential in our Southeast utility footprint and the earnings impact is projected to offset with reduced interest costs. Similar to REX, we expect to use the proceeds to invest in projects with strong growth prospects. Finally, TdM is the third asset that no longer fits with our long-term contracted infrastructure strategy. It is currently held for sale, and we are in the midst of a sales process.","Now, please turn to slide 7. IEnova is building upon its position as the largest private energy company in Mexico to identify and originate new investment opportunities. IEnova is working on multiple development initiatives, including M&A, asset optimization, strategic partnerships with established companies and new companies seeking to enter the Mexican market, and emerging the opportunities in clean energy, storage, and liquids infrastructure.","One example of asset optimization is the building of laterals of our gas pipeline network to interconnect with end users. Just this week, CFE awarded IEnova a contract to build a small lateral that connects our Sonora pipeline to a combined cycle power plant.","In addition, the project opportunities identified by IEnova, the CFE bidding process for natural gas pipelines continues. We are currently evaluating two tenders with likely bid dates during the second quarter. In generation, we expect to see the second round of renewable energy auctions in August. And in electric transmission, we expect to see the first two bids under new rules of energy reform in 2016 and 2017. Each electric transmission project represents an estimated $1.2 billion of investment.","With that, please turn to slide 8 and I'll turn the call over to Joe. Joe?","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Thanks, Debbie. Turning to our long-term financial projections, we expect that our base plan can provide 2020 earnings of $7.20 per share to $7.80 per share. The resulting adjusted earnings CAGR from 2016 to 2020 is about 12%. Some of our key plan assumptions include an $18.5 billion capital program including joint venture CapEx for Cameron trains 1 through 3, full-year earnings of $300 million to $350 million from Cameron trains 1 through 3 in both 2019 and 2020, a GRC outcome in line with our proposed settlement agreement and tax repair allowance benefits prior to 2016 being retained by shareholders and an optional $2 billion share repurchase.","Under our base plan, annual adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase by $1.7 billion over the plan period, raising our FFO to debt to roughly 22%. Including our targeted annual increase in the dividend of 8% to 9%, we project excess credit capacity in the later years of our plan to be between $2 billion and $4 billion. Leaving excess capacity on our balance sheet would not maximize shareholder value. We have used a conservative assumption of an optional $2 billion share repurchase, split between 2019 and 2020.","While we do include this assumption, it is our intention to allocate capital toward high-value development projects. I will discuss all of our base plan assumptions and provide business unit guidance at our Analyst Conference. I want to remind you today that our plan is not aspirational in nature. It is anchored on expected utility performance and projects that are already contracted and operating or under construction. This approach gives us high visibility and conviction in our growth rate.","On a final note, before turning to the quarterly results, I want to address the long-term earnings impact from the REX capacity release that Debbie discussed earlier. In the base plan we presented last year, we had only assumed about $5 million to $10 million of annual losses associated with this capacity for 2016 and 2017 because we had not factored in the financial distress that several counterparties have recently experienced. We had no capacity obligations in 2020. By permanently releasing the capacity now, our new five-year plan does not have to reflect any future losses from this capacity, nor any negative impact from the recently announced counterparty bankruptcies beyond the loss we expect to record in the second quarter.","Now, please turn to slide 9. This morning, we reported first quarter earnings of $319 million. On an adjusted basis, we reported first quarter earnings of $370 million or $1.47 per share. Adjusted earnings this quarter exclude the $27 million after-tax loss on the pending sale of our equity interest in REX and $24 million of deferred Mexican income tax expense as a result of holding the TdM power plant for sale.","In addition, just as a reminder, in 2016, we are now including LNG development expenses in our reported adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings guidance, whereas in 2015, these were excluded. There are several factors affecting the first quarter results that are either timing items, or items expected to reverse in later quarters.","Please turn to slide 10 and I will discuss the key factors impacting our quarterly earnings. Quarter-over-quarter, adjusted earnings were impacted by the following items. At our California utilities, we had $17 million of lower earnings mostly due to higher operating costs from higher depreciation and litigation with no increase in authorized margin due to the delay in our GRC.","As Debbie noted, until we receive a final decision, we are recording revenues based on amounts authorized for 2015. Once we receive the final decision, we will record the cumulative impact of 2016 authorized revenues back to January 1. Including this retroactive benefit, we expect the utilities quarterly earnings would be roughly in line with last year which is important given the fact that approximately $60 million of annual tax repair benefits will now flow to customers under the new GRC.","Moving to the Parent category, we recorded $10 million of higher losses due to $7 million of lower repatriation tax expense that was more than offset by $10 million of higher net interest expense combined with a $5 million income tax benefit that was reported in the first quarter of 2015.","At U.S. Gas & Power, we had $9 million of lower earnings due primarily to the impact of natural gas price movements on inventories that we sold forward. We expect this $9 million loss to reverse by year-end. At Sempra International, we had $8 million of lower earnings from foreign currency effects. This was due to a $4 million negative impact in South America and a $4 million higher positive impact in Mexico in Q1 2015. At SoCalGas, our Q1 2015 results included an $8 million GCIM award. No GCIM award was recorded in Q1 2016 as this reward was received in the fourth quarter of last year.","Now, let's conclude on slide 11. In summary, we have updated our 2016 adjusted earnings guidance to $4.60 per share to $5 per share to reflect the REX sale. The annualized impact of the REX sale will also reduce earnings by approximately $70 million per year for the next few years.","Our adjusted guidance is defined in further detail in the appendix. In terms of our financial results, while our first quarter earnings were impacted by the delay in our GRC, we will record the retroactive authorized margin back to January 1 once the final decision is received.","Finally, assuming the GRC outcome is consistent with the settlement agreement, we project a base plan adjusted earnings CAGR of about 12% from 2016 to 2020.","With that, we will conclude our prepared comments and stop to take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go first to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Hey, Julien. Hi, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Congrats.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thank you.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Yeah. So, first quick question to get out of the way, what's the implied growth rate year-over-year on 2019 into 2020? You talked about share repurchases; I have been getting questions on it. Just wanted to settle that.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Well, what we've disclosed now is the growth rate through 2020, and we're not going to give any adjusted earnings guidance for 2019. We always give you the fifth year in our five-year plan. But I think you can kind of infer from what we've given you before and kind of the range of growth over that period of time. What I will say is as you know in our business that some of our growth tends to be lumpy because we have large projects coming into service, and then 2019 will be the first full year of Cameron trains 1 through 3 going into service. Those trains remain on schedule to be completed throughout 2018 as we've told you before. So, 2019, you'll see that come into 2019. And so, 2019 will be lumpy in comparison to 2018, and 2018 will be lumpy in compared to 2017 as the trains come in service.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","And, Julien, this is Joe. I'll just add on to that, exactly what Debbie said, but remember, the way we build our base plan, it will have utility growth ongoing from attrition and utility growth in South America, but there are no new projects that we have outlined that would come on service in 2019 and 2020. So, the growth, I think, you would see there or you would predict to see there won't be what we expect to have because we expect to have new projects. But we're talking about four years or five years from now.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. And with that technicality out of the way, thinking holistically, what is the next focus, at least, of the company when it comes to that capital allocation? I appreciate you delineating the share repurchase as a placeholder. You are selling down some of the gas assets, deeming them non-core. Where is the company going? If you can at least describe your preliminary thinking. I know it's a little bit of an Analyst Day kind of question. But just thought I'd get it out there, especially in light of what should be nearer-term cash proceeds from the asset sales that you articulated already.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Well, let me talk to you about some of the things that we're looking at. And obviously, there's a lot of M&A activity right now in the space, there's a lot of opportunities. But we have a lot of organic growth as well. So let me talk about some of those things.","First of all, we are still looking at train 4 being developed, and so that we would anticipate having agreements in place by the end of the year based upon conversations we've been having with the parties now. And that is not at all in our growth plan. So the numbers we gave you for 2020 has nothing for any additional LNG beyond trains 1 through 3. So we're still focused on that. We think it's a good growth opportunity for us. And then what we also think is the integrated asset. When you have such a huge demand for gas, the opportunity to develop pipelines and storage to serve those loads is a really great opportunity for us. So we continue to look at putting capital into those areas.","I would also say that as you look at the opening of the energy markets in Mexico, they're at the infancy right now. They've only done some of the gas infrastructure. We have electric transmission, we have pipelines for liquids, we have pipelines for our terminals for liquid, we have a lot of more energy infrastructure to come out for opportunities in Mexico, and we think we just have wonderful foundation of assets there that allows us some opportunity.","And then I would say our renewable business, we don't talk a lot about our renewable business, but we had a growing robust successful renewable business that we continue to have new projects that we find, and we have the ability to expand on some of our existing projects. What I would say is that we have a strategy that's really focused on growing at more than twice the rate or at twice the rate of the typical utility but with a similar risk profile.","So, when we start looking at assets, we look at are they long-term contracted? Can they have low volatility because we know you all value low volatility with growth? And can they support our growing dividends? And can they give us the strength of the balance sheet that we're seeing over the five years of plan?","And so projects that kind of fit that criteria, we're open to a lot of things. We constantly look at M&A, and we see some assets that may be on the market that might be of interest to us. So, our strategy hasn't changed and we just thought that the capital that we had in some of these things was kind of trapped and was not really integrated with anything else we had and was not going to provide us the kind of growth that other investments might.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And the last little piece there on the cash in hand today, I know it's part of the broader capital allocation, anything in particular there to emphasize?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Just the cash that you're getting from the asset sales.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yes. Yeah, I'll let Joe...yeah.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","No. I think, Julien, nothing particular. We're building out about $1 billion of renewables this year, and money is fungible. We're looking at all kinds of opportunities. Mark's groups are looking at lots of opportunities. So, I can't name one thing because there's a whole bunch of things on the plate.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Well, thank you, guys, very much. Good luck.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Thanks.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thanks, Julien.","Operator","We'll go next to Neel Mitra with Tudor, Pickering.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Hi, Neel.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","I just wanted to touch on Mexico first, the three pipeline bids which IEnova got disqualified from. Could you explain the reasoning behind that and if there's any way to reverse the result or appeal it, and how that may affect the bidding going forward for you guys?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Sure. I'm going to have Mark address that. And because I think it's important to know that it was not kind of \u2013 it didn't happen with as being disqualified one bid after the other. Unfortunately, we had to submit all bids kind of at the same time, and we didn't find out about being disqualified for the first one until the other two had already been submitted. But, Mark, would you talk a little bit about...","Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy","Yes.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy",".... of that really going forward and how we're dealing with that.","Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy","Right. Sure. I mean, on those particular bids, what \u2013 the methodology that we used was to adjust our tariff to CFE by additional capacity that we anticipated to sell to other customers down the road. But without specifying exactly where on the pipeline we would do that and that's the basis on which they would disqualify us. I mean, as Debbie said, we submitted three bids at once, used that same methodology. We're disqualified. We don't agree with it. And we've challenged it, but I think we've adjusted our bidding procedure going forward. And we've \u2013 frankly, it's kind of behind us now, and we're looking at the other bids. And we've adjusted how we're doing it. We would expect to be quite competitive in the future.","So, it's not something \u2013 it was unfortunate just the way those bids came together, but it's behind us now, and we're moving on. But I will say that I think talking about Mexico in particular, we're still in a very, very good competitive position there and I'm really pleased with the growth that we've had. It's unfortunate you don't see it quite in the financials, but our EBITDA there was up 19% from $93 million last year to $110 million if you include our ownership in the JV and our proportionate share of their EBITDA. And it gets masked a little bit in the GAAP reporting and because of FX. Last quarter 2015 in the first quarter, we had a 3% inflation with \u2013 or a strengthening of the peso which actually reduced our tax expense. And in 2016, it was pretty much flat, and so we didn't get that same benefit. So, that kind of masked the underlying growth. But we had very strong growth there and are in a very good and competitive position in Mexico.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Got it. And, Debbie, you mentioned a lot of opportunities in Mexico beyond just the CFE pipelines. Could you maybe comment on, nearer-term, what maybe the best opportunities are that we should be looking at?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Sure. I'll talk about some, and I think one that we have before us that we expect to close during the third quarter is the PEMEX acquisition of the JV assets that we currently hold jointly with PEMEX, and we're still moving forward on that. But as you probably read, now PEMEX is looking at other potential asset sales. And they have a number of assets that we would be interested in that will give us some opportunities. We're also looking at some of the other energy assets that are in Mexico now, some of which are in operations, some of which are in the development stage that we could potentially acquire and we have some that we're looking at there.","And then just in terms of the broader markets opening, you have the bids coming out that are about $1.2 billion a piece for electric transmission that we're seeing. You have renewable being bid and several billion dollars worth of potential there. And then for us, since we kind of own and operate pipelines, there's a lot of liquid pipeline assets in Mexico. They are currently held by PEMEX now or needs for new liquids pipeline that deal with their opening of the oil market. And so we think that that's a great area for us as well to have similar type of long-term contracted infrastructure in liquids.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Got it. And my last question, with you guys divesting REX, there's no real domestic midstream presence. Are you looking to grow that through acquisition or organically or is that something that's not necessarily important as long as you have contracted growth in other areas?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. What we've looked at as a strategy to grow that but more on an integrated basis with our other assets. And that when you have a huge load like building an LNG facility, that gives you the opportunity to build pipelines and storage to serve that load that integrate with others, and then to expand those in a way that you can pick up additional customers, whether they're electric generation facilities or manufacturing facilities and really have a full pipeline. So what we tend to look at is where we have a load and we're the one that has that load, whether it's a utility or, it's a \u2013 or a contract with PEMEX or it's a contract for LNG export that we like to have assets that integrate with that load. And so that would be kind of our priority for looking at assets as to how they could be more integrated with our business. I mean, REX is fine, but it didn't integrate with anything we had. We only had a 25% interest in it. We didn't control it. It has contracts expiring. It's just really didn't fit our model. And I don't want that to tell you at all that we're reluctant to get into other midstream assets. We are very interested in getting into those types of assets.","But they need to provide us more growth. And when we look at REX, we just did not see the profile as providing the kind of growth. But there's some interesting assets that we're starting to look at now that maybe come on market that we are already in existence, and then there's some that we foresee the need to develop that we think would be really interesting as well.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Hello, guys.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Hi, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","So, I just want to be clear on \u2013 if I were trying to replicate your business plan with my own financial model that we take the balance sheet capacity you have, and we just assume that you buy the shares back at some higher stock price as we compound out four years of growth. And that would be a pretty low implied return on equity on that capital relative to what you would consider a competitive hurdle rate for an actual infrastructure project. Is that a fair articulation of the math?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah, Greg. I think you figured that out actually quite well. One of the things we struggled with is that when we do our base plan, the only things we put in our base plan are things we already have contracted and our expected utility earnings and that \u2013 most others, when they build those plans, they put aspirational projects and we don't do that. So then when we looked at that and we thought with all the projects we have at our contracts and what that would yield, and then looking at all the cash flows we have coming from the projects that are in service at that time and what that did to our FFO to debt, we just said, there's no way we would sit with that FFO to debt on our balance sheet at that time.","So what's the most conservative assumption we could put in and decided that to do a stock buyback with the most conservative way to handle it. But I'm going to turn it to Joe to talk a little bit more about how you might think about that in your question.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Thanks, Debbie. Yeah. Greg, I want to emphasize the two key factors that she mentioned that are the element of the base plan. It's built on the strength of our regulated utilities and the already contracted infrastructure business that contributes to the strong balance sheet and the cash flow. So we did kind of what you said, we looked forward, we had to pick up price, we estimated the price based on a reasonable utility multiple several years out and used that as a way to develop the optional share buyback. And I think that our goal is really to develop infrastructure and beat that. And so the earnings from those projects will replace this and that's the goal that we expect to achieve.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Great. I would presume once we get to Analyst Day that you would give us a similar framework of, this is what we have on the list of things that are moving ahead. And then the checklist of that aspirational items that we could hold you to either achieving or not achieving as you move through time, much like you did last year?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Absolutely. We'll do the blue box, which is the base plan, and the green box, which is the aspirational items. And I mean, the key thing is that that some of those aspirational items will replace these stock buybacks, obviously. But to the extent that we can do more of those projects, they would also be additive to the stock buyback. And so we'll go through all of that with you at the Analyst Meeting as we usually do.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Great. Switching to Aliso Canyon, the costs obviously are up pretty significantly since the 10-K disclosure of around $330 million, if my memory serves me correctly. Can you give us what the incremental costs have been in basic buckets? Has it been mostly the extension by the judges of the relocation program? Or has it been other items that have also been significant?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. Let me \u2013 I'm going to refer this to Dennis so he can kind of walk you through some of that and what's happening relative to the relocation. But the majority of these costs are associated with relocation. The vast majority \u2013 I think it's about 70% of the costs are relocation. So, Dennis, do you want to kind of walk him through that a bit?","Dennis V. Arriola - Southern California Gas Co.","Sure. Good afternoon, Greg. You're right. If you think back when we reported in the 10-K, the costs were about $332 million. Since that time, we have had the relocation program extended at least a couple of times by the courts. So if you look at the change of about $333 million, the majority of that has been relocation, a 70%. Then you basically have two other buckets. So about 15% of the overall total relates to the work of stopping the leak, building the relief wells, the root cause investigation that's underway and everything and then you've got the buckets of the other costs related to legal and other out-of-pocket. So, those are the three main 70% relo, 15% for the stopping the leak and the investigation, and then the other 15% related to legal expense and other costs.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thank you very much. Take care.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Faisel Khan with Citigroup.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good afternoon.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Hi, Faisel.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. On the TdM asset sale, I suppose that with the sale sort of announced, did that mean it was difficult to get a long-term contract on that plant for sales into Mexico? Is that the genesis behind why this asset is being sold? I thought that this would fall underneath that bucket of assets that could be under a long-term contract, but maybe that wasn't a possibility.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. I'm going to have Mark talk about that, but it had been sold into the U.S. previously. And we were working on the possibility of trying to sell it into the Mexican markets. But as we looked at the asset and the difficulty in that, we decided that it was not likely to be not long-term contracted in the near-term. Mark, do you want to...","Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy","Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, the plant right now is configured only for sale into the U.S. We've looked at and we have a plan to connect it into the grid in Mexico. It could be that in the not too distant future that there could be a long-term contract opportunity with the CFE. The CFE did just sponsor and build a new plant very close to our LNG facility in \u2013 down by Ensenada. And so, it's going to delay for some years the need for additional capacity in that region.","And also to \u2013 just with those kinds of plants, fossil fuel-fired plants in Mexico, the contracting periods are not as long as they once were and so we started to see that this asset is not likely to meet our kind of long-term contracted objectives and therefore, we thought that we ought to put it on the market and see if we \u2013 and move to sell it.","All that said, I think we have certainly a reserve price in our heads that if we don't get it, or don't get it, then we'll rethink that. But I think we're in very good \u2013 we're looking at trying to move forward on it.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, makes sense. And then just going back to Aliso, just want to understand. So, you're saying that you probably won't get any major final report from the agencies until late 2016 or 2017. Are there going to be any initial findings that come out through the regulatory process over the next few months?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Well, I would say there were some initial findings from DOGGR that indicated that SoCalGas was in full compliance with all the rules that were in place at that time, and DOGGR came out with those findings early on from the preliminary review. But right now, the work that Blade is doing on-site in conjunction with CPUC, I don't think we're going to get any preliminary information. What they'll do is they're gathering the data and then they'll write the report, and it's likely that report will be out at the end of this year or early next year.","Dennis, do you want to add to that?","Dennis V. Arriola - Southern California Gas Co.","Well, the only thing that I'd add to that, Debbie, is that there's a lot of work going on not just under the root cause investigation with DOGGR, the CPUC, and Blade, but work to get Aliso back up and running. And I can tell you right now that it's really clear that the regulators and policymakers truly understand the importance of Aliso Canyon and gas storage to both gas and electric reliability. So the tone is basically, let's make sure it's safe but let's get it back up and running as quickly as we can. And so far, we've got \u2013 of the 114 wells at Aliso, about 100 wells of them have completed the Phase I inspections and we're transitioning those now to Phase II so that \u2013 our target right now, Faisel, is to have the field ready for full operation obviously subject to DOGGR confirmation. But by late summer, probably late August, so a lot of work going on there.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then the storage field would not be able to go back into operation until this report comes out? Or could you put it back into service before then?","Dennis V. Arriola - Southern California Gas Co.","Well, today, we've got about 15 billion cubic feet of gas, so if needed, we can withdraw. We're just not allowed to inject until the field has been confirmed ready by DOGGR. And as I said, our current target right now is to have wells ready for re-injection by late summer.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","And that is before the full report will be out.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay.","Dennis V. Arriola - Southern California Gas Co.","Yeah. And that's separate from the root cause analysis. So those things don't \u2013 they aren't linked. The root cause is going down one work stream and then there's a separate work stream to get the field back up and running.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, makes sense. And then just on REX, just wanted to make sure I understand the \u2013 I guess, what you had initially had in guidance in the past. So, did you always have the legacy REX interest that you have going to zero earnings in 2020? Just wanted to make sure I understood that correctly.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. No, you understood it correctly. I mean, we basically had \u2013 it was de minimis in 2020 because we had looked at the contracts all expiring in 2019, and then there was debt refinancing that needed to be done and so we looked at the economics of that. And so when we were putting our plans together, we were not expecting REX to continue at the kind of run rate that \u2013 we told you that it was $60 million for the 10-month we have this year. We were not expecting it to continue at that kind of run rate after those contracts expired in 2019.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","That makes sense. So do you expect the contracts to expire and nothing would happen after that, or did you also \u2013 did you expect some re-contracting but at a lower rate? Did it also include the east-to-west contracts that were signed?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. Yeah, we looked at all of that and we expected that there would be some contracting at a lower rate. Mark, do you want to...","Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy","Yeah. Faisel, yeah, obviously, we did. We had a projection of what we thought the re-contracting rate would be, and then we also assumed that we would continue with the east-to-west contracting that we've done and that we had a market check on that, and that's what was in our plan. But that combined with the interest cost and some refinancing that we thought was going to happen, it just didn't have a material impact on our financials beyond 2018.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, got it. Then last question for me. With the midstream and MLP markets coming back, to some degree, off the bottom, I'm just wondering \u2013 and also with the sale of REX, does this mean the MLP is completely off the table even in the future?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","I would say nothing is off the table in the future. I mean, I would never do that. We will always look at what's the lowest cost of capital for us to grow, and that's the way we look at it that \u2013 REX was not a core asset for the MLP anyway since we only owned a fraction of it, and we really didn't have the ability to use that as openly as you would an asset that you had 100%. And I would say Cameron trains 1 through 3 are excellent assets for an MLP. But those would not be off the table, but right now if you kind of look at where that market is, it's certainly not our top priority.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Understood. Thank you, guys.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Lapides at Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Actually, I have a couple of them. First of all, Debbie, can you talk about the portfolio and whether you think there's anything else within it that you wouldn't view as core or strategic to Sempra over the long-term? And if so, why?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Sure. No, there's nothing that we identify right now that fits that category, Michael. We look at our assets all the time. And the \u2013 all of our assets or other assets really are pretty well long-term contracted. The only one that comes up that we look at constantly is gas storage and that we do have still contracts on gas storage that have some duration left on those contracts. And we look at that and say how does that fit with our other assets? And what we see happening kind of in the Gulf region with the export of LNG, the conversion of coal to gas and need for different type of assets to support that and then looking at the storage market right now, we kind of think that the timing on that asset, if things aren't going to happen, they're going to get better, not likely worse. And so, that's one we constantly look at but we have concluded on that at least for the time being. It doesn't seem like something that we would want to try to get out of our portfolio at this time.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. When you talk about the $18.5 billion capital plan over the next five years, how much of that is at the two core California utilities?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","It's about $12 billion of that at the two California utilities, so the vast majority of that. And there may be some opportunities \u2013 I was going to say, there may be some opportunities for the utilities to actually consume more of that. There's some projects that we have that are on the green sheets that we show you that we're hoping to get some accrual on that would add to the capital expenditures at the utilities during that time. But we really put in that only the ones that we have some great visibility and high certainty that we either have rate case approval or project approval from the CPUC or FERC.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And last question, how are you thinking about the growth rate in the South American utilities relative to the rest of the Sempra portfolio? I ask only because if I back out the FX impact, it still doesn't seem like it was a huge growth rate and going back over the last couple of quarters as well, just curious how you are thinking about that business and its organic growth potential.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah, I mean, we still see a lot of organic growth potential there because similar to Mexico, there is huge needs for infrastructure in those countries. And we're looking at quite a few things right now in Peru, in particular. Mark, why don't you maybe hit a little bit about some of the things that we'd looked out and opportunities for growth.","Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy","Right. I mean, there is huge infrastructure needs there. I do think both economies, probably Chile more than Peru, but both economies have been affected by the downturn in the mining sector and effectively China's downturn. And so I think that's hurt the overall growth. But I think when you look at them, where they've been historically and what the expectation is for this year and next year, we still see strong underlying growth that you just don't see in any domestic utilities. So, you're seeing \u2013 you still see here the 3%, 4% customer growth and 3%, 4% energy growth coming back. And we \u2013 I think, with the recession, we've had a little bit of a downturn there, but it's \u2013 but we see that coming back.","And then on top of that, we see some large infrastructure needs, which really wouldn't be available to us if we weren't active in that market in the utility market there. There, we just wouldn't have a presence to be able to capitalize on those. And so I think we're \u2013 again, we don't put those in our plan because we don't have them signed up yet, but we're close on several things. And I think it looks promising. It looks like that there's definitely some activity level that's going to be happening down there that will increase the growth for those facilities.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks, Mark and Debbie. Much appreciated.","Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy","Thanks.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","The next is Steve Fleishman with Wolfe.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Hey, Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. Hi, Debbie. Couple quick questions. First on the assumptions on the rate case. So you highlight that the guidance includes the settlement, including the repair tax treatment. Could you just remind me that \u2013 I recall that not being a big number, but I just want to make sure I know what the number is for the prior repair tax treatment?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. Let me have Joe walk through the repair tax treatment numbers for you. Let me talk about the rate case though while he's getting the precise numbers on that. What I would say is on the GRC that we've been given every indication that we should be getting a decision soon. And that we're expecting since we had 8 out of 11 parties sign on to the settlement that we would likely get the settlement as the outcome.","We would also expect to get a repair allowance because we feel like we have very strong argument and have differentiated ourselves in terms of how we handle that in our rate cases going forward and returning the benefits to customers. And so we would anticipate getting a decision hopefully very soon and that very consistent with the settlement. And what we've been told is that the hang-up and the delay is not any different than when you're hearing from every utilities commenting on their proceedings is that there's just a lack of resources at the commission right now, especially in the ALJ division, to get some of these things out as quickly as they would like. And so we anticipated that that would come earlier but that we continue to be told it will be soon and that it's really more hung-up because of their resource issues.","Okay? Joe?","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Hi, Steve. Hey, let me just...","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","...remind you all. Jeff and Dennis and their teams have been working closely with the commission on this issue, and we've tried to emphasize with them that we have very unique facts that are differentiated from some of the other utilities. And some of those things relate to \u2013 our rate case was actually worked on and closed and officially closed by the ALJ before we made our changes in the tax treatment. And in our 2012 GRC, we offered up a sharing mechanism much like we have in the past, and that was rejected. It was denied. So we've kind of offered up avenues for them to look at this kind of things. And as we've talked about before, there's very good precedent that the savings you generate before next rate case for all kinds of things, tax and general operating \u2013 flow to shareholders. So we think this will be resolved favorably, but let me get to the numbers that you asked about.","There's two timing periods that are important. One is up through 2014 and then one is 2015. And I'll talk about the first period first. So from the beginning of the rate case through 2014, the interveners that applied for this suggested that we had about $90 million at each utility that they want to be adjusted through rate base. So that would be a rate base adjustment and the impact, if we lost that, we don't think we will, but if we lost that, the impact would be $6 million to $7 million at each of the utilities kind of going forward because of that change in rate base. But then the commission asked us to put a memorandum account together for 2015 savings from this tax repair allowance. And if we were to lose that issue, we will, of course, appeal it and fight it. But if we were to lose it, we would have to take a charge of about $70 million that's broken between the two utilities, but in total, $65 million to $70 million in total for the 2015 memorandum account. Again, I think these are things that we expect to go in our favor. We're giving you all the data...","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","... we've done before.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. But I guess the main reason I asked the question is a scheme of a range that's $7.20 per share to $7.80 per share. These are pretty small when you look at the ongoing impacts.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Very small.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","They are really not meaningful, so I didn't know why you highlighted it out, because it really doesn't move the needle very much at all.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Yeah. It doesn't move the needle at all in the outer years. It was really a 2016 issue because...","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","... if that decision were to come out in the next couple of weeks and we had a negative result and we didn't want to surprise anybody.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And just on the Aliso, with the changes to the relocation that you set up, could you give us a sense of what the ongoing like weekly cost is? Is there some way to get a sense of that?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. Let me hand it to Dennis. I think that one of the things that we need to put in perspective is that we've made a lot of changes to the program that reduced the cost from where it was. And so, Dennis can walk you through including the number of people that are going home now which is quite significant. Dennis?","Dennis V. Arriola - Southern California Gas Co.","Hey, Steve. Yeah, let me give you a little color around that because I think as we get some questions, people want to understand and put in perspective. When you look at \u2013 first of all, the leak, as you know, was permanently sealed back on February 18. And at that time, when you look at the number of people that were impacted, it was really \u2013 the vast majority of the households around Aliso Canyon, they never left. They stayed at their homes. Everything was safe and everything. So, it was a smaller number to begin with. But since then, we've had over 54% of any impacted residents that have actually gotten back to their homes, and every week, we're seeing more and more. So, to give you an actual run rate is difficult because, as Debbie said, we're doing things within our program that allow us to \u2013 and help the residents move safe from hotels to corporate-style apartments, more family-situated apartments with kitchens where they can cook and everything, and that helps bring down the cost.","The other things that we're doing is we've been offering in-home cleaning services to give further assurance to residents that everything is safe. So, while we haven't given an official run rate, what we can tell you is that the number that we gave out for the $665 million assumed relocation expenses through June 7. And as we said, we expect to get additional information from the Department of Public Health this month regarding their testing. And I think that type of information will even further get people more comfortable that they can go home and we'll see the numbers continue to drop week after week.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","And then just very quickly, last question, Debbie, any incremental color to your year-end call on news on Cameron 4?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. Let me just ask Mark to address that since we've been having some conversations with Oct\u00e1vio recently about how those discussions are going and actually feel pretty positive about what we're hearing from the customers and the high level of interest. So, Mark?","Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy","Yeah. I \u2013 Steve, thanks. I think the big thing \u2013 the point to keep in mind is as far as U.S. LNG exports go, we believe train 4 will be one of the least expensive options available. So that's why we have \u2013 we continue to have pretty good interest from people looking at securing that option early and maybe even in advance of when world demand may require it. So, we are feeling pretty confident that it's going to move forward.","Our original statements that we made on the last call at the end of the year or two were that we expected to have something wrapped up by the end of the year and that our FID amount would be in the first part of next year. And that hasn't changed. So, we're still working towards that. And if we get any indication that things are different, we'll tell you right away. But I think right now, we're still feeling like this will happen sometime this year.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","And then I would add to that just that you all read about what's happening in the markets. And we have great expressed interest from customers. I mean, they're spending time. They're putting teams on this to negotiate with us. So it's not like they're just saying, oh, we like this, do something. They're actually dedicating resources to this. But this is a very challenging market to get agreements signed and so I just want to counterbalance that. And honestly, if we get agreements signed in January or February of next year versus December of this year, I'll be a happy camper.","Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy","Yes.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","So we're really focused on it. And as I said, it's not like the counterparties are not engaged fully. They are engaged fully. So...","Operator","And we'll go next to Rose-Lynn Armstrong at Barclays.","Rose-Lynn Armstrong - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, Debbie.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Hi. How are you, Rose-Lynn?","Rose-Lynn Armstrong - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I'm well. Can you just talk with a little bit greater specificity about the construction progress at Cameron trains 1 through 3? And then separately, regarding the Aliso estimates of $665 million, can \u2013 with regard to the relocation assumption in there, are you assuming that the same number of households are relocating over the entire period? Or is there a decline in trends through June 7?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Sure. Let me take the LNG question first and talk a little bit about that and then have Dennis address the assumptions on the relocation. So for Cameron 1 through 3, we're 43% complete. The construction is going really well. We're all slightly ahead of our construction schedule. I would say on schedule but if you look at some of the data, we're slightly ahead. And that we're still expecting train 1 to come on in March of 2018, train 2 to come on in July of 2018 and 3 in November of 2018 which was the schedule that we had outlined for you previously.","So, everything is going very, very well there. I would say the safety performance has been exceptional on the job. And that the major materials, the long lead time materials have all been ordered and everything is moving on quite well in construction. I don't know, Mark, is there anything else you want to add?","Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy","No. I mean, I think, right now, the project is moving as smoothly as we could have expected. It's in very good shape.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","So, then your second question related to the assumptions that are in the $665 million on the relocation, and let me have Dennis address that.","Dennis V. Arriola - Southern California Gas Co.","Sure, Rose-Lynn. Yeah, as I mentioned, what we did is we assumed that the relocation cost would continue through June 7. And we basically \u2013 to be conservative, we've assumed that they stay flat throughout that period. Now, what we are seeing, and this was incorporated into our assumptions, is that as we're cleaning more homes, people are going home. They're being \u2013 they're even more comfortable that their homes are safe and everything. So, we are seeing more and more people go home that way.","The other thing that we've been doing that we incorporated into our assumptions is as we're able to locate more of the family-style corporate housing options within the area, we're transitioning more people from hotels where they're also receiving per diem to these corporate apartments where they have their kitchens and we don't have to pay the per diems. So, those are the types of \u2013 and that's part of the program that we have. That's part of the approved program. So, that helps reduce the overall cost as well. So, all those things are built into it, but we aren't assuming a huge drop-off. But we are seeing that on a week-to-week basis, so I think that's favorable.","Rose-Lynn Armstrong - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thank you.","Operator","Next, to Paul Patterson, Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good morning, guys. How are you?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Hi, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","So, I just wanted to touch base just to revisit Steve's question on the growth rate and the repairs deduction, just to understand this. The impact is roughly \u2013 approximately $70 million in 2016. And then after that it really doesn't have much of a significant impact afterwards. Is that the way to think of it?","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Yeah. Paul, this is Joe. Yeah, that's the way to think of it. But the $65 million to $70 million is not in any of our numbers. We're assuming that we win that, we don't have that impact. So it's really...","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Quite right.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","...if we get a negative impact going forward, there's just really very \u2013 it's not significant, not material.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Just wanted to double-check on that. And then with respect to the $100 million to $120 million of capacity release and the loss that you guys expect to take in the second quarter on that, what would it have been if you \u2013 I mean, this is not completely clear. What is it that \u2013 I mean, you did describe it and I apologize, but what would it have been if you hadn't done that? Would it have just been pro-rated through, what was it, 2019 or something or...","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Yeah. Paul, I said that and so I'll say it again, so it's clear it'll be in the transcript. I said that in our plan, the one that we gave you last year, we had for 2016 and 2017 between $5 million and $10 million of losses related to this capacity because we had a lot of capacity sold forward. It wasn't exactly at the same price we were buying the capacity up. It was pretty close. So, we had a $5 million to $10 million loss for 2016 and 2017. That did not take into account some of the recent financial troubles that some of the capacity holders had. So, if we had kept it, we would have had bigger losses going forward, which is why as we try to sell this forward on a permanent basis, we're taking a bigger loss than you would assume from the $5 million to $10 million that had been in our plan. But for you to go adjust your plans, you were probably basing them off of our numbers, and I want you to know what was in our numbers before which was $5 million to $10 million for the next couple of years.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then the potential buyback, that's kind of a placeholder. And if I understand it correctly, you guys are aiming for better returns with investments and what have you. But the 12% has this as a placeholder in the event that you were for some reason not able to find investments. Is that the right way to think of it?","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Yes. Paul, that is the way to think about it. What I'd like to emphasize is, look, we're pretty unique here. Most of our peers whether they're utilities or midstream companies or renewable companies are issuing equity to grow. We're actually growing our earnings and our cash flow so fast and increasing the strength of our balance sheet and increasing our dividend 8% to 9% a year over this period that we're able to actually look at a potential buyback if we don't capture some of these projects we're working on, but we fully expect to capture those projects and do better. We just showed this as an optional thing that it's within our control and we can do. That's unique.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. So if you were to be able to find the investments, the 12% would be on the lower end of the range? Is that the way to think of it?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. Let me just add to that that the 12% is based upon what we already have under contract and in construction. And what our expected utility earnings would be assuming we get the settlement in the rate case and then we just assume in out years that we use attrition in addition to that. So we try to use conservative assumptions for that, but then we show you all the development projects. And in this time, we thought that using the assumption of the buyback was conservative because we wouldn't be sitting there with 22% FFO to debt on our balance sheet and not do something with it. What we fully expect in the next five years that we will have projects that will have a much better return than what we're showing you with the stock buyback. But we have, as Joe said, we have wonderful flexibility.","To be able to show you five years what we have long-term contracted that yields that kind of a growth rate and gives us the strength of the balance sheet that gives us the flexibility, if we were not to find projects, to buy back stock, which we don't think is going to be the outcome because we have a robust backlog of projects that we're working on. But it's just a wonderful position to be in and honestly, this is what I was going to talk about at the Analyst Meeting because not too many others can talk about having a strengthening balance sheet, having this type of a 12% growth rate with conservative assumption, and then having the ability to grow the dividend by 8% to 9% over that five-year period of time with nothing else.","So, that was going to be a lot of my presentation. I'm (01:07:53) closing kind of what we're going to be talking about, but it's a really great position to be in. And since we didn't do the Analyst Conference, we wanted you to all understand where we stood relative to that, and we'll go into a lot more details as we always do when we get to the conference.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Great. Thanks so much.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thank you.","Operator","This does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back to Debbie Reed for any closing comments.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Well, thanks for all of you joining us today, and as always, if you have any follow-up questions, feel free to contact our IR team. We look forward to seeing you at the Analyst Conference. We will let you know as soon as we get a date scheduled so that you can plan around that. And thank you very much for being understanding with our decision to postpone that. We would not likely have done that, but we also want to do the best job possible in outlining our business. And I think having the certainty of a rate case decision will be a much better position at the end when we really talk to you about the business. So, have a great day and we'll see you sometime hopefully in July.","Operator","This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation.

Good day, and welcome to the Sempra Energy First Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time I'd like to turn the conference over to Faisel Khan. Please go ahead.","Faisel Khan","Good morning, and welcome to Sempra Energy's first quarter 2019 earnings call. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our Web site under the Investors section. Here in San Diego are several members of our management team, including Jeff Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Joe Householder, President and Chief Operating Officer; Trevor Mihalik, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Peter Wall, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller.","Before starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC.","It's important to note that all the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis, and that we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for reconciliation to GAAP measures. I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, May 7, 2019, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.","With that, please turn to slide four, and let me hand the call over to Jeff.","Jeff Martin","Thanks a lot, Faisel. I'd like to thank everyone who attended our Investor Day here in San Diego. We appreciated having the opportunity to provide a comprehensive update on our strategy and capital plans and enjoyed taking many of you to visit our LNG facility in Baja, California, as well as SDG&E where we highlighted our wildfire mitigation program and showcased our other California utility assets.","We hope you came away from our conference with the following: First, we have a sharper strategic focus, second, we've improved our capital discipline and third, we are investing in a high performance culture. Since our Investor Day, we held our internal top 300 leadership meeting, leaders across our company came together here in San Diego to discuss steps we're taking to better align our 20,000 employees to directly support our strategic mission of becoming North America's premier energy infrastructure company. There was a great sense of energy amongst the team as we set our course for the next year and beyond. From an execution standpoint, we continue to make progress on our goals. Just last month, we completed the sale of our wind assets, which bring the total cash proceeds from our renewable to midstream divestitures to approximately $2.5 billion. Well above market expectations.","Next our focus is on successfully completing the planned sale of our South American businesses, which we're targeting to close around the end of this year. Proceeds from our asset sales will be used to advance our strategic mission by funding growth while also strengthening our balance sheet by paying down parent debt.","Now, looking forward, Sempra is well-positioned, our business is at the intersection of two key trends that are transforming the energy markets, the transition towards cleaner energy, which is happening market-by-market, and the US's growing dominance in the global energy markets. We expect our assets to play a key role in furthering both of these trends, which in turn should create jobs both in the United States and Mexico, bolster the economies of both countries and drive future value creation for our shareholders. Before handing off the call to Joe, I'd also like to highlight that we're affirming our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance range as well as our 2020 EPS guidance range.","Please turn to the next slide, where Joe will discuss how we're executing on our operational goals.","Joe Householder","Thanks, Jeff. Before touching on some of the legislative discussions happening in California on wildfire risk, I'd like to mention that last week the CPUC issued a favorable proposed decision on SDG&E's wildfire mitigation plan, enabling us to continue to improve our industry leading program.","Now, on the legislative front, we're pleased with Governor Newsome and the strike force's leadership and their proposals. The most important aspects are mitigating the threat of wildfires through measures such as increased vegetation management, advancing emergency response to minimize damage if an event occurs, and defining proposals that can help ensure healthy utilities to achieve California's greenhouse gas reduction goals. We believe the strike force's recent recommendations of a liquidity fund, a wildfire fund, and changes to inverse condemnation help narrow the focus of the Blue Ribbon Commission.","We're actively engaged to help ensure that our customers and our shareholders' interests are addressed and that our existing wildfire mitigation efforts are recognized. We're optimistic that effective legislative solutions could be introduced and approved this summer. Although positive headway is being made the current regulatory environment and threat of wildfires in this state are factors we must take into account in our regulatory filings including that cost of capital proceeding.","Please turn to slide six. This CPUC cost of capital proceeding is very important to our two utilities, because our currently authorized return on equity numbers were last updated in July of 2017, and were the result of a two-year extension from our cost of capital proceeding approved in 2013. A lot has happened since 2017, and even more so since 2013. Over this time period, in California, customer needs, state mandates, energy goals, the environment, the regulatory construct, have all changed considerably. They've had a corresponding and material impact on the risk profile of California investor-owned utilities.","Our cost of capital applications reflects this shift in risk and the higher ROEs are designed to help ensure access to the capital markets. Specifically, our request for focus on returns that are commensurate with the increased risk of operating in California, investment grade credit ratings to preserve reasonable rates for customers and maintain access to capital to continue investing in safety and reliability and financial stability.","With this in mind, we request that first an increase to our authorized ROEs, at SDG&E we requested a base ROE of 10.9% plus a 3.4% ADAR [ph] for a total of 14.3%, an increase from our currently authorized ROE of 10.2%. We have arrived at the wildfire ADAR by estimating risks associated with potential unrecoverable wildfire liability, premiums required by insurers and premiums required by investors in our catastrophe bonds.","At SoCalGas, we requested an ROE of 10.7% compared to it's currently authorized ROE of 10.05%. And second an increase in our authorized capital structure to 56% equity for both utilities, which has been our average actual capital structure over the past five years and puts us within the range of debt ratios for Moody's A rated regulated electric and gas utility companies. We believe our ROE applications are appropriate based on our financial modeling, input from external consulting experts and taking into account the current capital markets and regulatory environment. We also believe the applications will help to ensure the credit worthiness and financial integrity of our California utilities. For additional perspective, our base ROE requests are similar to our authorized ROEs prior to 2012, which were around 11%.","We submitted our FERC cost of capital filing for SDG&E in October of last year, which included a proposed ROE of 11.2% compared to our current ROE of 10.05%. In terms of timing, settlement discussions have started and are expected to go through the second half of the year. A requested FERC ROE increase is clearly lower than our proposed CPUC ROE increase. This is primarily due to the fact that when these applications were filed, events that have occurred since that time and most importantly differences in the probability of cost recovery between the two regulatory jurisdictions.","Regarding our 2019 GRC filings, based on the activity we've seen, we continue to believe will receive a proposed decision from the CPUC in mid 2019 with an effective date of January 1, 2019. Southern California Edison recently received their proposed decision but from a timing perspective each rate case is assessed on an individual basis and is led by different commissioners and administrative law judges. We continue to believe our proposals are in the best interests of all stakeholders involved with a focus on safety and reliability for our customers. Please turn to the next slide.","Shifting to our Texas Utility business, we're happy to report the settlement has been reached with key stakeholders in on course proposed acquisition of InfraREIT and Sempra's proposed acquisition of a 50% interest in Sharyland, the last regulatory steps in the transaction or approval and a final order from the PUCT. This is consistent with our previous timeline and we would expect to close the transaction in mid-2019.","Now, please turn to slide eight. I'd now like to spend a few minutes discussing our infrastructure businesses. Let me start with Cameron. As you'll recall, at our Investor Day, we were able to raise Sempra's projected annual run rate earnings guidance range for Cameron LNG Phase 1 to $400 million to $450 million. Train 1 continues to achieve key milestones to support its timeline and most recently we introduced feed gas in mid-April. We expect to begin producing LNG from this train shortly and began recognizing earnings in mid-2019. Based on updated disclosures, the EPC contractor now expects Train 2 to produce LNG in Q1 2020 and Train 3 to produce LNG in Q2 of 2020 due to a longer construction and commissioning schedule.","Moving on to our development projects both ECA and Port Arthur recently received non-FDA approval to export LNG. Additionally, Port Arthur received FERC authorization to site, construct and operate the LNG facility. These approvals bring us one step closer to reaching FID for these important projects.","Related to IEnova, we're still targeting commercial delivery of natural gas at the Marine pipeline in the second quarter of this year. At the terminal businesses IEnova announced two new capacity contracts with a global integrated oil company. This included an additional contract for 740,000 barrels of storage at the previously announced [indiscernible] marine terminal development project as well as 290,000 barrels of capacity at a new storage terminal project in Guadalajara. This new Guadalajara terminal is our seventh terminal project and one of 12 projects currently in development or under construction.","Please turn to the next slide, where Trevor will review our financial results.","Trevor Mihalik","Thanks, Joe. Earlier this morning, we reported first quarter GAAP earnings of $441 million or $1.59 per share. This compares favorably to first quarter 2018 earnings of $347 million or $1.33 per share. On an adjusted basis, first quarter earnings were $534 million or $1.92 per share. This compares favorably to our first quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of $372 million or $1.43 per share.","Please turn to slide 10, where I'll discuss the key drivers of our quarterly results. The variance in our first quarter 2019 adjusted earnings when compared to last year was affected by the following items, $79 million of higher equity earnings at the Sempra Texas utility segment resulting from the acquisition of our interest in Oncor in March of 2018. $35 million and $31 million at SoCalGas and SDG&E respectively related to the January 2019 CPUC decision allocating certain deferred income tax balances to shareholders. This benefit was included in our 2019 adjusted guidance. $23 million of higher earnings from South American operation including $15 million at Peru due to an increase in rates and lower cost of purchase power and $7 million of higher earnings combined from both utilities as a result of lower depreciation due to the assets classified as held for sale.","$21 million in lower expense related to foreign currency and inflation effects net of foreign currency hedges in Mexico, and $15 million of higher earnings at Sempra LNG from our marketing operations primarily driven by changes in natural gas prices which was offset by $18 million of lower operational earnings at SDG&E comprised of $27 million of lower CPUC base operating margin in 2019 due to the delay in the 2019 GRC decision while absorbing higher operating costs. Offset by $9 million of higher earnings from electric transmission operations.","And $25 million of higher cost related to increased net interest expense and mandatory convertible preferred stock dividend at parent driven by the Oncor acquisition. Please turn to slide 11. To recap, we continue to execute on our path to premier. Looking forward, our key priorities are executing on our $25 billion five-year base capital plan, optimizing our capital allocation with a focus on strengthening the balance sheet, advancing our LNG development opportunities and engaging with stakeholders in key regulatory and legislative proceedings at our U.S. utilities. We believe our strategic mission and disciplined capital allocation plan should help us reach our operational and financial goals well into the future.","With that, we will conclude the prepared remarks and stop to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from question from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon","Hi, guys, how are you doing?","Jeff Martin","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon","Couple of questions, I think obviously the quarter -- quarterly earnings were significantly better than consensus. And I think that utility analysts no matter how long they have been doing this and have been doing it quite a while often have time -- hard time with the quarterly lease [ph], just given how the regulatory model in California causes things to be extremely lumpy sometimes. In this case, it was the utility income tax benefit that was $66 million positive on the quarter. I know that you put that -- there was also a footnote that was also in your full-year guidance range which you gave on analyst day. But, it's probably not a recurring item even though it's considered an ongoing item. So, how do we bridge to 2020 to the growth guidance that you gave for SDG&E and SoCal Gas? What are sort of not in any specific mathematical terms, but in general terms that sort of replace that and offset it so that you can show growth despite that item being sort of a onetime thing?","Jeff Martin","Well, thanks for that question, Greg. And obviously I think there is a number of big levers in front of us for 2019. And you can probably list a lot of these. But obviously we are quite focused on getting our GRC approved for both SoCal Gas and SDG&E. You will recall that the year one step up in our filed request for SoCal Gas was closed to a 20% step up and a 10% step up in the attrition for SDG&E. And then in the outer years, SDG&E is roughly 5% to 6% ad SoCal Gas is in 6% to 7%. So, the outcome of the GRC is important both for 2019 and 2020. And I will remind you that in the recorded results for Q1, we held there are no additional attrition revenues above what we guided in 2018. So that should lead to some form of understatement for Q1. Second, you will recall that we have got our FERC ROE pending. I think we requested 11.2% at several hundred basis points above where we are currently at.","The expected effective date for that FERC decision independent of when it's going to be ruled upon is the 1st of June, 2019. And then obviously the cost of capital proceeding at the PUC is really, really foundational to what we are trying to accomplish. And in our base plan we have requested a 10.9% number 4 SDG&E. You have followed us enough you will recall in the '08 to 2012 timeframe it was slightly higher than that. I think it was 11.1%. So we think that's adequate, and you did note that we have a 3.4% ADAR [ph] relative to whether the reforms that we are expect in the summer are adequately put in place. The same number for SoCal Gas is a 10.7% ROE. So, in general there is going to some moving pieces in '19. But our ability to execute well around those regulatory initiatives will have a big impact on 2020.","Greg Gordon","Thanks. My second question bit more general. The governor's framework is released by his I think he calls his strike team or strike force contemplate several ideas to solve the wildfire -- destruction of wildfire problem. And one of them is the idea of this catastrophic wildfire fund. And the understanding is that multiple constituencies would be asked to potentially contribute to capitalize that including the state but also including the utilities. And that that would create a buffer between utility balance sheets and potential future wildfire claims such that inverse condemnation would essentially in many ways be immunized and then if you see [indiscernible] later. I mean how do you contemplate that? Is that a viable outcome for you? Because in some ways I think investors look at it say, well, that's a little bit frustrating. From a Sempra-specific perspective since you have best-in-class wild fire safety provisions. You haven't had a fire in 10 years. And yet, you might be asked to contribute some amount as fund, in the long run it might be in the best interest of your shareholders to contemplate that. And on the other hand you have the best-in-class safety record. So can you talk about you are thinking about the evolution of this negotiation and what that might look like?","Jeff Martin","Yes. It's a very thoughtful question. Let me try and do this. I will give you a couple contextual comments first. And then I will talk about some of the levers that could be put in play that will bridge buffer that you referred to. First off, we probably will stop short of forecast and the outcome. But I can say across our management team, we have growing optimism that will get some things done this summer that will be adequate.","First off, I commented on this on the Q4 call, the Governor Newsome [indiscernible] strong leadership. And I think one of the things I try to focus on, Greg, is up and down the state all the right people that you would expect to be at the table are highly engaged which I think is promising. Secondly, you referenced the strike force report. But it does lay out a roadmap for preventing future wildfires in the future. And this is the point you made a comment on SDG&E. We have been a leader in this regard. We have been recognized nationally. So I think that it gives us some credibility to be at the table. And then thirdly, the commission that was established under SD-901, as this report due to legislature on July 1, I think that will be an important thing for all the investor on utilities and investors to track. But there are three key working groups out of that commission now focused on utility cost for coverage standards, wildfire funding mechanisms and insurance supportability.","And the heart of your questions goes to this issue of wildfire funding mechanism. And I would say this first off we think it's a good idea to have this type of fund in place. I think it provides confidence to the market. It protects the utility balance sheet. And just as importantly, it gives people who have incurred damages, Greg, access to liquidity which I think inspires some confidence in the marketplace. But the mechanism by which that funding level is met and the funding level is determined continues to be play. I don't want to speculate too much except to say that I know that the reduction of the subrogation rights of insurers that provide wildfire insurance to consumers is actively under consideration. Also note that there is a variety things in the existing rate making formula in California such as the Department of Water Resources bonds which are rolling off here in the short term.","So, there is going to be some headroom in existing rates relative to how we might raise those dollars. And like you, we have also heard some of the discussions around potential equity contributions. It's probably quite frankly too early to speculate on that, except to say that we are certainly a significantly small fraction of the state in terms of exposure. We have invested $1.5 billion to date in hardening our backcountry, and our vegetation management programs, we spent another $300 billion. So, around fire science, our risk fuel content in the backcountry, it's something like that came to the floor. We certainly think that any contributions from us should recognize the points that you made, which we're in a materially different situation.","Greg Gordon","Thank you, very clear. Have a good morning.","Jeff Martin","Thank you, Greg.","Operator","Our next question will come from Steve Fleishman with Analyst and Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman","Hi, thank you. Excuse me.","Jeff Martin","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Fleishman","Good morning. Turning to Cameron, could you just first of all, clarify that the dates are all first LNG dates, so in terms of actually turning it into earnings producing asset is that like three months after, six months after what is the rough timeline for turning it commercial?","Jeff Martin","Yes, what we usually look for is that she usually four to six weeks after you get first LNG, it gets a substantial completion as well as earnings.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And then I know this isn't an issue by 2021, but just for 2020. How should we think about the delay in terms of your guidance range?","Jeff Martin","Well, I think in my prepared remarks, we talked about the fact that there's really no change. I mean, frankly, you go back to the analyst conference, and we were looking at different contingencies for the year, we build in the expectations of a potential delay like this but 2021 I think, to your point, Steve is still when we expect full run rate earnings. And you recall that at our Investor Day, we raised our expectations around that to $400 million to $450 million.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And then maybe just switching gears on to California wildfire fixes. So all the right people together, et cetera, just do you think it's feasible to get done by this July timeframe? Are you more focused on just by the end of the session? And what will kind of where you keyed off of to kind of say that this will get done?","Jeff Martin","Well, we're actually entertaining some of the key stakeholders in Sacramento here in San Diego later this week actually have a group of senior folks and administration tour in our wildfire science center at SDG&E, which we think is positive. All the right conversations are being ahead, we certainly thank Tony Atkins, who's from San Diego, has a very important role to play in the Senate. The governor's got the right folks on it. Guggenheim is our independent financial advisor. They've been meeting with all the credit rating agencies. In fact, some of the agency has actually been out to Sacramento.","So we think to your original point, all the right folks are at the table, I continue to be very keyed off of this July 1st date, which is the date that the Blue Ribbon Panel is supposed to make the report to the legislature, which I think is important. And then obviously, there has been a commitment to try to get a bill that is comprehensive to the legislature, the middle of July, which I think is a second data point to follow. But look, I go back to the point Steve but this is the fifth largest economy in the world, we have had a premium regulatory climate here for several decades, I think there is growing recognition in all of my conversations, that they understand the value of having A rated balance sheets from the investor on utilities. I think that, we remain optimistic, we'll get something done.","Steve Fleishman","One last quick question just on the GRC, so we did finally get an Edison GRC and I guess some of the issues there were mixed, but I know you filed. Your GRC, I think it was the first one done under the ramp filing mechanism. So I guess the question really is, how should we view the Edison proposed decision as a parameter at all for years?","Jeff Martin","I'll make a couple comments and see if Joe wants to add some, but internally, Steve, the way we've talked about it is, it's apples and oranges, right, so this risk assessment program that we use for our rate case, really went into all the fundamentals of how you rank a hierarchy of risk operationally in your service territory. And then you've got to tie that to expected capital spending, right? To make sure that you end up with a different risk mitigated set of outcomes. And if you look at the backdrop that the commission is reviewing our ramp based GRC, that backdrop is around how we take risk out of the system and move toward more constructive regulation. So I'm not sure how much precedent I would assign to the Edison case that Joe do you want to add anything about how you're thinking about our rate case?","Joe Householder","Sure. Thanks, Jeff. Hi, Steve. I think you have to consider a few things when you think about it. First each rate case filing is very different, they have different assigned commissioners, different staff, different ALJs, we've already talked about the ramp, I don't need to repeat that, but our filing incorporates safety and reliability spending as directed by the PUC a large component of the filing for SDG&E was including additional wildfire mitigation efforts that include accelerating the hardening increase vegetation management above and beyond what we have to do additional fire prevention technology. And if you look at the wildfire mitigation plan that we have, that was just approved, there's little additional capital in there because most of us already incorporated in this GRC ramp request, and if so, kind of the same thing. It's a continuation of integrity management for transmission, distribution, and storage. So we think we have a very thoughtful filing around safety, reliability, and most of all, importantly, affordability for our customers. So we think as Jeff said, they're apples and oranges.","Steve Fleishman","Thank you.","Jeff Martin","Thanks, Steve.","Joe Householder","Thanks","Operator","Next, we'll go to Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, good morning. Can you hear me?","Jeff Martin","Good morning, Julien. You are loud and clear.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. So perhaps just to clarify a couple of things that have already been followed up on here. How do you think about the wildfire mitigation plans and some of the responses and the propositions that came back of late on the LJ side? I suppose, how do you think about translating a wildfire mitigation plan into some form of prudency. And now given the way the things have been developing, how do you think about clarifying that from a legislative perspective? Obviously, this is one Nexus. I'd be curious on your perspectives?","Jeff Martin","Yes, I'll make two comments in that regard and Joe you feel free to come in behind me but you recall that our wildfire mitigation plan was focused on fire hardening vegetation management, increase in our aerial support, so we have a 24-hour capability with the night time flying helicopter. And then, you may recall, Julien, we've got 177 weather stations in the back country, six of those will be retrofitted as part of our plan. And we've asked for an incremental $100 million to $200 million associated with our mitigation plan for 2019. And that augments what Joe covered because there's a fair amount of capital just in our ramp based GRC filing. So as you think about that contextually, then you move over to how you might think about assigned liability. What we're trying to do is move away from some type of discretionary standard, right? So if the goal is to make sure that you're substantially compliant, the whole goal of having this liquidity fund setup is to meet the needs of those people who have incurred losses.","Separate and apart from that, you recall, Julien, that commission always retains discretion regarding penalties. If they think that there should have been a different standard and applied. So what we want to move away from is this idea of a discretionary standard where someone's interpolating, how well you've complied with your established wildfire mitigation plan?","Trevor Mihalik","Yes, let me just add on onto that. Hi, Julien. Look, I think that I'm going to go back up to a different level. We really applaud the work of the governor and his leadership and trying to address this. He clearly recognizes that healthy utility companies are a key component of us providing clean, safe, and reliable energy. And in order to have healthy utility companies, we have to have certainty of recovery, right? We have to, and that includes cost in operating our business and those incurred as a result of the application of inverse if we're operating the normal course. So his strike force is laid out a path for the Blue Ribbon Commission and the California Legislature to achieve that. We think that's the way and as Jeff said, we need the certainty. And if you were to look at our U.S. Supreme Court filing, it goes through all of this, right? we have to have certainty of recovery.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","That's right.","Trevor Mihalik","And you can't have it taken. So I think this is the point we need to make.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Clear. And then just turn it back over very quickly to the McDermott side of the equation. Just curious, are there ongoing negotiations here just to clarify after some of the commentary last week here about the status of the project and not necessarily related to timeline, but just cost and even in that there. Obviously, there is a lot of activity on their side of the equation. How do you think about your leverage in the situation to ensure not just timely completion but also completion on budget as it stands today?","Jeff Martin","Let me take that, Julien, I think look for all of you the most important thing to recognize is this project is days away from beginning to produce LNG and start delivering it to our customers. And Cameron LNG and the EPC contractor have common goals in getting this world class project completed safely and reliable. And I want to kind of remind you all that simple risk managers' project and the imminent startup is very exciting for a few reasons. One, we were very low-cost world-class LNG project that has created substantial value for the shareholders to this high return asset that we have, it's a very high return asset, it's going to begin producing earnings very soon.","Cameron LNG, the business is very strong, we have strong partners, we have strong contracts and that supports our long-term cash flows from this business. So remember we put in our old project, we're going to get like $12 billion of cash flows out of this thing. And there have been ongoing discussions with the contractor over the last year or so. They continue to move things a little to the right. You can see in McDermott's materials that they just have, they're going to end between the two of them about $1 billion to finish this thing. And so they they'd like to get some help but we would like to make sure we get the project done. We want to get it done. We want to get it done as soon as possible. Everybody's focused on it, what we're really excited about is we're starting up right now. And that's about all I can say right now.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Fair enough. Thank you.","Jeff Martin","Thank you, Julien.","Operator","And Christopher Turnure from JPMorgan has our next question.","Christopher Turnure","Good afternoon guys. Just a follow-up on the last question, Joe, is there a way that we can think about kind of your own internal processes for evaluating Cameron timing and cost in construction versus what the contractors are doing there because I think you're being very deliberate in your message that that is what they're forecasting, that's what their latest update points to. Certainly that was your message at the Analyst Day too and that was pretty recently that we had a affirmation of the old schedule versus now?","Joe Householder","Look I think that we when I say we let me talk about Cameron LNG, Cameron LNG is a company, it's owned 50% by Sempra and 15.6% by the other three equity owners who are our customers. Cameron LNG has people on the ground at the site every day as they have since the start of the construction. And they oversee what's going on, their big engineering team looking at the forecast of the schedule. I can tell you that McDermott has since last year when they took over CB&I put a lot of focus and effort on this project and have gotten more deeply into the schedule and the cost over time as you've seen in their announcements.","I think that David Dixon is very intent on getting this project done. He talks to all the partners as well as to Cameron LNG management. We have assessed it. We've had partners, engineers assess it. We've had our owners engineer assess it. We think the schedule is one that seems very reasonable but it's in the hands of the contractor which is Chiyoda and McDermott. So it's up to them to predict the schedule and the cost. We think that what's laid out there. We took that into account when we did our earnings guidance and that's I would say.","Christopher Turnure","Okay, that's helpful color. And then could you just give us a little bit more detail on the LATAM sale process and kind of how that's progressing next milestones to look for and I guess versus a base case what might move that schedule forward or backward?","Jeff Martin","Thank you. The current sales process is being handled by Trevor's our CFO and I'll let Trevor address the next milestone.","Trevor Mihalik","Thanks, Jeff. Yes, we're progressing well on schedule. We've seen robust interest across the board for these businesses and these are great businesses. Interest has been wide ranged from financial investors to sovereign and pension funds. So we're targeting first round bids by the end of the second quarter and then go into the second round and then we're still targeting close sometime around the end of the year.","Christopher Turnure","Okay. And nothing that could move that forward or backward based on what you're seeing right now?","Trevor Mihalik","No, I think we've got a pretty formalized process that we're working through and we're still adhering to the schedule that we laid out.","Christopher Turnure","Okay, great. Thanks, Trevor.","Trevor Mihalik","Yes.","Operator","Our next question will come from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides","Hey, Jeff. Hey, Joe. Thank you for taking my question. Real quick, if you had to peg which moves forward first, is it Cameron expansion so 4 and 5. Is it the Cameron expansions so 4 and 5. Is it the first trains at Port Arthur or is it the small train at Costa Azul and if so what are the next key milestones we ought to watch for?","Jeff Martin","Thank you for that question, Michael, and I'll give some color commentary maybe Joe can add into it, but I think that the one that has the lead advantage currently is we currently have three Heads of agreement at ECA Phase 1 are fully contracted and all three of those are moving toward having SDAs in place. So just in terms of documentation that is further along in terms of being 100% contracted and moving toward more definitive agreement. I would also say that Cameron expansion is something we remain optimistic about. You recall that when Total stepped into RNG's position they made it very clear to their shareholders that one of the attractive aspects of being in the original Cameron partnership was they were committed and interested in seeing the expansion go forward which you may recall is something we were trying to do several years earlier.","So, I think you've got line of sight to the three participants in the expansion and we continue to have a lot of positive work being done there to make sure that the underlying economic support that. And then obviously at Port Arthur, we've got 2 million tons per annum accounted for with our partner from Poland. We're continuing to have a lot of very positive conversations around Port Arthur and we think that is a remarkable site for a number of reasons. So I think in general, one of the things you'll recall that we did was we did a bottoms up strategic review of our LNG business over the last 12 months and came away with a view Michael that not only is it a core business to Sempra and Sempra can continue to add value in terms of balance sheet and expertise, we really raised our ambitions about what we thought we could accomplish. So we're actually feeling quite constructive on all three of those projects.","Michael Lapides","Got it. And then a question on the settlement in Texas, any impact meaning the settlement regarding in for reading Sharyland, any impact of that settlement on the potential accretion dilution that you discussed when first announced?","Jeff Martin","I would say that we've gone back and revisited our underlying economics and we feel equally good about how we underwrote that transaction before maybe 30 or 40 days of slippage in and out of where we expect to close it, we feel great about the transaction frankly. The type of growth that we outlined at the Investor Conference, Michael you recall really had a lot to do with that Sempra in West Texas opportunity and the InfraREIT transaction actually lays into that growth probably even better than we originally thought when we underwrote the deal.","Michael Lapides","Got it, thank you, Jeff, much appreciated.","Jeff Martin","Thank you, Michael.","Operator","Next to go to Ryan Levine from Citi.","Ryan Levine","Hi, given the recent weakness in global LNG [indiscernible], do you anticipate any customers who elect not to nominate or with LNG and Cameron 1 after the commissioning phase is complete. Can you comment on the nomination process now that you're nearing first half?","Jeff Martin","I don't know if we'll go into kind of how we think about nominations Ryan but I think that we do take questions from time to time about whether we see the overall contract and model change and based upon our current conversations in the marketplace, Joe's been on the road, I'm on the road, Carlos Reese. We've got our entire management team been in over to make sure we're talking to the right folks. We still see this as a long-term contract in business and our goal is a first step as we move toward FID is making sure that we have high quality customers contracted for 20 years with very, very strong balance sheets. And remember we're really on the infrastructure side of business, right. So we want to play in exact same role or very similar to what we're doing in Cameron which is a telling model.","Ryan Levine","Okay. And then on ECA with the non-FDA approval received, are there any remaining comments that the company still looking to procure?","Jeff Martin","Yes, you raised a great point, we've got the non-FDA approval to export from the United States to Mexico and then to also export from Mexico abroad as issued by the Department of Energy. We also in this year got our Port Arthur approval from FERC. I'll let Joe comment on what other permits we have in Mexico and whether is there any other we're still pursuing.","Joe Householder","Thanks, Joe. Hey, Ryan. Yes, really the major permit we got earlier about both the large scale and the mid scale site. And then as Jeff just mentioned the non-FDA, what we still need to get and we have applied for and we've done this before is we need our Mexican export permit. So that's underway. The other things are just small local permits around building the site but those come later in the process. But the only one that's more significant is this export from Mexico, we expect no problems with that.","Ryan Levine","Thank you.","Jeff Martin","Thanks, Ryan.","Operator","Our next question will come from Shah Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.","Constantine Lednev","Hi, good morning. It's actually Constantine here for Shah. A lot of the questions have been answered just a couple of kind of housekeeping items. So, on the LNG development projects, now that kind of permitting has been progressing. Can you talk about how you see kind of the ownership structure is going to be similar to Cameron where some of the off-takers might take an equity interest or just how to think about that going forward?","Jeff Martin","Thank you for that question. I think as we went through our strategic review or LNG business over the last six to eight months, we've also been looking as we move toward an FID decision at ECA Phase 1 later this year and hopefully an FID decision around Port Arthur in Q1 of next year. One of the things we're looking at is how we finance these projects and the potential impacts to our balance sheet. But John a great point, as you saw in the Cameron facility Phase 1 Joe articulated this earlier our three partners are each and just over 16% participation. We think it's a great model to align the interests of partners around these large capital projects. And to your point we expect that will be a model, you'll continue to see us replicate going forward. I would say if you went up to a million feet and looked across the portfolio over LNG projects, we'd like to be in that 60% to 70% range of equity ownership in our projects.","Constantine Lednev","Okay. So kind of thinking about it the same way as it's been, another just kind of small housekeeping item. You mentioned kind of the cost of capital application to equity ratio was going to kind of shore up the credit ratings but kind of both from your perspective and I guess what you can reflect from the CPUC, some of the downgrades have come not on the heels of just formulaic kind of metrics but also some of the regulatory and kind of legislative kind of structures around there. So how are you thinking about that kind of going towards credit metrics?","Jeff Martin","Well, I mean we have spent a lot of time with our credit rating agencies and obviously they're very focused on the process. We've described on this call around making sure that the legislative and regulatory model moves back to standard utility practice and procedure rights. You always expect to have your reasonable costs returned plus an additional return on what's on your investments. I think that's what broke as you recall with the misapplication of the inverse combination model is, there has been a leakage of utilities ability to recover all the costs that they've incurred. So I think it's really a multipart effort, you've got to get back to the right regulatory regime that allows for the type of funding mechanisms to meet the liquidity requirements, you've got to get a improvement to the regulatory model and you've got to make sure that your return on equity reflects the risk in the marketplace. Now oftentimes said that your return on equity is intended to be a proxy for the regulatory financial and operator risk that you see in the marketplace and that's why we filed our updated ROE requests as we have.","Constantine Lednev","Okay, so I guess it's fair to say that kind of progress on all fronts is what you're targeting in terms of second line?","Jeff Martin","That's right.","Constantine Lednev","Yes, that answers everything from me. Thanks.","Jeff Martin","Thanks.","Operator","And that does conclude our question-and-answer session today. I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff Martin for closing remarks.","Jeff Martin","I want to thank everyone for taking the time to join us on the call today. I would say as we've had conversations with our management team, we actually have a lot of exciting things that we're working on right now and look forward to seeing many of you on the road in the next couple of months and per custom. If you have any follow-up questions, feel free to contact Faisel and the IR team. Have a great day.","Operator","That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation."],"19125":["Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) Q3 2018 Earnings Call November  7, 2018 12:00 PM ET","Executives","Faisel H.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the program over to Mr. Faisel Khan. Please go ahead, sir.","Faisel H. Khan - Sempra Energy","Good morning and welcome to Sempra Energy's third quarter 2018 earnings call. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section.","Here in San Diego are several members of our management team including Jeff Martin, Chief Executive Officer; Joe Householder, President and Chief Operating Officer; Trevor Mihalik, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Dennis Arriola, Executive Vice President and Group President; Martha Wyrsch, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and Peter Wall, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller.","Before starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis, and that we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our third quarter 2018 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures.","I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, November 7, 2018, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.","With that, please turn to slide 4 and let me hand the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","Thanks, Faisel, and thank you all for joining us today. The third quarter was quite busy for us here at Sempra. We recently held a strategic update call where we discussed the announced InfraREIT and Sharyland transactions, and our renewable sales agreement with ConEd. This quarter's strong financial results add to this positive momentum. And together with this week's LNG announcements, further advances our strategic vision to become North America's premier energy infrastructure company.","Today, we'll be providing more color on the progress we're making related to our disciplined phased approach to our strategic vision. Specifically, we'll be discussing how we're progressing. Cameron Phase 1, advancing our LNG development opportunities through this week's announced Heads of Agreements and memorandum of understanding, high-grading our portfolio and strengthening our balance sheet.","But to be clear, we're committed to maximizing shareholder value through all these activities. We believe this can be achieved through our superior, projected earnings per share and dividend per share growth, coupled with our T&D risk profile. We'll continue to make disciplined investments tied directly to this strategy. I'd like to briefly discuss this construction progress at Cameron. The successful completion of this project remains a top priority. As we have stated all along, we continue to believe all three train will be producing LNG in 2019. We also remain confident in McDermott and Chiyoda's ability to deliver a state-of-the-art facility.","Later in this presentation, Joe will provide some additional details regarding the commissioning of train 1 and other construction activities. In addition, we're working hard to make real progress on our LNG opportunities. Joe just spent two weeks in Asia and Carlos and I were in Europe meeting with our partners and potential customers. We received significant interest and hope to continue building our relationships in those two regions.","Our recently-announced MOU and HOAs are a direct results of those marketing efforts. Please turn to the next slide. I'm pleased to say we continue to make great strides with our vision to become North America's premier energy infrastructure company. An integral component of that vision is our commitment to continue to improve the visibility of our T&D earnings mix, which we are able to do through our recently-announced Texas acquisitions. These transactions require no incremental equity and we expect to fund them with a portion of the proceeds from our announced U.S. solar portfolio sale.","Furthermore, we're continuing to make progress on the sale of our U.S. wind and certain U.S. midstream assets as originally announced in June. We're currently engaged in an active sales process with very strong initial market interest. Lastly, we're continuing to strengthen our balance sheet. We plan to pay down parent debt with the portion of the proceeds from the announced asset sales and the settlements of our common equity forwards.","And with that, I'll hand it off to Joe.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Thanks, Jeff. I'd like to highlight some of the recent projects we've captured that are incremental to our plan. I am particularly pleased with this week's announcements of the MOU with Total and the three HOA agreements for the ECA Phase 1 project. I'll discuss these in more detail in just a moment.","Oncor is now projecting CapEx of approximately $10.5 billion over five years compared to the $8.4 billion over five years that we discussed at our analyst conference. The portion of this growth can be attributed to, number one, interconnecting the Rayburn County Electric Cooperative into ERCOT. Two, building approximately 30 130-kV transmission projects in 2019 and 2020, largely comprised of greenfield and brownfield lines. And third, adding two 345-kV projects in West Texas. They're part of a new transmission loop to support increased load growth in the Permian Basin. IEnova continues to expand its strong position in Mexico. Most recently, it announced the acquisition of a 51% equity interest in the Manzanillo marine terminal project. IEnova will build the terminal, which has a total estimated cost of approximately $200 million. The facility is expected to go into service in late 2020.","IEnova is making great progress in this new terminal business. And also recently announced a capacity agreement with BP for 50% of the Baja Refinados liquids terminal, and capacity agreements with Chevron and Marathon, each for 50% at the Topolobampo liquids terminal. Each of these terminals are now 100% contracted.","IEnova continues to make great progress in diversifying its portfolio and its customer base. I would also like to briefly mention that IEnova's management team has been engaging in collaborative discussions with the incoming administration. We look forward to furthering the goal of developing critical and essential energy infrastructure designed to provide safe, reliable, and lower cost energy for the people of Mexico.","Please turn to the next slide. On top of capturing incremental opportunities, there have been several positive developments at our California utilities. Specifically, we received a very constructive decision relating to the Power Charge Indifference Adjustment or PCIA reform. Announced our commitment to helping the City of San Diego's formation of Community Choice Aggregation or CCA, which we're financially neutral too as were decoupled from commodity sales. View the recently-enacted wildfire legislation as a constructive move in the right direction.","Submitted a project alternative for the San Diego Pipeline Safety & Reliability Project or PSRP with total CapEx estimates that are similar to the PSRP project, and finally, filed for an increase of our FERC return on equity to 11.2%, an increase of approximately 100 basis points over the current 10.05%.","Please turn to the next slide where I'll discuss our LNG business. As we discussed at our analyst conference, we look to create leadership positions in fast-growing addressable markets. Our LNG business fits that profile. There continues to be significant worldwide demand growth for LNG and we're well positioned with five strategically-located opportunities in North America, comprising over 45 million tonnes per annum of long-term projected capacity.","Sempra is committed to growing its LNG business into a world-class organization, and over the past few months, we've made significant progress in realizing this goal, including restructuring our organization to form the North American Infrastructure group to better align our resources and enhance our visibility to execution, making great progress at Cameron, and advancing the four LNG development projects in our queue, and launching a comprehensive global marketing outreach program to further discussions with our potential customers.","These efforts have proven to be effective as illustrated by our execution of the Memorandum of Understanding with Total and execution of the Heads of Agreement with Mistui, Tokyo Gas and Total for ECA Phase 1. These accomplishments speak volumes about our commitment to our LNG business.","Please turn to the next slide. Our MOU with Total is a significant milestone for our LNG business and outlines the potential for Total to contract up to 9 million tonnes per annum of offtake across Cameron LNG Phase 2 and ECA Phases 1 and 2.","Please turn to the next slide. The signing of the three detailed HOA agreements with Mistui, Tokyo Gas and Total for the expected LNG offtake at ECA Phase 1 represents a significant step toward negotiating and executing definitive agreements with these quality counterparties.","Importantly, ECA is the only brownfield LNG opportunity on the West Coast. We believe that ECA provides a great opportunity for our customers to source low-cost U.S. shale gas and provide it to the growing markets in Asia.","Please turn to the next slide and I'll discuss Cameron Phase 1 in greater detail. As Jeff already mentioned, we continue to believe that all three trains at Cameron will be producing LNG in 2019. We also have confidence in McDermott and Chiyoda in meeting the current project schedule.","In fact, for train 1, all major construction activities have been completed to begin the commissioning and start-up process. Importantly, we've commenced the start-up of support systems for the three trains and commenced the refrigerant gas turbine test.","This progress keeps the project on track and the remaining milestones are lined up in fairly rapid succession, namely the initial start-up of train 1 including the introduction of fuel gas into the system as well as commissioning of all three flares, and the production of first LNG from the project in the first quarter of 2019.","Regarding our EPC contract and McDermott's recent announcements, I'd like to remind you that one, the EPC contract is a lump-sum turnkey fixed price agreement with established milestone payments. Two, we reached the settlement agreement with our EPC contractor, which includes Chiyoda and McDermott in December of 2017, which resolved all known and unknown issues through that date. And all Cameron joint venture partners as well as our EPC contractor, McDermott and Chiyoda, are in alignment with our expectations that all three trains are producing LNG in 2019.","Now please turn to slide 11, where I'll turn the call over to Trevor who will review with you the third quarter results.","Trevor Ian Mihalik - Sempra Energy","Thanks, Joe. Earlier this morning, we reported third quarter GAAP earnings of $274 million or $0.99 per share. This compares to third quarter 2017 GAAP earnings of $57 million or $0.22 per share. On an adjusted basis, we reported earnings of $339 million or $1.23 per share. This compares favorably to third quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $265 million or $1.04 per share.","So let's turn to slide 12, where I'll discuss the key drivers impacting our quarterly results. Our adjusted earnings results were primarily driven by the following; $154 million of earnings at the Sempra Texas Utility segment due to the acquisition of our interest in Oncor in March 2018, and $39 million of higher earnings at SDG&E, primarily due to electric transmission operations. This is partially offset by $86 million of higher costs, primarily related to increased interest expense and preferred stock dividends at parent, which includes the impact of the Oncor acquisition financing, and $38 million primarily related to unfavorable impacts from foreign currency and inflation effects, net of foreign currency derivative effects at Sempra Mexico.","In addition, I'd like to point out that this quarter we recorded a one-time non-cash charge of $65 million in equity earnings, reflecting the full impairment of our remaining equity method investment in RBS Sempra Commodities as a result of previously-disclosed ongoing litigation in the UK. Another adverse item impacting this quarter's results is the movement in the Mexican peso. Specifically, during the quarter, we saw the peso strengthen relative to the dollar, which drove the large non-cash FX loss in Mexico. However, subsequent to the end of the quarter, we've seen the peso weaken, which has largely reversed these non-cash losses.","We continue to monitor the movements in the peso relative to our guidance assumptions of a year-end rate of approximately 21 pesos to $1 and its associated impact to our full-year 2018 earnings projections. Based on strong year-to-date operating results, plus our expectations for the remainder of the year, we're reaffirming our full-year 2018 adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $5.30 to $5.80 per share or $2.83 to $3.44 per share on a GAAP basis.","Please turn to the next slide and I'll hand it back over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","Thanks, Trevor. We're pleased with this quarter's financial results and the progress of our plan to-date. However, I'd like to stress that our management team will continue to be focused on delivering our disciplined phased strategy of becoming North America's premier energy infrastructure company. We actually believe this strategy will be strengthened by the work we're undertaking with our full board. Working with the newly-created Business Development Committee, your management team will be focused on five key areas. Number one, conducting a bottoms-up strategic review of each of our businesses; number two, restructuring our corporate center activities to better support each of our businesses; number three, performing a strategic review of our businesses in South America and determining whether it's better to hold and grow partner or divest these assets; number four, completing the renewables and midstream divestitures that we've previously announced; and finally, number five, updating our financial plan to reflect these updates.","With that, we'll conclude our prepared comments and stop to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we'll take our first question from Christopher Turnure with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, everyone. Just on that last set of priorities you mentioned Jeff, could you elaborate on the, I guess, it was the corporate center review in a little bit more detail and kind of what you're thinking there?","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","Good morning, Chris. Thank you for joining our call. Sure. As you think about the divestitures we announced back in June, where we're selling our domestic solar business, domestic wind business and our non-utility natural gas storage businesses, our parent cost \u2013 our parent activities are really intended to reflect how we support all the different businesses that we own. So as you reduce your overall asset base, we need to make sure that we're reducing our parent cost at the same time. So we'll be looking at how we can better leverage technology for repeatable processes. We'll look at resizing our head count, we'll also look at whether some functions that we do at corporate could be better done in the business unit. So, we're realigning our parent cost to make sure that we're better serving our businesses and we're also lowering our cost structure.","Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Over the past several years you've had some movements in asset sales and divestitures as well. To what degree before this time have you focused on cost cuts at the corporate level?","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","Thank you. Remember, going back in the 2015 to 2016 timeframe, we had an enterprise-wide initiative to create more value around our business model and I think across all of our utilities, across our non-utility businesses and parent, we took significant cost out of our business. Some of those initiatives are still ongoing at our utilities in 2018 and 2019, we called it our Fueling our Future initiative. You've heard us talk about in the past.","What we're doing at corporate really is a phase two of that work and this is really intended to make sure that we right-size our cost as we reduce our asset base and our revenues related to the three divestitures that I cited.","Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, that's helpful context. And then my second question is on the LNG announcements from today and I think two days ago. Could you give us a little bit more color on the competitive environment maybe what has changed if anything there over the past three to six months and give us a little bit color too on your decision to articulate a goal of 45 million tonnes per annum?","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","Sure. I actually appreciate that question a lot. I think as the new leadership team got together in May and June and we prepared for the analyst conference, we took the time we went to the World Gas Conference, I was joined by Joe Householder, and Joe, I'd like you to make some comments when I finish too, if you want to add some color and we took the opportunity to say where are we in terms of our competitive advantages geographically with respect to all five of the projects that we're pursuing, we took time to meet with a lot of different customers starting in Washington, D.C. I think we made the decision, Chris that we need to be a little bit more ambitious about what we think we can accomplish. And that was really driven by the customer interest we saw in our projects.","So, I think one of the things that today's announcement from my standpoint, but I think the key takeaways are is that there's a lot of validation in the marketplace that we are very well competitively situated with our terminal down at ECA, as well as the two terminals we have in the Gulf Coast. So we've raised our ambitions and that's why as you think about our strategic goal of being North America's premier energy infrastructure company, we also want to be North America's premier infrastructure company in the LNG space. And that 45 million ton per annum figure was intended to reflect what we think that we can accomplish, and I'll give you a little bit more color in terms of why the Total MOU is so important.","We took the time starting at the World Gas Conference to meet with Patrick Pouyann\u00e9, Joe and I did. And I think when you look at the integrated natural gas space and all the competitors in the marketplace, they are currently the number two publicly-traded LNG player. But I think their ambition from equity gas in the ground through service to customers, and they've circled the goal of having 40 million tonnes per annum in their LNG portfolio by 2020, and then growing that portfolio at a 5% rate well into the future.","What we felt like was that we matched their ambition in a small part of that value chain and namely that was making sure that we could turnkey some infrastructure here in the United States to support exports abroad. And that's why we were so interested in trying to match their ambition across the value chain really in an area where we thought that we had some unique expertise and really well-positioned geographic sites for liquefaction terminals. But, Joe, I appreciate if you will make some comments as well.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Sure. Thanks, Jeff, and hi, Chris. We've been engaged with Total since they made the announcement of buying the LNG business from Engie and I have been talking to them, and then we had the good fortune to meet with them at the World Gas Conference. And then Jeff and I met with them a number of times since, and he mentioned I was just in Asia with some of our LNG team and Faisel was along with us as well. But Jeff was busy with Carlos and others in Paris working on this. So we had a quite busy couple of weeks and a very busy weekend getting these things done.","But I wanted to go to your point about competition. We have great partners and customers at Cameron and Total is now one of them, but also Mitsubishi and Mistui, and we're very pleased that Mistui is able to join us in the ECA project. I want to tell you there was a considerable competition for that project.","We had a lot of people that wanted it and it was a little bit hard to explain to a couple of them that they were not going to be offtakers. We sold the thing out in these HOAs and having Mistui and Tokyo Gas and Total is very exciting for us. But I want you to know the competition was really high there and will continue to be high for the large scale project.","Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's really helpful. So it sounds like you guys are taking a step forward on the level of competition on the supply side here, but that also the demand remains pretty robust in terms of interest from prospective clients.","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","I think that's accurate.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Chris, let me just add on to that because I mentioned and Jeff mentioned, I was in Asia for almost two weeks. The interest for our Port Arthur facility also is very robust. So we met with people in three countries and from the customers to the ministers and we have a lot of interest in all of our projects. And I think it speaks volume to our ability to execute across this frame and we've been talking about it for a while, but now we are in execution mode.","Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Appreciate that Joe. Thanks Jeff.","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","Yes, hi. Thanks. A couple of questions. So first just, Jeff maybe in your strategic initiatives that you mentioned one of the things that I keep having people seem to get confused of is this board committee is called the LNG and Business Development Committee. But then none of these initiatives specifically talk about LNG. So could you just kind of clarify that issue since it seems like really on LNG you're mainly focused on just getting these growth projects done?","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","Yeah, Steve, I appreciate the question and we certainly appreciate you taking the time to come visit us here recently in San Diego. The way I would describe it is, we had an ad hoc committee of the board. Over the last several years it was really focused on meeting and making sure that we were galvanizing particularly the construction leadership from our board around making sure that the Cameron construction process went forward in a very healthy way.","And as we went through resolving our thoughts and discussions with Elliott and folks, what we decided to do was rename that committee really around the business development review process. So that committee really has nothing to do \"with LNG\", it has everything to do with making sure that we take a comprehensive bottoms-up review of our entire business.","There are no sacred cows. You've heard me say that before. If there are opportunities to drive more value to our customers and to our shareholders, that's exactly what you should expect us to do. So, the LNG portion of that title and I think you correctly point this out, is a little bit of a misnomer. It's really a legacy issue for the name of that original ad hoc committee. But this is intended to be a committee of the board that's focused exclusively on working with the management to make sure we look across the entire enterprise at ways that we can unlock value and strategy, will always be owned by our full board. But this is the committee that will iterate the process through February, where we've been making board decisions related to our strategy. And you should expect us to provide a fulsome update in the last week of March of all the five work streams I discussed at our analyst conference.","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","Okay. Great. And then, just on the HOA and MOU and the like, just from a standpoint of pricing and returns, I know you don't have official contracts yet, but just, should we read these as you're seeing sufficient pricing to get the returns you need on these projects? How can we think about that?","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","Steve, it's a great question. Obviously, the MOU \u2013 and we've taken some questions on this before \u2013 is intended to be a statement of aspiration about how we plan to collaborate with Total. That's a company that we hold in high regard. And there's more work to be done there as Joe indicated in his prepared remarks, about how we plan to maximize their participation not only in ECA 1 and 2, but also in Cameron Phase 2.","We typically target low-double-digit unlevered returns on all of our LNG projects. I think Joe and I and others have talked about trying to guide across this portfolio where we're targeting roughly between 60% and 70% equity ownership. So, I think, the most important takeaway as you think about potential returns is the comment that Joe made particularly around ECA 1, Steve. The level of interest in the project was extremely high. We think that bodes well for ECA 2 but that also speaks directly to the point you're asking about is the pricing power and the expectation of how that might impact returns.","But, Joe, if you want to add any other color to Steve's question?","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","I think you answered it, Jeff. I think that getting these HOAs was a significant milestone for us. But there was a lot of competition.","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","Right.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Steve, so I think that answers your question.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then one last question just on Cameron 1-3, you mentioned you feel confident in the construction and schedule. Can you just maybe talk to maybe the other concern that that's out there is just the financial health of your E&C companies and just your protections from that?","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","Yeah, I'll make a couple comments, Steve, and pass it to Joe. But I think that we were thoughtful in the very beginning in terms of how we structure the contract. Joe talked about the lump sum nature of the EPC contract in his prepared remarks. Obviously, Chiyoda and now McDermott are jointly and severally liable to deliver that.","We will not speak obviously to the financial health of those businesses directly, except to say we have a lot of confidence in both companies. Joe in particular has spent a lot of time with David Dickson, who is someone we enjoy spending time with. He certainly has a firm handle on that project. And I think the most important takeaway from our perspective is we continue to think that the project is on track with respect to what we've said in terms of having all three trains producing LNG next year and we don't really have any fundamental change in terms of how we think it's executed.","But Joe, if you want to add some color, it would be helpful.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Yeah, thanks, Jeff. Hi, Steve. I think that the big takeaway is, look, they just confirmed their plan to have all three trains producing LNG next year. And I have confidence in their ability to execute on that schedule. And I think that McDermott has made a number of positive changes in the oversight and management of the job site and at corporate. And we all, including the Cameron LNG team, the partners, we've all spent time with David Dickson and several of his team members over the past several months, the past six months I'd say since they had the merger completed with CBI (sic) [CB&I] (29:38). And they have a very high level of engagement and analysis about what it takes to finish this job. And I've personally met with David a number of times, he's very engaged and he's committed, he's focused. He knows he has a tough job ahead of them and they've accepted that in their merger. But you can see from his comments that he's focused on getting it done. And the contractual payment terms are drawn around ways for them to get cash flow as they hit milestones. So they're encouraged to keep pushing ahead. And the sooner they finish their work the sooner they get paid and the sooner they cut out their indirect and overhead costs.","And I think if you looked at McDermott's announcements recently, they've talked about raising the funds they needed and have liquidity to finish the job on their side. So I feel good about their ability to do it.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Greg Gordon with Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Hey, good afternoon.","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","Hi, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Great list of accomplishments this quarter.","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","Thank you.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","I think you may have just answered the question but I just wanted to be clear on follow up with regard to ECA Phase 1. You obviously own a majority stake in the IEnova, IEnova owns ECA, is it IEnova's intention to retain 100% equity stake in this project or would Mistui, Tokyo Gas, Total all be taking equity stakes in the project itself as well?","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","It's a great question, Greg. You recall that using Cameron as a model, we have roughly a 51% ownership stake in Cameron. And Joe talked about this earlier as well, where we're targeting across this portfolio of 45 million tonnes per annum, owning between a 60% and 70% stake on average across the portfolio. Our approach to Cameron 1 will be targeting probably something that looks very close to a 50-50 equity ownership, for ECA 1 I mean, between IEnova and Sempra. And we're still having ongoing discussions about the level of participation that may or may not occur between the offtakers.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. So IEnova \u2013 if I assume IEnova owns 50%, Sempra Corporation owns 50% because you functionally own a majority of IEnova, you own a proportionately higher direct and indirect stake in the project then, correct?","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","That's correct.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. I just wanted to be clear on that. Thank you.","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","Thank you.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","My second question is with regard to the CapEx increase at TXU and I know in March you'll give a full five-year update on your financing plan. But is it your expectation that sort of the overall corporate balance sheet has the capacity to fund the equity investment needed to grow at that rate at TXU without additional equity issuance at the parent?","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","Greg, I really appreciate that question. I think that I'll start by just telling you how darn excited we are about the Oncor investment, right. You recall about this time last year they were heading into finalizing their rate case and had committed to a minimum capital expenditures over five years of $7.5 billion, and by the time we got to closing earlier this year in March we were able to adjust that CapEx forecast to $8.4 billion.","So we're very pleased now to be able to put a firm number around their five year revised forecast of $10.5 billion. And that obviously does not include the expected CapEx that would come from purchase in InfraREIT as well to extend that franchise.","So I think that the growth that we're seeing is both on the population side and on economic expansion and I certainly believe that we can meet the requirements of this over the next five years without equity issuances.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Fantastic. Take care, guys. See you soon.","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","Thank you, Greg.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead, Julien.","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","Hi, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, Jeff. Congratulations to the whole team on these LNG developments.","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","Thank you very much.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Absolutely. Just following up on some of the last questions \u2013 particularly Steve's, how do you think about the mix with respect to Total's commitment here and just the timeline as well, right? So ECA, and especially the ECA expansion, certainly that had some other considerations on timeline given the import contract. How do you think about juggling these various considerations, especially given the 9 Mtpa committed.","I mean, maybe said differently and more directly, you've got Total involved in the first phase of ECA. How imminent are we looking at an ECA expansion decision here, given what seemed like pretty material volumes, both with respect to the ECA expansion and Cameron 4, 5?","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","Well, as you ask that question, Julien, you can tell it's kind of a high-class problem, right? And we've got a lot of activity going on. I think it's particularly not only in our divestitures, but the acquisition in Texas. It's very important, and one of the things we spend a lot of time on is making sure that we have a very disciplined approach to execution.","So, right out of the box, the most important thing is the careful disciplined delivery of Cameron Phase 1, right? So, all hands on deck to make sure we stick to the timeline of ensuring that we get LNG produced at all three trains in 2019.","Next steps in terms of ECA 1 is to move from these HOAs, which, by the way, have relatively definitive terms that we expect to crystallize into sales and purchase agreements early in the spring, and that will be a critical step, as you look to try to reach FID at the end of2019 on ECA 1. And I think one of the things that Joe and Carlos and the overall marketing team are looking at now is we have a variety of campaigns around not only ECA Phase 2 and the marketing program there but also Port Arthur. So those conversations are underway and that's something that we'll be looking to update you on as we have more details in the coming month.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Maybe to clarify this. How much flexibility does Total have in the initial rate in that you all have committed with them on basically balancing ECA Phase 2 versus, say, Cameron 4, 5?","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","The way I would describe it is if you just look at kind of what Total's announcements have come out, in 2017 they finished the year with roughly 60 million tonnes per annum in their overall LNG portfolio and they've targeted 40 million tonnes per annum publicly by 2020, right? So they have a pretty ambitious program underway. And I think they have long been focused on Cameron expansion even when they did the Engie acquisition they were quite public about their commitment not only to be in that project but also to sponsor the Phase 2 of Cameron.","So I think what you've seen is you've seen them take down 0.8 Mtpa today in the HOA announcement at ECA Phase 1 and you've seen that they've circled an aspiration around a total of nine and it's reasonable to believe that that could be up to 4 million tonnes per annum at Cameron Phase 2 and up to potentially 4 million tonnes per annum at ECA Phase 2.","So there's a lot more work to be done there but I think most importantly we share their ambition, Julien. I think we have a great working relationship at the senior level of both companies. I think the working engagement today around Cameron has been extremely healthy and that's one of the reasons we've got a lot of aspiration for the relationship.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","A quick clarification, if I can, on the Cameron Phase 2, is this to be assumed to be the leading project in the U.S. now relative to Port Arthur and that marketing efforts are going to be focused on this then, just given the greater involvement of Total now?","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","What I'll do is I'll make a comment and I'll pass it to Joe, but I will tell you that it probably remains to be seen. I mean, there are people in the marketplace, Julien, that really want to privilege the competitive advantage of brownfield sites like we have at ECA, and like we have at Cameron. But one of the benefits we have at Port Arthur is we've done a lot of design engineering work going back to over the last several years. We think we have a very low cost project there. It's in a unique location in Beaumont. And I think that we've got an opportunity to do all of these. That's one of the reasons we've really changed our vision, our ambition of what we want to accomplish. So I don't want to make it sound like that we're going to prioritize Cameron Phase 2 over Port Arthur. There is a lot of interest as Joe indicated in both of these projects. And I'll pass it to Joe, if he'll make some comments on that.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Please. Thank you, Jeff. Hey, Julien. Look, they are different customers. So we don't have to prioritize one over the other. Total is very seriously interested in Cameron as are we. And we're working with our other partners evaluating what exactly is the best thing to do there. But that project is really a project where existing equity owners and customers are going to take the offtake from that facility. And now we're approaching a phase in the original construction that we can see. We can see to the end now and we can see when we could start doing something about expansion.","But that one is focused on the existing customer base there. Port Arthur, I can tell you, I've just mentioned this earlier, I think to Chris is, the people that I spoke to in Asia, people that Jeff spoke to in Europe, others in Europe, they're very interested in Port Arthur because Port Arthur can equally go to both Europe and Asia And so, that one is something that I think will attract a lot of attention because of what Jeff talked about in terms of the cost. It's going to be very cost competitive. Cameron's a different situation. And so I wouldn't link those two together in terms of competition.","And one comment about Phase 2 of the ECA project, I think we could probably try to move that forward very fast but we have something which I've talked to you about before which is we have an existing project there that's making $150 million a year. And we don't want to give away that. So we have to balance that. But depending on how fast the offtakers want to take it and what size can be, we'll have to look at that but I would say all three are moving ahead in a very nice way.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Congratulations again. Talk to you soon.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Thanks.","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","Thank you, Julien.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, guys, congrats on a good earnings season. One question...","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","Thank you, Michael.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","...you made the comments about kind of the broader strategic review and then you touched on the Latin American businesses. Can you talk just a little bit more, clarify kind of how you're going through the process of looking at those businesses? How you think about what's core versus maybe non-core to Sempra.","And then and this may be a Trevor question kind of with all the asset sales and some of the other moving parts, what's your tax position? Meaning if you were to sell these at a sizable gain and you've owned them for a long time, how should we think about what it means from a cash tax perspective?","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","So, Michael, I appreciate the question. I think I would harken back to the June analyst conference where we laid out that one slide that talked about how we thought about capital rotation and strategy and it was a very clear three-phase process.","So, this year, we made a decision about how we could high grade the U.S.-based portfolio and focus more on T&D businesses both in utilities and outside the utilities. We talked about Phase 2 would be a deep dive on South America. Phase 2 is a Q1 2019 report. And then we talked about the reasoning why we would revisit IEnova and LNG in Q1 of 2020 because we want to make sure that, number one, Cameron is fully online and we're balancing, making sure that as we go through this capital rotation process we're doing it through the lens of making sure we maintain a strong credit position.","So we have a very disciplined phased approach. This year it's divestitures. Next year, it's the Latin American review or, frankly, it's the South American review not Latin America. And then in 2020, we're going to update you on the IEnova, LNG story. And as you've seen in today's call, IEnova and LNG are greatly intertwined on ECA Phase 1 and ECA Phase 2 and that's why it's a second order analysis.","Now, let me drop down to your specific question on South America. The lens we'll be looking through is just as we described it last June. If there's an opportunity to do something different with those businesses that have traceable benefits to our shareholders, you should expect us to follow that path. Now, this is something we've looked at multiple times historically and particularly the tax lens has been the greatest challenge.","Now, as you know over the last nine months, you've seen a dramatic change in terms of how we reform U.S. taxes. But when we talk about was the change in control of tax provisions both in Peru and Chile that have tend to create a significant amount of leakage in excess of a $1 billion if you do transact down there.","So the lens that Dennis Arriola, who's leading that effort, is reviewing what this is, number one, we're going to put it through the lens of earnings impact and accretion. Taxes will be a consideration as well as credit. And we always try to look at it, Michael, from the lens of, are these businesses more valuable to somebody else. So one of the inherent questions is what might be different this time when you look at it? Well, asset values in South America have certainly traded up, the interest rate environment is a consideration, the change in taxes here in the United States and our NOL position is a consideration. So what our commitment is, is to go back and look at it de novo with a fresh review bottoms-up and if we can create more value in some type of rotational opportunity, we will.","We're going to go through exactly what I said in our prepared remarks. Does it make the most sense to hold and grow those businesses, partner either in South America or at the holding company in the Netherlands or to sell those businesses? So that's the thought process. And then I'll turn to Trevor to see if he'll add anything from an overall tax standpoint.","Trevor Ian Mihalik - Sempra Energy","No, Jeff, I think you covered it pretty well. There is \u2013 even though we have an NOL position in the U.S., as Jeff said, there's local taxes that need to be taken into consideration and the indirect sales rules that also need to be contemplated if there were to be a sale down there. And so, you need to take a look at all of that across the board to determine what the cash tax payment implications are and that's why we try to disclose that at the analyst conference.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it guys. Thanks much appreciated, Jeff, Trevor.","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","Thank you, Michael.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","Hi, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Hey. How you doing?","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","Great. How you doing, Paul?","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","All right. So I think I've been LNG'd-out here. So just back on Oncor, are all these \u2013 are these projects subject to, I mean they sound perfectly legitimate and everything, but just in general, is there any regulatory approval process for them or is it sort of formula driven? Or how do we think about that and how is the cost allocation?","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","Yeah. Thank you for asking that question. You'll recall that in Texas they have a T-cost mechanism which is the mechanism by which you look at use and useful type of projects that you identify. They'll make investments in distribution and transmission. And all of those are reviewed in hindsight at the next rate case. But these are all driven by demand that they are seeing on their system, and I think one of the things that Allen (45:42) and the team are quite proud about is they've never had $1 of disallowance in the history of that company.","So they're quite prudent in terms of how they allocate capital. And I think one of the things you're seeing here is they've got a real focus on not only being the lowest cost provider in the state of Texas today, but they're also making sure that all the capital that they allocate, Paul, is prudently used knowing that at some point in the future, it'll be reviewed as part of a rate case.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Great. And then, there were some rate design concerns that sort of had shown up this summer at San Diego that had caused some concern. And I know you guys were looking to address them and what have you, and I just wondering if you could update us in terms of how you think that's looking in terms of getting that sort of corrected.","And then just also, in terms of the wildfires, one of your utilities is voicing concern \u2013 or one of your neighboring utilities, I'm sorry, is voicing concern about higher risks associated with wildfire and, therefore, planning on asking for a higher return in terms of cost of capital. And I'm just wondering if you guys were thinking of doing the same thing with the upcoming cost of capital proceeding.","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","Hey. Sure I'd be glad to try to address both of those questions. The first of which is on rate design; the second is on the potential impact of cost of capital. I'll see if Joe wants to kind of come behind me with any other comments.","But let's start and talk about rate design. You remember that over the last three to five years, we've had a number of different rate initiatives around rooftop solar and the redesign of the rates around, not just a three-tiered rate schedule, Paul, which is volumetric, but also a super user rate.","And the design of this is that your fixed costs are collected volumetrically. And essentially, as you use more electricity in the San Diego system, much like the rest of the state \u2013 the other utilities have a similar mechanism \u2013 you actually cover a larger portion of the fixed cost for the utility.","I think one of the things we've long advocated for is that whether you're a rooftop solar user, whether you're completely off the grid with some sporadic or intermittent use of the utility, there is a design model where costs are best spread evenly across customers and then a lot of dialogue around a fixed charge.","We have a fixed charge at SoCalGas. I think there's a fixed charge at over 60 different utilities across the state of California. So both SCG&E (48:17), PG&E and San Diego Gas & Electric have long thought that a portion of their fixed costs should be collected that way. But the current rate design has a three-phase approach with the super-user rate and that's something that will continue to be part of the design discussion at the Commission.","Secondly, on cost of capital, I think you've hit a really, really important point which is, it's intended to be a proxy of what we in the market believe is the appropriate return for all stakeholders. So as you look at both the interest rate environment, you look at inherent operating risk in your service territory. As we go into that cost of capital review, we will be approaching that in an April filing which is intended to reflect what we think the appropriate return is for the unique operating characteristics of our own service territories.","Joe, do you want to add any comments to either of those?","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","No. I think you addressed it. Let's see if there's another question.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Well, just I mean, just as a sort of a follow-up there. So should we expect \u2013 I mean, how are you guys thinking about the risk profile? I mean, I know that you guys were relatively unscathed compared to others in the most recent fire seasons, but just in general, we should expect you guys going in and probably expecting a higher? I mean, how should we think about it in terms of your current cost of capital that you guys settled on recently?","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Yeah. Sure. Paul, this is Joe. I'll just add on to it. I mean, we got asked the question a little bit earlier about the FERC ROEs and we certainly asked for 100 basis points additional there which takes into account existing situation with wildfires of course. And the FERC rate base is about $4 billion, a significant part of our rate base. So we will be looking to do the same with the CPUC ROE, taking into account many factors. Interest rates going up, the wildfire exposure. Of course, in our situation, we have spent a significant amount of money over the past 10 years really mitigating a lot of that risk and continue to do that every day.","Our goal is to reduce that risk to the most minimal amount we can. But we have to take into account all those risk premiums. So I think we will be looking forward to making a filing with a higher ROE.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then, just finally with the \u2013 back to the rate design, should we think that next summer, when it comes around the situation, that developed this summer is unlikely to happen again? I mean, with your discussions with the Commission and what have you, that they're sort of open to the idea of changing this, that they're also finding this to be sort of an issue?","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","I'll make a couple of comments. One is, I think there are many stakeholders in the process, Paul, that believe that, from a environmental standpoint, the people that use the most should be burdened the most. And the rate design is intended to make sure that the more electricity you use, the higher amount of fixed cost that you bear. I think what happens in the summer time is it becomes more extreme.","So what people are looking at is ways that you can make sure that you can have a rational rate design where people are paying their fair share for system cost as well as their fair share of electricity cost. And this is not a recent phenomenon. This is an ongoing debate over the last decade. And I think what you should count on is there are many people in the process now that believe that we can move to a more modern design where folks that are incentivized to use rooftop solar are rewarded for that. But at the same time, there's a more common fee associated with people that are connected to the grid.","So I can't promise you that it'll be resolved by next summer. I can say there are a lot of people very engaged in this process. And over the next several years, my instinct is, you'll see an evolution in rate design.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Awesome. Thanks so much, guys.","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","Thank you, Paul.","Operator","And at this time, I will turn the program to Jeff Martin for any closing or further comments.","Jeffrey Walker Martin - Sempra Energy","So let me close by saying that we very much appreciate everyone's participation on today's call.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead, sir.","Richard A. Vaccari","Good morning, and thank you for joining us. This morning, we'll be discussing Sempra Energy's second quarter 2013 financial results. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section. With us today in San Diego are several members of our management team: Debbie Reed, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Snell, President; Joe Householder, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Trevor Mihalik, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer.","Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's 10-K and most recent 10-Q, which will be filed with the SEC later today.","Important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and that we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our second quarter 2013 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures.","I'd also like to note that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, August 6, 2013, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.","With that, please turn to Slide 3, and let me hand it over to Debbie.","Debra L. Reed","Thanks, Rick, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. The second quarter was an important one for Sempra, as we received the final decision in our General Rate Case for SDG&E and SoCalGas. This decision provides us with a sufficient level of revenues to maintain a safe and reliable system for our customers and provides regulatory clarity for the company through our current rate case cycle, which runs through 2015. Additionally, we continue to move forward on many infrastructure projects during the quarter, and I will give updates on some of these projects a little later in the call.","Now let's move to Slide 4. Our consolidated financial performance this quarter was strong, and that performance, coupled with our efforts to control costs within the revenue structure we were granted in our GRC, allows us to remain on track to meet our full year EPS guidance. This guidance of $4.30 to $4.60 per share is updated to exclude a $119 million loss of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station or SONGS. This guidance also includes the 2012 retroactive benefit from the GRC of $77 million. We remain committed to achieving the 6% to 8% long-term compound annual growth projections we laid out at our analyst conference in May. This growth rate is based off of our 2013 adjusted EPS guidance of $4 to $4.30 per share, which excludes both the 2012 retroactive GRC benefit and the $119 million loss at SONGS.","Annual earnings from SONGS were between $15 million and $20 million, but that has now ceased as of the date Edison decided to retire to facility. Our guidance for the year reflects our view that we will overcome the loss of these earnings through better performance across our business.","Now let me hand things to Joe to discuss the financial results in more detail, starting with Slide 5. Joe?","Joseph A. Householder","Thanks, Debbie. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $245 million or $0.98 per share. This compares to earnings of $62 million or $0.25 per share in the same quarter last year, which included a $179 million impairment charge on our investment in the Rockies Express Pipeline. This quarter, we reported a loss of $119 million related to SoCal Edison's decision to permanently retire SONGS. We estimated this loss using California utility regulatory precedent to determine the expected recovery of SONGS rate base assets, replacement power cost and O&M during the time of the outage. The loss is slightly higher than the top of our previously disclosed range as additional analysis and the most current information was taken into account since the date we filed our 8-K on the topic.","After excluding the SONGS loss, second quarter 2013 earnings for guidance comparison purposes were $364 million or $1.46 per share. As Debbie indicated, our year-to-date performance was strong and allows us to remain on track to meet our guidance of $4.30 to $4.60. Additionally, this quarter's results include $106 million for the retroactive benefits from our final General Rate Case decision. $77 million of this benefit is associated with 2012, and $29 million is associated with the first quarter of 2013. Without those benefits and the loss at SONGS, adjusted earnings for the period were $258 million or $1.04 per share.","Keep in mind that our results for the first half of 2013 include the $63 million planned annual repatriation tax expense, which we recorded in its entirety in the first quarter. Additionally, first half results include the dilutive effect of our highly successful IEnova IPO.","Now let's go through the results for each of our segments in detail, beginning with San Diego Gas & Electric on Slide 6. At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the second quarter of 2013 were $65 million, down from earnings of $95 million in the second quarter of 2012. Excluding the impact of the loss at SONGS and the GRC retroactive benefits for 2012 and Q1 '13 of $69 million, SDG&E's adjusted earnings grew to $115 million.","The increase was due to $15 million of higher CPUC and FERC margin and to an $11 million reduction in 2013 income taxes. This reduction resulted primarily from the change we made last year in the tax treatment of certain transmission and distribution repair expenditures, an increase spending on self-developed software. These increases were partially offset by $4 million of lower revenue from our cost of capital decision and $2 million of lower earnings due to the loss of SONGS rate base margin as a result of the closure.","Now please turn to Slide 7. Second quarter 2013 earnings at Southern California Gas were $118 million compared to earnings of $53 million last year. Excluding the GRC retroactive benefits for 2012 and Q1 '13 of $37 million, adjusted earnings at SoCalGas in Q2 '13 grew to $81 million. The improvement in earnings was driven by $15 million of increased income tax benefits in 2013, primarily as a result of a change in repair expenditures for natural gas pipelines similar to the one I just described for SDG&E and by $9 million of higher CPUC-based margin due to the final GRC decision. This quarter's results also benefited from $4 million positive variance due to the full recovery of transmission integrity management program costs in 2013, which were not balanced in the 2012 revenues.","Now let's move to Sempra International on Slide 8. At our South American Utilities, earnings were $34 million in the second quarter of 2013 compared to earnings of $38 million in the same period of 2012. The decrease was due to a loss related to the sale of our investment in 2 Argentine natural gas utility holding companies. In June, we completed our exit from Argentina through the sale of our investments in that country for $13 million. As we discussed last quarter, the completion of this sale will produce a tax refund of approximately $80 million, which we expect to receive in the first half of 2014. This tax benefit was previously recognized in earnings in prior years.","Second quarter 2013 earnings for the Sempra Mexico segment were $26 million versus earnings of $47 million in the second quarter of last year. The decrease is due to $10 million of lower tax benefits in 2013 versus 2012. These are largely related to currency and inflation adjustments; also $8 million from noncontrolling interest at IEnova related to our reduced ownership; and $4 million lower earnings from operations, primarily related to the planned major maintenance that occurred at our gas-fired generation plant in Mexicali.","Now please turn to Slide 9. Moving to Sempra U.S. Gas & Power, the Natural Gas segment earned $9 million in the second quarter of 2013 compared to a loss of $193 million in the year-ago period, which includes last year's $179 million impairment charge on REX. The increase came primarily from improved earnings from LNG and gas storage operations mainly due to changes in natural gas prices this year.","The Renewables segment generated earnings of $15 million in the second quarter of 2013, down from earnings of $24 million in the second quarter of 2012. The decrease is largely driven by deferred tax benefits in 2012 from solar assets placed in service last year. This decrease was partially offset by higher levels of production tax credits from our wind assets, many of which were placed into service in late 2012.","Now let me hand the call back to Debbie.","Debra L. Reed","Thanks, Joe. As you know, in June, Southern California Edison, the majority owner and operator at SONGS, made the decision to shut down the plant. As a result of this decision, SDG&E established a new regulatory asset in the amount of $322 million, which reflects management's assessment of the amount probable but not certain of recovery in rates for SDG&E's investment in SONGS.","Additionally, SDG&E recorded a loss of $119 million after tax due to the plant closure. Due to the outage of SONGS from January 1, 2012 through June 6, 2013, which is the date Edison announced the plant was to close, SDG&E has spent approximately $166 million on replacement power. The CPUC has opened a multi-phased OII to determine the ultimate recovery of the investment in SONGS and the cost incurred since the start of the outage, including the cost of purchasing replacement power. I can assure you that as a minority owner of SONGS, SDG&E will do all it can to protect the interest of its customers and shareholders as these proceedings move forward.","Now please turn to Slide 11. Last quarter, FERC issued an order on SDG&E's transmission rate case filing, which conditionally accepted our filing, including the methodology we used to calculate our requested ROE of 11.3% and approved the 50-basis-point adder for SDG&E's membership in the California ISO. Last week, FERC issued an order making the 11.3% ROE effective September 1, 2013, subject to refund pending an approved settlement or final decision. Settlement discussions with the key parties have already begun.","Since many of you have asked me what happens in a rising interest rate environment, I wanted to remind you that both our utilities have a trigger mechanism, which allows our CPUC-authorized ROEs to be reset if the annual average Moody's A utility bond index rate move 100 basis points above or below the benchmark level, which is currently 4.24%. While interest rates have been rising in recent months, the move has not been significant enough to raise the average rate to a level where a trigger would occur this year. However, if rates continue on a similar trajectory to what we've seen recently, the potential does exist from an upward trigger to occur effective January 1, 2015. If an upward trigger did occur, it would increase our equity return by 1\/2 of the difference between the new monthly average rate and the benchmark rate. Additionally, the authorized cost of debt would be adjusted to reflect the actual cost of debt at that time.","We continue to await a final decision on our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan or PSEP and expect that decision to come out later this year. As you know, we have received authorization to track in a memo account and are currently spending capital and O&M in anticipation of a final decision.","Let's now go on to Slide 12. Moving to our Cameron Liquefaction project, I'm pleased with the progress we are making, and we remain on track to begin operations in the second half of 2017. We currently expect EPC bids back from the 2 consortium bidding on the project this quarter, and we would anticipate selecting a final EPC contractor by the end of the year. Our efforts to secure financing for the project continue to move ahead, and interest in project financing Cameron remains very strong. We expect firm commitments from lenders by the end of the year and anticipate putting 60% to 70% leverage on the project at attractive terms.","We remain confident that the DOE will approve our non-FTA permit in 2013. This is based both on the positive recent comments made by Secretary Moniz concerning LNG export approval and on strong bipartisan support for our project. Given the FERC schedule issued in April of this year, we expect to receive our FERC permit in February of next year, which will put us on schedule to begin construction in the first half of 2014.","Turning to South America. As you recall, last year, a joint venture we formed with SAESA, another Chilean electric utility, was awarded 2 transmission line projects, which are now under construction. In June, this JV was awarded 2 additional 220-kilovolt transmission lines that will extend roughly 70 miles. The total project cost for these 2 new lines is expected to be about $80 million. 50% of which will be Sempra's share. And we expect construction to be completed in 2018.","Let's now move on to Slide 13. At IEnova, we recently signed a contract with PEMEX for the first phase of the Los Ramones pipeline project and expect to begin construction in the fourth quarter of this year. This 48-inch pipeline, which is 70 miles in length and starts at the US-Mexico border is South Texas will be a part of our JV with PEMEX, and the total project costs are expected to be between $450 million and $550 million. This pipeline is expected to commence operations in the second half of next year.","The second phase of Los Ramones is a 450-mile pipeline project, which is estimated to cost roughly $2 billion. The pipeline will begin at the terminus of our Phase 1 project and extend into Central Mexico, bringing gas supply to this region of Mexico for the first time. Bids for the second phase of Los Ramones are due this quarter, and IEnova will most likely submit a bid, potentially with a partner.","We continue to make good progress on our $1 billion Sonora pipeline project, and we have now signed both the construction and pipeline supply agreement. We remain on schedule to begin construction on the pipeline this quarter and expect the first phase to be operational in the second half of next year.","I'm really pleased that our team at Sempra International has been able to execute on these opportunities. We continue to see a number of very strong incremental opportunities in this business unit that will help us grow at or above the 6% to 8% range we laid out at our analyst conference.","So let's now go on Slide 14. While it is unfortunate we had to take the loss at SONGS, I am really pleased that we had such a strong quarter otherwise. We continue to execute on our strategy and deliver solid performance for our shareholders. We remain on track to meet our earnings guidance for the year, and we continue to have very compelling long-term growth prospects.","And with that, let me stop and take any questions that you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Faisel Khan, Citigroup.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. There's an recent sort of news about the potential to change the foreign tax rate for repatriation of overseas earnings. Just wondering if you can just remind us if we're going to move to more of a quasi-territorial system as what might be outlined in some of these tax trade publications? What will be the earnings impact or benefit to you guys? And then I have a follow-up.","Debra L. Reed","Let me first remind you of what we've committed to do under the current tax situation, and then I'll have Joe kind of talk about what's happening in Washington right now and what the impacts might be with that. What we committed to do under our -- under the current tax situation is that we're repatriating about $200 million this year and then about $300 million over the next 5 years back and that we're doing that by using the net operating losses that we have as a result of some of the bonus depreciation we had at the utilities. And so that is the plan that we're working currently. As you know, under the tax laws, they looked at changes that may change the overall corporate tax rate, and with doing that, then we would get a benefit. And I think the number was something around $30 million. But Joe, let me ask you to go into more details.","Joseph A. Householder","Sure. Yes. It sort of depends on where they land here. As Debbie mentioned, if they were to drop the rate such -- to like 28%, something that the President suggested the other day, Debbie's right. Instead of about $60 million a year of expense, we'd have roughly $30 million. But if they were to go to a more territorial system, which we've been advocating, perhaps, they might do something that would have no tax, although they might actually impose some kind of a onetime tax to bring back some of this money that's sitting offshore in many companies. So they might impose sort of a 5% tax or something like they have done previously. And in that case, certainly, it would lower the earnings impact that we have in our plan today. So it would be very beneficial to us.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, understood. And then just you guys ended the quarter with about $1 billion in cash on the books. It looks like you had a number of asset sales, including the IPO of IEnova. What's the plan with the $1 billion in cash? Is it to pay down debt? Or is it -- is that how you're going to reinvest that cash or give it back to shareholders?","Joseph A. Householder","Yes. Faisel, this is Joe. Let me talk about that most of that cash that's sitting on the balance sheet right now is either in Mexico or in Chile. As we've talked about before, we are not repatriating any of the funds from Chile because we would have an incremental Chilean tax, and we're looking for investment opportunities for that sum, which is around $300 million. The other $500 million about is sitting in Mexico, and that's money that was raised in the IPO and is going to fund the Sonora pipeline project.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Naaz Khumawala with Wolfe Research.","Naaz Khumawala - Wolfe Research, LLC","Just had a couple of quick questions for you guys. First of all, if you exclude Argentina from South America, can you discuss how Chile and Peru are doing year-over-year?","Debra L. Reed","Yes. If you take Argentina out, Chile and Peru are right on track to what we would be anticipating and kind of what we laid out for you at May at the Analyst Meeting. We're having good performance from both of those companies. The growth rates are very positive, and the ranges that we've talked about before, we're seeing customer growth of 2% to 3.5% and load growth of 5% to 6% in both of those utilities.","Naaz Khumawala - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay, great. And then for SONGS, what's the ongoing impact to earnings from pulling SONGS at a rate base?","Debra L. Reed","The ongoing impact, what -- well, what I can say is what, historically, we've had is about $15 million to $20 million a year of net income from SONGS. And as I mentioned in my comments, certainly, for this year through looking at cost efficiencies and in some of the improvements in our operations due to advancements of technology that we're deploying and all, we feel that we can offset that for this year. And so we were able to include that in our updated earnings guidance that we would still be in the $4.60 -- $4.30 to $4.60 range, including covering off that loss of SONGS income for this year.","Naaz Khumawala - Wolfe Research, LLC","Right. Now I mean, I appreciate that but just sort of thinking about next year and forever or are they cost efficiencies, stuff that you guys can keep?","Debra L. Reed","Well, we'll look at -- we'll update our guidance as we always do in February. I mean, what we will certainly look at continuing to look for ways that we can improve the operations of our business as we always do and look at some opportunities to offset that. One of the things that hasn't been factored in and will be factoring in when we do our guidance is what is needed to replace SONGS and what that would mean in terms of additional investment. And so all those things we'll be looking at the before we give updated 2014 guidance in February.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Mark Barnett with Morningstar Equity Research.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of just quick questions on some of the international projects. The number, I think, on the Los Ramones looks roughly the same. I was just wondering, with the Chilean project that you won and the announcements that you highlighted, are these projects all already fully included in your planned CapEx as of the Analyst Day?","Debra L. Reed","Yes. The -- on the Analyst Day, we had the Los Ramones Phase 1 that we talked about, and then we had the Chilean first 2 transmission lines in Chile. The second 2, that I mentioned today that we had just bid were not in the capital plan. But as Joe mentioned, we have plenty of cash in Chile to fund those projects.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. And you had mentioned for one of the projects, I believe, Mexico, the second phase, you had mentioned a potential partner. Would that be a domestic partner you'd be looking at or maybe another multinational?","Debra L. Reed","Well, we're still looking at that right now. The bid hasn't even come out. We're looking at -- September time frame is what they've said for the bidding on that. And so we're, of course, pursuing all possible options and looking at how we would want to handle it. We haven't made any decisions.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just last one, I guess, that, as you said, it's a little too early with the bid not out yet, but is there kind of a, would you say, a greater interest in bidding on these projects, maybe a little bit more competition circling the market? Or it's a little bit too early to comment?","Debra L. Reed","Mark, why don't you just talk about that?","Mark A. Snell","Yes, I would say that it -- there's certainly interest in Mexico. I think there's -- the people recognize that there's good growth there and that these are good projects. But I do think that the companies that have historically been successful in Mexico, of which, obviously, we're one of the leaders in, are the ones that are -- continue to be successful. And I think it's just a knowledge of the market and knowing how to get things done there. But it is attracting more international investment, but I think the companies that have been doing business in Mexico for a long time still have some advantage.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a question on Cameron. In the event that the DOE doesn't issue the non-FTA approval until, say, next year, how does that impact the overall timeline and construction of the project?","Debra L. Reed","Well, first of all, we expect that to come this year. And that's -- every indication that we received and most recently a key person that works with Moniz, his energy counselor, Melanie Kenderdine, commented that he had completed his review of the data. He had completed his review of the analysis to ensure that the public interest analysis was done appropriately. And he had affirmed that no further modeling was required. And so we would anticipate having him now completed that we will start seeing these projects roll forward. It's not on a critical path for us yet because the FERC permit comes after our expectations on the non-FTA. And so as long as we have both of our permits in the first quarter of next year, then we're pretty much on path.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And in terms of the incremental investment opportunities above the 6% to 8% growth that you laid out at the Analyst Day, can you talk you about -- and you talked about Latin America and some of the opportunities there, but where do you stand with the opportunities in California and under, I guess, the shale gas revolution?","Debra L. Reed","Yes, we gave you the slide at the Analyst Meeting, and we broke it down into utilities and midstream and renewables. And just to give you a highlight of some of the things we're working on, as I mentioned in the utilities for San Onofre and what needs to be put in place with San Onofre retiring, there will most likely be some incremental transmission investments that would be necessary but also the gas system because to replace San Onofre is most likely a combination of renewables and natural gas will be necessary and that we will be looking at what type of investments will be necessary in the gas system. And so that is underway. In Latin America, we talked about Los Ramones Phase 2. We're looking at clearly moving forward with -- to the extent that we can on the Santa Teresa Hydro II project. And then we talked about the additional transmission in Chile, and then we'll continue to look at other things there. And then in the U.S. midstream area that we have made a filing to do some laterals on REX, that's a public filing and that we're also looking at the assets adjacent to Cameron, the LA Storage and then the Cameron pipeline and would expect to be developing those assets in the same kind of time frame as Cameron. And then on the Renewables space, we're certainly looking at any additional opportunities there, including if there's some to get -- some potential to get some wind projects done before the clock ticks away and that we no longer have the opportunity for the production tax credit. So those are all kind of underway right now in those areas.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brandon Blossman with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","I guess, actually, following on a little bit on the REX comment on the laterals and I understand there's some sensitivity around this likely. But can you comment just generally REX's future as a bidirectional pipe and then also, how that fits into a drop-down MLP strategy on a go-forward basis?","Debra L. Reed","Yes. Let me just say that this is something that we told you before we were looking at because we saw the flows out of the Marcellus and Utica and needing to get to market. And so this has been something that we've been quite interested in for a while now, and now we're pursuing it with a new partner. So let me have Mark kind of talk a little bit about that.","Mark A. Snell","I think the future of REX, it will, over time, start to look a giant header system for the Midcon. And it'll take flows from both directions and probably feed into Chicago and other Midcon markets. I think that'll take some time. There are some tariff issues, and you've probably seen the news on some of the issues with existing shippers. All of that has to get worked out. But I think, over time, that's where this asset will go. We probably, as far as the MLP-able, it's obviously an MLP-able asset, but until a lot of these issues are resolved, there would be one that wouldn't drop into an MLP right away until we kind of had some long-term predictable cash flows out of it. But we have -- the good news is we have plenty of other MLP-able assets that are very strong. And obviously, with the Cameron facility, we'll have very good assets that we can look at developing that kind of infrastructure down the road.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And just to follow on, again, kind of midterm, are there incremental ideas that may be percolating around REX today?","Mark A. Snell","Oh, there are, and we're pursuing them right now. And I think there's likely to be some near-term kind of things coming out of REX that's showing additional revenue possibility.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Faisel Khan with Citigroup.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Figured I'd follow up with a few more questions. On the LNG project, the, I think -- can you just clarify that you're expecting the construction permit in February of '14?","Debra L. Reed","What, we're expecting in February 14 is the FERC permit, which basically allows us -- without the FERC permit, we cannot begin construction, and so that's what we're expecting in the February time frame.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So after that, you guys can start construction. So starting February -- assuming you get the permit in February '14, you'd start construction right away. There's no other permit that's required after that.","Debra L. Reed","Well, yes, there's a few months between when you get the permit and when you can actually begin construction. But assuming that we get the permit in February as we expect, then we would be on our construction schedule that we've laid out to have the first train come on at the end of 2017.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, got it. And just on this project queue that everyone keeps looking out for the -- for all these -- for all the liquefaction projects, it seems like the DOE is going in the project queue order. I mean, are there criteria that the DOE has to look at in order for a project to get the approval? Or is it simply having the application in place? I mean, how do you guys -- what's your opinion on how you see the DOE looking at each application? Is it -- you guys have talked about having to have the FERC application, the process and all those other things. Can you just remind us what the key criteria are to kind of get that FTA?","Debra L. Reed","Sure. The FTA criteria is really that in order not to approve the permit, they have to show that the project is not in the public interest. So there's a presumption that these projects should get approved, and that's an important factor. And there's been nothing that has come out in any of the public studies that have been done, the EIA studies or any of the studies that have been done that have demonstrated that exporting is not in the public interest. And so what we think has happened is after the Freeport project was approved, Moniz stepped into his job. He had made a commitment to go through the data and to go through the determination of public interest that had been published earlier in the NIRA report. And as we understand, he has completed that work now and has affirmed that, that work is accurate and no further studies are necessary. So what really should happen is that these projects should move forward then in the queue because that report showed that the projects are in the public interest and to export LNG. And the projects actually -- the report actually showed that the more LNG you export, the more on the public interest it is. So we would anticipate seeing some projects start going through the queue now that he's completed his affirmation of the data. Mark, do you want to add to that?","Mark A. Snell","I [indiscernible]...","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Sorry, go ahead, Mark.","Mark A. Snell","No, go ahead, Faisel.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I was going to ask is it -- I mean, does it really have to be in order? I mean, is that -- is the DOE committed to reviewing each application in order? And so if they're going to do one application every few months, is that kind of -- does that put you guys on track to get the permit when you want? Or are they going to -- do you think they'll issue permits in kind of batches?","Mark A. Snell","Let me try to answer that. I mean, we're all speculating on what we think the DOE is going to do, and so there's a high degree that we'll be incorrect. I think we all thought, a lot of us and, not just us at Sempra but other companies as well, Dominion and others, all thought that there may be some of this would come out in batches. It seemed reasonable to think that, that was going to happen. In hasn't happened yet. That doesn't mean that it won't happen. It could. But our belief is that even if we stay on the schedule that Moniz has laid out and he does do them one by one under some thoughtful process, we still believe we'll get ours by the end of the year. So I think we're -- we feel comfortable that we're on track to do this. As Debbie said earlier, it's not a -- it's an important permit obviously. We have to get it to secure our financing and all the other things. But as long as we get it this year or very early next year, we're still on track, and it doesn't really -- doesn't change our timing as long as it's within a reasonable time frame.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, understood. And then I was also wondering if you guys had any opinion on the low carbon fuel standard and sort of the carbon prices we're kind of seeing in those forward markets now and if that has any sort of impact to you guys or if that's just a pass-through to the consumer?","Debra L. Reed","Yes, I'll have Mark...","Mark A. Snell","Well, let me tell you from a business perspective that we're looking at. I mean, we have talked a little bit in the past. We are looking at LNG and natural gas as a fuel, and a lot of the low carbon standards, especially in the shipping industry, is things that we're looking at, and we see opportunities there to provide infrastructure to that industry, both shipping and the railroad industry to use natural gas. And so we do -- we think that there's going to be some real benefits and growth opportunities in the future around those kinds of regulation.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And any sort of update on natural gas vehicles and transportation infrastructure for natural gas vehicles? I mean, you guys put a lot of stuff on your website related to this sort of topic and just wondering if something is sort of moving forward at SoCalGas or maybe outside of SoCalGas.","Debra L. Reed","Yes, we've done a lot of work at SoCalGas on the fleet side, and we have a lot of fleets operational now. We also were able to put something in place at SoCalGas, which is a Compression Services Tariff where we can actually serve compressed natural gas directly from our pipeline system. So we're doing those kinds of things. But I think probably the more interesting things are some of the things that we're doing in our U.S. Gas & Power and looking at the potential to develop some market opportunities there. So Mark, you want to?","Mark A. Snell","Yes. No, I just think, just as I said, I mean, I think the opportunities that look to have the best potential to really be significant in the near term, I think are on the commercial side, both on the maritime and railroads and large haul trucking and those kinds of things as opposed to passenger vehicles.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Greg Gordon with ISI.","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","It's actually Jon Cohen calling in for Greg. What is the earliest date that you could lock down financing for Cameron? And is there any way to hedge out your interest rate risk between now and when you close on your construction loans?","Debra L. Reed","Yes. Let me have Joe talk about that because we were just talking about that this morning, and we've done some analysis on the interest rate impact. And also, Joe, do you want to?","Joseph A. Householder","Sure. What we're focused on is getting these commitments later in the year. We want to make sure that we do them in the right time frame so that commitments don't expire before we actually draw down the money. But it's progressing very well. There are more meetings going on all the time. And we're getting strong, very strong indications of interest. So the financing is going along well very well. We will look to do hedging when we have the commitments in place, and we're talking to our partners about that. Interest rates have moved some, but it's pretty modest. The impact is really pretty modest based on the numbers we have in our plan. So we will, in fact, do a significant amount of hedging. The timing will be probably closer to the end of the year or beginning of next year, depending on when we and the partners agree on the structure.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead, sir.","Richard Vaccari","Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today we\u2019ll be discussing Sempra Energy\u2019s First Quarter 2014 Financial Results. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section.","With us today in San Diego are several members of our management team: Debbie Reed, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Snell, President; Joe Householder, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Martha Wyrsch, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and Trevor Mihalik, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer.","Before starting I would like to remind everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company\u2019s most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC.","It\u2019s important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and that we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our first quarter 2014 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures.","I\u2019d also like to note that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, May 2, 2014, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.","With that, please turn to slide 3 and I let me hand the call over to Debbie.","Debra Reed","Thanks, Rick, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Before I get started off I\u2019d like to thank those of you who attended our March Analyst Conference in San Diego and those of you who also participated in the webcast. It was a great opportunity for us to discuss our strategy for achieving a 9% to 11% growth rate and the numerous additional projects in development that could provide upside to our plan.","On today\u2019s call we will discuss our first quarter financial results and provide you with several operational and regulatory updates. Earlier this morning we reported first quarter adjusted earnings of $256 million, or $1.03 per share. Our first quarter earnings were in line with our growth expectations and consistent with our full year of 2014 guidance.","On our Cameron liquefaction project we are happy to announce that FERC completed its environmental review process and published the final environmental impact statement on April 30th. We are now awaiting the final FERC permit which we should receive this summer. This is an important milestone and we expect to be the second U.S. LNG Export Project to begin construction.","Consistent with our 50-50 partnership model for renewables we successfully completed the sale of a 50% interest in our Copper Mountain Solar 3 facility during the quarter. Additionally on April 21st, we announced a partnership agreement for our ESJ wind-generation project in Mexico.","On the California regulatory front SDG&E and Southern California Edison reached an important settlement agreement with key parties that was approved by the CPUC to resolve all outstanding cost issues on the SONGS plant closure. We have also received the proposed decision on our pipeline safety enhancement program. We will provide further details on all of these developments later in the call.","Now let me hand things to Joe to discuss the first quarter results in more detail starting with slide four. Joe?","Joseph Householder","Thank you Debbie. As you mentioned the first quarter financial performance was strong and in line with our growth expectations. We reported first quarter consolidated earnings of $247 million or $0.99 per share. Excluding a $9 million revision to the loss on the SONGS plant closure we reported adjusted earnings of $256 million or $1.03 per share. This compares to earnings of $178 million or $0.72 per share in the same quarter last year.","In comparing first quarter performance year-over-year remember that first quarter earnings in 2013 did not include $29 million of earnings from our California utilities as a result of the general rate case delay. In Feb these earnings were recorded in the second quarter of 2013 after SDG&E and SoCalGas received their rates case decisions.","2013 first quarter earnings were also impacted by several other items including a $44 million gain on the sale of a portion of the Mesquite Power plant. In addition we recorded a $63 million deferred tax expense in the first quarter last year related to the IEnova IPO restructuring.","In the first quarter of 2014 we recorded $12 million of estimated deferred tax expense to reflect only a portion of the planned repatriation for the year. However our estimated annual tax rate includes an expectation that we will record additional deferred tax throughout the year to reflect our plant repatriation for 2014.","Now let me turn to our earnings guidance. First I would note that the impact of the SONGS settlement was not in our original guidance. Still we are reaffirming our 2014 guidance per share at $4.25 to $4.55 including the $9 million or $0.04 per share of SONGS impact. Also last month the President of Chile presented a tax reform proposal to the Congress that would increase the corporate tax rate from 20% to 25% and apply a 10% additional shareholder tax when profits are earned rather than distributed.","The higher proposed taxes are likely to be enacted this year although the final rules have not yet been determined. We expect the proposal would phase in the higher corporate tax rate over a four year period beginning in 2014 and change the shareholder level tax starting in 2017. In the quarter the [innate] tax changes enacted we will record changes to deferred tax liabilities impacted by the change. None of these potential impacts to the proposed Chilean tax reform is in our guidance, as additional details were pending and the timing of enactment is uncertain.","Now please turn to slide five for details on SDG&E. First quarter adjusted earnings for SDG&E were equal to $108 million and excludes a $9 million revision to the loss on the SONGS plant closure that resulted from the settlement agreement. In a year-over-year comparison first quarter 2013 earnings were $17 million lower due to the general rate case delay. In the first quarter of 2014 $4 million in higher CPUC based margin and improved operational performance largely offset $6 million of lower earnings from both the reduced FERC authorized return on equity and the loss to SONGS rate base earnings.","Now please move to SoCalGas on slide six. The SoCalGas first quarter earnings were equal to $78 million. As with SDG&E first quarter 2013 earnings for SoCalGas were $12 million lower due to the rate case delay. First quarter earnings last year were also reduced by $3 million of gas pipeline integrity expenses that were not recovered in rates in the first quarter. Instead those expenses were recovered in the second quarter of 2013 under the rate case decision and all ongoing costs are now fully balanced. In the first quarter of 2014 SoCalGas had $11 million in higher CPUC base margin and improved operational results.","Now let\u2019s move to Sempra International on slide seven. At our South American utilities first quarter earnings were $35 million. In 2013 first quarter earnings were $37 million and included a $7 million impairment charge on our Argentine investments. South America\u2019s first quarter earnings are lower this year primarily due to $5 million of foreign exchange impacts resulting from the movement of currencies quarter-over-quarter.","In addition Chile incurred $2 million of higher interest expense this quarter due to an inflationary impact on the local bond interest rate. As we discussed at our analyst conference, tariffs for South American utilities do adjust for foreign currency and inflation effects overtime. However there is some lag effect.","Moving to Sempra Mexico, first quarter earnings were $42 million versus $31 million in the first quarter of last year. Sempra Mexico\u2019s first quarter earnings increased by $11 million due to a $10 million reduction in income tax expense including effects from foreign currency in 2013. First quarter earnings this year also include $9 million of AFUDC equity earnings from construction of the Sonora gas pipeline offset by $9 million of higher dilution resulting from the reduced ownership following the IEnova IPO that occurred in late March of last year.","Looking forward to the second half of 2014 Sempra International expects to have several large projects coming online that will bolster earnings. These projects include the Sonora and Los Ramones pipelines in Mexico and the Santa Teresa Hydro project in Peru.","Now please turn to slide eight. Moving onto Sempra U.S. gas and power the natural gas segment earned $9 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared with $53 million in the same period last year. The difference in earnings is primarily due to $44 million gain after tax on the sale of a portion of our Mesquite Power Plant in the first quarter of 2013.","First quarter earnings for the renewable segment were $28 million and included $16 million gain associated with the sale of 50% of our Copper Mountain Solar 3 facility to our joint venture partner ConEd. First quarter earnings also include higher deferred income tax benefits primarily due to a $5 million reduction in tax grant benefits in the same period last year as a result of the federal budget sequestration.","With that, let me hand the call back to Debbie to discuss slide nine.","Debra Reed","Thanks Joe. Now we will provide you with an update on some of our major projects. As I mentioned at the outset of this call on April 30th of this year we received the final FERC environmental impact statement on our Cameron LNG project. This is an important milestone and the FERC final order is expected this summer. In March of this year we also signed a lump-sum turnkey construction contract. Along with the progress we are making on financing we are on track to begin construction later this year.","Turning to Sempra Mexico, this week the Mexican Government released its five years national infrastructure plan. The plan calls for investments totaling an estimated $13 billion in natural gas pipeline, $7 billion in power transmission projects and $14 billion in power generation projects including renewable. In the near term PEMEX plans to develop three pipelines to transfer liquids from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean. PEMEX estimates that the total for these pipelines and needed storage and port infrastructure at over $2 billion. They deem guidelines to be published in the second quarter of this year.","At a recent analyst conference we also discussed a number of natural gas pipelines to be awarded in the near term by Mexico\u2019s Electricity Commission. On April 21st the Commission announced five pipelines for which bid offers will be reviewed this summer. The total estimated investment is over $2 billion and three of these pipelines are in or have segments within U.S. territory. Each of the pipelines is expected to be contracted by the Mexican Government under a take-or-pay long term structure. We will watch for further details on the bid process but the segments in Mexico will likely be attractive opportunities for IEnova.","We also view the US segments to be attractive opportunities for our U.S. gas and power business, particularly as they will be long term contracted assets that could blend well with Cameron in an MLP. IEnova also announced on April 21 an agreement to InerGen 50% of our 155 megawatt ESJ wind generation project. InerGen is a global power generation firm with 11 power plants in operation in Europe, Mexico and Australia. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and is consistent with our renewable strategy to deconsolidate and reinvest proceeds in near term growth opportunities.","For U.S. gas and power we recently completed the sale of 50% of our Copper Mountain Solar 3 facility to ConEd recording a $16 million after tax gain. The 250 megawatts facility is currently under construction and half of the facility expected to be completed by the end of this year and the remainder expected to be completed by 2015.","Additionally U.S. Gas & Power agreed to invest in a 50% ownership of ConEd\u2019s California solar portfolio. This 110 megawatt portfolio is comprised of four operating projects that provide power our under long term contracts. Finally we have some really good news with regards to our REX pipeline. This week REX launched a binding open season for 1.2 BCS per day of East to West capacity. REX has already secured binding financial commitments for this capacity at rates of $0.50 per dekatherm for 20 years. If REX receives higher bids in the open season the shippers who have already provided commitments will have the opportunity to match the higher bid.","Also during the first quarter REX concluded a successful binding open season on its Seneca lateral and we have filed with FERC to expand the associated capacity from 200,000 dekatherms per day to 600,000 dekatherms per day. The first portion of this capacity is expected to be in service in the second quarter of this year.","Let\u2019s now turn to the slide 10 for an update on the regulatory proceeding at our California utilities. On the regulatory front our California utilities have seen important progress on two major issues. First, we announced at our analyst conference in March that SDG&E and Southern California Edison had reached a settlement agreement with key parties on the SONGS plant closure. The settlement agreement is subject to CPSC approval and was filed with the commission on April 3rd. If approved the agreement resolves all outstanding cost issues on the plant closure and allows for recovery of replacement power cost, operating and maintenance expenses and our non-steam generator investments among other things.","The resulting financial impact for SDG&E is not materially different from the impairment we recorded in 2013, and we recorded an incremental $9 million after tax loss in the first quarter of this year. Additionally the agreement outlines a sharing mechanism between rate payers and shareholders for any third party recovery.","On April 15th we also received a proposed decision for our natural gas pipeline safety enhancement program or PSEP. The proposed decision finds that SoCalGas and SDG&E presented a reasonable conceptual plan to enhance safety and adopt the basic structure of the plan. In its current form the proposed decision approved a process for cost recovery and balancing account treatment subject to a reasonableness review.","The proposed decision also includes criteria for determining recovery of costs associated with records review and testing of pipeline installed after 1955. Our California utilities are seeking additional clarification on a number of key areas within the proposed decision and plan to file comment to the CPC by the deadline of May 5th.","Now let\u2019s finish by turning to slide 11. In summary I am very pleased with our first quarter results. We are on pace to meet our 2014 earnings guidance and we have several large projects in Mexico and Peru coming online in the second half of the year, in addition to the numerous growth opportunities. At our California utilities we are making headway on significant regulatory matters like farms and PSEP, our Cameron liquefaction project remains on track to begin construction this year and our U.S. Gas & Power business has made important progress on both the REX pipeline and renewable project.","So with that let me stop and take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions). And at this time our first question will come from Matt Tucker from KeyBanc Capital Market.","Matthew Tucker \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Hi good morning and congrats on a nice quarter.","Debra Reed","Thanks Matt.","Matthew Tucker \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","First question on Cameron and now you\u2019ve got the FERC final EIS out there? Any sense as to whether they will take on the full, I think it\u2019s a 90 day window to issue decision? Or are you thinking that it could come sooner than that and I guess is there any role for you all to play at this point in the FERC process or is it just in their hands now?","Debra Reed","Well I\u2019ll give you kind of a high level view but then I\u2019m going to have Mark kind of walk you through the schedule as we see it. The next step as you mentioned is not a precise period of time and generally to get to the next step where FERC issues the order is a 30 to 90 day period. Obviously with all of the issues with the Ukraine and all of the attention on that we would it certainly hope that FERC would look at keeping that period as short as possible and we thought it was a really good sign that there were no delays whatsoever in their issuing the final environmental impact statement. And so that was a positive sign.","I would also say that Secretary Moniz have commented that once FERC acts on it than DOE intends to act very quickly and giving their final approval for the export as well. So I think with all the attention on this we\u2019re hopeful that we\u2019ll be starting to see but there is not a required standard that will see some shorter time period. I\u2019ll have Mark kind of walk you through what we see is the way that it would unfold?","Mark Snell","Yeah I think Debbie pretty much highlight exactly how it\u2019s going to work but we do, as we\u2019ve said we have the final EIS and they could take up to 90 days usually a little shorter than that but it could be that long. We\u2019ll get a FERC and then that has the mandatory 30 day comment period before it really becomes final. But during that period they could issue our initial authorization to construct which would allow us to do some work and get moving on the project. But I think as it stands right now and as we\u2019ve looked at the other projects, the other project that have received the FERC [inaudible] project. We still expect that we begin construction sort of later this year and that will time well with our financing and also meet the expectations that we laid out to you at the analyst conference.","Matthew Tucker \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Thanks a lot that\u2019s helpful. And then on the PSEP program you mentioned that the commission kind of endorsed your, I guess your model or structure for the program. Has your estimate for kind of the amounts of spending changed at all or was that part of the commission\u2019s proposed decision?","Debra Reed","That\u2019s not really part of the commission\u2019s proposed decision. We are going through it and we are looking now what happened in their proposed decision is that they actually laid out the approval for all phases of PSEP, not just the first phase of PSEP. And so what that means in terms of how we do the work and how much work occurs over the 5, 10, 15 year period time we are going through and assessing that right now.","What I would say as we look at the plan that we showed you in March for SoCalGas. We feel that we can certainly be consistent with the plan that we showed you in March of this year.","Matthew Tucker \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Great and then just one last one for Joe. I am sorry I missed when you were discussing what had \u2013 was in the original versus what\u2019s in guidance now if you could just go back over those items that you called out please?","Joseph Householder","Sure. What I said was that the SONGS settlement there revision of $9 million, because of the SONGS settlement that was not in our original guidance. We are reaffirming guidance as the numbers we have that now includes that, so that\u2019s the difference. And then we also said that in guidance was nothing for the Chilean tax reform which has been recently proposed.","Matthew Tucker \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Thanks a lot.","Joseph Householder","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes will come from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research","Yeah, hi.","Debra Reed","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research","Good morning, morning Debbie. So just to first on the REX news, could you maybe I think if I recall this project was not in your plan. Could you give us some sense on maybe how meaningful that would be to plan even if we stayed at the $0.50 and but also did the Seneca expansion as well?","Debra Reed","Yeah, let me just clarify what is in the plan and what would be upside potentially to the plan. So there is really three pieces of REX that we are talking about. We are talking about the first phase of the Seneca lateral which is about 200 a day and then we are talking about the second phase of the Seneca lateral which is an additional 400 a day and they were talking about the east to west flows. And those east-to-west flows have been contracted at 1.2 Bcf a day at a $0.50 per dekatherm rate for 20 days. And that part of the open season, the binding open season if other parties wanted to pay more than that or look at different volumes and that\u2019s the purpose of the open season. But we really have firm contracts for the 1.2 Bcf a day at the $0.50 a dekatherm.","We can\u2019t go through kind of what the investment levels are in each of these phases but I would say that they are not substantial. And so, what I would \u2013 you could and we cannot disclose what the rates are on the Seneca lateral pieces of that. The first phase of the Seneca lateral was in our plan of 200 a day. The second incremented for an additional 400 was not in our plan, nor was the REX east to west flow. So you can kind of do your best to calculate the numbers with what I have given you there and assume not huge levels of capital.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research","And when would you think you will get a rough timeline for an answer on the binding open season?","Debra Reed","I think it\u2019s May, that we are supposed to get that completed. Initial day was May 7th, I think and then they said something about if they may have to make some extension but sometime in May we would expect.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research","Okay, great. And then on the Chilean tax impact issue Joe could you just explain kind of what the process is and whether this is actually going to happen and is it more even would it be meaningful more from impacting your deferred tax balance or more from kind of an ongoing tax or I guess both?","Joseph Householder","Yeah, Steve. That will be helpful. I can elaborate on that. So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks the President presented the tax reform proposal to Congress. She mentioned that she would be looking at doing something like this when she was running and so we expect that probably this or some form of this will get enacted but she wants to raise the current rate from 20% to 25% and we believe that will occur over a four year period. So 1% or 2% a year for a few years.","This would increase our tax in Chile a few million a year in the early years, not so much because it\u2019s not a big change. But the other change that she wants to make has to do with the way that taxes under current law would be paid in addition so that they distribution tax, or withholding tax if you will, a second level tax that brings the rate up to 35% under current law. She wants to maintain the 35% rate but she wants those taxes paid currently even though the funds aren\u2019t distributed out of the country and she wants back beginning around 2017.","We haven\u2019t tried to estimate what the impact on the deferred taxes are yet because it\u2019s a little bit unclear on the second part exactly it\u2019s going to work and when it be enacted but we will tell you on our future call when we know more information about that. But just to be clear she keeping the total rate of 35%, she is changing the structure so it will have some impact on current taxes in the next couple of years and then it could have a little higher impact if this 10% of additional tax gets imposed currently.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research","Okay, get it. And then last question is just on the Mexico bids when are those expected to be I guess decided?","Debra Reed","Sure, I am glad you asked that because there is a lot really exciting things happening at Mexico and the Mexican government actually put out their five year plan that outlines the hundreds of billions of dollars of projects that they plan on several hundreds of billions of dollar just in the energy sector alone. And this year they have identified a number of projects, I think there is about ten or so pipelines that would be bid out this year.","What we seen already the announcement from CFP of the five projects that I mentioned. And we expect those to be, the bid packages to be out within the next couple of months on those. Three of these projects are in U.S., two them are in Mexico and then we have also seen an announcement of bid packages coming out for our three projects from PEMEX over the rest few next couple of months.","And one of those projects is a gas pipeline one is a naphtha pipeline and one is a liquids pipeline or propane pipeline. And so we are seeing a lot of momentum right now in terms of the bids coming out and they have identified more bids, another five or so projects later this year that\u2019s on their schedule that they have identified as being bid out this year. So we think it\u2019s a great opportunities, we are analyzing those right down looking at what is available on the project. So they said they don\u2019t have the bid packages out, so it\u2019s very difficult for us to assess which ones we would bid on. We are certainly into both of those in Mexico and the U.S. project.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research","Great, thank you very much.","Debra Reed","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Hi, good morning.","Debra Reed","Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","So first kind of the big picture strategic question as you think about the various monetizations that you have talked in the past, can you talk about where you are in the gas side of the world. You have obviously had a couple of [emerging] plans out there. And then also on the renewable side how do you think about the future of that business kind of given the [yield co] phenomenon out there et cetera and how that\u2019s procured?","Debra Reed","Yeah, in terms of the power business I think your real \u2013 your question seems to be about the power part of our business which has the renewable and the generation. And on the generation side, in the U.S. we don\u2019t see that as a business that we want to be in and that we are exiting business. We have Mesquite held for sale, we have already sold our other power plants in the U.S. and that\u2019s largely because that doesn\u2019t fit our business model because that business when it was long-term contracted as it was when we had DWR contract then that made a lot of sense but for those assets today you are not get 10-20 year contracts on them.","And that we \u2013 although we do have on a block at Mesquite a long-term contract but it\u2019s very, very competitive. It\u2019s not a focus area for us. So you are going to see us trying to exit that business this year in the U.S. I would say in Mexico we still own the TDM plant and as I mentioned is billions of dollars that are planned in Mexico for electric generation. So, we see an opportunity for that plant to meet some of those needs in Mexico and we\u2019ll hold that plant to enable that either at a long-term contracted arrangement or selling the plant down the line.","In terms of the renewable business that we think it\u2019s a great business. The issue that we certainly always look at is the deferral of our ability to use the tax benefits from that business and it may be a great business. Our question is, is it a great business for us to continue to deploy capital in. We certainly are very focused on building out our solar facilities and if we see good projects on the wind side we are doing those but we are really focused largely on continuing to develop our solar side of the business until the issue on the taxes and what\u2019s going to happen with tax incentive gets a little firmer. I don\u2019t know Mark you want to...?","Mark Snell","The only thing I would add to that is that again those renewable projects do fit our contraction, our contracting mode though which is the long term 20 years contract. They are all contracted for a long period of time. On the wind side, we are kind of, I guess the whole industry is a little bit up in the air. We don\u2019t know where we are going to be with CPUC extensions or not. I think from our perspective since we are not using all the tax credits some phase out of CPUCs or something would be probably be helpful for us.","But I think what we will be doing is deploying capital primarily in our solar projects that are adjacent to some of our existing facilities. We have a fairly competitive pricing point there because we have a lot of infrastructure in place and I think we can win bids and be successful and get the kind of returns that we expect. So I think we are going to stay in that business but again it\u2019s going to be the long term contracted kind of profile that you come to expect from us.","Debra Reed","I would just also add the analyst meeting we talked about our capital allocation and the things that\u2019s been great for Sempra is we have a lot of growth areas. We have a lot of places we can deploy our capital. And so we always look at these businesses in terms of the risk adjusted returns and how it fits for us in comparison to other alternatives that we have and we will continue to do that.","Mark Snell","I would also just add Debbie, we talked about on a few other calls but we\u2019re always interested in way to increase the value and we try to look at whether the stock\u2019s being priced fairly and one of the things we talked about is our contracted energy infrastructure business is effectively a yield co. I was talking to myself this morning and I was thinking maybe we should just change the name to simply yield growth, [inaudible].","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","That\u2019s true. Well perhaps just a second strategic question and maybe this is a change in tack for your prior statements. But how are you thinking about the complementary asset here to backup Cameron, you kind of alluded to it little bit earlier. What exactly could those include just guiding from your comments and the remarks earlier as well as how are you thinking about timeline to get something off on the ground today?","Debra Reed","Well I mean there is a lot of assets that are adjacent to Cameron that we own, like the LA storage, it\u2019s \u2013 that is something that we are looking at now, the potential of development of that. We have the Cameron pipeline, we are going to be \u2013 we have our other storage facilities that we think with all of the change that we\u2019re starting to see and we are seeing now the picking up the pace, hold the gas conversions occurring and then we are starting to see the LNG facilities coming on line over the next coming years. So we think all of those assets integrate well, we think other pipeline assets integrate well and that we think other LNG facilities, we have the Port Arthur property that we think is a very viable facility to develop and then we have train four and five at Cameron that we think are also viable to develop.","So our focus is kind of around that cluster of assets that really kind of support each other and support the change and what\u2019s happening in the gas market.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","So just to follow up to be specific is REX now eligible to be included now that you have some of the contract comfort and then secondarily if it is to be included, do you still think you need other assets to look outside the complement starting, or kick starting in?","Debra Reed","Yeah, we\u2019ve been spending a lot of time on this question, so I will let Mark and Joe answer this and I might summarize at the end.","Mark Snell","Yes. Well, let me \u2013 I\u2019ll just kick in. Clearly we are pleased with the upside potential at REX that we just six months to year ago we didn\u2019t know whether \u2013 where we were going to be with that asset. So obviously given the interest on the east to west shipping and some of the lateral opportunities there clearly is a strong asset there now, that looks like it\u2019s going to have good cash flows for a long time to come. I think and Joe can comment on this but unfortunately we only own 25% of it and therefore there is some regulatory reasons why it is a standalone asset, can\u2019t be an MLP, but it can be in MLP with other types of assets that we own and we certainly have plenty to do that.","I do think we are continuing to look in our MLP-able assets that make sense. And one of the most exciting thing is this pipeline announcements that came out of Mexico, there is several of those pipelines, three of them that are going to be in the U.S. and they are sizeable investment and if we win one or two or so of those they would also be very good assets for the MLP. So we see some real opportunities where we actually have some I think advantages because of our history with the Mexican government and our ability and the fact that we\u2019ve been doing business in the Mexico for a long time. I think we would be looked at as somebody that would have not only the wherewithal to do that but also the experience and I think somebody that will be a trusted partner for PEMEX and for the PFE on those pipelines.","Debra Reed","I would just add that, in terms of the timing of when the government is expecting in this case PFE expecting this pipeline to go into service, one of them is expected to go into service in 2016 the other is in 2017. So they have nice timing relative to our Cameron assets.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Excellent. Thank you for all the details.","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our next question will come from Gabe Moreen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Gabe Moreen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning everyone. Not to stick with everyone\u2019s favorite acronym but related to the answer around the IEnova projects in the U.S portion of those projects. I guess two fold one is it possible to [recap] how much of that $2 billion is actually piped within the U.S. And then the second part of that is in terms of structuring it is that something that CapEx will be undertaken at IEnova even for the U.S. portions and then MLP would acquire it later, or does U.S. Gas and Power just build that section and it eventually goes to an MLP?","Debra Reed","Yeah. Let me tell you about the three U.S. pieces of the project and I\u2019ll have Mark or Joe talk about some of the options for structuring with IEnova. The three pieces the government has estimated as part of the $2 billion that those three pieces end up being, it looks like about $1.2 million of the total. So they are quite large. There is one that $250 million and then the largest of the three is $550 million in the government\u2019s estimate.","Now the government\u2019s estimate kind of seemed low to us from what was published but those are the Mexican government\u2019s estimate for those pipelines, So you can see that there is sizable pipeline and then Joe do you want to\u2026.?","Joseph Householder","Yeah. And so then we wouldn\u2019t have IEnova build the U.S. side of lines we would actually do that in U.S Gas and Power. As Mark mentioned a little bit earlier talking to Julien because we only own 25% of REX to form an MLP we would need some other assets that are slightly larger than the value of REX because there of the [inaudible] investment company rule and so we need some other assets. I am very excited about REX. I said that at the conference and this new announcement is great because it really enables us to look hard at that and I mentioned that we have some other assets related to our LNG plant in Mexico that creates some U.S. income.","Looking at that and then looking to ability to put these pipelines from the CFE bids that are in the U.S and whether we funded from U.S gas and power or whether we use \u2013 of the IPO to fund it we can look into that further but first we have to win those bids but this is a very exciting momentum for us with REX.","Gabe Moreen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. And then thinking I guess on the topic of REX, it\u2019s a two part question. One, clarifying which is to stay the matching ability on bids, does that mean $0.50 goes higher for all shippers, if indeed incremental shippers come in at higher than $0.50 or does that just mean existing shippers have the chance to match on capacity? And then second on the Analyst Day I think there was implied there was a decent amount of hydraulic flexibility around the size of a REX reversal. So I am just curious around the 1.2, I guess given other producer and midstream commentary on the need to get gas out of the Utica and the Marcellus I think imply that the REX reversal may not even be enough, the flexibility to go to an even higher capacity if you get more interest?","Debra Reed","Yeah we had talked about and I\u2019ll have Mark go through the detail of how the open season works. But what we had talked about at the Analyst Conference is that there have been like 5.5Bs of interest in the REX reversal and so there is a high level of interest. What we have in place is 1.2B\u2019s of signed contracts at the $0.50 that they come to base point for the open season. Mark?","Mark Snell","Yeah to answer your question specifically we went out and obviously canvassed potential parties and got commitments for 1.2Bs at $0.50 if somebody comes in and wants additional capacity than the existing holders have the right to match that price so the $0.50 effectively becomes kind of a floor but at the end of the day we kind of expect that to be the price. So there could be a little bit of an uptick but I think for our modeling and stuff we are using $0.50.","And then to the other question yes, we can expand the East-West capacity of REX beyond the 1.2. The question is as you start to expand it further you get into certain additional compression but also you get this pretty quickly to where you have to start doing some looping which gets very expensive and so the question is are we still the most cost effective solution and we\u2019re looking at it and so everyone will certainly study it but I would expect we\u2019re not putting anything in our plans right now for that and we\u2019re just really focused on getting this 1.2 signed up and moving forward on that. And then we\u2019ll look to see if we\u2019re cost effective for the shippers on doing any further expansion, could be that we are but we\u2019re just starting to study that now.","Gabe Moreen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hi guys, congrats on a good quarter. Debbie I wanted to ask I went through the filing, the proposed decision in California and there was some language in there honestly I almost felt like I was reading another utilities language in some of the other PSEP related proceedings going on because but there was language about potential cost that will be borne by the shareholder not the rate payer and pipe record that haven\u2019t been tapped and pipelines that you can\u2019t really prove they\u2019ve been inspected or not is and to be honest I\u2019m not sure I understood a whole lot of it when it came to the Sempra side effect of it.","So could you kind of walk us through your interpretation of what some of those components of the PD means and what the cost implications in kind of the rate payer versus the shareholder implications are?","Debra Reed","Sure I\u2019ll try to do the best I can on that, if you read the decision then you\u2019ll also see that is very hard to interpret and there\u2019s some contradictory elements and we\u2019re going to filing comments on May 5th and trying to get some of that cleaned up. What the decision basically does is it goes back to 1956 and it says that any pipeline that they set they feel that should have been tested from 1956 and beyond where you haven\u2019t tested or you don\u2019t have complete records of testing, that a shareholder should be responsible for the test and the test component of that.","And we think we have some really good evidence that, that was even inconsistent with the policy at that time. In fact we have CPUC policy statements on the record dating back to 1950 where they said that utilities were not required to meet voluntary standards and that they were not going to be funded. So these are things that I think are in contention right now in the decision. If we look at the decision in entirety and you look at the fact that we can expedite some of the other phases that even if we look at the decision as it stands today we think we can be consistent with the plan that we showed you in March. But we do feel like we have a really strong case for getting some of these things modified.","And you will see that, I hope you read our comments on May 6th when we file them and you see that\u2019s the case that we have that shows that really this first time there were standards put in place was in 1961 and SoCalGas and SDG&E had a very, very few miles of pipe that were installed post 1961, that we don\u2019t have complete records on. So I think that\u2019s hopefully that\u2019s where we end up on this. But you\u2019ll see some very strong comments from us.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great, thank you on that, one real quick Joe on Chile and the tax implications, just curious if all of it got implemented tomorrow morning, I know it\u2019s not, I know it\u2019s going to be a long-term multi-year process but how would you think about what the net income or EPS impact would be if all components of the tax change happens in the 2014 timeframe, I\u2019m just trying to quantify what the net income or EPS at risk is here?","Joseph Householder","Yeah we haven\u2019t tried to quantify because there are so many unknowns about how that tax is going to work and what we might be able to do structurally around it. And so we\u2019re kind of just focused on the next year or two is going to have a 1% or 2% increase in the next few years and that\u2019s only a few million. If this additional tax does get enacted we just need to know more about the rule really to try to figure that out. You can make some assumptions with math but we haven\u2019t tried to do that for you.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay and then finally the REX reversal contract when would that actually go into place?","Debra Reed","It would go, well it would become effective, the contract\u2019s effective but the actual line would go into place in June 2015, is the timeframe.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Meaning the reversal and therefore the revenue flow back to REX equity?","Debra Reed","Yeah.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it, thank you Debbie, much appreciated.","Debra Reed","Thanks Michael.","Operator","Thank you and our next question will come from Faisel Khan from Citi.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi","Good afternoon.","Debra Reed","Hi Faisel.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi","Hey guys, on REX just wondering would the binding opportunity you guys had was there \u2013 did you have the solicit any sort of term back capacity so did reverse shippers \u2013 would the existing shippers sort of allowed to turned back to capacity in order to make room to the reversal or do these sort of contracts still stick until they run out at the end of decade?","Debra Reed","Yeah I\u2019m going to turn it to Mark.","Mark Snell","We had a FERC hearing on those issues and we were successful and FERC agreed that in that zone the shippers don\u2019t have any right to those revenues or the ability to do that.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi","Okay, got it. And then just on guidance, was the Copper Mountain sort of gain on sales, is that included in your guidance before and is the sale of the wind assets in Mexico, the 50% interest, is that also, is that gain also been baked into your guidance?","Debra Reed","Yeah on any of the gains or costs like that we would incur entering into these partnerships on renewables are in our guidance to the extent that we can expect them and as you remember last December we talked to you about ESJ that we thought we would be towards the low end of our ranges of that time because ESJ was delayed because it was in our plan for last year. And so ESJ and Copper Mountain 3 were both in our plans for this year. It\u2019s part of our business model where we sell 50% down, a lot of that is recouping the development cost that we already expensed during the course of the time for these projects. So it\u2019s always in our guidance if we know that we\u2019re intending to sell an asset like that.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi","Okay, got it.","Debra Reed","In the renewable \u2013 and I would say, in the renewable space. Like Mesquite is not in our guidance because that is not something that\u2019s a typical business model for us but the turn of these renewable projects is selling off 50%, we always put that in our guidance.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi","Okay understood on SoCalGas the transportation volumes seems to be down pretty in a very large amount of way over last year is there anything associated with that except for just weather or\u2026?","Debra Reed","I would say it\u2019s probably the weather. We\u2019ve had an endless summer in California it\u2019s like 90 degrees here today. So there\u2019s nothing fundamentally different in the business as we see it I think it\u2019s mainly weather.","Mark Snell","Yeah. Residential volumes were down and so Edison\u2019s electric volumes were probably down and the power points were not used as much.","Debra Reed","Yeah. I don\u2019t think anyone had their heater on in California, at least in southern California there has been high C\u2019s and it\u2019s been so warm, yeah.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi","Yeah. Fair enough. On Mexico \u2013 on the Los Ramones and the Sonora pipelines, as those sort of ramp up at the end of this year, what\u2019s going to be the \u2013 I mean how are they going to ramp up, like what\u2019s the \u2013 how much gas are they going to pull from the U.S. as those facilities ramp up? Is it \u2013 is it sort of they are going to hit capacity right away or is it going to be the slow sort of movement in volumes as they get connected to some of these pipelines.","Mark Snell","Well. I think the actual volume of gas flowing probably will ramp up because not all of the infrastructure is in place. But we will get paid. We\u2019ve got a firm capacity arrangement essentially, so we will get paid as if it was running full.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi","Oh, sure I understand. I was just trying to figure out kind of the magnitude of the flow across the border?","Mark Snell","It will be slower at first I don\u2019t \u2013 I can probably get you those numbers if you are interested and get back to you on it. But I just \u2013 I don\u2019t know off the top of my head exactly what the ramp up will be.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi","Okay. Yeah that would be great if we get a chance to do that. And then just on in Mexico too on the ethane pipeline, the LPG terminal in Guadalajara, what\u2019s the sort of plan for that, I mean is there a, is there opportunity to expand that pipeline, is that part of the whole infrastructure de-bottlenecking and expansion plans for Mexico?","Mark Snell","Yeah. It\u2019s not listed as some expansion project in the list that we\u2019ve gotten but there is obviously if we get more petrochemical plants down there and things \u2013 there is an opportunity there. But I think right now it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re not counting on it.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citi","Okay, got it. I appreciate. Thanks for the time guys.","Debra Reed","Thank you, Faisel.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Kit Konolige from BGC Financials.","Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Financials","Good morning.","Debra Reed","Hi, Kit.","Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Financials","Just a very brief question. On SONGS what are you guys anticipating as far as timing on \u2013 hearing from NEIL and on the arbitration with MHI and what would the economics and accounting look like if there is some recovery from one or both of those?","Debra Reed","Okay, well the timing on \u2013 we are supposed to hear something back, at least what NEIL has indicated this summer about their response to the claims that have been made. And then the MHI arbitration is likely to take a couple of years. We won\u2019t even probably be appearing before the arbitrator for a year or something. So that will take some period of time. Under the settlement provision there is a sharing mechanism for third-party recoveries where based upon the amount recovered that the \u2013 get a certain amount and the shareholders get a certain amount. And none of that has been recorded at all. Anything that we would get in that would be upside. We don\u2019t have anything in our plan about any recoveries about, that would be all upside.","Mark Snell","Yeah. The first thing that happens is we recover the legal fees that we had paid out so that would go like earnings because we are already recording those expenses. And then as Debbie said it would be upside it would go to reduce the losses that we took earlier. So we would just have income for the amount that came to us.","Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Financials","Okay. That\u2019s great. And just to kind of clarify in a few sentences maybe, just to go back through how we should view the potential for an MLP, if I can characterize it obviously Cameron would be, I guess the key asset. It sounds as though \u2013 well let me ask you it this way if you were to win one or more of the U.S. pipes in the Mexican bidding would you be able to put the potential asset if you will into an MLP and start an MLP say in 2015, if that \u2013 along with REX say if that were to be when the bids were held?","Debra Reed","There is a lot of what ifs there. But REX is a great asset. As we\u2019ve said that it is not an asset that could stand alone in an MLP. The pipelines we\u2019re going to service in 2016 or 2017 according to the schedule that\u2019s been published by the government. And so when those start if we were to get one or more of those and they were cash flowing in that period of time then that would be something we would definitely look at as a potential bridge strategy consistent with what we told you at the Analyst Meeting, because those assets have the same type of characteristics as Cameron. They will be long-term contracted.","And one of the things we don\u2019t want to do is to form an MLP with assets that don\u2019t have the same kinds of value enhancing characteristics like Cameron that would trade at low yield. So if all of those things happen we would certainly look at it and we would time it based upon how to create the greatest long-term value for our shareholders.","Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Financials","And so is it fair to say that the Mexican bidding would be key to forming an MLP or could there be a bridge strategy with only the Mexico, LNG and REX?","Debra Reed","I mean we will look at \u2013 I would not say Mexico, the Mexican pipelines in the U.S are one way to form a bridge strategy. There are other ways to form bridge strategies and we have a team looking at all MLP-able assets and what it does to the long-term value if we were to acquire, build or buy any of these assets or companies, what it would do in terms of creating long-term value and comparison to standalone MLP with Cameron and that\u2019s the way we\u2019ll look at it. And we will figure out the combination and the timing that gives us the greatest long-term value.","Mark Snell","Yeah. We usually do see the economics are better when we build green field things and buy something. But I think what Debbie just said all the above, we\u2019re looking at all the above.","Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Financials","Okay. Good luck with it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from Mark Barnett from Morningstar Equity Research.","Mark Barnett \u2013 Morningstar Inc.","Hey, good morning everyone. Can you hear me over there?","Debra Reed","Yes, yeah. We can hear you.","Mark Barnett \u2013 Morningstar Inc.","Okay.","Debra Reed","Can you hear us?","Mark Barnett \u2013 Morningstar Inc.","Yes I can thanks. You talked a lot about what\u2019s going this year in Mexico and lot of it is very exciting. Just one more quick question I guess following-up on that discussion. Outside of the bidding rules for the next slate of projects this year, you had mentioned in some past calls that there are some outstanding uncertainties around maybe rule making and some additional reforms that you are still looking forward to. Could you maybe highlight what some of those might be?","Debra Reed","Sure. One of the \u2013 I mentioned earlier that we don\u2019t have anything in our plans in Mexico to do additional electric generation or transmission right now. Those are areas that are opening up and the government has published a list of potential projects to bid on \u2013 those are right in our sweet spot absolutely, those are areas of interest to us that we have not put into any of our plans today. And those are projects that we\u2019re interested in \u2013 they are on the list that the government has published as well to be bid out.","The other area I would say and we\u2019re doing some work now is in the gathering and processing. We have done different types of pipelines in Mexico. We\u2019ve built an ethane pipeline as an example. And so we think that this is a great opportunity area for us is to get into the gathering and processing area in Mexico. And so we\u2019re exploring those opportunities. All of the markets are opening up in those areas. So it\u2019s not just gas pipelines for us, it\u2019s electric transmission electric generation gathering and processing, all of those are great opportunity areas. And I think in the energy sector that there was something like $600 billion of projects identified over the next five years in Mexico. I would see us going after a very large share of that and aggressively going after a very larger share of that.","Mark Barnett \u2013 Morningstar Inc.","All right thanks for that.","Operator","Thank you. At this time we have one question remaining in the queue. (Operator Instructions). We\u2019ll take our next question from Vedula Murti from CDP Capital.","Vedula Murti \u2013 CDP Capital","Good morning out there, good afternoon here, how are you?","Debra Reed","Hi. I will say hi, that\u2019s easy.","Vedula Murti \u2013 CDP Capital","Yeah, that\u2019s fine. To follow up a little bit on your conversation with [Ticon] or whatever. What\u2019s your how you evaluate it when you look at everything, all different permutations that would impact? What\u2019s your opinion about how [inaudible] OGE kind of put their structure together what Davin did with cross tax in term of trying to accelerate things and that type of thing. Is that something that based on what you\u2019ve seen and how the value realization has kind of read through so far something that you grew positively or do you feel like it\u2019s something that can slow is paramount or how should we think about how are you thinking about those specifics?","Debra Reed","Well I will tell you how we are thinking generally I am not going to comment on any other companies or their transactions. But the way that we think about it is we have an exceptional asset with Cameron when that goes online that has natural drop down, we think would trade at a very low yield and would be an amazing MLP. That if we do a bridge strategy we would not wanted to diminish the value of that long term asset or an MLP. But there is a possibility that how something might be structured could increase the value in a bridge strategy.","And if we found assets that we thought would trade as comparable kinds of yield and that they would allow us to have higher splits by doing it earlier we are absolutely not adverse to doing that. But we are not going to just go out and buy something that is going to trade very differently than Cameron would likely trade and diminish the value of a high value asset in the long term and that\u2019s the way we would generally look at it.","Vedula Murti \u2013 CDP Capital","Okay and just to follow up then on that which I completely agree with, given your probably quickly well along into this evaluation, can you characterize how you think the probability is that a bridge strategy that meets your criterion can materialize at least or do you feel like there is something that you see that has a chance to actually meet these criterion which I completely agree with and wouldn\u2019t want to dilute anything. So I am just are you optimistic about that? Or how are you thinking about those?","Debra Reed","I am always optimistic. And I think that there is a lot of infrastructure that\u2019s needed in the U.S. and so there are opportunities for us to look at but I wouldn\u2019t want to handicap it. And the good thing is we have an incredible fall-back position with Cameron and the assets around Cameron. And so I wouldn\u2019t want to handicap that, but I think there is a lot of opportunities happening in the United States right now in terms of infrastructure.","Vedula Murti \u2013 CDP Capital","Okay. Thank you very much.","Debra Reed","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And it appears there are no further questions at this time. Ms. Reed I would like turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Debra Reed","Well thank you all for joining us today on the call. As always our incredible investor relations staff will be there to answer any of the follow-up calls that you have after.

Good day and welcome to the Sempra Energy Second Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead.","Richard A. Vaccari - Sempra Energy","Good morning and welcome to Sempra Energy's second quarter 2016 earnings call. The live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section.","Here in San Diego are several members of our management team: Debbie Reed, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Snell, President; Joe Householder, Chief Financial Officer; Martha Wyrsch, General Counsel; Trevor Mihalik, Chief Accounting Officer; Dennis Arriola, Chief Executive Officer of SoCalGas, and Jeff Martin, Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric.","Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we will be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q.","It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and that we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our second quarter 2016 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures.","I'd also like to note that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, August 4, 2016, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.","We'll keep our prepared remarks shorter than usual today with a focus on the quarterly earnings as we just held our Analyst Conference.","With that, please turn to slide 4. Let me hand the call over to Debbie.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thanks, Rick, and thanks to all of you who were able to make it to our Analyst Conference a few weeks ago. We couldn't have asked for better attendance and enjoy being able to talk to you in person and listen to your feedback. Based on our year-to-date results, I will start by reaffirming our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.60 per share to $5 per share. Joe will review the details of this quarter's results. But first let me take some time to address the strategic goals we have for the Natural Gas business.","We previously disclosed the sale of our interest in REX which negatively impacted our quarterly results. We also expect losses in this segment in 2016 and 2017, which are incorporated into our adjusted guidance. Our decision to sell REX reflects an implementation of our strategy for the Natural Gas business to focus our investments around our anchor LNG assets where we have competitive advantages. Oct\u00e1vio discussed this at our Analyst Conference. We also decided to sell our Southeast utilities and TdM and redeploy the capital on assets that better align with our strategy and provide stronger long-term growth.","I'd like to spend a minute reiterating the value proposition that we believe is top tier among our utility industry peers and that is a result of Sempra's long-term strategy. First, our strategy continues to provide the building blocks for high total shareholder return. Our base plan projections resulted in an approximate 12% adjusted earnings per share compound growth rate through 2020. Second, we plan to grow the dividend 8% to 9% annually. Third, we have a healthy balance sheet with significant projected credit capacity in the latter years of the plan, which gives us several options to return value to our shareholders. Four, our businesses have great development platforms with a long runway of opportunities. Finally, with those development opportunities, we are committed to our strategy of long-term contracted infrastructure and utility earnings, which moderates risk and provides less volatility in varying market environments.","Now, I will turn it over to Joe to review the quarterly financial results. Please turn to slide 5.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Thanks, Debbie. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $16 million or $0.06 per share. We also reported second quarter adjusted earnings of $200 million or $0.79 per share compared to second quarter adjusted earnings in 2015 of $259 million or $1.03 per share.","Quarter-over-quarter, adjusted earnings were impacted by the following items, at U.S. Gas & Power, we had losses of $19 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared with gains of $5 million in the second quarter of 2015, both related to movements of natural gas prices on inventory that we sold forward. We expect the majority of this quarter's losses to reverse by year end, as we sell the natural gas held in inventory. Our goal is to operate this part of the business to lower our economic exposure to commodity price swings. Also at U.S. Gas & Power, we had $8 million of lower equity earnings due to the sale of our interest in REX.","At SoCalGas, we had a $13 million impairment as a result of the CPUC decision related to the North-South pipeline. We are now working on ways to recover all or a portion of these expenses, and more importantly, develop alternative solutions for the reliability needs in Southern California that this pipeline was designed to address.","Last year, SoCalGas had a $13 million retroactive earnings benefit from higher CPUC rate base approved in the second quarter of 2015. You can find the individual financial results for our businesses in the Business Unit Earnings section.","Please turn to the next slide. As Debbie mentioned, we took actions in the first half of this year to continue to align our assets with our long-term strategy. And at our California utilities, we received the final general rate case decision. As a result, we made several after-tax adjustments to arrive at adjusted earnings this quarter.","The significant adjustments are: first, a loss of $123 million for the permanent releases of pipeline capacity that Sempra Natural Gas held with REX and others; second, $80 million in charges as a result of the final GRC decision for the reallocation to rate payers of certain benefits from tax repairs deductions, and third, also related to the GRC decision, earnings benefits of $21 million for the retroactive GRC effect related to the first quarter of 2016.","Additionally, I want to remind you that we expect to report significant gains that will be excluded from adjusted earnings for two transactions when they close, both of which may happen in the third quarter. First, we expect the after-tax gain for the sale of our Southeast utilities to be approximately $70 million.","We also expect to record a significant after-tax gain from the re-measurement of IEnova's investment in the shared joint venture with PEMEX upon its acquisition of PEMEX's interest. Regarding this acquisition, we have made progress recently, and we expect to close this year, subject to regulatory approvals. The transaction was restructured earlier in July, and a new price for the seven assets was finalized at approximately $1.1 billion. The sale by PEMEX will be submitted to the regulators for final approval.","I'd also like to address Aliso Canyon. We have increased the cost estimate to $717 million, and we have begun collecting under the insurance policies and to-date have received approximately $34 million. On July 25, the individual and business plaintiffs filed an updated and consolidated complaint as required under the case management order. In addition, the County of Los Angeles filed a separate complaint against SoCalGas, a primary component of which seeks new safety measures.","Please see our Aliso Canyon status update slide in the appendix, which describes the costs included and excluded from our estimate. And please refer to our 2015 10-K and second quarter 10-Q for more detail on these costs and our insurance coverage.","Finally, as Debbie mentioned, we are reaffirming our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $4.60 per share to $5 per share.","With that, we will conclude our prepared remarks and stop to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Hey, good morning, good afternoon. Hey. So, first question, a little bit more strategic, again, going a little bit back to the Analyst Day commentary. But what's the latest thinking, perhaps, if \u2013 could you elaborate on IEnova and the decision to participate or not to participate both in the sort of an immediate sense and over time, in the equity offerings and maintain your ownership level. Just \u2013 can you elaborate a little bit more on that?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Sure. Let me talk a little bit about, first, the investment opportunities that are there. And we have a lot of things that are coming together now. First of which, we won the Marine pipeline bid in conjunction with TransCanada. And our investment there is about $840 million for that project. And then it appears that the transaction with PEMEX is going to move forward, as we had indicated, and hopefully close by the end of the third quarter, and that's about $1.1 billion.","In addition to that, we're looking at some M&A activity, there are some renewables, the second auction is coming up for bid and we have some projects that we're looking at bidding into that second auction. And so, if you kind of look at all of those, that we have several billion dollars' worth of new projects that we're going to be working on over the next few years that we've already secured and several other billion dollars' worth of other projects between the renewables and then the transmission bids that are going to be coming up that are additional opportunities for us.","And further than that, we're starting to do some things with the assets we have, like we just built a lateral or got an agreement to build a lateral. We have some others under negotiation off the existing pipelines, so we're looking at how we keep taking the assets that we have and growing those assets. So, it's a great opportunity. I was just with Joe and Mark in Mexico City last week. We spent time down there with the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Treasury, the Head of PEMEX, the Head of CFE, Cenagas, and everyone is very enthusiastic about the Mexico infrastructure opportunities. And I will tell you, their view is they're not slowing down because it's critical to what their goal is to have manufacturing in Mexico. So, we're really, really excited about the IEnova opportunities.","Going specific to your question, then. What we're going to do, and I can't tell you what position we're going to take on the equity, but we're going to look at all of that, and we're going to look at all of the capital needs. I think we have a couple of hundred million dollars available in Mexico right now. And so, we're going to have to look at the total capital needs that we would expect over the next year or so and then look at what's the right position for us to be in relative to that. We've told you that we're not repatriating because we wanted to take a position in the equity offering, assuming that the equity offering occurs, and we would expect it to occur. So, there's really not a definitive percentage ownership that we've ascribed to. What we'd love to do is have the pie keep getting bigger. And that we don't have to keep our same position in the pie. We don't have to own 80% of the pie. We'd like the pie to be bigger and own a significant position in that pie.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. But is there kind of a point at which, let's say, Cameron IV does or does not move forward that that would potentially evolve as you think about capital allocation, or do you kind of think about it separately and distinctly as what is the return proposition in Mexico not necessarily what happens with the Cameron?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. We're not looking at \u2013 because we think any of these \u2013 all these projects are really good and they're financeable. So, that I wouldn't say that's the consideration but we have some things going on in Peru right now that are very exciting.","Potentially, we have the projects in Mexico and then we have the Cameron IV. And so, from a capital allocation standpoint, as we've kind of looked at it that we set up IEnova so that we could issue equity through IEnova. We have the opportunity through our Peruvian company to issue equity.","It already has \u2013 it's in the market, and we own like 83% of it. So, if we needed capital for that, we could issue equity in Luz del Sur. And then for Cameron IV, we can issue equity at Sempra for that. So, we have different ways that we can finance these things. And, honestly, if we have great projects that earn significantly above the cost of capital, we have not had an issue in being able to finance them.","Further, we showed you at the Analyst meeting, our balance sheet strengthens over the five-year period of time. And so, we put a plug in of $1.5 billion of stock buyback. We would hope to invest that money in good projects, and I think we're going to be able to do that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And one more clarification on the thought process for IEnova, anything around the FIBRA-E structure in Mexico to think about here? Obviously, that's kind of maturing. And what does that mean for you guys, one way or another? I mean, from your tax position in the country, probably, it doesn't mean much, does it?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Well I'm going to have Joe answer that. We talked a lot about that when we were in Mexico City last week. A lot of the agencies or PEMEX and all have been looking at FIBRA-E for some of their assets. I mean, I think it offers some opportunity for financing. Again, for us, a lot of it is as it was with the MLP, what's the best cost to capital? So, Joe, do you want to...","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Sure. Thanks, Debbie. Hey, Julien. Yeah. We looked at this over a year ago when it first came out, and there were some issues with it, and we worked with the regulators around those. And so, now it's \u2013 I think that's sorted out. But I think it goes back to what Debbie said. What's going to be the best source of capital for us to grow the business? And as she said, we were just down there. It makes us even more excited to own a large part of this business. So, how we decide to fund it with debt and equity, we will take that all into account because these are really great projects, and we really like the growth opportunity there.","As to the FIBRA-E, specifically, we just look at that as one of the options we have to grow the business. PEMEX would love to try to do something, but they'd like to see the market kind of open up, and it just hasn't evolved yet. But we stay very close to it.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thank you, Julien.","Operator","Our next question will come from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Hi, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Hey. How are you? So, looking at where you are for the first half of the year and then understanding that certain things are coming out of the numbers like we won't have REX in the second half, we expect the gas costs to reverse and other puts and takes. Given the line of sight you have right now, do you feel like you're right at the midpoint of the guidance range, a little bit behind, a little bit ahead. Can you give us a sense of how you think you're trending?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","We're not going to pinpoint within the guidance range. That's why we use a range. The things that I think that you mentioned are the things that will take effect over the rest of the year. A few things to consider: usually SDG&E has its best quarter in third quarter, but SoCalGas has its worst quarter because of the way that the revenues are and then has a good quarter in the fourth quarter. So, the earnings are not even throughout the year for the utilities; that the hedged inventory that we talked about should reverse in the second half of the year. We had a North-South impairment at SoCalGas in the quarter of $13 million that hit SoCalGas. That's not something that is repeated again throughout the course of the year.","And then the income tax tracking issue at SoCalGas, that was really going retroactive to the beginning of the year. So, that's not a quarterly issue, that's like...","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Double.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","...double, yeah, what it would be. And then last year to this year, we were looking at putting renewables in service last year, where we had a higher ITC. And now, the ITC levels that we're showing are more normalized. So I mean, we look at the earnings that we have are like half of the earnings that we have in our guidance range, and we would anticipate being in the range. And I'm not going to tell you high or low. We're in the range \u2013 that there's a lot of moving parts. But we feel really good about our business and what we're in this for is truly the long-term. And when we start looking at the great opportunities that we have for the growth in addition to what we've laid out in our five-year plan, we feel really good about our business, and that's what we're really focused on delivering.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","No, that's fair. Okay. Can't hurt \u2013 can't harm me for trying. The second question is a little bit off the beaten path. As you are looking to work on the emissions offset and carbon reduction programs that you're putting in place both in the normal course of business and as a result of the Aliso Canyon incident. how significant are some of these programs for methane emission reductions? What are the big buckets of methane-emission reductions that you're going after? And do any of them actually require capital investment where you might look to put those types of programs into the rate base?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Sure. And some of them certainly do. So, let me \u2013 I'm going to refer this to Dennis because he can address both the Aliso but more specifically the methane reductions. SoCalGas has been actively involved working with DOE on this whole methane-emission issue. And I would say that the one thing that SoCalGas has very, very low relative emission levels to other kinds of pipeline systems or upstream systems. But it's something that we've looked at, and we've looked at what investment would be required to really get it down significantly. So, Dennis?","Dennis V. Arriola - Sempra Energy","Sure. Good morning, Greg. Yeah. Let me start with what we're doing regarding Aliso, and I touched on this at our Analyst Conference. We've already signed some letters of intent with various dairy owners. And our strategy here is it's consistent with what the Air Resources Board, the plan they put out. But our strategy basically is to look at the destruction of methane, and the biggest opportunities in California are with dairies and\/or landfills. So, we're working with some of those owners. We're actually in the process of due diligence on a handful of dairies to see how we can most cost effectively mitigate what resulted from Aliso.","From a systems standpoint, as Debbie said \u2013 and we've obviously worked with the American Gas Association and the other trade groups, SoCalGas's emissions from our system itself are some of the lowest in the country. So, we don't see a huge amount of opportunities to be able to make improvements in rate base. But we're looking at new technologies from a monitoring standpoint, for example, that that could be associated that could help us, that those types of things could be added into a rate base in the future. I think that what we see is \u2013 there's just technologies continuing to evolve, and we're on the leading edge of working with those technology manufacturers and the gas industry. So we're going to look at what we can do to try to grow rate base in a smart way that helps improve our system.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks. So you're really going after the methane emissions from animal waste? That's really the biggest potential offset? That's interesting.","Dennis V. Arriola - Sempra Energy","The biggest potential directly on methane is on dairies. That's correct. And we have quite a few dairies within our service territory especially in the Central Valley, and that's where we're starting to look.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","And there's quite a...","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thank you.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","I would say also a couple of things. We put the estimate of that in the $717 million for all the offset for the emissions from Aliso. The emissions have been measured now, and so we're going after making our commitment, fulfilling our commitment of making those offsets. And it's really quite cost effective. So, that is our focus, and we will fulfill that commitment.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Great. Thank you, guys.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from (23:45) Research Consulting. Please go ahead.","Unknown Speaker","Thank you. I, too, have kind of an off-beat question. By 2020, the rate base of the utilities look like it's going to be about $17 billion, maybe $17.5 billion. Could you give me an estimate on what the non-utility investment total would look like in 2020?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Non-utility investment total.","Unknown Speaker","So, investment base. Like a \u2013 similar to the rate base.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Similar to rate base. Okay. And I have the utility projected rate base \u2013 while Joe looks up the non-utility piece, I have the utility piece. And at SDG&E, we're looking at about $10.4 billion of rate base in 2020, and that's about 6 bps being (24:43) about 4.4 (24:44). And then for SoCalGas, the rate base that we're looking at for 2020 is about $7 billion, and then about $5.1 billion of that is CPUC, and about $1.9 billion of that is more special projects approved by the CPUC that's not part of the rate case.","And then...","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Yeah. (25:04), this is Joe. I think you're asking a question about something that we typically don't give out, but it's probably information that's here, and we can catch up with you on the call after because you're asking about what's the total invested capital outside the utilities, you're not asking what the investments for that year are, correct?","Unknown Speaker","That is correct.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Yeah. We can do it offline. I don't have that information at our fingertips. We don't usually talk about our total invested capital outside. I mean, you can see it on the balance sheet pretty easily. But it's more complex than I think we would take time here with everybody, because we're not...","Unknown Speaker","Agreed. Okay.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","And \u2013 the utility assets are much bigger than their rate base. There's a whole bunch of things that are in there. You got nuclear decommissioning trust and all sorts of things. So, we need to parse it out for you, and it's in the segment tables. So, the information is there, but we could lead you to it.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. And the other question is the non-utility businesses, so natural gas, LNG, pipeline. On a risk basis compared to utility \u2013 let's say, you \u2013 the risk in utility businesses is 100 units. What would you characterize as the risk for all of your other businesses combined?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. I mean, that's a really difficult comparison. What I will tell you is that our strategy is based upon having a portfolio that has similar risk profiles between our utility and our non-utility business, and we do that by doing long-term contracts. And if you look at our non-utility businesses, they're either \u2013 our international businesses are either foreign utilities that have been under a regulatory framework for 30 years, or they are long-term contracted assets like our pipelines. And so, we have 20-year to 25-year contracts on those.","Most of those assets \u2013 honestly, when you look at it, once they go into service, they're more like a bond, because you have a steady stream of earnings coming from those. And the construction risk on those projects is not much different than the construction risk that was on building Sunrise. So, I would say they're very similar and that's our strategy, is to not go into extremely high-risk areas to create the growth but to have our risk profile be quite similar.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Debbie, I'll just add on to that. (27:46) the other thing you could look at is, if you look at the slides that we did at the conference just a few weeks ago and look at slide 7 in my deck, it talks about the investment grade credit ratings at all of our subsidiaries. And these are all highly-rated, mostly A rated, including Cameron and \u2013 while we don't have ratings on all the project financing at the renewables, as Debbie said, they're all contracted long-term with utilities.","Kate and I just spent a good deal of time last summer with all the rating agencies explaining to them why our non-utility businesses were as strong or stronger than our utility businesses because we don't have three-year rate cases or four-year rate cases, we have long-term contracts. And so, they like that very much and they understand our business very well. I think it's very strong.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Just a little bit of question. I want to make sure I understand trajectory of earnings within your 2016 guidance and even for 2017 just across the quarters. It strikes me that when you all have talked about this a little bit that there's going to be some significant movement around kind of what to expect versus a typical or historical year at both of the utilities in third versus fourth quarters going forward.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. I mean, what \u2013 last year was the first year for SoCalGas. We had the new way of accounting for revenue. So, that kind of gives you what percentage of the revenues come out each year. And they're just allocated on that kind of a percentage basis. And so, that should follow suit. And then SDG&E, we've historically reported earnings based upon the same methodology. And so, you can kind of look at what percentage of earnings usually fall within a quarter. So, if you look at last year, those are pretty regularized in terms of how the earnings get allocated by quarter and we can give you the precise percentages for SoCalGas if you want those. I mean, but this quarter, we obviously had a lot of unique things because we had the REX transaction, we had that capacity release, we had the change in the rate case, the rate case decision coming out, the impact of the taxes from the rate case decision. So, there were a lot of things that occurred this quarter.","Next quarter, we're going to have a lot of things occurring as well. And we tried to foresee that and communicate that because we should have a close of Mobile and Wilmut happening some time at least by the end of this year. And then, that we will have, also by the end of this year, most likely the PEMEX transaction closed. And so, both of those will have gains that would be adjusted out of adjusted earnings. Hopefully, once we get through some of that. The other thing we have, we have TdM as an asset held for sale, and depending on the sales process on that. And earlier this year, we took a $26 million hit in terms of deferred taxes for holding that for sale. So, we've had a lot of things because we're really trying to go through and take our asset portfolio and cleanse it of things that we don't think are going to add to our growth in the long term and then reinvest our capital. Hopefully, you'll start seeing more normalized kinds of earnings going forward since we have now pretty much accomplished that plan with the exception of getting some of these things closed. And I don't know if that helps you at all.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","No. That helps a ton.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Real quick. As you think about strategic positioning of existing assets, where does your Gulf Coast-related gas storage facilities fit into this?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. As we look at those, Michael, one of the things that we really have already started seeing as some of the LNG facilities have come online is that those storage assets, we think, will have more value over time. And that we think that really to run an LNG facility, it makes sense to have storage. There was a situation that just happened last week where Cheniere was cut back on their pipeline capacity, and that you cannot cut back an LNG facility like that.","So, what we're looking at, we haven't put any money in terms of developing those yet. We think as the LNG facilities come online in the Gulf that the need for storage adjacent to facilities will become a lot more apparent, and that \u2013 and this is part of our strategy. We're hoping to develop some of the storage facilities and some adjacent pipelines to serve Cameron, other LNG facilities that are in the area, manufacturing that's in the area, and then that Port Arthur when that gets developed.","So, we think that there's going to be a need for more robust infrastructure in that Gulf Region as the LNG comes on.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","When do you expect to economically benefit from higher storage pricing?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Well, we actually \u2013 when we did our work this year, we looked a lot at that, and we used outside firms. And we actually cut some of their forecasts when we did our own projections this year because they're projecting that as the LNG facilities come online that \u2013 and as you get more of the coal-to-gas conversion that you're going to start seeing some storage rate increases occurring. But what we've seen in reality is it's been slower than what their projections have been. So we took at conservative view in our plan. But we are starting to see \u2013 year-to-year, we're starting to see some price movement upward from where we were last year. Not huge amounts, but we are starting to see some upward movement in pricing. So, I think as more load comes on that we'll start seeing better storage rates.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you, Debbie. Thank you, Joe.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Sure.","Operator","Our next question will come from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Hi. Just...","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Hi, Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, Debbie. A question on Aliso. Could you give us an update on your well testing? And what your latest thought is on when maybe some of the first wells could start coming back into operation?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Sure, Steve. I'm going to have Dennis address that because he's right in the middle of that now. So, Dennis?","Dennis V. Arriola - Sempra Energy","Hey, Steve. Yeah. As of right now, we've completed the first series of tests on all 114 wells. And as of this morning, the Division of Gas, Geothermal Resources and Oil (sic) [Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources] (34:47) has approved and reviewed 96 of those wells. So, they have all gone through the process. Out of the 96, we've had an additional 17 wells that have gone through the next series of tests and they've passed and they've been reviewed by DOGGR. So, out of the 114, 17 have been completely cleared by DOGGR. So once DOGGR and the Public Utilities Commission confirm that the entire field has met the requirements of the new law, SB 380, we believe that probably sometime in September, we'll be ready to start injection, subject to their approval, of somewhere between 20 wells and 25 wells. So, that's our best estimate right now. In September, we'll \u2013 later, maybe as early as perhaps later this month, we'll be going back to DOGGR asking for that approval, but they've got to go through a process with public hearings. So, September is our best estimate at this point in time.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yep.","Operator","Our next question will come from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good morning.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Hi, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just really quickly, on the permanent release impairment is there any longer term impact to earnings associated with that? Any benefit from reduced cost or something like that?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Let me have Mark talk about the capacity release. Most of it was tied to the REX transaction.","Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy","Right. Paul, I think to understand your question, I don't think there's any significant reduction in expense going forward tied to that release. It's a pretty small team that was managing it. And also, with respect to the release, there won't be any ongoing P&L impact now that it's done. So, I think the answer to your question is no, there's no really ongoing effect.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","I would just add to that. The decision to do this was largely looking at what the value of that capacity was going to be over time, and it was devaluing in comparison to what we had assumed it was going to be valued at. And we wanted to get that behind us. We had some credit issues on REX that were there. There was some shaky credits in addition and that we just felt it was better to get, when we sold REX, to get all of that behind us and not have a tail risk associated with that pipeline, so.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then, just to follow up on Aliso. So, you guys mentioned the $717 million update and the receivable what have you. But there were some things I guess that that cost estimate excludes. Do we have any sense as to what the neighborhood of those cost estimates that may be excluded are and what the insurance coverage of that is, do you follow me?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","What I am going to say is that, we've included everything that's estimable. And that's the $717 million includes all of the well costs, it includes all the relocation costs, it includes the cost for Blade [Blade Energy Partners] to do the investigation. All of those kinds of costs that are estimable. What's not estimable is what happens on litigation. And we don't know what that would be. I would say, the good thing is that we've paid for relocation. We have offered people to be out of the area. We tried to do things to reduce damages and then further, the Department of Health Services has come out repeatedly and most recently after thorough investigation of the homes and testing and all and said that there were no long-term health effects from this. And so, how that all plays out in litigation, we can't estimate that. But what we tried to do is to put this in a box to the extent possible and ensure that we've managed the risk effectively. And so, we'll go forward with the litigation. But I think from the basis of the estimates that we have over $1 billion of insurance, and that we continue to believe that the \u2013 with what we see, that the insurance coverage is adequate for the damages.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Great. Thanks so much.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Since there are no further questions then, I thank you all for joining us, and I thank you all for being at the Analyst Conference. It was great seeing you in person. And if you have any follow-up questions, please contact our IR team. And have a really wonderful day. Thanks a lot.","Operator","That will conclude today's conference.

Good day and welcome to the Sempra Energy Third Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Rick Vaccari. Please go ahead.","Richard A. Vaccari - Sempra Energy","Welcome to Sempra Energy's third quarter 2015 financial presentation. A webcast to this teleconference and slide presentation is available on our website under the Investors section.","Here in San Diego are several members of our management team: Debbie Reed, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Snell, President; Joe Householder, Chief Financial Officer; Martha Wyrsch, General Counsel; Trevor Mihalik, Chief Accounting Officer; Dennis Arriola, Chief Executive Officer of Southern California Gas; and Jeff Martin, Chief Executive Officer of San Diego Gas & Electric.","Before starting, I would like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements on this call within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q.","It's important to note that all of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and that we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call and to Table A in our third quarter 2015 earnings press release for a reconciliation to GAAP measures.","I'd also like to note that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, November 3, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future.","Please turn to slide 4, and I'll hand the call over to Debbie.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thanks, Rick. During the third quarter, our solid operating and financial performance across the company continued. With strong year-to-date results, we are now raising our 2015 adjusted earnings guidance range to $4.95 per share to $5.15 per share.","In addition, we continue to execute on our five-year base plan and are on track to meet or exceed our approximate 11% adjusted base plan EPS CAGR for 2015 to 2019. Since providing those projections at our March Analyst Conference, we have announced more than $2 billion of investment opportunities that are incremental to our base plan. We have also filed for commission approval of our GRC settlement agreement for SDG&E and SoCalGas. I am very pleased with our progress this year and I'm optimistic as we move into 2016.","Let's begin with an operational update and then Joe will provide more detail on our financial results.","Please turn to slide 5. With regard to our base plan, I would like to first revisit the visibility of our 11% adjusted EPS CAGR. On this slide, we provide key base plan assumption. I will mention just a few points. First, the almost $20 billion of investments included in our five-year base plan reflect projects that were essentially approved, contracted, or under construction as of March 2015. For earnings associated with these projects, we have risk mitigation strategies in place that limit our exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign currency rates, or commodity prices. We provide additional information in the appendix to this presentation.","Second, our base plan projections do not include impacts from the proposed GRC settlement, the $2 billion of new projects or acquisitions announced since March 2015 or any earnings from our three potential LNG development projects.","Third, we do not need to issue Sempra equity nor any potential MLP equity in order to finance the base plan. In light of the planned IEnova equity offering we discussed last quarter, we do not need to issue Sempra equity to finance the PEMEX acquisition or any of the announced renewable projects that are incremental to our base plan. Further, we did not include any earnings impacts from a potential MLP in our base plan. Altogether our five-year plan was built on conservative assumptions, and we are on track to meet or exceed our base plan earnings projections.","Now, let's go to slide 6 for an update on our growth and development opportunities. Beginning with the California utilities, we filed a multi-party GRC settlement agreement for both SDG&E and SoCalGas in September. The settlement agreement is subject to CPUC approval.","Under the agreement, SDG&E and SoCalGas would be allowed revenues sufficient to operate their businesses safely and reliably, and to provide excellent customer service. For 2016 through 2018, the agreement provides annual revenue increases for operations of approximately 3.5%. When including costs subject to balancing accounts, this equates to a total revenue requirement increase in 2016 of $17 million for SDG&E and $122 million for SoCalGas. Both utilities have also reached the second settlement agreement with the Office of Ratepayer Advocates for a four-year GRC term. The four-year term agreement is contingent on approval of our 2016 to 2018 GRC settlement, and on the commission approving a four-year term for all California utilities. If approved, the annual revenue increase in 2019 for SDG&E and SoCalGas would be 4.3%. Recall that our base plan projections assume utility revenues grow annually at the current 2.75% rate of attrition throughout the five-year plan period.","Moving to Mexico, in July, we announced that IEnova agreed to purchase PEMEX's 50% equity interest in their shared joint venture for approximately $1.3 billion. The acquisition is expected to be about $0.05 accretive to Sempra's EPS in 2016, growing to about $0.10 per share by 2019. We currently expect the Mexican Competition Commission to rule on the transaction this month, and for the equity offering to occur before year end.","In Mexico, IEnova also submitted a bid for the latest CFE pipeline auction, with award schedule for this week. Together with five other pipeline projects in Mexico that are currently being tendered, the total near-term investment opportunity exceeds $6 billion.","I also want to mention that the Ministry of Energy has published the long-term plan for development of the national electric system. The plan outlines significant needs for new generation in electric transmission. We expect the initial transmission projects to be bid during the first half of 2016 under new rules of energy reform and IEnova plans to participate in these new markets. We provide more detail in the appendix to this presentation.","Lastly, I would like to take a moment to comment on the status of Sempra Partners. In June, we announced that our board authorized us to pursue the formation of an MLP. The primary reason to form an MLP is to create a source of competitively priced capital to support Sempra's growth. As you are aware, current MLP market conditions are not ideal, and we will not go forward at this time. We are watching market conditions and we'll reevaluate our position in the middle of next year. In order to preserve this optionality about whether to pursue an MLP, we did submit a confidential S-1 with the SEC. As I stated earlier, we do not require equity from MLP markets in order to finance our base plan and we have flexibility in how we move forward. If we proceed, we will be convinced that the size and sustainability of the long-term value proposition for the Sempra's shareholder is intact.","Now, please turn to slide 7. With regard to investment opportunities post 2019 that are beyond our base plan period, we continue to make good progress. For Cameron expansion, we filed our FERC application in September and expect to receive FERC approval mid-2016. We received EPC pricing for Train 4 with per train costs that are lower than Trains 1-3. We believe Train 4 could be one of the lowest cost LNG development projects worldwide and competitive in the marketplace. Now that we have firm EPC pricing, we can conduct focused discussions with customers, and we continue to target announcing customer agreements prior to the end of the first quarter of next year. For our Port Arthur project, we have received our DOE FTA authorization and are continuing our project assessment. We are targeting the first half of next year to execute a joint development agreement with Woodside.","For our ECA liquefaction project, we continue to work on the regulatory and other project development issues with PEMEX. We view both the Port Arthur and ECA liquefaction projects as potentially providing LNG post 2020.","With that, let's turn to slide 8 for a discussion of the quarterly earnings. Joe?","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Thanks, Debbie. Earlier this morning, we reported third quarter earnings of $248 million or $0.99 per share. On an adjusted basis, we reported third quarter earnings of $250 million or $1 per share. Third quarter earnings in 2014 were $348 million or $1.39 per share.","Adjusted earnings this quarter exclude expenses related to the development of our three proposed LNG liquefaction projects. Similar to last quarter, we only recorded $2 million of after-tax expense. This number reflects the fact that a substantial portion of the costs are either being capitalized or shared with our Cameron joint venture partners and PEMEX.","Earnings this quarter include reduced tax expense associated with repatriation. As I mentioned on last quarter's call, we intend to participate in the planned IEnova equity offering, and now expect to use about two years' worth of dividends from Mexico that we had originally planned to repatriate. As a result, we expect an approximate $0.10 per share benefit in both 2015 and 2016 from lower than expected tax expense. Our current plan is to resume repatriation from Mexico in 2017 and 2018. I also want to reiterate that third quarter earnings continue to reflect the impact of seasonality in SoCalGas's revenues. This impact resulted in $113 million of lower earnings this quarter and $48 million of lower earnings year-to-date.","Applying seasonality will have no impact on full year earnings. We will see a $48 million after-tax benefit in the fourth quarter due to seasonality. You can refer to the appendix for additional detail where we illustrate 2014 SoCalGas earnings had seasonality in revenues being applied. Excluding the impact of seasonality in SoCalGas revenues, Sempra's third quarter adjusted earnings increased by $15 million compared to the same period last year. Looking forward, we are now raising our 2015 adjusted earnings guidance range to $4.95 per share to $5.15 per share. With regards to 2016 earnings and dividends, we anticipate updating our guidance in February on our fourth quarter call. Our new five-year EPS and dividend projections will be updated at our 2016 Analyst Conference.","I will note two additional matters. As a result of IEnova's anticipated purchase of PEMEX's interest in their shared joint venture, we expect to record a non-cash gain in the fourth quarter from the step-up of our own investment to fair value. This gain is not included in our 2015 adjusted earnings guidance.","Finally, as Debbie mentioned earlier, our GRC settlement agreement excludes an issue proposed in the proceeding regarding certain intra rate case income tax benefits relating to repair allowances. The proposal recommended by one of the interveners would require reducing rate base by $93 million for SDG&E and $92 million for SoCalGas. In addition, the proposal seeks to reduce pre-tax revenue requirements related to the 2015 year benefits in the amount of $46 million for SoCalGas and $34 million for SDG&E through the third quarter of 2015.","Our current expectation is that the CPUC will rule in our favor and do so on the same timeline as our GRC proceedings. That is because the proposed treatment would violate and contradict longstanding rate making and income tax policy. It would also represent a material departure from historical commission practice.","Please turn to slide 9. Individual financial results for each of our businesses can be found in the section of our presentation entitled Business Unit Earnings. Key drivers for our consolidated earnings this quarter include $20 million of higher net operating earnings in Sempra International including foreign exchange impacts, $14 million of higher earnings at SDG&E from higher CPUC base margin net of expenses and higher electric transmission earnings, and $14 million of lower tax expense at the parent related to reduced repatriation of dividends from Mexico.","Offsetting factors include the $113 million seasonality impact that lowered SoCalGas's third quarter earnings and two earnings items that occurred in the third quarter of 2014. One, the $25 million tax benefit for Sempra Natural Gas from the release of a state tax valuation allowance, and secondly the $14 million gain on the sale of a 50% equity interest in the first phase of ESJ in Mexico.","Now, let me conclude with slide 10. Overall, our financial and operating results for the third quarter continued to be strong, and they positioned us to raise our 2015 adjusted earnings guidance range. Increased operating earnings at both the California utilities and Sempra International underpin our solid year-to-date results. Across the company, we continue to capture development opportunities that are incremental to our base plan and look forward to providing you new projections early next year.","With that, we will conclude our prepared remarks and stop to take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take our first question from Neel Mitra with Tudor, Pickering.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hey, good afternoon.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Hi, Neel.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","How are you?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Great.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","First question was on the pipeline award expected this week. There has been some articles with some bids submitted or published. And it looks like you guys are a close second. Are those apples-to-apples comparisons and does that reflect how the ultimate auction will come out or is that \u2013 or is the CFE still ruling on it?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Well, first, let me say that they just changed the date when we will be notified on the bid to November 10, which is next Tuesday. And if you've looked at any of these bids before, the capital costs are not really reflective of who wins the bid, it's one component of the total bid. The real bid decision is based upon the tariff amount that you are agreeing to provide over the 20 years or 25 years of the contract in all of these pipeline bids, and that's what will be analyzed and looked at next week and announced.","Capital is a component, your return is a component, what your gas costs for operating the facilities is a component, what you think in terms of additional capacity sales that you might get off of the pipeline, those all factor into the creation of a tariff rate and that's what they will be announcing next week. So, we feel good that we're in a close second, only $4 million behind the low capital, but there is a lot of other factors that will come into the final decision.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. And second question on Cameron Train 4. Has the timeline been pushed out as far as negotiating customer contracts or MoUs, because I think previously you guys mentioned end of the year and I think in your prepared remarks, you said you'd have something maybe by Q1 2016. Can you just remind us of the timeline going forward and the market conditions for additional LNG?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Sure. I'll start and then I'll have maybe Mark add some additional color to it. But I've been saying in meetings with the investors for some time that we were looking at the end of the first quarter of next year. And that was because we really cannot \u2013 could not even begin negotiating MoUs until we have the EPC contract and we just got that this month. And so now we have the information that we can get a firm price. And we're very pleased that knowing that and getting a firm price, we think Cameron will be one of the, if not the lowest cost facility in the United States for LNG export. And so that allows us to really negotiate a firm MoU. And we followed the same process when we did Trains 1-3. We really needed to know what the cost was going to be in order to have a firm MoU negotiated.","Mark, do you want to add anything?","Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy","Yeah. I would just say that we've been having substantive discussions with a lot of potential customers and now we've been able to give them some hard data to work with, and we do expect to show some results. They won't all come at once, and so we expect to have some towards the end of the year and in the first part of next year. But our firm decision to move forward on this would be late in the first quarter.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","You might also comment, Mark, on what we see in the contracting area there because I know that there has been a lot of articles and all, and what we've seen is that there are still a lot of parties out there contracting.","Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy","Yeah. I think there's always \u2013 there's speculation in the press and rightfully so, picking up that LNG is oversupplied up through 2018, but when you start looking at the needs beyond that, when you get into 2020 and 2021, there's definitely a need for additional capacity and we're seeing that. And just to remind the audience, just in 2015 alone, we had 27 contracts signed. And 17 of those were 20-year contracts, four were 10-year and the rest were shorter term contracts. So there is plenty of activity going on, and we are certainly seeing that and we remain very confident that we'll move forward on Train 4.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","And, Mark, just to quickly follow up on the comment that off takers will need LNG in 2021. How late can they wait before they sign contracts in order to procure that supply? Do they have another year or is it necessary to make that decision in 2016?","Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy","I think they really got to start making those decisions in 2016, especially for new projects because otherwise they just won't be online in time. We are probably the \u2013 as far as a new train goes, Train 4 can probably come online as probably as quickly or quicker than any other train in the market that's starting anew, and you've got to really kind of make that decision in 2016.","Neel Mitra - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Got it. Thank you very much.","Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy","Yeah.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. Can you hear me?","Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy","Yes.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yes, Julien. We can hear you.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Excellent.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Good afternoon.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Yes. Indeed. So, perhaps firstly on Mexico, can you elaborate a little bit on opportunities down there, and I suppose principally focusing on non-oil and gas, but obviously this transmission, there's talk of electric capacity market like procurements, et cetera. What are you guys ranging to do down there at present?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. I mean, that's a great thing about Mexico. I think, it's one of our wonderful growth platforms where we see layers of opportunities for our company there. And certainly, there is more bids coming out on pipeline, we'll see $6 billion worth of pipeline bids occur over the next several months and we will be actively involved in that. Following that, they are finalizing the market rules for electric transmission and in our slides we showed you some of the projects that would be up for competition and probably within the first half of next year. And we're very interested in participating in that market. Further, now some of the oil properties are beginning to be taken over as it is and we see some great opportunities to the liquids pipelines that will take how \u2013 take away capacity from some of those PEMEX properties that are now being developed. And also, potentially gathering and processing in those areas.","And then the generation market we'll be opening and we have, as you know, the ESJ lands, property that could \u2013 we could add about another 1,000 megawatts or more to that area to do wind production. And so we see some great opportunities there. We also see some opportunities to really get some greater value add of our TDM plant. So, I think that and I would also add, I should say, that looking at our existing assets and a great pipeline backbone that we have, we can also add capacity with industrial customers to that and we're working on that right now. So we just see a great worth of opportunities, wealth of opportunities in Mexico and are very excited about it.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Perhaps just a quick follow-up there. TDM, obviously, you've been looking for contracts a while. Is there an opportunity to re-contract that back into Mexico now because of the opening up of this market, I mean is this quote finally going to happen?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. Those are the things that we're working on right now and we think that that those rules are getting put in place that would allow us to do it. Mark, do you want to...","Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy","Yeah. I was just going to say that the procurement for electricity along the Baja border haven't been let out yet, and so the CFE is working on that, but we fully expect that there'll be opportunities to contract that plant into Mexico. And you will have to weigh that against the opportunities on the U.S. side.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. And then lastly bigger picture, if you would, in terms of the U.S. obviously we just talked about Mexico and the range of opportunities, but you all have been pretty active both on gas pipelines and renewables in the U.S. As you think about CPP, California's own 50% RPS, is there anything bigger picture we should be paying attention to, any observation?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Well, I mean there are two sides of opportunity that we certainly see there. As you know, we do the renewable development and we have the potential to add additional solar project that can sell into the California market. And as you know, since our Analyst Conference, we already got two additional solar projects sold into the California market, and that was before the 50% was adopted. So, we see great opportunities to expand our existing solar facilities. And then in terms of our utilities that the integration of 50% renewables is going to require both gas and electric investment and the reason it requires gas investment is the type of generation that's going to be needed to support renewables in the area is different, and the location of that may be different. And so we're looking at major investments to our gas system to support the future. The North South Pipeline which we have before the commission right now would not only reinforce the system for reliability, but also help provide for that 50% renewable future.","And then of course on our utility side, we're going to have to make investments, so it will allow us to integrate all of the additional renewables in. So, I think there are some investments that are not part of our current plan right now, North South Pipeline is not part of our base plan nor are additional solar projects, nor are any of the distributed energy resource planning on it. None of that is part of our base 11% growth plan. So, we see that as all potential upside.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning\/afternoon.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Hi, Stephen, how are you?","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Very well, thanks. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to talk about dividends from Mexico. It makes perfect sense to use that cash to further invest in the business. As you look out longer term, do you think it's likely you're going to want to think about trying to keep more of that cash within Mexico rather than bring it back in the U.S. It sounds like it's efficient in some ways to do that. I'm just wondering whether you think this is more of a near-term phenomenon or something that we could see you extending out and trying given the excellent growth opportunities in a country.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah, I'll start and then I'm going to turn it over to Joe. I mean I think when we were looking at doing the dividending, it was because we had the net operating losses that we could benefit from. So when we look at the PEMEX deal, it made a lot more sense for us to keep the cash in Mexico for that major project. And so, I think to the degree that we continue to have major projects in Mexico, that would drive some of our decisions there. But why don't you talk about our plans, Joe, and...","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Sure. Thanks, Debbie. Hey, Stephen. It's a great question and I'll just go back. I will remind you all that, we essentially built all the equity in Mexico from profits from international operations over the last decade or more and basically doubled the value of that as we took IEnova public. So, it's been a really good investment for Sempra and we will continue to want to invest in it. We do have public shareholders now, so we will pay a good dividend from IEnova and Sempra will receive some of that cash. We don't need to bring it all the way to the U.S. Our current repatriation plan has us doing that through 2018 but as we just said, we're going to hold off on that for two years so we can use that money effectively in this offering. I expect IEnova to keep growing and I would expect us to want to continue to participate in offerings as we go along so that we don't dilute our ownership so much. And so I think what you're suggesting is probably the way it will play out over time and that's been a really good thing for us.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That makes sense. Great. Thank you. And just on your DRP overall. Shifting gears, any feedback or reaction that you had to the different elements. It sounds like obviously the grid overall needs to change, which you mentioned just a minute ago, but just curious that any color and the kind of feedback that you've received so far.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","I'm sorry. I wasn't quite sure, you're talking about...","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Distributed resource plan.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","The distributed resource plan. Okay. I'm going to ask...","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's right.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah, I'm going to ask Jeff talk about that. Jeff, do you want to...","Jeffrey Walker Martin - San Diego Gas & Electric Co.","Sure. Good morning, Stephen. You recall the kind of focus that program is really intended to make sure that all the investor owned utilities are making the investments, which are necessary to make sure that distributed resources like solar and other resources continue to penetrate the system. And when you kind of compare that to some of the other things we talked about like SB 350; that's designed to make sure there's a lot more central station renewable. So as you have more participation on the central clean energy side and the on the distributed side, it really sets up pretty interesting dynamic for the electric utilities to make more investments around transmission and distribution to accommodate those resources and particularly the unique characteristics of the fact that they're so intermediate \u2013 intermittent.","But I think that the \u2013 one of the things we keep falling back on is we've got about a $5.8 billion capital program through 2019, and we continue to think of the DRP opportunities, Stephen, it's kind of a longer term opportunity. Part of this maybe definitional in the way some of the different utilities in the state talk about it. But for us, anything that comes out of the DRP, whether it's greater use of batteries, synchronous condensers, more solid state switches, more investments around electric vehicle charging, all of that we would view as being an additive to the plan that we already have from a capital program standpoint.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Hi, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Hi, guys. Just a couple questions on clarification and I apologize if I missed it. But what was the assumed annual repatriation from Mexico for 2015 through 2018 in the last five-year plan?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Joe, cover that.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","We basically said back in 2012 when we started, Greg, that we were going to do approximately $300 million a year. We didn't break it down between Mexico and Peru, but we set a roughly $300 million a year for that period, 2012 through 2018. And so, we're pulling back on the Mexico piece for this two-year period. So, you can see we're talking roughly around $300 million investment in the IEnova, $300 million to $325 million maybe, something like that. So, if you think about that, cut that in half and you see what the Mexico piece was for a year.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. So, you're going to basically keep \u2013 so, you're telling us that $325 million is the amount that you're now not going to repatriate and instead use to help finance...","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","In the two \u2013 yeah, over the two-year period 2015 and 2016. We already have the 2015 dividend. It's already in a Mexican holding company above IEnova, we'll use that and then we'll borrow some money for a short-term until we get the dividend next year usually in the summer time.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Okay. So, you answered my question without me having to try to figure out on my own $325 million. Thank you.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Roughly, right around that.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","And then the second question and it might entail a longer answer is, I know, you told us in the five-year plan what your assumptions were with regard to the general rate case outcome in terms of attrition, it was 2.75% and the repair allowance benefits would be flowed through to customers beginning in 2016. If this deal was approved, I know the attrition adjustments are modestly better. But can you explain the repair allowance \u2013 the prospective repair allowance framework and then also go back \u2013 maybe explain a little bit more what your exposure is perhaps the retroactive look at repair allowance goes against you?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Sure. Let me start this because having been in this business for 37 years, I can't help, but make comments on how flawed I think the proposal is. And it was only raised in our case by one of the interveners and what they're basically trying to do is re-coup what had been decided in the last rate case. So, we think it's legal case retroactive rate making and I \u2013 we will fight it as a legal case that retroactive rate making. What in our case is, I just want to talk about our set of facts. Because I think our set of facts is really important. A record in our case was officially closed in July and we did not even file with the IRS for any consideration of a change of tax treatment until after the record had been closed and in the case of SoCalGas, it was more than a year after the record had been closed. So, we think that to try to re-trade this and to go back and recoup those dollars is fully inappropriate. And so we think we have a very good legal standing in our case with our set of facts and we will fight that.","As Joe mentioned in his prepared remarks, the dollars that we're talking about or the SDG&E for 2011 to 2014 is $93 million, and for SD \u2013 or SoCalGas is $92 million. And a memo account for 2015 because they were all concerned about the retroactive rate making effect and so they tried to cover it with a memo account. There is SDG&E $46 million pre-tax and SoCalGas $34 million pre-tax through September. We will fight all of this because the history has been very, very clear that it's to the benefit of the customers to have utilities pursue efficiencies and tax benefits and everything. And that the shareholders have to pay for all the research and work that was done to accumulate these benefits. And that the shareholder has always been able to keep those benefits in between rate cases, and then the customer gets them at the next rate case. And when we did our 2016 plan and beyond, we did incorporate in that $40 million reduction at SoCalGas and $19 million reduction at SDG&E starting in 2016 forward for that now going to the customer, which has been the regulatory history of how these things have been dealt with for decades at least since I've been here. So, we think that we will prevail on this issue with our good set of facts and we will continue to fight this, because we think it is a retroactive rate making situation.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. So that sums it up, the worst case scenario would be you lose your \u2013 on your legal position and that goes as a reduction to rate base, but prospectively, you worked out how you're going to pull back the benefits?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Right. I mean that's the way it's always been, is that the customer gets the benefits flow through to them at the next rate case and we assume that in our base plan and Dennis and Jeff went through that in March, because we've always had that assumption that come 2016, those will become benefits that will go to the customer.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay, great. And then, a final question amongst the many things you guys have talked about, some \u2013 two of the biggest building blocks for earnings as we go into next year that were not in the base plan are the $0.05 of accretion from the PEMEX, which rises to $0.10 in 2019. And then also the continuation of this $0.10 benefit from not having repatriated cash from Mexico. And then you've got all these other things on the checklist that you've won that weren't in the plan that you delineated earlier as well. Correct?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. And some of those don't happen next year that they begin construction but they are not in service next year, so...","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Got it. Thank you, guys.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thank you.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Yep.","Operator","Our next question will come from Chris Turnure with JPMorgan.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Hi, Chris.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. How are you? I wanted to just follow up back on Trains 4 and 5 here. Could you maybe give a little bit more color to the extent if there's anything different from what you said earlier in the call about the potential for getting a Train 5 contract signed in addition to just Train 4. And then, could you comment on whether the EPC contract preliminary agreements there were not just good but better than your expectations at all?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Sure. I'm going to ask Mark to comment on that as he's smiling. So...","Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy","Well, I would say that I'll answer the second question first, which is with respect to the EPC contracts. I think we were pleased with the way the numbers came out. I won't say we were terribly surprised, we suspected that continual construction would lead to a very low cost and we were \u2013 and I think we're proven correct. So, we do believe that it will be beneficial to continue the construction into Train 4 and that will actually reduce the costs for all of the trains in the facility. So, I think it will make Cameron a very competitive facility.","With respect to any change in the way that we're looking at it \u2013 as to Trains 4 and 5, I think we've said numerous times in the past that the decision to go forward with Train 4 is really a Sempra decision that we've made in conjunction with our partners. And for Train 5, that will be a decision that's made by our partners and they're still contemplating that and whether they go forward at the same time or not is really not \u2013 is their call and really not ours, and frankly not that relevant to our investment decision or our financial outcome.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then, shifting gears to the total return vehicle. You mentioned you're going to revisit the idea in the middle of the next year. Is there a reason for that timing specifically, and maybe you can give a little bit more color as to what you would view as a constructive MLP environment out there for you guys to have a low cost of capital?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah, let me just say that the middle of next year is arbitrary, it's more that we want to see sustained markets that can make us feel that the cost of capital that we would receive by doing it is better than what we would receive at Sempra. And so, we did not want to give you a view that we're going to look at it again next month, and the month after, it's going to be \u2013 we're going to have to see really sustained improvements in the market that cause us to want to launch something on the basis of allowing our growth, this wonderful growth that we have to occur at a lower cost of capital. And if it doesn't deliver that value proposition, then it doesn't make a lot of sense for us to go forward. So, that's how we're looking at.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question will come from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah, hi. Just first, to follow up on that, so is the registration still live for the MLP in the meantime, or is it no longer kind of live?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah, the registration can stay live for a period of time, and what we did is we wanted to have full optionality. So, we did this with IEnova, we did a lot of pre-work to be ready to launch if the markets were right. And we ended up actually launching IEnova faster than we thought we would have, because we saw Mexican reform coming, we'd won some pipeline bids and it made sense for us as a way to raise both debt and equity. But we would have to see the same kind of thing for the MLP, and so that's kind of how we're looking at it.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then, apologize to move back to the repair issue, but just to kind of clarify, if we looked at the forward revenue requirement of the utilities, what would be the impact to that beyond what's currently in your plan if this is upheld?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Well, all I can...","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Is it just the lost return on that rate base or...","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Yeah.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Well, there hasn't been a decision in our case. So it's hard to say what it would be. And I will say our set of facts is not exactly the same as another utility's set of facts. So, I wouldn't want to speculate, I told you the amounts of what the tax was over the period of time, but how it ultimately gets treated and everything, that will be litigated in our case. So, I couldn't really speculate on that.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then finally, the $2 billion of upsides \u2013 investment upsides to the plan, which I guess that's also separate on top of the rate settlement separately, but just the $2 billion of investments. Could we just go through those one more time? I know we have \u2013 PEMEX investment is a big one.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Right.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Is it the two...","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","The PEMEX...","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","...renewables projects?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. There's three renewable projects and then the PEMEX, the PEMEX was about a little over $1.3 billion and then the three renewable projects equate to the remainder. So, I mean that's...","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","They are in the slides, Steve, on page 19.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And just at a high level, has anything gotten worse than when you gave the plan, any key drivers or is generally the rest the same?","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","I would say the only thing that is down from the original plans is natural gas prices are down. So, that's a factor in \u2013 and you're looking at 2016, is that what we're talking about?","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","No, the whole five-year plan, the 11% growth...","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Yeah, so really \u2013 oh, the whole five-year plan. I mean natural gas prices are clearly down almost $2 from when that plan was put together a year ago. And FX, clearly, the dollar has strengthened against all the currencies, that has actually been in our favor right now because the Mexico effect is bigger than the South American effect. So, it's a little bit hard to see how that will play out over the five-year plan period because it depends on what the U.S. dollar does against those three currencies. And I think those are really the two main factors. Everything else is very consistent. We have a very long-term contracted business with a good regulatory model and we just got this proposed decision that \u2013 or I'm sorry, the settlement \u2013 proposed settlement, so feels pretty good.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. The only other thing that I would mention that I didn't mention in terms of the upsides to the plan is that we did get the additional pipeline in Mexico, that's about $110 million. So, they're all listed on slide 19.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thank you.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Faisel Khan with Citi.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good afternoon.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Hi, Faisel.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Hi.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Can you remind us also just what the dividend growth rate is along with the base plan for 11% EPS growth 2015 to 2019?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. Well, we had talked about a dividend growth rate that was around 5% to 6%. But that \u2013 and our board considers that every February and the great thing that we have is that we have all of these projects that are long-term contracted and then we will get our GRC decision by February, we will see the progress on construction of Cameron, which is going really well. And we will see if we're getting some contracts on Cameron 4 at that time and so there will be a lot of visibility to things that may cause our board to reconsider, is that the appropriate growth rate over the time through 2019. And so that happens in the February timeframe and we had targeted a 45% to 55% payout ratio at 2019 \u2013 and that, I think there's been no change in that type of a thought process, but what we do in the interim, I think, we're going to be looking at again in February.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And any change in your thought process around M&A? Certainly the midstream and MLP sector has been hit pretty hard, I'm not sure if that changes your calculus around how you look at assets and opportunities?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Well, we always look at \u2013 we've looked at a lot of the MLPs and we looked at \u2013 I think our interests would lie as, we haven't seen anything that is greatly attractive to us in terms of the composite in an MLP. But there are some assets there that if they need the cash and they need to start liquidating some assets that we may be very interested in. And so we've identified things that would be of interest to us and we continue to monitor those and have discussions as appropriate.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","See, let me just add \u2013 if I could just add to that. I see this transaction and the wonderful thing that we have at Sempra is that we have such high organic growth that we don't have to do those kinds of transactions to get our growth. And so I would just tell you all we're really picky about what we would acquire because we've had such success in doing greenfield projects that \u2013 and our returns tend to be higher on all the greenfield projects and the acquisitions. So we're very disciplined when we make acquisitions and I think hopefully you'll see from the PEMEX acquisition. We think it's a very good acquisition for us. It's accretive. It allows us to have a more robust pipeline system that we can grow from. So that's what we really look at.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, understood. And then just on the potential assets in Mexico, I was wondering have you guys looked at exporting LPG, propane and butane out of Mexico. I know a number of people have been trying to figure out how to export LPG out of the West Coast and it's been a difficult process. So I'm just trying to see if you guys have looked at that opportunity and if you think it's a viable option out of the West Coast.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. I will have Mark talk about that. I mean, what we have \u2013 we have the ethane pipeline and that we look at all opportunities. We also have the joint venture that we'll continue with PEMEX. And so these are some of the kinds of things that we would see as being potential out of that JV. Mark?","Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy","Yeah. I would say both in the U.S. and in Mexico we've studied opportunities to export various kinds of natural gas liquids and we haven't put a project together or announced anything, but it's something that we study all the time and I do think there's some interesting opportunities. So it's definitely top of mind. There is a real need to move some of these liquids out of the producing areas, and to the extent that we find an opportunity that works for us, I think we'd be willing to capitalize on it.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, last question from me. Any impact from the hurricane on the West Coast of Mexico to your operations or assets?","Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy","No.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","No, no.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, got it. Thanks.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thank you.","Operator","We'll now go next to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Jay Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, guys, real quick...","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Hi, Michael.","Michael Jay Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, guys, real quick question.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Hi, Michael.","Michael Jay Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","...on the U.S. renewable business. Can you talk about how much incremental room you have for the development of solar projects whether it's Mesquite, Copper Mountain. Really can you just talk about it fleet-wide like almost how much excess room do you have in the backyard, how many megawatts would that potentially create over a long period of time?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","So, I'm going to have Mark address that.","Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy","Yeah. Hi, Michael. Yeah, we've got about 420 megawatts under construction and with respect to solar, we have about 280 megawatts of property that's still available for development. And then, we're actually in the process of trying to acquire a little bit more to increase that. And then, with respect on the wind side, we have just a flat rate, we have over 200 megawatts that's potentially developable there. And then, of course, at ESJ, we have, I won't say unlimited, but it's a very, very large amount of capacity that's potentially over 1,000 megawatts.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","And that can sell both into the U.S. or into Mexico.","Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy","Correct. Yeah. So, we do have \u2013 we currently have developable properties that we can and then, obviously, we're looking at new ones all the time.","Michael Jay Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And how should we think about contract prices and the economics of the projects you announced at the second quarter call versus ones you started development on three years or four years ago?","Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy","I would say that the economics are very similar or sort of within 75 basis points of each other. Our returns, we don't really announce what the returns are, but the prices are cheaper because of the cost of this \u2013 of the product of both in wind and solar has dropped dramatically and that's made a big difference.","Michael Jay Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks, Mark. Much appreciated.","Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy","All right.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go now to Mark Barnett with Morningstar.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research","Hey. Good afternoon\/good morning.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Hi, Mark.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research","Thanks for all of the details today. It's been a really helpful call. A couple of just quick questions, just one clarification for the $0.10 \u2013 extra $0.10 in guidance that was assuming approval of the PEMEX buyout this year?","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","You want me to answer it?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. I'll have Joe answer that. Yeah. Go ahead, Joe.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Yeah, Mark. No, that was our reassessment of our desire to make the investment of the two years where the dividends, 2015 and 2016 dividends. And so we have recast our tax expense to assume that we will only repatriate this year and next year from Peru and not Mexico, so that's locked in, we are doing that.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research","Okay, okay. So that decision was certainly not then contingent on approval, okay.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","It's not contingent on the closing, no. We're just not going to repatriate those monies for 2015 or 2016. We believe that the deal will close and we will fund it. And so there is no contingency there. We've already adjusted in the third quarter tax expense for that and so you'll see also lower tax expense in the fourth quarter combined that will be the $0.10.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research","Okay, great. Sorry, I was a little confused on that. And more of just a big picture question since it's a new development. With the transmission bids that will be beginning in 2016, how do you view your competitive position there given that your existing relationships in gas is sort of a different ball game, I guess, on the electric side? Can you maybe talk about sort of the competition and the clarity that you've seen around the bid structures, obviously something that took some time to develop with the gas?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. I think a couple of things. We have some outstanding experience building major transmission projects in difficult areas. Sunrise is probably one of the most difficult transmission projects to get done and it got done on time, on budget. So \u2013 and I think our company has shown our ability to work through regulatory agencies and get all of that done. When you go to Mexico then and you take some of those skills and you transfer that rights of way will be a key issue. It's very similar on the gas and electric side and in fact there may be cases where the transmission could use some existing rights of way that we've already acquired. And then, the siting of the line, the ability to work with the agencies, CFE would be the agency that would be bidding these out and we have good experience working with CFE. And I think having a workforce of several hundred people headquartered in Mexico City that know how to work through these processes, I think that we're in a really good place to enter that area of the business with the experience that we have in Sempra and do quite well in it.","Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy","Yeah. And I would just add to that we have developed transmissions lines outside of the U.S. as well. We've been one of the \u2013 we've done a good job of building transmission in Chile, we've built some things in Peru. And so it's not \u2013 we're not without experience outside of the U.S. as well. So, I think given the combination of experience that we have and our relationship with the CFE, I think we're in \u2013 we should be in very good standing to be competitive in that market.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research","All right. Thanks for your thoughts, guys.","Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy","Sure.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Goldenberg with Luminus Management.","Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management LLC","Good afternoon.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Hi, Michael.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Hi, Michael.","Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management LLC","Hi. I wanted to get more understanding on the guidance and the $0.15. So, you increased the midpoint by $0.25 of which $0.10 is taxes. Can you maybe help me understand the other $0.15, since it's not PEMEX?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Well, I think if you look at the strength of our business so far this year, you look at how our performance is all of our businesses, and then you adjust for seasonality at SoCalGas, our utilities are having very strong years, our other businesses are having very strong years. So, we look at where we are today and where we think that we will be at the end of the year across all of our businesses. And I think everything is doing very well. So, there is not like one thing that's behind it. There is $0.10 for the tax, the repatriation issue, but the rest of it is across our businesses.","Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management LLC","So, it's not one specific thing and it's not GRC and it's not PEMEX, right, it's just kind of spread out...","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Well, the GRC doesn't take effect until next year. PEMEX will not close until later this year, so it won't be until 2016 earnings. So you won't see the GRC effect until 2016 nor will you see the effect of PEMEX until 2016. So it's neither of those, it's just the strength of our base operations across the board.","Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management LLC","And then the other part that I'm trying to understand, since you were raised $0.15 but you kept CAGR as the same, is the starting point now high and thus the ending point will \u2013 and is the ending point also higher?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","I'm not sure I understood it.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","He is saying we're raising $0.15.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yes.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","But keeping the CAGR the same. I mean, we're not setting a new CAGR. Debbie was talking about our approximately 11% CAGR that was in the Analyst Conference. We're not telling you a new number yet. We'll give you a new guidance when we have the conference or what our 2016 to 2020 number is. But we've already said we already know that the numbers are all getting higher, because we have $2 billion more projects, we have a number of positive things going for us. So I think you can glean from that that it wasn't lifting up the front and keeping the end smaller, that's not our intent of this conversation.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. But I will also say that that's a 2015 to a 2019 CAGR. And one of the reasons that has some big effect is that the end of the period what's been great is that we've been able to produce strong results at the beginning of the period. So that Cameron adds a lot in 2018 and 2019 to that growth rate, but we're also growing our business in a lot of other areas and we've had exceptional performance in safety, reliability, customer and financial performance from our utilities as well as our other businesses.","Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management LLC","So, what I'm hearing is both conceptually things are going great and mathematically as well, if we just crunch the numbers...","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","We just won't tell you what number to forecast, that's it.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Yeah.","Michael Goldenberg - Luminus Management LLC","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Vedula Murti with CDP Capital.","Vedula Murti - CDP Capital US, Inc.","Good morning, good afternoon depending how \u2013 wherever you are.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Hello.","Vedula Murti - CDP Capital US, Inc.","I'm fine. I'm wondering given the sales to the MLP market and everything, yeah, I'm sure \u2013 I would suspect you have this theory at least some inventory of very mature assets where the EBITDA and everything like that is on full run rate and everything like that and there are other entities that are going to be needing to big machines, so to speak. So, can you give me a sense as to what \u2013 and you guys have always been very, very good at recycling capital. So, can you give us unless I missed this earlier, I did show up a little bit late, I showed up in the Q&A. Can you give a sense as to what might be available in terms of either in some gross EBITDA value or something like that or certain types of assets that you think that it will recycle capital during this period, while you're waiting to see things stabilize if they're all on their optimal run rates?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. If your question is like what is our capital allocation methodology and our enterprise, is that what you're trying to get at?","Vedula Murti - CDP Capital US, Inc.","Well, I'm trying to get at the fact is that you probably have certain plants or assets or whatever that already at regular run rates and they're contracted and the fact is that those \u2013 in theory would have probably been appropriate for holding on to for an MLP, but if the MLP is going to be pushed off and you have MLPs and YieldCos that are going to need to acquire in order to justify their own cost of capital, the question is whether you have a inventory of assets that you can recycle capital perhaps at better rates than sitting on them right now and just waiting for the MLP market or whatever to turn around?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. I would say that we always look at our assets everyday as if we've just bought the company. And so everything we look at if it is \u2013 makes sense for us to sell it and to exit that, we're willing to do it and same thing in terms of looking at acquisitions. We're very disciplined on that. I will give you examples of what we've done in the past, I can't tell you what we might do in the future, it depends on what the market is, what kind of pricing we could get, but we decided to exit merchant generation because it didn't fit our model and we filled our power plants as an example. So those are the kinds of things that we do on a regular basis and a lot depends on what the market conditions are and what kind of premiums will be paid and whether or not it would make sense for us to exit that, and then redeploy capital into some future growth. And we always think that way, but I'm not going to list any kind of assets that are for sale.","Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy","And I guess I would just add to that too is that, all of our large assets that we expect to be \u2013 essentially fully contracted and moving forward, and if you look at our pipelines in Mexico, our LNG facilities, all of those we believe have expansion capability. And so it's not like \u2013 even though they're fully contracted for their current size, we think all of them can \u2013 especially in Mexico, we're in the process of expanding capacity on some of our existing pipelines and adding additional revenue. We're looking obviously at Train 4 to Cameron. We're looking at additional facilities. So I think we've got a lot of growth left in a lot of our major assets. So we really wouldn't be looking at that at this time. We want to be completely sure that we capture all of that growth and all of that additional revenue. But I think for more mature assets down the road, as Debbie said, we always look at that stuff.","Vedula Murti - CDP Capital US, Inc.","Well, maybe the point I was trying to distinguish between kind of legacy, fully mature assets that are at their full EBITDA run rates or whatever where there is not \u2013 it's obviously contributing, but there is not necessarily \u2013 that's not the growth component. And I'm trying to distinguish that between Mexico expansions or Cameron or whatever. And I just don't know what your \u2013 what the pot might be that because you guys have been one of the best in our industry in terms of recycling capital. So I'm just curious if you can give a sense of what that. Assuming this is the way you're thinking about whether there is a part of recycle book capital that is sitting there that's depending on given the other market participants. That's what I'm trying to get a sense of.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah, I think that when we look at what we've had, all I can tell you is what we've done historically and we did that with coal plants that we bought and we sold that when we thought the market was changing. We did that when our generation plants came off the DWR contracts and that they no longer fit our model because we go for long-term contracts. So we always look at the market and we always look at what's left in our contracts. What we think is a little chance of re-contracting, is there more value there to us that we could get out of the asset. I mean, that's the way we look at it and so I am not going to go through how we would look at specific assets, but I can tell you that's the methodology we use.","Vedula Murti - CDP Capital US, Inc.","Well, one last question and I'll let someone else go. And given that history and the way you describe it, what starts bidding that type of thing to be examined, like for instance, gas storage, the Mid-South (67:20) or something like that. I'm just curious \u2013 I'm sure, not everything is perfect. So, the fact is \u2013 and you guys have always been very, very good at identifying that. So, I just want to get a sense of what might be available just to recycle and optimize?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. I just don't think I can answer what we would plan to look at selling. I think I can tell you what the methodology is. And when we look at an asset like storage, I can tell you it's at very low values right now in comparison to what it's been in the past, but you see what's happening in the gas market and you see what's happening relative to coal to gas conversion and the need for storage by utilities and then all of the LNG plants in the Gulf. So the way we would look at an asset like that is do we think it could have greater value to our shareholders in the future, and are there ways to optimize that, and how much could we get to sell it in the market, and that's the way we would always look at those kinds of assets. So, I really don't think I can give you a list of what we would be considering \u2013 that wouldn't even be a good thing to do for our shareholders in terms of any kind of negotiation. So, I think that's all I can really say.","Vedula Murti - CDP Capital US, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. I'll let other people ask questions. Thank you.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good afternoon.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Hi, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","How are you doing? Just, I know you've been asked this by Greg and Steve, but I just want to make sure I have a better understanding. With respect to the repairs deduction rate base potential impact, you mentioned a couple of different numbers, you mentioned memorandum account numbers. And I just wasn't sure what \u2013 on a corporate wide basis, what kind of rate base is actually sort of being challenged here retroactively, which you guys don't plan on \u2013 I understand you guys don't feel a valid challenge. But I just wanted to know what we're quantitatively roughly speaking about?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Okay. Joe, I'm going to ask you to cover it...","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Okay.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","...and see if you can explain it better than I did.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Yeah, yeah. No, no, no, you explained it well. I think that the proposal suggested that we took the 2011 to 2014 savings and that added up to $185 million on a Sempra-wide basis, roughly split between the two utilities, and that would be what they suggested should be reduced from rate base going forward. So, you can do the math and figure out what that would mean to a revenue requirement. Again, we don't believe that's going to be sustained.","The memorandum account really dealt with 2015 and they treated that separately, they're trying to get around retroactive rate making, as Debbie suggested. So, the sum of the two numbers that she gave you, and they were in my remarks as well, totaled $80 million on a pre-tax basis through September, less than $50 million after-tax. That would be a 2015 impact, that wouldn't go to rate base, it would just be a direct impact, that they were requesting. This is what they requested as a way to get around the retroactive rate making. We don't think they will be able to sustain it. But that's the way it would work. So, the rate base is only that $92 million and $93 million.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. Let me further say, though, who the \"they\" is, because what I want to stress is that we don't have a proposed decision that does this.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Right.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","The \"they\" is TURN, one of the interveners in the case and this is their proposal in the case. And so we have not yet received a proposed decision and we will make a very strong case that the record was closed, officially closed by the ALJ before we even filed with the IRS to make these changes. So, I just want to be sure that the facts are really clear on this.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","No, absolutely, and I apologies for having \u2013 there were a few numbers running around that I wanted to make sure I understood them.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","No. It was a good question. I am glad you clarified.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","And then with respect to the master limited partnership vehicle and what have you, it seems to me that people \u2013 the Street and what have you sort of wanted you guys to move faster on this a while ago, and I don't know, you guys didn't, and the situation has changed and you guys are looking at what the opportunities might be on a sustained basis. I am just sort of wondering, I mean strategically when you see something like what's happened in the markets and what have you, whether or not it makes the bar higher or you think more about how you might want to unwind something, if it ends up that \u2013 I mean because obviously these are not really short-term financing plans. These are supposed to be vehicles that last for a period of time. And I am just wondering when you have something that we just recently experienced, what does that make you think about \u2013 I mean, in terms of \u2013 does it make the bar higher? I mean, what do you guys think about it, I guess, is what I am asking? I mean, sort of a little bit more elaboration in terms of obviously if it doesn't make sense, you're not going to do it, but not only that, if it \"does make sense\" for a period of time, does \u2013 what would give you \u2013 do need more confidence in terms of that or just how do you think about that, do you follow what I'm saying?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. I'll start a little bit and then I'm going to ask Mark to add to that. I think that one of the things that became apparent was that there is some limited liquidity in that market. And that the effects were great when people needed to change portfolios and clear out of that market, and that creates a sense of discomfort for us, because that's not what we see in the Sempra stock. And so what we want to be able to see is that there is the ability to have \u2013 and that you can differentiate, and I think you still do see that in the market. You can differentiate quality from things that are not quality, and quality continues to trade well even if that whole market segment is not trading as well. Because I mean that's always been what we've been after is if we're going to do this, it's going to be all about quality, and that if we can't get the value for that quality, then it doesn't make sense for us to go forward. So, Mark, do you want to add?","Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy","Yeah, I guess my only add to that would be \u2013 I think when we looked at this, in the beginning I think we had some skepticism and then as we watched these things progress over the last few years, it was clear to us that there was a cost of capital advantage to these entities and that was worth taking advantage of and we had ideal assets, and we still do have ideal assets for that kind of vehicle that was valuing cash flows at very high multiples or very low yields. But I think to your point, Paul, and it's a very good one, which is does this disruption in the market give us some pause to think that this was more \u2013 something like a passing fad. And I think at the end of the day, I think there's a high probability that these long, sustainable cash flows will continue to garner a yield that makes the capital look really \u2013 that makes the cost of the capital look really attractive.","But I do think that we have to kind of make sure that we're in a market that supports that for the long haul and that there's enough liquidity in that market that, as Debbie said, the ones that have \u2013 that truly aren't tainted by underlying commodity prices can shine, and can still garner that low cost. And that's got to be proven and whether that can happen in the next six months or a year, we don't know. But I think we're going to keep our options open and look at it and take advantage of it, if it makes sense. And if it doesn't, we're perfectly okay to keep \u2013 to do the course that we are on, which is just as a C corp and I think we can be very competitive with cost of capital and we've got a great business here. So the good news is our underlying assets and business are super \u2013 are just really sound and we don't have to avail ourselves of any one particular mechanism to raise capital. We have lots of opportunities for that and we can meet our capital needs without any real problem.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, great.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah.","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Let me just add on one more thing and Mark just alluded to it. But you guys may or may not have seen this, in the last several months including last week, we got a affirmation of our credit ratings and S&P just moved us to a stronger business risk profile from strong to excellent. We've a very strong business and we can finance our growth and this was an opportunity to maybe do something that was really cheap and good. And so to everything Mark and Debbie said, I just want to add that, we have a very strong credit ratings and we can finance our growth, we will need it.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Great. I appreciate it. Thanks so much.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thank you, Paul.","Operator","We'll now go to Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","A quick follow-up question. Can you just go through in a little more detail what your net exposure is to currency with Mexico offsetting the exposure in Chile and Peru. And then sort of a secondary question on that is in the places where you're dollar denominated, I know that functionally inflates you, but if we continue to have a strong dollar, doesn't that put pressure on the regulatory construct and how do we think about risk in that framework?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Joe, do you want to take that or Trevor?","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","Yeah, I will speak first and then I'll let Trevor go through all the numbers of the net exposure and so forth. But as you know, we have a natural hedge here because we have when the dollar strengthens on all three of the currencies, in Chile and Peru, we have a reduction of our growth because of the translation of the two currencies in South America to the dollar by offsetting that is the fact that we do have dollar functional currency in Mexico because fundamentally most of the businesses are in dollars. So we pay our taxes in pesos and we have some other adjustments in the income tax expense as a function of their income tax rules that impact us in the opposite direction when all three currencies decline. And so that's what we've seen over time. So I'll let Trevor walk through what the numbers were for the quarter...","Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy","Sure, Greg","Joseph A. Householder - Sempra Energy","...and year-to-date.","Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy","Yeah. So for the quarter, we had a total decline in earnings from translation of the earnings of about $6 million for the quarter between Chile and Peru and that is more than offset by a $17 million pickup in Mexico and as Joe said that, that's primarily from the revaluation of the taxes. So the net benefit in the quarter was $11 million. And then year-to-date, it's not much different, it's about $14 million of a benefit year-to-date and that was driven by $13 million of the P&L hurt that we took in the translation of the earnings from Chile and Peru offset by $27 million net of NCI for Mexico, giving us a net benefit year-to-date of $14 million.","Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy","And, Greg, let me just add to that. In South America, you're on point and say, we do get adjustments in our tariff primarily from inflation, but also FX too. But what we have seen in South America this year, it's a little bit unusual. We've seen currency devaluation without underlying inflation in those countries. So, we're not getting the inflation adjustments for our tariff. So, it's really not putting as much rate pressure on as you might expect. I'm not sure that's a good thing. I mean, we'd like to get the adjustment, but we're just not seeing high inflation in those countries. What we're seeing is just strengthening of the dollar and is probably more has to do with more U.S. policy and the strength of the dollar worldwide than it has to do with really underlying weakness in those economies.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay, so \u2013 sorry, go ahead.","Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy","Go ahead, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","I was going to say you move into next year and you update your five-year plan to the extent that currencies have moved dramatically, that would be reflected in your update on expected earnings from those jurisdictions, right?","Mark A. Snell - Sempra Energy","Yes.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Yeah. Yeah, what we'll do and why we don't give you numbers until February, as we look out the forwards at that time for currency and natural gas prices, and we adjust our plans for those things as well as the additional growth that we've had in our businesses, outcomes like the GRC and all. So that's why we wait to give you our 2016 forecast in February and then at the Analyst Meeting in March, we'll give you additional information for the next five years.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","But in your opening comments, you didn't seem like you're too concerned that this one factor would knock you off the aspirations that you currently have?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Well, we wouldn't \u2013 based upon what we see in currencies now, we wouldn't see that and then gas prices are so low now, they've already been reflected to a great degree, and this is just pro forma. So, I guess they can always go lower, you can never say they won't go lower, but we have pretty low gas prices now. So...","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thank you. Have a good afternoon.","Trevor I. Mihalik - Sempra Energy","Thanks, Greg.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll now take a question from Feliks Kerman with Visium Asset Management.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is Ashar Khan (81:30). How are you guys doing and great results? One thing...","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thank you.","Unknown Speaker","...which I picked up on the remarks is that we have a settlement with the commission that we might get a fourth year of the rate case with an attrition mechanism if I heard that correctly. Could you just go over that I might have heard it wrongly?","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Sure. No, you heard it correctly that with the ORA, the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, we have a settlement for fourth year that would give us a 4.3% attrition for that fourth year and that will be looked at by the commission separate from our other settlements. So we have a settlement with eight parties for the three years and then we have a settlement with one party for the fourth year, that party being the Office of Ratepayer Advocates.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you so much and great results.","Debra L. Reed - Sempra Energy","Thank you.","Mark A.

Reed","Thanks, Rick, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. You may have noticed a new name in the list of introductions Rick just made, so let me introduce Trevor Mihalik, our new Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. He has extensive industry experience in the energy business and also a strong accounting background, and he is going to make a great addition to the already strong management team that we have here at Sempra. I'd also like to mention that Bruce Folkmann, who has been our Acting Controller since October of last year, will become the Vice President and Controller of our U.S. Gas & Power business starting next week.","On today's call, we'll review our second quarter financial results and then we'll give you a regulatory and operational update on our businesses.","Let's begin with our financial results. Earlier this morning, we recorded second quarter earnings of $62 million or $0.25 per share, excluding a $179 million non-cash charge related to our investment in the Rockies Express Pipeline, or REX. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter of 2012 were $241 million or $0.98 per share. In the second quarter of 2011, we recorded adjusted earnings of $226 million or $0.94 per share, which excluded the $277 million remeasurement gain we booked when we completed our acquisition of South American Utilities.","As many of you are aware, Kinder Morgan, a 50% owner of REX, is in the process of selling its interest in the pipeline as a result of its merger with El Paso. The REX pipeline is contracted through late 2019. The current market conditions for the pipeline are weak due to low gas prices and low basis differential. The sale by Kinder Morgan, coupled with the weak market conditions, led us to determine it was appropriate to record an impairment at this time. Joe will provide more details on this a little later in the call.","After adjusting for the REX impairment, our businesses are performing well and consistent with the plans we shared with you at our Analyst Conference. Given our performance through the first 6 months of the year, we continue to expect to meet our earnings guidance for 2012, which is $4 to $4.30 per share. The full-year guidance excludes both the charge related to the REX and a tax benefit related to a change we've made in the holding period for the life insurance contracts we own. Joe will also discuss this change in more detail and in fact, let me just hand things over to him now to take you through details of the financial results, beginning with Slide 4.","Joseph A. Householder","Thanks, Debbie, and thank you, all, for joining us again. At San Diego Gas & Electric, earnings for the second quarter were $95 million, up from $71 million in the year-ago quarter. This increase was primarily due to higher earnings from Sunrise Powerlink, which was put into service in June of this year. In addition, the earnings comparison was impacted by the timing of wildfire insurance premium recovery. During 2011, insurance premiums expensed in the second quarter were not recovered in revenues until the fourth quarter when the CPUC issued a decision approving the recovery.","Moving to Southern California Gas. Second quarter 2012 earnings were $53 million compared to $59 million in the second quarter of 2011. A decrease was primarily attributable to higher operating expenses and depreciation without the usual revenue increase due to the delay in our GRC decision. Majority of the increased expenses are costs which we expect to recover in full once the rate case decision is final. Please keep in mind that until we receive final decisions in the SDG&E and SoCalGas general rate cases, we will be recording revenues based upon 2011 authorized levels, plus an adjustment for recovery of incremental wildfire insurance premiums at SDG&E based upon recent CPUC decisions for prior year's premiums.","Once those general rate cases are decided, which we now expect to occur in the fourth quarter of this year, we'll record the cumulative impact of the decision from January 1, 2012. In addition to the retroactive impact resulting from the change in authorized revenue, we also expect certain pipeline inspection expenses that are unrelated to our Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan to be fully recovered.","Now please go to Slide 5. For our South American Utilities, earnings were $38 million in the second quarter of 2012, roughly equal to last year's results after excluding the remeasurement gain Debbie mentioned earlier. Second quarter earnings for the Sempra Mexico segment were $43 million compared with $35 million in the same period last year. The increase here was primarily due to tax benefits related to currency and inflation adjustments that were booked in the quarter. This benefit effectively just reverses the tax expense for the same items that we recorded in the first quarter of this year.","Now please turn to Slide 6. Moving on to Sempra U.S. Gas & Power, the natural gas segment lost $193 million in the second quarter of 2012. Excluding the $179 million charge related to REX, the segment lost $14 million. This decrease of $61 million in adjusted earnings was attributable to lower natural gas and power prices, including the impact from the exploration of the CDWR contract at the end of the third quarter of last year.","I'd like to spend a few minutes on our decision to impair REX. As Debbie mentioned, current market conditions are different than when we originally decided to invest in this pipeline, and the current market value suggests that the current book value will not be recovered in full on a present-value basis. Accordingly, we have taken a $179 million after-tax charge to reflect our estimate of the currant value of REX based on a set of assumptions using current market data, forecast of future pipeline capacity and various pipeline flow scenarios. I think it's important to point out that we expect to effectively recover our original investment in REX on a cash basis through a combination of distributions and tax benefits prior to the end of the existing contracts.","Renewables segment generated earnings of $24 million in the second quarter of 2012, up from $4 million in the same period last year. The increase was driven by the addition of solar and wind assets. As you'll recall, we now use the deferral method of accounting for investment tax credits. The change in accounting method reduced the originally reported second quarter 2011 earnings by $8 million or about $0.03 per share.","Now please go to Slide 7. For the second quarter, Parent & Other had earnings of $2 million as compared to a loss of $27 million in the same period last year. This quarter's results included a $54 million tax benefit associated with our decision to hold life insurance contracts that we keep in support of certain benefit plans to term. Proceeds from death benefits under those contracts will be tax-free. Previously, we took the position that we might surrender these contracts before maturity and those transactions would have been taxable. As such, we had recorded taxes on the unrealized gains on investments held within the insurance contracts.","This tax benefit was partially offset in the quarter by an $11 million tax -- consolidated tax expense, which we expect to reverse by year-end. Year-to-date tax benefit related to the life insurance contracts is $47 million, net of a $7 million income tax expense recorded in the first quarter of 2012. Excluding both the noncash charge related to REX and the $43 million net tax benefit recorded at the Parent this quarter, we are pleased with our business unit performance for the quarter and remain on track to meet our targets.","With that, please turn to Slide 8 and I will hand the call back to Debbie.","Debra L. Reed","Thanks, Joe. Now I'd like to update you on some of the key activities within our businesses, starting with our 3 major regulatory proceedings at the California utility: the general rate cases, the cost of capital and the Pipeline Safety Enhancement proceedings. As we mentioned earlier, we are awaiting a final decision on our general rate cases. We now expect to receive a decision in the fourth quarter of this year.","Turning to our cost of capital filings at SDG&E SoCalGas, the commission issued a schedule for this proceedings which calls for intervenor testimony on August 6, hearings in September and then final decision by December 20. The new rate set in this proceeding will be effective January 1, 2013. As you'll recall, for SDG&E, this cost of capital filing only covers CPUC jurisdictional assets. SDG&E's electric transmission assets are regulated by the FERC, which currently has an authorized return on equity of 11.35% on the actual equity held. Currently authorized FERC return on equity is effective until September 2013.","Our Pipeline Safety Enhancement proceeding is progressing. All intervenor and rebuttal testimony has now been filed and evidentiary hearings are scheduled to take place later this month. We'd still expect the final decision on our plan by the first quarter of next year.","Let's move to Slide 9. On the operational side, this was a very significant quarter for us as SDG&E energized the Sunrise Powerlink in mid-June. 117-mile, 500-kV transmission line is a key resource that will bolster our region's electric reliability, particularly the summer during the extended outage at San Onofre. Sunrise will also deliver a significant amount of renewable energy to San Diego, plus provide over $100 million annually in regional economic benefit. From a financial perspective, Sunrise will now move out of our construction work-in-progress account and into rate base. At year-end, we expect our rate base investment in Sunrise to be about $1.4 billion, which reflects the impact of bonus depreciation. As with all transmission and substation investments, Sunrise will earn at the FERC-authorized rate of return on equity.","We also receive CPUC approval in the second quarter on the East County, or ECO Substation. This is a $435 million project that will boost electric reliability in the region and help in increasing the delivery of renewable power to utility customers. Construction should begin later this year and the project being placed in service by 2014. When placed in service, this investment will be included in SDG&E's FERC rate base.","We continue to find attractive growth opportunities in our international businesses. And in Chile, we formed a joint venture with SAESA, a similarly sized distribution company, to develop electric transmission projects. The Chilean government has awarded our joint venture 2 projects as part of a competitive bidding process. These projects, which we expect to complete in 2017, will require a total investment of $160 million by the JV, and our share can be funded by local debt and cash. The Chilean government has also announced a bid due later this year for 5 additional transmission projects, which provides further opportunities to expand our presence in the transmission sector in Chile.","Finally, let me provide you with an update on our progress at Cameron LNG to develop a liquefaction facility. We continue to work closely with our partners, Mitsui, Mitsubishi and GDF SUEZ, on the design and development of the project, and expect to complete the front-end engineering and design work by the end of this year. We are working with these same partners on completing the definitive tolling agreements, and those negotiations should be complete late this year or early next year. We are also working with our partners on the project financing and the joint venture agreement.","On the regulatory front, we remain optimistic that we will receive the DOE non-FTA permit late this year or early next year. We've also begun the FERC permit process and we expect to obtain that permit in the second half of next year.","Now let's go to final slide. I'm pleased that we had a solid quarter, both financially and operationally, across our businesses. While we are disappointed to have to take the noncash charge related to REX this quarter, we do remain focused on executing on our plans to derive the highest value from all of our operations and assets. We remain on track to meet our operating goals, and our long-term growth prospects continue to be strong.","With that, I will stop and open up the call to take any of your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Naaz Khumawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Naaz Khumawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. Joe, do you mind letting me know how much was the Mexico tax gain in the quarter?","Joseph A. Householder","Yes, Naaz, this is Joe. It was about $8 million and prior quarter, it was $7 million. So it's virtually -- it's less than $0.5 million year-to-date.","Naaz Khumawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just can you guys talk about -- I know you impaired REX based on projected cash flow going forward, kind of once the contracts expire, what do you expect to do with REX? And kind of how do you see the pipe progressing, is there a back haul opportunity? And what can you do?","Debra L. Reed","Let me make a couple of comments on it and I'll turn it over to Mark to go through some of our thinking on this because we have done a great deal of modeling, looking at what we think may happen to gas markets post-2019 when the contracts expire. And if you look at how we felt about REX, the one thing that I want to make clear is because the Kinder is in the process of this sale, the way that you value REX for the purpose of assessing whether it's an impaired asset is different because they're in the process of the sale, and it's not the net present value of the future cash flows. You use net present value of the future cash flows versus actual future cash flows. So a lot of what we were looking at is, what is the timing of some of the changes that will all occur in REX, and we do believe that there will be changed flows on that pipeline over time with the development of Marcellus and Utica. It's just a matter of when those occur and what it does to that asset over time. So Mark do you want to talk about that?","Mark A. Snell","Yes, a couple of things. Look, we -- this is still an important asset. And it's a good system to bringing gas now to the Rockies East. But of course, with the development of the Marcellus in particular, as Debbie mentioned, we do think over time after our contracts expire, that flow could reverse and gas for -- will flow from both directions, then go up to Chicago and then to the Midwest, but a couple of things. Just keep in mind, one, as Joe said in his notes and I think it's important, is that we're going to be, by -- before the end of the contract period, we will have recouped all of our investment in either cash distributions or tax benefits. And from an accounting perspective, we'll still have bases left. But economically, we'll have gotten our money back, I think that's important thing to remember. And two, I don't think anybody can -- we don't know with 100% certainty exactly where -- what the revenues will be beyond the contract period but we know that there is interest in going from both directions, and we know that we'll have significant revenues. Now they may not be as good as we have now and that's what we've indicated by our write-down, but I think -- we do think this will be a significant asset going forward.","Naaz Khumawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then just in -- once Kinder does -- if they decide to, and then once they complete the sale, is there -- would you guys reassess the value based on market conditions, as this is my accounting failing me?","Debra L. Reed","Yes. Let me ask Joe to talk about how we look at that.","Joseph A. Householder","Okay. Naaz, the Kinder sales process, as Debbie and Mark said, led us to evaluate the REX investment. But our analysis is based on several scenarios that resulted in the fair value assessment that we put on REX. So we would not expect that the eventual sale will really reveal any information that would cause us to change any of our assumptions within these scenarios. So we would not expect any change in our assessment. Of course, over time new information could come to light, we just don't expect that to occur in the next several years.","Operator","Moving on, we'll hear from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can you just give a little bit of an update on renewable projects put in place during the course of 2012? And also what you're seeing in terms of output or capacity factor levels for some of your gas power plants in the U.S., meaning you're nonregulated gas plants?","Debra L. Reed","Yes, sure. Michael, I'll mention some of the renewables and kind of go through what we have in operation, and then what we have under development right now. Right now in operation, we have Fowler Ridge which is a 100 megawatt, our share. We have Copper Mountain Solar 1 and El Dorado Solar, 58 megawatts, and then we have 125 megawatts at Cedar Creek II Wind, which is our share of that, we own 50% of that. Right now, under development, that's contracted and under construction, we have the Flat Ridge Wind project, which our share is 235 megawatts, and that is to be put in service this year. We have the Mahogany wind project, which was just dedicated this week and our share of that is 71 megawatts, and that's to be completed this year. We're in the process right now of -- on Mesquite Solar, of building that out to a total of 150 megawatts, and we had 98 megawatts energized thus far. And that will be finally complete in 2013. And then we have Auwahi Wind, which is under construction right now, and that is a 11-megawatt wind project which will be done this year. And then we have also under contracts that we're working on construction, the Copper Mountain Solar project and that will be 92 megawatts. And then the ESJ project, which will begin later this year, which will be -- our share is 78 megawatts. And we have a lot of -- bottom line, we have a lot of construction going on. I mean massive amount of construction going on these projects. All the wind projects are scheduled to be done in 2012 before any issues of PTC go away. So they're all scheduled to be done in 2012, with the exception of ESJ, which is not dependent upon PTC because as you know, it's being constructed in Mexico and we just get accelerated depreciation on that. And then I'll have Mark talk about kind of the capacity factors, and maybe a little bit of information on what's happening in the generation front.","Mark A. Snell","Yes, on the generation front, on the gas fired generation front here in Southern California and the West where our plants are located, I think through the quarter we saw continued sort of weak gas prices and weak power prices. Unlike the rest of the country, we still have had fairly mild temperatures here in Southern California, so we really haven't seen much of an uptick or pressure on prices. We are expecting in August and September for that to change. We are seeing an uptick in both spark spreads or -- higher heat rates and better pricing. It's not significantly better, but it is better than it's been. We would expect to be a little bit stronger in the next quarter.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And finally, I know you gave a little bit of an update of this at the Analyst Day, but any further thoughts on natural gas storage development? Or any changes since the Analyst Day?","Mark A. Snell","Yes. No real changes since the Analyst Day. I mean I think the prospects for additional development on the storage side really is going to come in relation to the LNG projects that are in the Gulf. And we are uniquely situated with one of our projects, the Louisiana storage facility, which is -- which would be ideal to serve both our facility there and also the Cheniere facility. So we think that eventually that will get developed and it will be a good asset.","Debra L. Reed","And that facility would be about 19 Bcf when fully developed. Also as Mark mentioned, in that area, we have the Cameron pipeline that serves that LNG facility. And we would anticipate the development of both the storage and that pipeline to serve our facility in Cheniere's.","Operator","Moving on, our next question is from Leslie Rich from JPMorgan.","Leslie Rich - J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Inc.","I wondered if you could just give an update on the cash that you are expecting to repatriate from Latin America? Is that likely to be in the fourth quarter?","Debra L. Reed","So we had indicated that we were planning on having the repatriation begin next year, at the end of next year. And I'll have Joe go through that. One of the reasons that we feel that it's good to wait until next year is that gives us the opportunity to see what happens with all the tax law changes after the election. And then we can really assess if anything is changing that would in anyway modify how we would do our repatriation. Joe, do you want to...","Joseph A. Householder","Leslie, Debbie's right. Everything she said was consistent with what we had at the Analyst Conference. In addition to that, we also still had some intercompany debt that we could move cash from those countries up to the holding company. So we were going to pay off these intercompany loans during this year, so we didn't need to actually pay the dividend this year.","Leslie Rich - J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Inc.","Okay. And then separately, on CapEx, are you tracking in line with the breakout that you gave at the Analyst Day? Year-to-date, I see you've spent about $1.8 billion but it looks like it's distributed a little bit differently. So I just wondered if your CapEx plans are the same, or different?","Debra L. Reed","Yes. Our CapEx for Sempra is right on track to the numbers that we gave at the Analyst Presentation. There's a little bit of differences between one business unit and others, there may be more solar and then some like Humala and some other things that are in -- at SDG&E for projects. But basically, they wash and the CapEx is right on track.","Joseph A. Householder","And also, that -- SDG&E is a little higher in the first because of Sunrise, and then it'll slow off a little.","Operator","And we'll move on to Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just -- a lot of questions have been answered -- but the impact of the REX write-off going forward, I mean it sounds like you guys are contracted. I'm just wondering how it might possibly benefit you guys, a lower depreciation or something?","Debra L. Reed","Yes. I mean there would be benefits from lower depreciations but it's very small in terms of the earnings impact from that. I think that the -- probably, I'm looking at REX, that the biggest potential upside is what happens in the market post-2019 when the contracts expire. And really, how gas flows change in that region, what happens with LNG export, what happens with Canadian gas export and all of the -- and we see some real opportunities there. So -- but that's -- in terms of just the write-down having an impact on earnings, it's quite small. Joe, you want to add anything?","Joseph A. Householder","No, that's right. I mean if you think about the total amount that we rolled off and then the pipeline's a 40-year asset, it's not going to be that much per year. It's something but not significant.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, great. And then the other thing I was sort of wondering was the -- just to clarify on maybe insurance contract, that was associated with some benefit program, it sound like. I was just wondering what a -- if you could just elaborate a little more and that, what caused you to just change your mind in terms of how you're going to be treating that stuff, just -- nothing tremendous, just a little more clarification on that?","Debra L. Reed","Yes, sure. I'll ask Joe to answer that because this really came up as part of our Pension Investment Committee working with the present group, so...","Joseph A. Householder","Yes. Paul, what we really did was we were studying the benefit plans, and what it really relates to is how we fund within the company, deferred compensation and Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans, and we have a trust fund that's set up to do that. And inside that fund, we have a lot of these light insurance contracts and there are investments within those. And when this got set up, it was 10 or 12 years ago when -- just after the merger, and at that time, people weren't sure how all this was going to work and felt that maybe we'll have to cash these in it sometime. But when I came into the job, I started looking at all that and determined there was plenty of liquidity, there was a lot of cash flow, we could even access these life insurance policies to get cash when we needed it. And so it didn't appear reasonable to think that we actually would collapse these policies or cash them in sooner and pay the tax on the income that was earned in there. And so we reversed that tax that we'd been incurring. We've taken the tax expense for the last 10 years on this. It was just reversing what we had booked, it's all a noncash issue.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Kit Konolige from BGC Financial.","Kit Konolige","A question on SONGS. Obviously, you're a part owner there. The Commission, I think, is on the verge of deciding whether to consider what they should do about a nonoperating generating asset. What's your view of -- I don't know, just your perspective on the operational outlook, when and if it might run. And any regulatory overhang and how you expect that to play out.","Debra L. Reed","Well let me try to kind of put our position in light relative to Edison's position on this first. And then kind of go through what we know about that and what our expectations are for the future. First off, just to remind you, SDG&E is a 20% owner in SONGS and we are not the operator. We're not -- we've never been the operator. And our company had no involvement in designing the steam generator replacement or any of that, we basically get the energy out of the plant, then we have a long-term contract with Edison to own 20% of the plant and we get 440 megawatts. Because we're not the operator, when we went through -- when they wanted to build the steam generator, rebuild that. We were very concerned about us taking risk on long term. And our agreement that was approved by the Commission is that all of our O&M is balanced for the plant, so that if Edison asks to spend more than there is in their plant for O&M, SDG&E recovers its actual O&M expenditures for the plant. We also have an account for the purchase power, and the cost of the excess power that we're purchasing now goes into that account to be reviewed by the Commission, but it is also a balancing account. And our expectation would be that we would be able to recover that. And our costs so far during the course of the outage had been about $25 million for that. In terms of looking at the future operation of the plant -- I mean we can understand Edison's position and Edison's position is that they have an agreement with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission where they have to make a filing for restart. And it's our understanding that they're moving towards making the filing for Unit 2 and then later, Unit 3. But Edison cannot determine how long it would take for the NRC to act on that once they make that filing for restart. And so that -- the best that we can tell you is exactly what Edison says on their call and that they're hoping to get the unit started, but that they cannot give a specific date of when the restart will occur because it's dependent upon the NRC approval. We also have a claim to the warranties for our 20% share that Edison has with Mitsubishi, the manufacturer. And we are also an additional insured on the policy that Edison has. And they indicated on their call that they were going to be filing a claim with new NEIL, or putting -- the Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited group that ensures the plant on notice. And so we're an additional insured on that policy. So I think at a high level, our position is different, we do have the balancing account on O&M. We're not the operator. So we pay a lot of attention to this because we get 440 megawatts of power from that plant, and we would like to see it come back online because it ends up being very economical power for our customers.","Kit Konolige","So just to be clear, is the plant -- is your 20% share in SDG&E's rate base?","Debra L. Reed","Yes. Our rate base for SONGS right now is $228 million right now, it's our rate base right now. As of 6\/30, our rate base is $228 million, and that does not include the CWIP and nuclear fuel and all of that, it's just our 6\/30 ending rate base for SONGS. We -- again, we're a little different than Edison because if you will remember, during deregulation, we had to take all these assets out of our rate base, so we basically wrote them down to 0. And so all we have is kind of rate base buildup in SONGS coming from 2001 forward, contrary to any kind of historical rate base.","Kit Konolige","So that -- obviously then, that rate base figure, the $228 million, would be your theoretical exposure if there were some kind of proceeding at the Commission that resulted in exclusion from rate base?","Debra L. Reed","Yes. If -- there's a requirement that the Commission, after the unit has been out for more than 9 months continuously, for the Commission to do an assessment. And they would certainly look at what the circumstances were around this. I mean certainly, the information we're getting is that the Commission is paying attention to this but they delayed today, the OII that they're going to have. And so we would anticipate that they're going to wait and see kind of what the outcome is on this. And then they'll look at it and they'll look at the reasonableness of the actions of the parties in the case. And again, being not the operator, not any at one engaged in design of the facility, I think our position's slightly different than Edison's on this plant.","Kit Konolige","Very good, okay. One other area, it sounded Debbie, as -- you sounded pretty optimistic about DOE approval of the export license for Cameron. Is that any different from your thinking at the Analyst Day? I mean what's new there as far as your read on DOE's action?","Debra L. Reed","Well, we've heard from many parties in Washington that the administration is actually supportive of going forward with LNG export. And that we've heard that they would anticipate having a decision -- or the report coming out on the impacts of LNG export coming out in the end of summer timeframe period. And that after that report comes out, which I've told many of you -- I mean we have 2 reports that pretty much say the same thing, that they don't see a significant impact. It would be hard to believe that this third report would be substantially different than that. And I think after that report comes out, the answer's -- the thought is that there would be the approval of going forward of projects. I would also say that it's very interesting when you look at the actual DOE language, the DOE language presumes approval and it's the burden of proof to show that there would be an adverse effect. So the language is presumptive that export is good and that you're going to have an open market for gas, and that they actually have to prove why it shouldn't be done. And so I think what we're hearing would lead us to believe that this will be moving forward, the issues will -- it'd be the end of this year or first part of next year.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Don Alley [ph] from Decade Capital.","Unknown Analyst","Yes. Just a clarification on Kit's question and one other. When you said year-end, did you mean formal DOE approval, or just the DOE report?","Debra L. Reed","No. We're expecting the non-FTA approval by the end of this year, first of next year.","Unknown Analyst","And then the -- their study on the impacts of exports, when would you expect that?","Debra L. Reed","We would -- I mean whether -- everything we've heard is that the end of summer. And a few weeks ago, we were expecting it be coming out sooner, but by the end of summer is kind of the official word we get.","Unknown Analyst","Got it. And then on Chilean JV, how large would you expect that to grow and over what time period?","Debra L. Reed","I'll ask Mark to cover that. As I mentioned, we have the 2 projects that are in total $160 million. We're bidding on 5 more. I mean these are relatively small projects. They're generally -- and the projects we bid on are generally $80 million to $100 million of projects. So I don't see that getting gigantic. But we do have some good opportunities, we have a good partner to develop with. Mark, do you want to...","Mark A. Snell","Everything you said is exactly right. I -- the only thing I would add to that, as Debbie said, they're reasonably small and manageable-sized projects. It will add to our growth down there but they will be completely funded by earnings that was generated down there and in the local debt market. So there isn't any capital coming from Sempra in the U.S. down to South America to fund these projects. They'll be completely self-funded. So it's the best of all kinds of growth in our foreign entities.","Operator","And that does conclude our time for question and answers today. Ms. Reed, I'll turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Debra L. Reed","Well, thank you all for joining us today. And again, if there's any follow-up questions that you have, Rick Vaccari and our team are there to respond to any questions. Please give them a call, and thank you very much for being with us today.","Operator","And that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you all for your participation."]}}
