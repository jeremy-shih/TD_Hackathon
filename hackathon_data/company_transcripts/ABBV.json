Welcome to the AbbVie Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to introduce Mr. Larry Peepo, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Larry Peepo","Good morning and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Laura Schumacher, Executive Vice President Business Development, External Affairs and General Counsel; Michael Severino, Executive Vice President of Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer; and Bill Chase, Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, I\u2019ll remind you that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.","Additional information about the factors that may affect AbbVie\u2019s operations is included in our 2014 Annual report on Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law.","On today\u2019s conference call as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie\u2019s ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll take your questions.","So with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Rick.","Richard Gonzalez","Thank you, Larry. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. We delivered another strong performance with second quarter results ahead of our expectations including adjusted earnings per share of $1.08 representing growth of more than 31% versus the second quarter of 2014.","Our results included strong operational sales growth of nearly 20% driven by a number of products across the portfolio including strong performance from our newly acquired oncology therapy, IMBRUVICA, continued global uptake of VIEKIRA and continued strong growth from HUMIRA as well as other products in our portfolio including Creon, Synthroid, and Duodopa.","We are particularly pleased with the high quality of our results in the quarter. We saw significant margin expansion, continued R&D investment and SG&A leverage and we delivered these results despite a significant foreign exchange headwind.","We are also pleased with our outperformance and progress year-to-date. We've driven strong commercial, operational and R&D execution resulting in industry-leading top and bottom line performance.","During the quarter, we advanced several important strategic priorities, continued to enhance operational efficiency and achieved a number of regulatory and clinical objectives. Importantly, we completed the acquisition of Pharmacyclics augmenting AbbVie's already strong position and growth prospects. I'll discuss our progress with Pharmacyclics in more detail in just a moment.","We are also driving strong performance from our current portfolio, including HUMIRA which is off to a very good start in the first half of the year with robust underlying global demand and exceptional performance in the U.S. We made significant progress with our mid- and our late-stage R&D programs. During today's call our Chief Scientific Officer, Mike Severino will provide an update on our pipeline.","And we've also continued to improve efficiency across our operations delivering roughly 800 basis points in operating margin expansion this quarter versus the prior year, achieving an operating margin profile of 44.2% and we remain committed to improving this metric across our long-range plan.","This quarter and our first half results demonstrate the significant progress that we've made towards our objective of delivering industry-leading growth. As I mentioned, during the quarter we successfully completed the acquisition of Pharmacyclics, a strategic addition to our business that adds another compelling growth platform to AbbVie's strong prospects in immunology and virology and accelerates AbbVie's clinical and commercial presence in oncology.","While strategically important, the acquisition of Pharmacyclics will also drive strong financial benefits, further diversifying our revenue base, significantly enhancing our revenue growth across our long-range plan and delivering EPS accretion beginning in 2017. And as we have outlined, we expect accretion related to the acquisition in excess of $0.60 per share in 2019 ramping to more than $1.00 per share in 2021.","Pharmacyclics will operate from Sunnyvale, California headquarters under the leadership of Erik von Borcke. Erik has held a number of leadership positions within AbbVie since joining the Company in 2001 including his most recent role as Vice President of Global Marketing. The transition has been seamless and we've been impressed by caliber of talent we've welcomed from Pharmacyclics into AbbVie.","We saw a strong momentum with IMBRUVICA in the quarter. Full second quarter U.S. IMBRUVICA sales were $234 million. We continue to expect IMBRUVICA to drive U.S. sales of approximately $1 billion for the full calendar year 2015. Since we completed the Pharmacyclics transaction we have seen additional positive data and progress on our regulatory objectives, including positive readouts from two Phase 3 studies, HELIOS and RESONATE-2.","With respect to the positive RESONATE-2 data, a significant portion of our valuation for Pharmacyclics was attributed to advancing into first line treatment. And while we assumed a very high probability of success, these data provide strong evidence of IMBRUVICA's dramatic efficacy in the frontline setting and further de-risks this component of our model.","Our virology franchise will be a significant growth driver for us in 2015 and in the years to come. With the launch of Viekira we have established a meaningful position in the HCV market. We continue to see progress particularly internationally which is tracking ahead of our planning assumptions. We received approval in 47 markets and we expect a number of additional countries to come online as the year progresses and into 2016. This includes Japan where we continue to expect a regulatory decision during the second half of this year. As a reminder, in Japan we will commercialize a 12-week, two-pill, once a day ribavirin combination.","Overall, we continue to see excellent progress across our total pipeline. We've advanced several assets into the regulatory approval cycle, we've moved assets into pivotal trials, reported positive data from several assets and we expect additional regulatory approvals as the year progresses.","We are also encouraged with the advancement in de-risking of our mid and our late-stage pipeline. Over the past six months we've reported positive data from several programs. For example, earlier this year we reported positive top line results from the first of two elagolix pivotal trials in endometriosis. Our partner, Galapagos recently reported positive interim topline findings from two Phase 2b studies of our partner in selective JAK1 inhibitor in RA.","We've also recently seen data from the six-month extension trial of the first elagolix endometriosis pivotal study and the results were consistent with the previously reported efficacy and safety findings. Several other assets such as venetoclax in relapsed refractory CLL patients with 17p deletion are demonstrating strong results. We are very encouraged with each of these data readouts.","In summary, we delivered another quarter of strong results exceeding our guidance range for the quarter. When we launched AbbVie back in January of 2013, we set an objective for ourselves, to build an innovation driven, patient focused biopharmaceutical company capable of delivering and sustaining top-tier financial performance. We have made significant progress in building the key strategic elements necessary to deliver on that objective.","We're driving exceptional performance out of our existing portfolio including HUMIRA. We have a robust pipeline with several assets with multibillion-dollar potential. We're achieving significant operational efficiencies which are apparent in our first half 2015 results and we've added another major growth platform with Pharmacyclics and IMBRUVICA.","We've also delivered on our commitments to shareholders with a total shareholder return since launching the company in January of 2013 of more than 125%. We are well-positioned to deliver industry-leading EPS growth in 2015 and we continue to make significant progress advancing our pipeline and other strategic actions that will position AbbVie for top-tier growth through the rest of the decade and beyond.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike. Mike?","Michael Severino","Thank you, Rick. It's an exciting time to be leading research and development at AbbVie. We've got a broad and robust pipeline that includes more than 40 active clinical development programs, including 10 programs in late-stage development or under regulatory review. Our core areas of focus include immunology where we're leveraging our deep expertise to develop next-generation biologics from small molecules that elevate the standard-of-care.","Oncology, including assets to address both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, neuroscience with a particular focus on developing disease modifying therapies for Alzheimer's and other neurotic, degenerative conditions, and virology with an emphasis on continuing to evolve the ACB treatment landscape. We are also placing focused investment in our late-stage programs in women's health with elagolix and renal disease with Atrasentan.","Today I'll cover each of these areas and highlight some of our most promising programs. In immunology, we've established clear leadership positions across therapeutic categories including rheumatology, dermatology and gastroenterology and we're leveraging our expertise to build upon these strong positions. Our strategy is centered upon identifying treatments that offer differentiated profiles relative to currently available therapies with the goal of continuing to raise the standard-of-care.","We have several promising assets in development including two oral selective JAK 1 inhibitors, several biologics and a bi-specific biologic currently in mid-stage trials. Most advanced are our two selective JAK 1 inhibitors on the cusp of completing mid-stage development in RA. As Rick mentioned, earlier this year our partner Galapagos announced positive topline interim data from two Phase 2b studies in RA. Over the next few months we will evaluate data from our internal program ABT-494 and make decisions about next steps.","We also believe our DVD-Ig antibody platform holds tremendous promise in the treatment of immune mediated conditions. ABT-122 is our combination anti-TNF anti-IL-17 two validated mechanisms in Phase 2 trials for RA and psoriatic arthritis. Our early development work with the DVD platform has established as our DVDs have favorable drug-like properties similar to monoclonal antibodies and can be manufactured reliably. We will see data from our mid-stage trial in RA in early 2016. And we have other promising mechanisms in development including an IL-6 Nanobody as well as several early-stage programs.","Finally, in immunology we continue to innovate with HUMIRA. We have new indications and formulations in late-stage development. We recently received a positive opinion from the EMA for hidradenitis suppurativa and we expect a U.S. regulatory decision in the second half of this year.","We also received EMA approval for a new HUMIRA formulation specifically designed to reduce injection pain and reduce injection volume compared to the current formulation. This new formulation is currently under review by the FDA. And we're on track to submit our U.S. and European regulatory applications for Uveitis in the second half following the recent completion and positive results from our second pivotal trial.","The acquisition of Pharmacyclics significantly accelerated AbbVie's clinical and commercial presence in oncology. With IMBRUVICA we've established a leadership position in the treatment of blood cancers and we're well-positioned to build upon that strength with other promising assets in development. Within the hematologic oncology space we have three novel mechanisms that are either on market or in registration enabling trials, DTK, PI 3-kinase and bcl-2 inhibition.","We are well positioned to continue to evolve the treatment landscape with innovative combinations of these and other mechanisms. Our goal is to markedly improve efficacy by achieving deep, durable disease control and\/or remission.","As I mentioned, IMBRUVICA represents our first foray into this therapeutic category and we're pleased with the continued progress we are seeing with IMBRUVICA since the close of the acquisition.","At the recent ASCO meeting, we and our co-development partner Janssen, presented data from the Phase 3 HELIOS trial which studied the combination of bendamustine and rituximab or BR with and without IMBRUVICA in relapsed\/refractory CLL. The study demonstrated that IMBRUVICA improves outcomes when combined with BR illustrating that IMBRUVICA is not only effective as a single agent, but is also potent safe when used in combination.","We also announced topline results from the Phase 3 RESONATE-2 trial comparing IMBRUVICA monotherapy to chlorambucil in patients aged 65 or older with previously untreated CLL. The results illustrate that treatment with IMBRUVICA improved progression free survival in multiple secondary endpoints including overall survival in the first-line setting.","We plan to present and publish the full results and will submit the data to regulatory authorities in the second half, building upon our existing set of indications and expanding into the frontline CLL setting.","We've also continued to make progress with our first-in-class BCL-2 inhibitor, venetoclax. At the recent EHA Meeting we presented updated study results showing patients with relapsed\/refractory CLL taking venetoclax in combination with rituximab had an overall response rate of 84% with 41% of patients achieving a complete response. While early, these encouraging results speak to the valuable role venetoclax may play in novel combinations with the potential to restate standard-of-care in a variety of these cell malignancies.","We recently received the FDA's breakthrough therapy designation for venetoclax in relapsed\/refractory patients with a 17p deletion of genetic mutation. We plan to present the data that supported this designation at the upcoming ASH Meeting and we remain on track to submit our regulatory applications for the 17p deletion indication by the end of 2015.","Our hematologic oncology pipeline also includes duvelisib a dual PI 3 kinase gamma\/delta inhibitor being investigated for the treatment of a wide range of blood cancers. And we have partnered with Bristol-Myers Squibb on elotuzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CS1 a protein primarily expressed on the surface of myeloma cells in late-stage development for frontline and relapsed\/refractory multiple myeloma.","Data from the Phase 3 study in relapsed\/refractory patients recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that adding elotuzumab to standard treatment significantly reduced the risk of disease progression. We expect our partner to submit regulatory applications for this indication this year. We are also leveraging this mechanism within the context of our antibody drug conjugate platform with ABBV E3A and anti-CS1 ADC currently in early-stage clinical development.","Our pipeline also includes late-stage assets in development for the treatment of solid tumors. Veliparib is our PARP inhibitor being investigated as a treatment for several solid tumor types. In contrast other PARP inhibitors in development which are being evaluated as monotherapy specifically in cancers with inherited genetic deficiencies in DNA repair any later lines of therapy we've taken a different approach with Veliparib.","We have numerous ongoing Phase 3 trials evaluating Veliparib in combination with common DNA damaging chemotherapies in a wide range of clinical settings. Veliparib has demonstrated promising signals of efficacy and is currently in late-stage development for breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer.","Additionally, we plan to evaluate Veliparib in combination with checkpoint inhibitors with clinical trials planned for 2016. We are leveraging our strong capabilities in protein engineering with ABT-414 our antibody drug conjugate for glioblastoma multiforme or GBM. GBM is the most common and most aggressive type of malignant primary brain tumor. The early data for ABT-414 are promising and we recently initiated additional single arm studies and a randomized controlled trial in second line GBM which could provide a pathway to registration if the data are consistent with earlier phase studies.","Certainly the area of the immuno-oncology has recently garnered significant attention. We have an active discovery program with an objective to drive the next wave of immuno-oncology development beyond checkpoint inhibitors. We are particularly focused on the use of our bi-specific platform to support conditional activation of the immune system in the vicinity of tumor cells. And we are leveraging the emerging science of soluble T-cell receptor technology as well. We anticipate multiple immuno-oncology assets moving into the clinic in the 2016 timeframe.","Our virology franchise will be a significant growth driver for us in 2015 and in the years to come. With the launch of VIEKIRA we have established a meaningful position in the HCV market and our current position will serve as a base from which we will launch further innovation. We are on track with our next-generation HCV program to bring to market a ribavirin-free, once-daily, pan-genotypic combination with high rates of efficacy and a competitive duration of therapy.","Earlier this year, we disclosed preliminary results from a Phase 2b study of our next-generation protease inhibitor ABT-493 and our next-generation NS5A inhibitor ABT-530. The interim data showed that treatment with our next-generation combination in non-cirrhotic genotype 1a and 1b treatment-na\u00efve and experienced patients receiving the ribavirin-free therapy for 12 weeks resulted in an SVR4 rate of 99%.","Today I am pleased to report that the SVR 12 results are really impressive. In fact, the dose we intend to pursue in Phase 3 drove an SVR 12 rate of 100%. Evaluation in other genotypes continues to progress with encouraging results and we are also evaluating shorter duration of therapy with this combination. We expect to present data from the Phase 2 studies at the AASLD Meeting later this year and we remain on track to advancing into Phase 3 development this year with commercialization expected in 2017.","In neuroscience we're focused on pursuing transformational therapies for the treatment of conditions like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's, MS and other neurodegenerative conditions. Zinbryta, our investigational biologic for relapsing\/remitting multiple sclerosis is currently under regulatory review in the U.S. and Europe with regulatory decisions expected in the first half of 2016.","The filings are based upon strong pivotal trial results which demonstrated patients treated with Zinbryta had a statistically significant 45% reduction in annualized relapse rate versus Avonex an established standard-of-care. Given the product profile, novel mechanism of action and its once monthly subcutaneous administration, we believe Zinbryta has the potential to be an important therapeutic option.","We're also in the early stages of our U.S. launch of Duodopa for advanced Parkinson's disease which was approved earlier this year. We are continuing to innovate with Duodopa working on drug delivery improvements and moving toward less invasive approaches and continued improvements in the Duodopa pump.","We also have numerous early-stage neuroscience programs underway that have the potential to come to fruition in the later years or our long-term plan. For example, earlier this year we entered into a collaboration with C2N Diagnostics to develop and commercialize a portfolio of anti-tau antibodies for the treatment of serious brain disorders. Tau is a key protein associated with the pathologic progression of Alzheimer's diseases and like amyloid tau also has the ability to be imaged and tracked in the central nervous system.","We recently received an orphan drug designation and initiated a Phase 1 program in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy, a rare and debilitating neurologic disease. We're on track to start clinical development with C2N in Alzheimer's disease in 2016.","Finally, as I mentioned, we continue to make focused investment in our late-stage programs in renal disease and woman's health. Atrasentan is our internally discovered selective endothelin antagonist in late stage development for the prevention of progression of diabetic kidney disease. A large global Phase 3 program is currently underway evaluating the impact of Atrasentan on renal outcomes such as the onset of end-stage renal disease, transplantation or death due to renal failure.","Elagolix is our compound in Phase 3 development for endometriosis and Phase 2b for uterine fibroids. Given the high prevalence of these conditions and the current lack of treatment options we view elagolix as a significant opportunity. Our goal with elagolix in endometriosis is to bring to market an oral therapy that provides a high level of efficacy with minimal menopausal side effects such as hot flash while preserving bone health.","Earlier this year we announced positive top-line results from the first of two ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials. Initial results from the study showed that after six months of treatment both doses of elagolix met the study's co-primary endpoints with the safety profile consistent with prior studies. We have also now seen data from the six-month extension of the first elagolix endometriosis pivotal study and the results were consistent with previously reported efficacy and safety findings. We will see top line results from the second pivotal study in endometriosis in the first quarter of 2016, and we plan to disclose top-line data from our Phase 2b trial in uterine fibroids in the fall.","So in summary, since the start of the year we've made significant progress and are on track to advance several programs in the coming months. We've built a promising late-stage pipeline comprised of potentially transformational medicines which will fuel our future growth.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on the quarter and 2015. Bill?","William Chase","Thank you, Mike. This morning I'll review our second quarter performance and provide an update on our outlook for 2015. As Rick said, we are very pleased with the strong quarter we delivered. Operational growth on the top-line was a very strong 19.4% excluding an 8.3% negative impact from foreign exchange. Reported sales were up more than 11%.","HUMIRA delivered global sales of more than $3.5 billion, up 16.4% on an operational basis. We continue to see strong momentum for HUMIRA as the market leader around the world. On a reported basis currency had a negative 8.8% impact on global HUMIRA sales and reduced international HUMIRA sales by nearly 18%. U.S. HUMIRA sales increased nearly 29% driven by prescription volume and favorable pricing impacts. We've seen acceleration in market growth this year in the U.S. with HUMIRA driving double-digit growth in the gastro, rhum and derm segments. Wholesale inventory remained constant at less than half a notch.","Internationally HUMIRA sales have grown nearly 9% on an operational basis in the first half of the year consistent with our planning capitalizations [ph]. As we noted last quarter, the first quarter international growth rate of nearly 15% was favorably impacted by the timing of shipments in select markets. Consequently international sales growth in the second quarter was negatively impacted by the shipment timing. Market growth internationally remained strong with most major markets experiencing double-digit growth and HUMIRA's international market share has remained stable despite new competitors and the launch of biosimilar infliximab.","HUMIRA's momentum has not been adversely impacted by the biosimilar. For the full year 2015 we continue to expect global HUMIRA sales growth in the mid-teens on an operational basis. This reflects a forecast for the U.S. growth approaching 30% and 9% to 10% operational growth internationally.","Global Viekira sales in the quarter were $385 million. In the U.S. we are wrapping share in our exclusive accounts and have now achieved our target level of penetration and our largest contract. As we've said previously, the contribution of the international launch has exceeded our planning expectations, which will lead to a higher mix of international sales this year. International sales of Viekira in the second half will also benefit from an expected approval in Japan where we will commercialize a two-drug, once daily, ribavirin-free combination.","As Rick noted, total U.S. sales of IMBRUVICA in the quarter were strong at $234 million. Given the May 26 closing date for the Pharmacyclics transaction, we recorded a partial quarter of IMBRUVICA sales including $97 million of U.S. sales and $10 million of international profit-sharing. For 2015 we anticipate Pharmacyclics adding more than $750 million to our top-line for revenue occurring after the May 26 closing date.","Global Lupron sales were $198 million in the quarter, up nearly 10% on an operational basis. For the full year 2015 we expect Lupron sales to be roughly in line with 2014. U.S. sales of Synthroid were $187 million, up nearly 12% versus the prior year quarter. For the full year 2015 we expect modest growth for Synthroid.","AndroGel sales were $170 million, down significantly due to continued market declines and the entry of generic competition for the 1% formulation. We expect AndroGel sales somewhat above $500 million for the full year 2015. U.S. Creon sales were $159 million in the quarter, up significantly from the prior year. We continue to capture the vast majority of new prescription starts in the pancreatic enzyme market. We expect double-digit sales growth for Creon in 2015.","Sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease grew more than 20% on an operational basis in the quarter. We expect continued double-digit growth for Duodopa with a modest level of U.S. sales in 2015. Our U.S. launch will be getting underway this quarter and as we've said previously, we anticipate a gradual ramp for product sales in the U.S. this year as physicians grow familiar with the product.","Turning to the P&L profile for the second quarter, since becoming an independent company we placed a high priority on becoming more efficient in driving operating margin improvement. We are pleased with our progress in the quarter as we delivered an adjusted operating margin of 44.2% of sales.","Excluding a modest negative impact from Pharmacyclics our operating margin improved 820 basis points versus the prior year quarter. More than 500 basis points of this improvement was driven by efficiencies and P&L leverage. We showed continued improvement in gross margin as a percentage of sales in the quarter. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 85.3%, up 570 basis points from the prior year quarter driven by exchange, operational efficiencies and product mix.","Adjusted R&D was 15.9% of sales reflecting funding actions and support of our pipeline assets. Adjusted SG&A was 25.1% of sales in the quarter, down from the prior year contributing to overall continued improvement in operating margin leverage.","Adjusted net interest expense was $137 million reflecting the impact of debt issued in conjunction with the Pharmacyclics acquisition. The adjusted tax rate was 21.9% in the quarter. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share excluding non-cash intangible amortization expense and specified items were $1.08, up 31.7% year-over-year and exceeding our previous guidance range. On a GAAP basis earnings per share were $0.83.","Moving on to our outlook for the remainder of the year we are confirming our 2015 adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.10 to $4.30. This range reflects EPS growth of 23% to nearly 30%. Our 2015 adjusted guidance range includes the previously communicated $0.20 dilutive impact of the Pharmacyclics acquisition. It excludes $0.84 of intangible amortization of specified costs including Pharmacyclics transaction costs. Regarding the P&L profile for 2015 the following estimates have been updated to include the impact of significant foreign exchange and the Pharmacyclics acquisition. ","On the top-line we expect revenue growth on an operational basis of roughly 20%. We are forecasting approximately 7% negative top-line impact from currency this year resulting in a reported sales growth of around 13%. We are forecasting a significant increase in our operating margin profile which we expect to reach approximately 42% of sales in 2015.","Excluding the negative impact from the Pharmacyclics acquisition, we expect to deliver roughly 650 basis points of improvement over the prior year, about 500 basis points of this improvement results from efficiency initiatives and leverage across the income statement.","We are forecasting an adjusted gross margin ratio approaching 83%. This is an increase from our original guidance reflecting significant year-over-year improvement driven by the impact of exchange, product mix and actions we've taken to further improve our margin profile.","We will continue to invest in our pipeline supporting our exiting opportunities in oncology, HCV immunology and other areas. We are forecasting R&D expense of approximately 16% of sales and we expect to continue investing in our growth brands with SG&A levels at approximately 25% of sales.","We are now forecasting net interest expense of about $625 million for the full year including the incremental debt from the Pharmacyclics acquisition. And we continue to expect an adjusted tax rate in the 22% range in 2015.","Regarding the third quarter we expected adjusted earnings per share of $1.05 to $1.07. This excludes roughly $0.14 as specified items in non-cash amortization and includes the impact of Pharmacyclics dilution. We expect third quarter revenue growth on an operational basis in the low 20 percentage range excluding approximately 7% negative impact from exchange.","So in conclusion, we're very pleased with the level of quality in the quarter and our performance in the first half of 2015. We\u2019ve driven strong top and bottom line growth and delivered operating margin expansion while also advancing our strategic priorities. This put us in a strong position to deliver top-tier industry growth this year and in the years to come.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Larry.","Larry Peepo","Thanks, Bill. We\u2019ll now open the call up for questions. Operator, we\u2019ll take our first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Okay, sir. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ms. Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jami Rubin","Thank you very much. Hope you guys can hear me okay. With respect to HUMIRA international sales you've pointed to shipment timing, tough comparisons and FX as reasons for the underperformance, but wouldn\u2019t REMICADE biosimilars be the real culprit here? What evidence specifically can you share with us that suggests that this quarter performance was more of a one-timer verses a new trend? I mean may be you can share what you're seeing in terms of market share changes et cetera?","And then a question for your Rick, on potential for U.S. biosimilars, as you know Amgen filed an IPR on the two long data pats, may be you can talk to those patents that are being challenged and put that into the context of your broader patent defense strategy. Thanks very much.","RichardGonzalez","Thanks, all right Jami. Jami, this is Rick, good morning. I'll take the first question and let Laura Schumacher answer the second question for you. So it\u2019s a good question and I\u2019m going to answer your question, I\u2019d say very directly and very clearly because I want to make sure that there is no misunderstanding or confusion around this issue.","But the bottom line when we\u2019ve done is I would tell you that we have seen no impact from Remicade biosimilar on HUMIRA in the international market, but I\u2019ll give you some color to be able to support that. so I'm going to go back to the first quarter, when we announced first quarter results, if you look at Bill\u2019s formal remarks, in his remarks we identified the fact that they benefited from shipment timing and that is exactly what we\u2019re seeing here and I would tell you that the impact we\u2019re seeing here is consistent with what we expected in that.","Secondly, I\u2019d tell you that when we put out the original guidance on HUMIRA, both at the beginning of the year and then when we raised guidance, within that guidance range we had assumed international performance growth of HUMIRA at 9% to 10%. If you look at the performance in the first quarter, we delivered 14.9% growth in the first quarter, second quarter was 3.6%, the average for the two quarters or the first half of the year is 8.8%.","We are confirming now explicitly that the second half is forecasted internationally to be 9% to 10% which is exactly what it was in the original guidance. We are also confirming the original guidance. So obviously we feel that we were sitting here with our toes hanging over the edge of the cliff that would be an awfully foolish thing to do. So I can tell you we absolutely have no concerns around that.","So let\u2019s talk specifically around what we\u2019re seeing with biosimilars and I\u2019ll give you a little bit of facts maybe to support it. So the biosimilar Remicade has been approved now in 46 countries. It is actually launched in about 36 of those countries. They participated in five national tenders and they participated in about 11 regional hospital tenders. If you look at markets that they have been in for more than a year to be able to measure what their market share is, their total market share is 2.8%.","So they haven\u2019t any meaningful impact. We measured every one of those markets that they are in, we've been doing it from the very beginning and in those markets HUMIRA continues to grow as we would have expected it. We don\u2019t see any impact from nor did we expect any impact from Remicade biosimilars within those markets. We obviously continue to watch that.","If we look at the pricing within those markets, the medium discount versus the innovator is about 25% odd. For the ones that were tendered it is a little over 50% odd which again is in the range of what we would have expected. The reaction that we\u2019re seeing in the market is consistent with what we expected. And so I would just tell you that it is playing out as we anticipated. Now we need to continue to monitor, but I can tell you that we don\u2019t have any concerns in that area as we would have expected.","So the reality is, this is nothing more than movement of shipments between a handful of countries. I'll give you a couple of examples maybe to make you feel a little better. So if you take France which I know there has been a lot of public concern about France, if you look at our growth rate in the first quarter and our growth rate in the second quarter they\u2019re almost identical. If you look at Canada our growth rate accelerated between first and second quarter. If you look at the Netherlands our growth rate accelerated between first and second quarter.","Now there are countries where clearly we saw tenders move around. There weren\u2019t any countries that we're impacted by biosimilars, they were due to other events. So reality is, this is nothing more than shipment timing. Did I answer your question? I think we might have muted her line.","Jami Rubin","The IPR?","Richard Gonzalez","Go ahead on the IPR.","Laura Schumacher","With respect to your question about Amgen\u2019s IPR, as we\u2019ve said before, we have a broad portfolio of IP covering manufacturing, process, formulation and methods that we use. Amgen\u2019s IPR does not impact our patent strategy. We don\u2019t know why Amgen selected the two formulation patents that it did to challenge, potentially challenge an IPR, but it does give some perspective on the breadth of our IP including over 40 additional patents that are not the subject of the IPR.","Richard Gonzalez","Thanks Jami. Operator we will take our next question please.","Operator","Okay sir. Our next question comes from Mr. Jeff Holford of Jefferies. Sir your line is open.","Jeffrey Holford","Hi, there does still seem to be a lot of noise on the line it is not coming from me. First question is on new HUMIRA, the one you just had approved in Europe. Can you just give us a bit more color around some numerical data, whatever you have on the clinical differentiators you seem to have on pain and injection volume, just give us a bit more review whether the label that you are getting is going to help you potentially do hard switches in some of the markets you were thinking about? And how this product could help you in the future potentially as a biosimilar defense mechanism, because that\u2019s not entirely clear from this?","And then just on Viekira contracts in the U.S., could you just give us any updates on how these are actually playing out versus how you thought they were going to, just some of the metrics that you are looking at? And then, just last question around Viekira, does your run rate for the last quarter of the year, the $3 billion run rate that you are looking at, does that assume a full quarter Japan, how important is that in your minds at achieving that run rate? Thanks very much.","Richard Gonzalez","Okay, very good. So Jeff, this is Rick. I\u2019ll answer most of the first question. Let me see if Mike may be able to add a little bit of specificy. So there were two benefits that the new formation was designed to do. We know that there are patients who ultimately stop therapy with the current product because of the pain that they feel upon injection. So we know that\u2019s an important driver of adherence of the product and so we designed this product as a differentiation. The clinical data Mike, I don\u2019t recall the specific numbers, do you recall the actually percent?","Michael Severino","This is Mike. So there are data in the studies that were submitted to regulatory agencies. We\u2019re still waiting on a final labeling in the U.S. and Europe. So I think it\u2019s probably a bit premature, numbers that might in labeling, but we assessed this in the course of the clinical development program. ","Richard Gonzalez","But what I would say is, it\u2019s a significant reduction in pain, a very significant reduction in pain. The second part is that this will also allow us to ultimately reduce the volume of injection, volume and therefore potentially over time reduce the number of injections particularly on the loading dose. So as we said before this is an incremental improvement to the product. We think it\u2019s a meaningful improvement. We\u2019ve obviously studied the different kinds of things that we could do HUMIRA. We have other things that we\u2019re continuing to work on. But we think these are a meaningful opportunity to be able to launch the product.","We haven\u2019t formally decided exactly how the product will launch or at least formally announced how the product will launch. So I\u2019m not going to talk through any details around whether or not it will a full conversion or ultimately a phased-in kind of an approach based on certain countries. And so that\u2019s essentially how we see the product and we do think it will differentiated in a significant enough way. It will have both a material impact on HUMIRA itself, HUMIRA\u2019s performance itself, as well as a differentiator versus competitors.","So on Viekira pack as far as contracting is concerned I think the contracting hasn\u2019t changed a lot in the U.S. from the last time we talked on the call. As we indicated we had a number of exclusive contracts that were coming online. They are now up and running. We are ramping within those particular contracts. I\u2019d say we are ramping within the expectations that we expected.","If you look at our single largest customer in the U.S., that\u2019s an exclusive, we\u2019ve now reached peak share there and so ultimately we\u2019ve reached the level of share that we had anticipated, and it\u2019s a very high level of share. And so now the rest of the growth will be around driving these incremental contracts and then also driving additional share gains within the parity accounts and the non-exclusive accounts. And that\u2019s the work that goes on day by day by day.","As far as the $3 billion running rate that we\u2019ve talked about before, I\u2019d say we\u2019re still tracking against that U.S. specifically. Is Japan important? It does assume that we have a full quarter of Japan and I would say Japan is an important market for us. Now based on everything that we know today and the competitiveness of that product and where we are in the regulatory cycle, I think we should get a full quarter\u2019s worth of Japan potentially, but maybe a little bit better than that.","As we look at Viekira, the other thing I\u2019d say is, when we originally launched Viekira our expectation was that we would build this into a meaningful product for us and then position ourselves so that as we launched a next generation asset which as you know we've described as a pan-genotypic, ribavirin-free, QD product and the profile of next generation is maintaining consistent with what we would have expected that then with the launch of that we will continued to gain further share with that product as we introduced that product in that marketplace.","If we look at our performance so far, I think we\u2019re up by I don\u2019t know 67% quarter-over-quarter if you look at just the second quarter running rate as the product is tracking at about at about a $1.5 billion product and continuing to grow nicely.","The international side of the business obviously has performed better than the U.S. I think the U.S. has not met our expectations and I think we understand why and we\u2019re continuing to work on that, but certainly the international market is performing incrementally better than what we expected. And so, I think everything we are looking at right now would suggest that that should be a solid number.","I'd say there are three factors that are important for that to happen and we\u2019re continuing to monitor those three things, one is we have seen patient volumes in the U.S. overall volumes in the market decline. Latest data would suggest genotype-1 patients are down around 175,000 to 180,000 now on an annualized basis. We\u2019re assuming that's the level that it will stabilize at and I think the data would suggest that that is a reasonable assumption.","Second assumption is that the VA has run into funding difficulties. So the level of patients that they\u2019re treating is down and we are assuming that starting October 1, that they will get additional funds and they will come back up to the level that we saw in the earlier part of the year. And then the third assumption obviously is Japan that we just talked about. So those are the three things that I think will drive the ultimate performance.","I guess the last thing I\u2019d say is, if you look at our overall performance in the first half and both in second quarter, I think it demonstrates the strength of the business that we have here. If you look at consensus we were slightly off the consensus number for Viekira this quarter, but yet we over performed. And we over performed because we delivered better operational efficiency, we delivered over performance in other areas. And the balance of our business and our ability to be able to still deliver strong performance even when there are changes, I think is could be one reassuring our investors and two it demonstrates the strength of the overall business.","Jeffrey Holford","Thanks. That is very helpful color and congratulations on a great IMBRUVICA number.","Larry Peepo","Thanks Jeff. Next question operator.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Mark Goodman of UBS. Sir your line is open.","Mark Goodman","Yes, good morning. First of all, you have a guidance range that is pretty wide, I was just wondering why you didn\u2019t tighten it this quarter? Second you talked about immuno-oncology you would have multiple assets in the clinic by next year, can you talk about are these going to be similar types of assets to the PD-1 and PD-L1 things like that are they kind of the next wave of products?","Richard Gonzalez","Okay. This is Rick. I will cover the first one. We haven\u2019t narrowed the guidance range yet, we probably will here as we get closer to third quarter narrow the guidance range. And I'd say the primary reason for that is foreign exchange has certainly been more challenging than we anticipated and we want to see how that plays out.","We told investors that we were going to cover foreign exchange. That we weren\u2019t going to do \u2013 we weren\u2019t going to pass that on and so we just want to see another quarter\u2019s worth of performance here and what foreign exchange does over that period of time to feel more comfortable that when we narrow the range or within a range that we are comfortable with. It is just that simple. And them Mike why don\u2019t you talk about immuno-oncology?","Michael Severino","Certainly, with respect to immuno-oncology, we\u2019re really referring to the next wave of programs. These would be things beyond PD-1 and PD-L1 or perhaps they might combine well with those mechanisms, but we\u2019re looking at driving for treatment results that can't be achieved today. So we would be referring to novel mechanisms.","Larry Peepo","Thanks Mark. Operator, we will take our next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open.","Alex Arfaei","Good morning folks and thank you for taking my questions.","Richard Gonzalez","Good morning.","Alex Arfaei","Regarding HUMIRA, you mentioned you are seeing accelerated market growth in the U.S. very impressive U.S. performance by the way. Are you seeing increased penetration of biologics in these markets or is it overall volume growth or both? And can you provide more color on some of the efficiencies we are seeing, some of the operating efficiencies we\u2019re seeing? Where are you cutting and why? Thank you.","Richard Gonzalez","So Alex on HUMIRA, if you look at the U.S., it\u2019s really been a remarkable story. If you look at market growth last year, it was in the 6% range. That has now moved to about a 13%. We\u2019ve held that pretty steady across the quarter. So what that\u2019s a sign of is that the SG&A that we put behind the brand continues to work and it continues to give a positive return. And the way that that growth is delivered is in fact by penetration as well as improved patient compliance and a number of other things. But there is definitely a penetration element that is the big growth driver in this market. And as you know all of the autoimmuno segments are relatively under penetrated versus what you would expect given the power of a biologic. So that is a big part of the story.","In terms of efficiencies, look, we\u2019ve been focused on efficiencies from the very beginning now they shake on the number of different places. In manufacturing, they are the traditional efficiencies you would expect, whether it be purchasing, better utilization of plants or in some cases even take offline non-productive capacity, we've done all of those sorts of things.","Across the P&L though, leverage itself presents a different type of efficiency, right. We\u2019re obviously no longer in a situation where we need to grow expense in at the same rate of the top line. In fact, if you look at our expense growth particularly on SG&A it is far, far, far, below what the top-line is growing and that\u2019s pretty much the new model for this business now that we\u2019ve made the investments we needed to make back in '13 and '14 and we\u2019re on track to start delivering growth through the introduction of new products in '15 and beyond. So there are really two different types of efficiencies in the numbers.","Alex Arfaei","Thank you.","Larry Peepo","Thanks, Alex. Next question please, operator.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is open.","Mark Schoenebaum","Okay. Hey, guys, thanks a lot for the transparency, always the most detailed prepared remarks of any company, any big company, so thanks for that. I just want to go back to the central point that others have asked about. Because the stock is off right now and the consistent feedback I\u2019m getting is that people are just very concerned about the rest of the world's HUMIRA numbers.","So my question is really simple; one, what was the sequential volume growth for rest of the world HUMIRA? Two, what was the average change in price quarter-on-quarter in the 2Q, please?","And then my second question if I may is, you guys I think as mentioned that you might contemplate in the Analyst Meeting or you might provide some long-term financial targets or vision and go over the pipeline, and then you would contemplate this once the PCYC deal is closed. So I\u2019d just like to know what your current thinking is on that? Thank you and congratulations on a great stock move this quarter.","William Chase","Thanks, Mark. So Mark on HUMIRA, the volume growth quarter-over-quarter was slightly above 10%, overall price was 6% on a global basis.","Mark Schoenebaum","Do you have just rest of the world?","William Chase","Rest of the world had negative price of 4.1 and volume was up over 7%.","Mark Schoenebaum","The volume was up over 7%, rest of the world. Okay.","William Chase","Yes.","Mark Schoenebaum","Got it. People are very confused out there. Thank you.","William Chase","Thank you.","Richard Gonzalez","And then Mark, this is Rick. On the Analyst Meeting, yes it is something we are still considering, I think as you indicated maybe in one of your remarks, I think timing wise if we decide to do it, it probably will be at the beginning of the year, maybe time with a major meeting where it would be convenient for investors to be able to participate. We haven\u2019t made a final decision yet, but we will communicate something around that at some point here, probably third quarter. ","Mark Schoenebaum","And just to confirm the HUMIRA numbers, those were sequential correct?","William Chase","Quarter-over-quarter 2015 versus '14.","Mark Schoenebaum","Do you have the sequential numbers 1Q this year versus 2Q and then I\u2019ll stop.","William Chase","I don\u2019t have them handy, because we don\u2019t typically look it at that way. I would say price will be relatively flat quarter-to-quarter, price would be probably down about may be 2% quarter-over-quarter. But I don\u2019t have a firm volume number for you. Would you followup with me on that?","Mark Schoenebaum","Was it positive?","William Chase","Yes.","Mark Schoenebaum","It was positive. Okay. Thank you.","Richard Gonzalez","Was the price positive, he\u2019s asking...","William Chase","No price was negative.","Mark Schoenebaum","Okay.","William Chase","The volume was positive.","Mark Schoenebaum","Thank you.","Larry Peepo","Thanks Mark. Next question please operator.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Sir, your line is open.","Chris Schott","Great. Thanks very much for the questions and just couple of quick ones here. First can you just quantify the impact to gross margins from FX in the quarter and in your annual guidance? I\u2019m just trying to get a best sense of what type of underlying growth we are seeing on that gross margin line as we're going through the year here?","The second question was on the IL-17 just would be interested in your perspective on what those products are going to kind of mean for the psoriasis market and as you think about HUMIRA over time? And a final one, just so I just come back to clarify some of the earlier comments on the new HUMIRA formulation and launch dynamics, just want to make sure I understood the comments.","Should we think about when this product launches it is going to basically fully replace the prior version of HUMIRA in whatever countries it goes out in or is this going to be a conversion type process, we have to go to physicians, get them to select the new version for more of a gradual process? Just wanted to make sure I understood your earlier comments. Thanks very much.","William Chase","So Chris, on gross margins I'm just going to just give you some numbers. So our gross margin was up about 570 basis points. Pharmacyclics diluted that by about 50 basis points. So if you exclude Pharmacyclics we are up 620 basis points, just over half of that was exchanged.","And then for the year very similar story, different numbers but similar story, gross margin we are forecasting up around 300 basis points. Pharmacyclics will have about 90 basis points to a full point impact. So net-net excluding Pharmacyclics, you would expect to see about a 400 basis point improvement of which again just slightly over half is exchange.","Michael Severino","Okay. So this is Mike. I\u2019ll take the second component of your question. With respect to the IL-17s, I think clearly the IL-17s in plaque psoriasis demonstrate very strong efficacy. There are areas where their profile is not quite as compelling in psoriatic arthritis for example. The initial uptake of the 17s has been relatively slow. We would expect the dermatologist would take some time to become comfortable with the new mechanism before they would adopt it. So we feel comfortable about the trajectory of HUMIRA in the psoriasis space for quite some time.","Richard Gonzalez","Okay. And on the new formulation, I mean we really can\u2019t talk specifically about what the strategy is because it\u2019s somewhat condition on the regulatory approval and we don\u2019t have regulatory approvals yet all around the world. But there probably will be situations where it will be a replacement product, meaning it will replace not over a very short period of time, but over a relatively short period of time as inventory runs out of the old product, the new product will replace the old product and we will only maintain the new product in the marketplace. I would say that will probably be the predominant model that is out there, but it might not be the exclusive model that is out there depending upon the regulatory approvals.","Chris Schott","Thanks very much.","Larry Peepo","Thanks Chris. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Robyn Karnauskas of Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open.","Robyn Karnauskas","Hello, it\u2019s Mr. Robyn Karnauskas, thanks for taking my question.","Richard Gonzalez","Glad to meet you.","Robyn Karnauskas","All right, so two quick questions, one you didn\u2019t mentioned anything about celiac disease, I am wondering if you could comment on did the program fail or are you still interested in that program?","Second question on HUMIRA II, the new HUMIRA, do you think will be able to track that in any way will it be given a different name? Just wondering like how the Street will be able to monitor that as it has an uptick?","And then the last question big picture for your RA franchise given that looks like you don\u2019t have to go through the patent dance and Amgen\u2019s filing an IPR which could speed up sort of the clarity around when they are actually going to launch. How do you view the time lines for some of your emerging RA drugs and whether it is important to get them on the market sooner or whether or not you'll still be okay if Amgen\u2019s biosimilar hits ahead of their launch? Thanks.","Michael Severino","So, this is Mike. With respect to celiac disease, we're still evaluating the opportunity and we\u2019ve not reached a decision point yet.","Richard Gonzalez","Okay and Robyn this is Rick. I will cover the HUMIRA formulation. Again it is consistent with what I described to you before. It will depend upon the regulatory approval. So we don\u2019t know the answer to that yet. It could be that it has the exact same name as the current product and therefore you wouldn\u2019t necessarily have any direct visibility to it. It could be HUMIRA plus some designation after HUMIRA and therefore we would be able to track it, or you would be able to track it in some separate fashion. So we\u2019re going to see how that plays out before I can give you an accurate answer.","And then, I'd just say on the big picture piece, I'd say the IPR doesn\u2019t necessarily change anything that we thought about before from a timing standpoint. As we've said and as Laura mentioned a momentum ago, we have a broad group of, or portfolio of IP. We have some very important patents in this area and we intend to enforce those patents and this IPR process won\u2019t affect those timelines as we\u2019ve assumed it.","Robyn Karnauskas","Okay, great. Thank you.","Larry Peepo","Thanks Robyn. Operator, we have time for one more question please.","Operator","Okay sir. Our last question comes from Mr. Steve Scala from Cowen. Sir your line is open.","Steve Scala","Thank you and thanks for the R&D overview. AbbVie really does have an impressive pipeline. On the new HUMIRA formulation what portion of the current patients on HUMIRA have issues with pain and or volume? What additional IP protection does it offer? And then third, it sounds like there is a bit of hedging on the prior of Viekira guidance of annualizing as $3 billion exiting 2015 am I wrong? Thank you.","Richard Gonzalez","Thanks Steve. This is Rick. I guess I\u2019ll do the last one first. I was trying to describe to you the elements that will drive our overall performance in Viekira. If I sounded like I was hedging, I apologize for that. It is our goal to still hit the number that we described to you. So I was trying to describe to you the elements associated with it.","As far as the details around percentage of patients, I mean I don\u2019t recall it offhand. I\u2019d say there is a fairly substantial percentage of patients that when they first go on the drug do experience or express concern about pain upon injection. The vast majority of those patients obviously work through it and stay on the drug, but it\u2019s not an insignificant percentage of patients that we see that, that experience at the beginning of their use of the product.","And as far as volume, it\u2019s more of a practical thing. At the end of the day if you inject less volume obviously that helps with the pain as well assuming it is not more viscous, so it has some other reason why would have pain.","But if you - as you get less volume in the indications where you have loading doses, there would be a substantial benefit there, where you can go from multiple loading doses to one loading dose an example in certain conditions and I think that would be a significant benefit for patients.","Steve Scala","And the IP?","Richard Gonzalez","I mean essentially it has IP associated with it, I'd say this is really a strategy to differentiate the product. Obviously we have IP around this particular formulation. I think that IP will protect this particular formulation. As we've described I think a couple of times before, we don\u2019t view this as an absolute block. When you think about our biosimilar strategy, it\u2019s a number of things that have all been put together, a very large portfolio of IP, some of that IP is very broad and very challenging I think for someone to work around.","New formulations, it helps differentiate the product. Our commercial strategy, when and if biosimilar is launched and then our pipeline of new assets to be able to move into this market and I'd say although we tend not to probably be able to get there in any meaningful way, I think one of the exciting things that we see internally is if you look at the data that we\u2019ve seen around the JAK 1 hypothesis that we have its is playing out and its playing out in a very positive way.","And I think it\u2019s a profile of a drug that we believe could have a meaningful impact in the marketplace and I think that would be an important product for us to advance and get into the marketplace and then also ABT-122, I think as we talk about an IL-17 combined with a TNF as we see that data, I think that product could have a very meaningful place in the market as well. And so I think we\u2019re gaining a lot of encouragement about de-risking that mid-stage pipeline to ensure that we have some products that will follow on with HUMIRA.","Steve Scala","Thank you.","Larry Peepo","Thanks Steve.

These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website.","Following our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll take your questions.","So, with that I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Rick.","Rick Gonzalez","Thanks, Larry. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us this morning. Since becoming an independent company, our strategy has centered around delivering strong results and returns for our shareholders while insuring, we have a strong sustainable growth business over the long term. As we look back over the past year and assess our performance, we\u2019re pleased with the significant progress we've made, not only in delivering outstanding 2014 results, but also in establishing a solid platform for growth well into the future.","As we announced this morning, we delivered exceptional results in 2014. With sales and earnings well above our original projections for the year, we delivered 7% global operational sales growth in 2014 and we increased our ongoing earnings per share by nearly 6%. When we launched AbbVie two years ago, one of our key priorities was to return to strong growth in 2015. I\u2019m pleased that we were able to achieve that goal a year ahead of schedule. This performance demonstrates the strength and sustainability of our portfolio and underscores our continued focus and execution. Our performance in 2014 was driven by growth from key products including Humira , Synthroid, Synagis, CREON, and Duodopa. We also delivered year-over-year margin improvement while continuing to invest in R&D and SG&A to drive future growth. In addition to our strong financial results over the past year, we are seeing significant pipeline advancement and have achieved a number of important development and regulatory milestones. We secured US and European approval for interferon-free HCV treatment [inaudible]. We successfully completed several late stage clinical trials including daclizumab and Humira HS registrational programs.","We initiated a number of promising phase 3 through programs including several phase 3 studies of our PARP inhibitor Veliparib in solid tumors such as breast and lung cancer and our BCL-2 inhibitor ABT 199 in hematological malignancies. We also made significant advancements with our next-generation HCV program, initiating a broad phase 2 B program which is on track to transition the phase 3 in 2015. We advanced a number of early-stage assets in the mid-stage development including our DB platform and ABT 414R our antibody drug conjugate in development for glioblastoma multiforma. ","We augmented our pipeline through strategic licensing and partnering activities. We acquired the rights to [inaudible] now in development for CLL and NHL. And we entered into a novel collaboration with Calico to accelerate the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies for age-related diseases such as cancer and neurological diseases. And over the first couple of weeks in 2015 we have seen additional pipeline developments. With the recent US approval of DUOPA, our therapy for advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease and positive topline efficacy results from the first year-to-go ex-pivotal trial in endometriosis. ","So we have established a strong foundation and have entered 2015 with good momentum which we intend to build upon. As I outlined earlier this month in 2015 we are forecasting full-year adjusted earnings per share of $4.25 to $4.45. It is important to remember that this range reflects EPS growth of 28 to 34% which is well above our peer group. And in the coming year we expect to see significant activity across our pipeline including the potential for several regulatory submissions data readouts and phase transitions that I will discuss in more detail in a moment.","Humira was certainly an important driver of our strong performance in 2014 with nearly 19% operational growth for the year. Humira has averaged well over $1 billion of growth per year for the past eight years. For 2015 we expect Humira to once again be an important contributor to our robust performance with the mid-teens global operational growth expected. We also saw strong performance from several other products in 2014 including Creon, Synthroid, Synagis, and Duodopa. We expected each of these products would hold leadership positions in their respective categories, will continue to represent an important part of our business mix in 2015.","Clearly another important driver of performance in 2015 will be our interferon-free HCV therapy Viteron [ph] which is now been approved in the US, EU and a number of other countries around the world. We are pleased with Viekira product label and updated AASLD treatment guidelines and we believe both reflect the strength of the product\u2019s clinical profile across genotype-1 patient population. Position reception of Viekira has been positive and in line with our expectations.","While we moved quickly upon approval, I would say that the US launch began in earnest in early January and we\u2019re pleased with our progress today. The first phase of the launch securing payer positions and access for Viekira is well underway. As we indicated once a highly competitive alternative was available Managed Care began their contracting for this class. Obviously in this category the contracting process is occurring very rapidly unfolding over a period of weeks versus months. As we embarked on our discussions with payers we applied a standard Managed Care contracting approach with each account, basing our contracting terms upon four key tenants including the volume of Managed Care lives, the level of formulary control, the term of the contract and patient access within the system. ","A significant number of payer contracts have been completed in the U.S. with more than half the Managed Care lives in the US now under contract. Based on the outcome of this process today, we estimate that more than 40% of the covered lives will have access to access to Viekira pak including both the exclusive and parity positions we have secured. More than 20% of the lives will be in an exclusive position and we would expect the Viekira pak to capture some portion of the patients in plans that have elected to pursue exclusive contracts with other suppliers, given certain aspects of the Viekira pak profile and product label for certain patients. ","We need to see how the remainders of the contracts are finalized, but up to this point we're pleased with our formulary position and we believe we have the potential to capture meaningful share of the US HCV market. As we do with most new product launches, we monitor both prescriptions filled data as well as prescriptions written or claimed to assess our sales effectiveness and the efficiency of the payer administrative and prior authorization processes. ","To that end we have data from external sources, which show 11,000 Viekira prescriptions have been written through January 16th, with the majority occurring in the first two weeks of January. These prescriptions are working their way through the administrative and prior authorization process in order to be filled. While some of these claims may not be filled as is the case with all prescription claims, the majority will make their way through the administrative process and should be dispensed in the coming weeks. ","This level of Viekira prescription generation is well within our expectations for this stage of the U.S. launch. So based on the full body of data that we have in hand we feel good about the early days of our U.S. launch. Moving forward, our commercial efforts in the U.S. will focus on driving strong penetration in the AbbVie's exclusive and parity accounts while ensuring access to Viekira and non-AbbVie accounts, where our product offerings more appropriately based on the label or medical preference for certain patients. ","Our international launch is also progressing well and discussions with government payers in various countries are under way and they are advancing rapidly. We are currently selling Viekira in a number of countries around the world including Germany, U.K, Canada, Austria and Sweden and we are on the crux for beginning promotion in several other countries. ","The HCV market is significant and rapidly growing and based on patient prevalence, diagnosis, and treatment rates we expect it to remain large and an attractive opportunity for many years to come. We're excited about the opportunity Viekira offers us in this market and we're committed to this therapeutic category for the long term and we'll continue our efforts to evolve the treatment paradigm with next generation development programs well under way. Based on our current projections we estimate by the end of 2015 we will achieve a global annualized sales running rate for Viekira of more than $3 billion dollars. Given that we are early in our launch and there are numerous factors that play we will be providing more specific guidance regarding our 2015 sales expectation for the product as the year unfolds. ","Pipeline development is an important component about these long-term success and we continue to place a tremendous amount of organizational focus in this area. We have a rich and broad pipeline with more than 40 clinical development programs under way spanning large and growing especially categories. Our portfolio is comprised of assets that have the potential to deliver compelling clinical performance, patient benefits and economic value. Many of these products have the opportunity to generate multibillion dollar peak year sales. For a company of our size the sales projections from our late stage pipeline assets represent an impressive opportunity for meaningful revenue growth in the years to come. Over the past year, we demonstrated a strong track record of successful positive clinical data and regulatory outcomes from a number of clinical programs. And we look forward to numerous important pipeline milestones in the year ahead. This includes phase 3 trial initiations, data readouts for multiple programs across our pipeline, the submission of regulatory applications for several major late stage assets and potential product approvals.","While I won't cover our entire pipeline in detail today, I thought it would be helpful to review some of the expected milestones in 2015. As I mentioned in 2014 successfully completed our registrational trials evaluating Humira as a treatment for HS. Our US and EU regulatory applications for this indication are currently under review, and we expect decisions from regulatory authorities later this year. Given our strong data and a high unmet need of patience, we believe this will be a significant indication for Humira sales potentially approaching a billion dollars. We\u2019re also exploring Humira as a possible treatment for uveitis, a sight threatening inflammatory eye disease. We expect to complete the phase 3 program and some middle regulatory applications for uveitis later this year.","We expect to see data from several of our promising oncology programs in 2015. This data includes data from ABT-199 study in patients with relapsed refractory CLL who had the 17p deletion mutation. We believe this study has the potential to be a registrational trial. Should we see the level of efficacy observed in the earlier studies, and regulatory agencies agreed ABT-199 addresses an unmet medical need, we plan to submit our regulatory applications for this indication later in 2015. We also plan to start a phase 3 study of ABT-199 in Gazyva in frontline fit CLL patients in 2015. This year, we expect to see results from the phase 3 study of elotuzumab in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma.","Assuming positive results, we expect our partner to submit the regulatory applications for this indication later in 2015. We also expect to present mid stage data from our PARP inhibitor veliparib at medical meetings throughout this year. In addition to the four phase 3 trials already underway in 2015, we\u2019re planning to begin phase 3 studies, evaluating veliparib as a treatment for ovarian cancer. We\u2019re also excited about ABT-414, our anti- EGF monoclonal antibody drug conjugate, which is currently being evaluated in glioblastoma multiforme and has demonstrated encouraging responses in early-stage clinical trials. We will see additional data from the ongoing trial throughout the year and we\u2019re on the cusp of starting a phase 2 study in this aggressive type of malignant primary brain tumor.","With respect to our HCV programs, we expect continued progress in 2015. We\u2019re on track to submit a regulatory application for HCV combination in Japan in the first quarter and anticipate approval in the second half. As a reminder, we expect to commercialize a 12-week, two-pill once-a-day combination for this market. We also expect to see SVR data from our next generation HCV program and transition to phase 3 development later this year. We have significant R&D efforts in place to advance the standard of care in each of our areas of immunology leadership and we\u2019ll see mid stage results from several programs this year. We had two selective JAK1 Inhibitors in our portfolio \u2013 GLPG0634 and ABT-494. Both oral compounds are currently being evaluated as potential treatments for RA, and we look forward to learning more about each assets\u2019 profile as the phase 2B data study is complete later this year. We\u2019re working with our partner to complete our regulatory applications for daclizumab or Zinbryta in the first half of 2015.","As a reminder we presented strong pivotal trial results last year which demonstrated MS patients treated with Zinbryta at a statistically significant 45% reduction in annualized relapse rates versus Avonex. ","Given the product profile and its once monthly subcutaneous administration, we believe this agent has the potential to be an important therapy in this large and growing market. Earlier this month we announced positive topline results from the first of two ongoing phase 3 clinical trials of the elagolix in endometriosis. Initial results from the study show that after six months of treatment both doses of elagolix evaluated met the studies co-primary endpoints of reducing scores of non-menstrual pelvic pain and menstrual pain associated with endometriosis relative to placebo control. We will see additional efficacy and safety data from this trial later this year. Results from the mid-stage trial on uterine fibroids are expected later this year as well. ","Clearly, 2015 promises to be another important year with numerous developments and regulatory milestones. We believe AbbVie has a unique investment identity. We offer promising pipeline prospects as described along with strong growth and compelling shareholder returns. Our business generates significant cash flow which we expect will grow in 2015 and beyond with new product introductions. We\u2019re committed to returning cash to shareholders and our primary means to do so will continue to be our dividend. Last year we announced that AbbVie\u2019s quarterly dividend will be increased to $0.49, an increase of nearly 17% beginning with the dividend payable next month. We intend to maintain our strong commitment to growing our dividend going forward. ","Additionally last year we also disclosed a $5 billion share buyback program to be executed over the next several years further reflecting our commitment to returning cash to shareholders. We will also utilize our strong cash flow to enhance our pipeline through licensing and partnering activities. As a mentioned in 2014 we entered into several collaborations to add to our pipeline. We view these activities as an important component of our overall R&D strategy and we expect to continue to augment our pipeline in 2015 and in the years to come. ","In closing, since AbbVie became an independent company we\u2019ve been focused on executing our key strategic priorities and delivering market-leading returns for our shareholders. One of our primary stated objectives upon our inception was to return the strong growth in 2015. And we\u2019re pleased that we\u2019ve been able to do that a year ahead of schedule. We feel good about the high level of execution of our key strategic priorities, we\u2019ve established a strong track record consistently delivering our financial commitments generating strong shareholder returns and driving leading performance of HUMIRA and other products in our portfolio. ","We\u2019ve also built a promising late stage pipeline which will fuel our future growth. So we set a very sound foundation for our company. We were entering 2015 with strong momentum. We intend to build upon to drive a high level performance in our operations and strong growth. ","With that I will turn the call over to Bill for additional comments in the fourth quarter and our 2015 outlook, Bill?","Bill Chase","Thank you, Rick. This morning I will start with an overview of our fourth quarter performance and then I will walk through our outlook for 2015. We had an outstanding fourth quarter, getting off the year, a better-than-expected performance. This performance allowed us to raise our people year EPS guidance range of 23 year and ultimately deliver results that exceeded our final guidance. Off note in 2014 we delivered EPS growth despite headwinds from currency in the fourth quarter as well as the loss of exclusivity in our lipid franchise. ","For the quarter total adjusted sales were nearly $5.4 billion up 8.9% on operational basis. And as I mentioned exchange dynamics in the fourth quarter were significant reducing sales growth in the quarter by 3.8%. Fourth quarter revenue growth by Humira which delivered global sales of $3.4 billion, up 14.4% operationally and up 10.6% on a reported basis.","In the U.S. Humira sales increased 15.8% reflecting continued strong prescriptions trends double digit market growth across all three major categories rhum, gastro and derm.","Internationally Humira sales grew 12.7% on an operational basis, excluding an 8.4% unfavorable impact from exchange. International Humira performance continues to be driven by double-digit market growth in most countries. Globally Humira sales for the full-year 2014 were more than $12.5 billion, up 18.9% operationally, versus the prior year.","Sales of Synagis were $298 million on quarter, up 4.9% on an operational basis. For the full year, Synagis sales were $835 million an increase of 9.3% operationally versus the prior year.","Growth in 2014 was driven by continued product uptake and strong commercial execution. As a reminder, this is a seasonal product with the majority of sales in the first and fourth quarters of the year.","AndroGel sales were $230 million in the fourth quarter, down about 20% versus the prior year, reflecting the continuation of recent market trends. Full year sales were $934 million, down 9.7% year-over-year.","Global Lupron sales were $207 million in the fourth up 0.6% on an operational basis. For the full year Global Lupron sales were $778 million, roughly flat from the prior year and in line with our expectations. Lupron continues to hold a leadership position and maintains significant share of the market.","U.S. sales of Synthroid were $186 million in the quarter, with full-year sales of $709, up nearly 14%. Synthroid maintain strong brand loyalty and market leadership despite the entry of generics into the market many years ago.","U.S. Creon sales were $151 million with full-year sales of $516 million up 25.3% versus 2013. Creon maintain its leadership position in the pancreatic enzyme market with roughly 70% share, and we continue to capture the vast majority of new prescription starts.","International sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease were $56 million in the fourth quarter up 25.4% on an operational basis. For the full year, Duodopa sales were $220 million, a 24.7% increase versus 2013 on operational basis.","And as you know, we launched our VIEKIRA, in the US in mid-December following FDA approval, sales of VIEKIRA were $48 million in the quarter, reflecting the shipment of stocking quantities into the market over the holiday to support our full commercial launch in January.","I'll turn now to the P&L profile for the fourth quarter.","The adjusted gross margin ratio was 81.2% excluding amortization and other specified items. This represents a significant increase over the prior year due to favourable mix impact across the portfolio, margin enhancing initiatives and the impact of exchange dynamics.","Adjust SG&A was 29.1% of sales in the fourth quarter, reflecting investments and support of the recent VIEKIRA launch and in our other growth brands and adjusted R&D was 16.3% of sales in the quarter reflecting funding actions in support of our pipeline assets.","Net interest expense was $63 million and the adjusted tax rate was 22.5% in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.89 excluding non-cash amortization expense and specified items. On a GAAP basis, we posted the loss per share of $0.51. Specified items were primarily comprised of various cost associated with the termination of the share transaction, our Calico collaboration and ongoing separation costs.","I'd like to now discuss the outlook for 2015. We are confirming the full-year guidance we issued earlier this month including adjusted EPS of $4.25 to $4.45. This guidance excludes $0.34 per share of amortization expense and other specified items. On the topline, we expect high-teens revenue growth on an operational basis. Clearly we have seen significant currency movements in the recent weeks. If the recent rates would remain in effect for the remainder of the year our sales growth would be roughly 5% lower. Given our global business structure and programs we have in place to mitigate exchange impacts, the fall-through from currency to the bottomline is much more modest for us. We are comfortable with our 2015 EPS guidance range despite potential currency swings. ","Included in our topline guidance our assumptions for our key products, for HUMIRA, we expect global sales growth in the mid-teens. For Synagis we expect similar performance to 2014 growth rates. Regarding AndroGel we're forecasting continued market declines as well as a negative impact from the recent entry of generic competition for the 1% formulation. As a result we expect 2015 AndroGel sales of less than $500 million. We expect 2015 Lupron sales to be roughly in line with 2014 levels. For Synthroid we expect sales to be roughly flat from 2014 levels in line with market trends. For Creon we expect low double digit sales growth in 2015. We expect continued double-digit growth for Duodopa with a modest level of U.S. sales in 2015. ","Given the underserved patient population and the products profile and efficacy we are excited about Duopa's potential in the U.S. and expect it to be a meaningful contributor over time. That said, we anticipate a gradual ramp for the product sales in the U.S. as physicians grow familiar with the product. And we expect declines in several other products with continued lipid erosion and negative market trends in HIV and other material products. ","Turning back to the P&L, we are forecasting in improvement in the adjusted gross margin ratio of around 100 basis points for the year reflecting product mix and actions we've taken to further improve our margin profile. This level of improvement would be considerably higher if current exchange rates were to hold throughout the year given how exchange flows through our P&L profile in 2015. ","In 2015, we will continue to invest in our pipeline supporting our exciting opportunities in oncology, HCV, immunology and other areas. We are forecasting R&D expense of approximately 15.5% of sales, and we expect to continue investing in our growth brands with SG&A levels and approximately 25.5% of sales. As a result, we are forecasting a significant increase in our operating margin profile, which we expect to reach 40% of sales in 2015 up roughly 400 basis points reflecting the positive impact of leverage across the income statement, given our ability to moderate bottomline Fx impacts in 2015. Operating margin would be greater than 40% if current exchange rates were to hold throughout the year. ","We are forecasting net interest expense of about $275 million for the full year and we continue to expect an adjusted tax rate in the 22% range in 2015. Regarding our first quarter outlook, we expect adjusted earnings per share in the first quarter of $0.82 to $0.84. This excludes roughly $0.18 cents of specified items and non-cash amortizations resulting in a first quarter EPS in the range of $0.64 to &0.66 on a GAAP basis. So, as we look back we are very pleased with AbbVie\u2019s performance in our first two years as an independent company. ","In 2014, we delivered sales in our names well above our original outlook and returned to growth a year ahead of expectations. And we expect to build on that momentum in 2015 with industry leading growth. And with that I'll turn it back over to Larry Peepo.","Larry Peepo","Thanks Bill. We\u2019ll now open the call for questions. Elon, we\u2019ll take our first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] and our first question today is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin","Thank you and good morning everyone. I have a few questions related to Viekira, but first Rick, congratulations on an order. So, first if you can clarify your $3 billion Viekira forecast, is that a runway you expect to achieve by the end of the year or is that a forecast for the full year, I am a little bit unclear, I think the street is too. And secondly, if you can provide a little bit more color on the percent of cover to Manage lies or you have an exclude deal with Viekira, I think you said 20%. The only exclusive deal with the PBM that we've seen come across the tape is Express Scripts, and I think they cover around 8%. So, where is the other 12% coming from? Is that on the state side or is that other Managed Care companies that just haven't issued press releases? There is confusion around there. And then just lastly I'm just curious what your assumptions are for pricing in the market, once Merck enters either late this year or early next?","Rick Gonzalez","Good morning Jami. And thank you for the congratulations. Let me address your questions. So let me start with the run rate question. Yes, what we were describing to you is there are exit rate at the end of 2015. It should be above $3 billion. So, and the reason why we're characterizing it that way is because we're still assessing the speed at which the ramp will occur, and because there are many different factors that will impact that. ","Obviously, a number a different processes about how the administrative and prior authorization process ramps up in the United States, how we get pricing and reimbursement, many countries around the world, the speed of which we decide and a number of other factors. So what we're basically saying to you is based on our current forecast that we have built in for 2015, as we look at that exit rate it should be above $3 billion. ","Second question was around PBM access. So, if you look at our preferred position indeed it is above 20%. That includes obviously significant portion of Express Scripts. It also includes a number of different more regional based PBMs. It includes a number of Blue Cross Blue Shield or Blue Shield plans. And I think as an example Blue Shield of California announced yesterday that position, but there are a number of those they are also in the mix. And so, it's a variety of plans in those areas that make up the 20%. ","And then assumptions on price post Merck's entry; I think there is a lot of factors that will play out over time obviously in most markets as you get more competition, there is some additional price pressure. But I wouldn't anticipate that we will see significant price pressure as we see more players come into the market, but it's very early to tell what that looks like going forward. It will depend a lot on the performance of those products and other aspects of the market and how it plays out. So I think, it's just very hard to predict, Jami.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Goodman from UBS.","Mark Goodman","Bill, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about how much of the spending is now in there for the HCV. And then on the gross margin you'd mention mix effects, margin enhancing initiatives; can we go into that a little bit more? And then about your commentary about the 2015 guidance you talked about the margins if Fx stays the same, the margins would be even better. Can you just give us an update on what you mean there? And then you had mentioned the infinity product that you are not licensed? And can you just tell us where that is, when will the studies be getting going and when we will see some data? ","Bill Chase","Sure, so it's a lot of different items here, but starting first with the spend for HCV. Yes, as you would imagine in the fourth quarter of 2014, we had fully built out a U.S. sales-force, we had everything basically provided for a strong launch. So those expenses were reflected in the fourth quarter. In 2015, there will be some annualization of those expenses in the U.S. because obviously we didn't have the full organization on board early 2014. The ex-US, we are currently building out and that timing is gated based on expected reimbursement timelines and launch timeline, but the bulk of that has been encompassed in our 2015 guidance. I think what's important on SG&A is we've gotten a lot of questions in the past about operating leverage on this P&L and we are beginning to show it. Our SG&A profile is coming down considerably versus where we\u2019ve been in the last couple of years, so we are pleased on the progress there. ","Gross margin is another area, frankly Mark we've been focussed on since our inception. We are benefiting from some product mix but we also have programs underway to drive efficiencies on that line and we are very focussed on it. And that's what you're seeing playing through to a great extent. We were impacted in the fourth quarter by exchange and it was a favorable impact and let me explain like this. It is a little counterintuitive, but we have within our P&L natural hedges that exist on developed market currencies and we do from time to time, when we think prudent, set up other programs to offset exchange fluctuations, primarily around the Euro. ","And we are to a great extent in 2014 and 2015 protected from swings in the Euro. The manifestation on profile of course is you have weakness on the topline and an offset on the gross margin line, which actually has the impact of increasing gross margin profile. And we saw that play out in the fourth quarter. That was about 200 basis points. The rest was operating efficiencies and product mix. In 2015, we see the same dynamic playing through in the event that currencies were to remain at where they are at, that said what we have forecasted is 100 basis points of gross margin improvement and that's purely related to the operating efficiency programs we have in place as well as product mix. Is that clear?","Mark Goodman","Yeah, so you're saying that there would be more upside to the gross margin on the Fx, that you just haven't baked that in. ","Bill Chase","No, what I'm saying on a profile bases it would manifest itself as a higher profile because we'd have the weakness on the topline, but the bottomline would be protected based on our internal high dispositions.","Mike Severino","So with respect to Infinity, this is Mike Severino. The Infinity collaboration around duvelisib, this one we're very excited about. There are a number of studies are up and running and the key studies are dynamo which is a phase 2 study in patients with refractory indolent nonHodgkin's lymphoma and the duo trial which is a phase 3 study in patients with relapsed refractory CLL. Those studies are up and running. We don't have a specific timing for readouts there, but they're progressing nicely. Over the course of last year, we would this to continue over the course of 2015, earlier studies are continuing to mature on that molecule and there will be a day-to-day readouts over the course of the year. ","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Schott from JP Morgan.","Chris Schott","Just two here. First, coming back to the greater than $3 billion run rate by year-end 2015, is that a number that you expect you can continue to grow over time? So when we think about the year-end run rate in 2015, could that continue to grow in 2016 or do you really think about sales plateauing at that type of level over time? Second question was just on Viekira and just with all the headlines we're seeing regarding contracting. I guess just high level is pricing and the amount of access you're securing, is that progressing as expected or are you at all disappointed in terms of the number of formulary wins you're getting at this point? ","Rick Gonzalez","Okay, Chris, this is Rick. On the $3 billion run rate we would expect growth between 15 and 16 and if you think about the gating of countries coming online over the course of 2015 as an example, you'd certainly expect you'd see some annualized improvement year-over-year. But again, we have to see how that plays out in the timing of that. We're pleased with the progress that we're making so far. On the Managed Care contracting I think we are overall pleased with how it has proceeded. I think it's come within the expectations that we had, having overall 40% coverage for Viekira between our parity positions and our preferred positions, I think it is well within the expectations. But again, as I mentioned in my formal comments we have to see how the rest of it plays out and we're continuing to work on a number of contracts and I think those will conclude over the course of the next 30 days. But so far it's within our expectations. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.","Jeff Holford","Just a couple of extra questions around Viekira. Can you give us any kind of sense for the US visit the ex-US mix on the run rate by the end of 2015; just any color on that would be useful? Second you talked about getting potential access, in contrast we don\u2019t have access; how much leakage would you expect of your exclusive contracts to Gilead? And then just lastly we were talking with Roche just the other day, their results about ABT 199, they seem to indicate that the data were almost in-house or were in-house. Can you give any further commentary around near-term timing on that readout?","Mike Severino","Yes, I will take 199 first. This is Mike Severino. 199 is a program that we continue to be very excited about. We are accruing data in the study that Rick referred to earlier that same patients with refractory or relapse CLL with 17P delta lesion. That's a data set that's accumulating. It's a single arm study, so obviously that data builds over time. We\u2019d expect to have a data set that would allow us to draw some conclusions sometime early this year and we continue to make good progress. So again if the level of activity that we saw on earlier studies persists, we\u2019d expect that to support a regulatory filing obviously, in discussion with regulatory agencies later on this year ","Rick Gonzalez","Okay Jeff, this is Rick. If you are asking the question of what will the US\/ex-US mix be in 2015, obviously the US will be a much heavier mix based on how the gating will occur across those countries, and that mix will continue, I think going forward. As far as leakage or assumptions around what we will be able to achieve within accounts that are Gilead preferred, I think both of these products, if you look at the labels, if you look at the performance there are clearly a certain number of patients and patient types that will benefit from one therapy versus the other. So as we look at our own, we think that numbers are around 10%, for example, PI failures and decompensated cirrhotics are two examples of patient populations that will be more appropriate for the alternative. ","As we look at Gilead are certainly -- as you look at our label and our performance we think there is probably in the neighborhood of about 15% that would be available for therapy, those will be transplant patients, HIV co-infected patients, patient who have significant renal insufficiency, and we also think that there will be some experienced cirrhotic patients. They could benefit from 12 weeks of therapy with Viekira verses 24 weeks of therapy with Harvoni. And so those are some examples of how we see that sorting out. ","Operator","Our next question is from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse.","Vamil Divan","Just a couple if I could on the pipeline, with daclizumab, you mentioned some excitement around there. I guess the questions we\u2019re getting a lot from investors, in terms of your future looking at MS having this one product, this partner obviously with a player that\u2019s much bigger than you and MS, and has other products that they are going to be promoting as well, do you think MS is a space where you need to invest more, obtain more assets in order to have a broader impact? Or is this one where you think where you have daclizumab alone is sufficient? And a second just on Duopa. If you can just give a little more color there, where we think a lot more activity in terms of new approaches to treating Parkinson\u2019s, how long or how much of an impact do you think that can really have if you think about, it is more of a formulation plan that you guys have here as these other agents maybe come to the market in the coming years?","Rick Gonzalez","Let me start with daclizumab. Certainly as we look at the daclizumab profile, we are very pleased with how it sorted out. This is a high efficacy agent. We think the subcutaneous dosing based on the market research we\u2019ve done is something that is appealing to positions and will be appealing the patients. And so we think it as a clear fit. As far as the space I would say the MS space is an area that is attractive. It fits the profile of the kinds of markets that we\u2019re interested in and we constantly look for opportunities within all these spaces. I can tell you, we will look at different opportunities that exist there and evaluate those and if we saw the right opportunity come along we could build us some more critical mass in the MS space, I can tell you we would be interested in that. On Duopa we've obviously had a fair amount of experience with that product in the international markets, in particular in Western Europe. And this is a product that is unique. ","I mean, when you actually look at the clinical benefit that this provides for these patients it's nothing less than astonishing what the benefit that these patients get from this product. Having said that, it is also a product that has a slow ramp up because it requires a lot of training to get patients on board, to get them titrated to the right level, to get the impact it requires a fair amount of clinical support for those patients that have to be provided. So it's not a product that has a massive ramp. What we've seen in Europe in particular is that it has good strong steady growth. But we do believe that this is a product that over the long term could become a very significant product, $500 million to $750 million range. Certainly we\u2019re seeing some estimates that were even higher than that. But it's gonna have a gentle ramp and obviously the U.S. market is an attractive market for us. So we're pleased that we've gotten it approved in the United States and we can bring that product to patients.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI.","Mark Schoenebaum","Hey, guys, thanks a lot for the question. Thanks for all the detailed color; that's super helpful. Out here on Wall Street where we all sit in chairs and watch flashing lights, there's a lot of speculation that the discounts you guys offered in the hep C market were outsized and that you've ignited a pricing war that will only end badly for everybody in the industry. So I'd just love to hear your comments generally on that. I recognize you're not going to give us the extent of the discounts, but just qualitatively I'd like to know if those perceptions out on Wall Street you agree with or you don't agree with and why. And then perhaps for Mike, on elagolix; elagolix is a compound I've become quite interested in lately. Street estimates are around $500 million in the AbbVie consensus model. Why couldn't this be significantly larger than that? Maybe you can talk about the unmet need, how you guys see this fitting in and specifically can this be a chronic therapy for women? ","Rick Gonzalez","Hi Mark, so I'll cover your first question. This is Rick. You know I think the contracting strategy that we put in place was very consistent with the contracting strategy as I said in my remarks that we put in place for all the specialty products. What we say is this, it became very clear to us prior to approval as we were engaging with payers ahead of the launch that payers made it clear was that they were going to contract this category, and there were many payers that said they were going to contract this category with one preferred agent. And so, we had to dial that into our launch strategy and essentially we built the launch strategy, was built around those sets of assumptions. We priced and rebated consistent with the value of our product and what we thought was appropriate for the market and we did it around a disciplined approach around those parameters that I described. And so I don't believe that this is unusual. In fact I believe this is a very typical kind of an approach that we've taken across many specialty categories and the rest of the industry has taken it across many different categories. ","Mark Schoenebaum","Elagolix?","Mike Severino","Okay, so this is Mike. I'll take the Elagolix question. Just a few weeks ago we announced with our partner, topline results from the first of two phase III studies. Now, that's an ongoing study, so we're limited in terms of the amount of detail that we can go into. And we will obviously update you as more data come and present full results in a scientific setting at some later day. But, we're very pleased with what we've seen today. We hit our end points, and these are very difficult end points to hit on pelvic pain and menstrual pain in women who had very difficult to control disease. We did that at both dose levels; we studied with a high level of statistical significance. We are obviously -- we are going to watch as those data mature and as we get additional data on long-term safety that might inform chronic use, but we feel good about what we've seen today and we clearly feel that there is a very large on that medical need, a large number of women live with endometriosis. Current treatment options are not sufficient in many women, a little bit debilitating chronic pain and other symptoms. So it's a molecule that we feel good about long-term.","Rick Gonzalez ","Mark, maybe I will add a couple of comments. This is obvious scenario where we have some experience because we have Lupron that\u2019s available for this indication as well. And fundamentally what we liked about this molecule is that we thought we could get to a chronic use claim for this therapy. And we also like the fact that this is fast-on and fast-of, one of the challenges with a with a drug like Lupron is once you inject the patient, the impact last for 6 to 12 months and you basically put the woman in the menopause until you have all the normal side effects associated with that; hot flashes and bone loss. So an ideal profile here would be one that would provide sufficient efficacy but have a safety and side effect profile that was consistent with longer-term use, so minimal bone loss and minimal hot flashes. A product like that, an oral product, that was fast-on and fast-off, we think has a substantial opportunity in the market. And as Mike said, this is a high prevalence disease where there aren\u2019t great options available for these women. So as we as we release more of the data and we see more of the data, that\u2019s certainly the profile we\u2019re shooting for, it doesn\u2019t mean that a slightly different profile wouldn\u2019t be a very competitive product. But the ideal profile is what you\u2019re describing.","Operator","Our next question is from Robyn Karnauskas from Deutsche Bank.","Robyn Karnauskas","Just one on hep C and one on the pipeline. So we're hearing a lot about volume and there's been some volume restrictions by payers this year, and just trying to get a sense when you've been negotiating, what do you think the volume restriction is or how much do you think the volume -- the number of patients the system can handle this year? Are your contracts incorporating any volume restrictions by fibrosis score? And then the second question is on TNF and IL-17, a lot of excitement in the field. Trying to get a sense of when we will get the next data update? And we've seen very good data on IL-17. Do you expect to have better response rates or would this just work for a dual population that had dual symptoms for psoriasis and RA? ","Rick Gonzalez","Hi Robin, this is Rick. So let me address your first question. As I mentioned in my comments about the four tenants that we operated with our contracting strategy, obviously one of those was access. And we believe strongly that opening up access for all patients regardless of fibrosis score is something that's positive for patients. So certainly as we approached our contracting strategy we offered the greatest benefit to those plans that were willing to do that. Not every plan is willing to do that. I would give as an example Express Scripts a lot of credit for their willingness to open up access. And so they vary by plan. Some are completely open, that\u2019s zero to F4, some are F2 to F4, some are just F3 and F$. So there is quite good variability across the plans as to how they are proceeding with that, but certainly that was something that we pursued with each and every one of the of the payers that we tried to contract with.","Mike Severino","Okay so this is Mike. With respect to TNF and IL-17, I think you\u2019re referring to our program ABT 122 which uses our dual variable domain technology, so a single biologics that blocks the action of those two important cytokines. When you look at that the spectrum of activity of agents targeted against the cytokines, one can see very real potential in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and in particular psoriatic arthritis. The IL17 as we have seen have very pronounced efficacy in skin disease in psoriasis. But the TNF mechanism remains the most highly active in our opinion in psoriatic arthritis. So we have the agent that I described in substantial phase 2 studies, in rheumatoid arthritis and in psoriatic arthritis and those will be progressing over the course of this year and the next and will provide data updates as appropriate.","Operator","Our next question is from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley ","David Risinger","Yes, thanks very much and thank you for all the detailed comments on HCV. That is very helpful. Just a couple questions. First, could you just provide some more color on the 25 state Medicaid group and how investors should think about the news and specifically what your contract states and what the implications are across those 25 state Medicaid organizations? Second, with respect to ABT-199 data in 17p and filing, could you provide some updates on the timing of both of those? And then, finally, in the past, you provided HUMIRA sales by indication. If you could provide a breakdown of 2014 sales again by indication, that would be great?","Rick Gonzalez","This is Rick. We\u2019re in the process of continuing to work with that group so I don\u2019t think it is appropriate that we talk and in detail. There was a public announcement on one of them but the rest of them are still in process and we\u2019re just not in a position to be able to give you a lot more information on that, as they\u2019re finalized my guess is that they will provide some color to their members and through that process you will get some visibility to it but we\u2019re just not in a position where it would be prudent for us to give you that information right now. ","With respect 199 were expecting to see data from our study in refractory relapsed CLL in patients with 17p del mutation in the first half of this year. And when we have this data in hand, we will discuss them with regulatory agencies and assuming we see maintenance of effect size that was observed in early trials, and regulatory agencies agree, we would expect to move to a filing in that indication later on this year. ","And in terms of the mix David, right now globally we\u2019d estimate that RA is approaching 40% of the sales mix. Derm is about 15%, gastro is about 25% and then other would be the remainder. That would be akylosing spondylitis and the other psoriatic arthritis etc. Indications.","Operator","Our next question is from Colin Bristow from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Colin Bristow","Hey, guys, thanks for squeezing me in. The commentary on hep C over the last 12 months has clearly highlighted the payer sensitivity to high-cost drugs in therapeutic areas. I'm just curious what gives you confidence that HUMIRA won't face an aggressive headwinds posed by a similar entry given the size of this asset? And then just a quick one; additional one on HUMIRA in the additional indications such as HS, how much off-label use is already occurring in the indication? ","Rick Gonzalez","This is Rick. Let me cover the payer comment. Obviously we have had lots of experience in interacting with payers with HUMIRA and this class there\u2019s a lot of competition that already exist in the class and obviously we\u2019ve been tremendously successful in securing strong positions with payers in the United States with HUMIRA. With the entry of a potential biosimilar at some point in the future, as I said many times before, I don\u2019t see the competitive dynamics changing dramatically from where they are now. I also don\u2019t necessarily agree that the precedent that occurred in hepatitis C changes the competitive dynamics in any way from the way it was prior to that despite a fair amount of rhetoric that has come out over the last month or so. The thing that\u2019s important to remember in a chronic used drug, that\u2019s different, is you have large groups of patients that are on drug, well-controlled. This is a class where when you move patients from one drug to another, not necessarily all patients do well, and has to be switched again, and so there are different dynamics, different competitive dynamics in each class. In oncology I would tell you, it has very different dynamics. Hepatitis C here you have two products that have tremendous performance and you have basically a product that cures patients is used for a relatively short period of time. Those are different dynamics than you see in many other areas. So, I don't think you can draw a strong correlation from one to the other. Having said that I'm sure one and if biosimilar competition comes along, it will be another opportunity to be able to work with and negotiate with Managed Care organizations and we'd anticipated that in our planning assumptions as we look at our long range plan.","Off late we'll use on HS, you know I would tell you I just came back from a European meeting where we brought in a number of HS patients. And the first thing I'll tell you is, it's obviously a disease that most people including myself didn't know a lot about. What struck me is how debilitating this disease really is for these patients and how little therapy there is or knowledge of alternatives that are available out there. And so I would tell you that I think there is probably very-very little use of HUMIRA in a HS today and I think when we launch, when we get approval one of the things we're focussing a lot of attention on will be education of physicians in order to know that there is an available therapy for these patients. And so, I would think it was tiny, if anything at all at this point. ","Thanks, Colin. Alright. Operator, we have time for one more question please. ","Operator","Our final question today is from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei","On Hep C, what is your estimate for the number of genotype 1 patients treated in 2014 and your expectation for how many are likely to be treated in 2015? Clearly, the size of the pool has a meaningful impact on you. Could you also comment on the early impact of REMICADE biosimilar in Europe and whether you expect this to be a major factor this year as it enters more markets? And then, finally, I just wanted to clarify and make sure I heard this right. The Fx positive impact on gross margin was 2% this quarter and maybe 1% next year. Could you just please remind us of that again? ","Bill Chase","Alex, let me start with the Fx. In the quarter it was 200 basis points. Our guidance in 2015 is an improvement on 100 basis points and that has no effects on it whatsoever. So, we think we can drive that 100 basis point purely through operational efficiencies that we've been committed to over the last couple of years as well as product mix. What I did say was if current exchange rates continued, simple math given that our bottom line is greatly protected from those winds, if the current rates continued it'd have the effect of actually increasing the profile above that 100 basis points. But that basically just math along through as you have a headwind on the topline that we are protecting the bottomline from.","Rick Gonzalez","On HCV genotype 1 patients, you know obviously that is one of the parameters that we were carefully watching as it plays out. We are assuming that we'll see a significant increase in patient access going forward and therefore in the U.S. we'll see more patients treated. I think a reasonable range to think about would be something in the range of may be a 175,000 patients to as much as may be low 200's to 10 to 15 something in that range. Obviously, based on our planning assumptions we've bracketed between those numbers and that's one of the reasons why we don't want to come out with a 2015 number, because we need to see how that plays out. We build obviously a certain base level number into our guidance they were comfortable with. It may end up being more than that going forward. But that's at least our view of what it looks like. On [Rentia] I mean thus far we haven't see a lot of impact, one difference is in European markets self-injectables are treated differently than infusion products, so it doesn't necessarily impact HUMIRA directly in very many markets, I'd say it's tracking for the most part very consistent with what our modelling assumptions were for its level of success and you know we watched that carefully over a period of time and it's proceeding as we would have got. So, we are not assuming that will have any material impact on us in 2015.","Larry Peepo","And that concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. Today, we'll be covering two topics. I'll briefly discuss our third quarter performance and operational highlights, and Mike and Bill will walk you through the quarter in more detail. Then, I'll provide an update on the company's long-term strategic and financial objectives. And as always, we'll provide ample time at the end of the call to answer your questions.","We delivered another quarter of outstanding performance, with results ahead of our expectations. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.41, up 16.5% versus last year. We also delivered strong top line results in the quarter with operational sales growth of 8.8%, driven by a number of products in our portfolio. This includes HUMIRA, with global operational sales growth of nearly 15%, and IMBRUVICA, which grew more than 37% versus the prior year.","Based on our strong year-to-date performance, we are raising our full-year 2017 EPS guidance to $5.53 to $5.55, reflecting growth of 14.9% at the midpoint.","During the quarter, we announced the global resolution of all intellectual property-related litigation with Amgen over their biosimilar to HUMIRA. We're pleased with this settlement, which we believe demonstrates the strength of our HUMIRA IP portfolio and further demonstrates our confidence that we will not see direct biosimilar competition in the U.S. until at least the 2022 timeframe. Importantly, this will allow a number of key assets within our robust late-stage pipeline to enter the marketplace and establish a strong growth trajectory.","Mike will provide additional color around recent advancements across numerous pipeline programs, but I'll briefly mention a few highlights. We're very pleased with the significant progress we've made with several late-stage assets. In particular, the data readouts for upadacitinib and risankizumab illustrate that both of these therapies have the potential to be highly differentiated best-in-class agents across a range of immune-mediated conditions. We've established strong leadership in immunology with HUMIRA. The 2019 commercialization of both of these therapies will allow us to further grow that already strong position.","We're also very encouraged by the results from the Phase III MURANO trial, which evaluated VENCLEXTA in combination with RITUXAN for the treatment of patients with relapsed\/refractory CLL, an indication for which we received Breakthrough Therapy Designation. An independent data monitoring committee reviewed the MURANO study and made the recommendation to unblind the trial based on the strong positive results. The full results of the study will be presented in an upcoming medical meeting, and we're moving forward with our regulatory applications.","Finally, this morning we announced we received Priority Review for elagolix in endometriosis. This status, which shortens the FDA review period, is granted to medicines the agency determines have potential to provide significant improvements in the safety and effectiveness of the treatment of a serious disease. There have been no new treatments for endometriosis-associated pain in well over a decade. So if approved, elagolix will represent an important treatment option for this painful condition and underserved patient population.","In summary, we continue to demonstrate outstanding performance, driven by our strong commercial, operational, and R&D execution. We have delivered strong financial results, and we're making significant advancements in our pipeline. I'll discuss our outlook for 2018 and provide an update on our long-term strategic and financial objectives following Mike and Bill's comments.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.","Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.","Thank you, Rick. In order to allow time for our strategic update, I'll keep my prepared remarks brief, highlighting just a few of the noteworthy milestones from the quarter.","As Rick mentioned, we've continued to make significant progress across our pipeline. In immunology, we reported results from several mid and late-stage trials. Just yesterday, we announced positive top line results from three Phase III studies evaluating risankizumab in psoriasis. Data from these trials demonstrated superior skin clearance with risankizumab treatment versus two leading biologics, Stelara and HUMIRA.","In the ultIMMa-1 and ultIMMa-2 trials, 75% of patients receiving risankizumab in both studies achieved PASI 90 compared to 42% and 48% of patients receiving Stelara, respectively.","We are particularly encouraged by the durable rates of skin clearance demonstrated in these two studies. At one year, roughly twice as many patients treated with risankizumab achieved full skin clearance compared to Stelara, with 56% and 60% of the risankizumab patients achieving PASI 100 in ultIMMa-1 and ultIMMa-2 respectively. We also saw very high rates of efficacy in the IMMvent study, with risankizumab demonstrating superior rates of skin clearance compared to HUMIRA.","Within this trial, we designed a portion of the study to evaluate risankizumab's efficacy in patients who had an inadequate response to HUMIRA. In this portion of the study, patients with an inadequate response to HUMIRA after 16 weeks were re-randomized to risankizumab or HUMIRA. And, of these patients, 66% treated with risankizumab achieved PASI 90, compared to 21% who continued with HUMIRA, demonstrating risankizumab's potential in the growing TNF inadequate responder population. We look forward to seeing data next year from the remaining trial in the psoriasis pivotal program. Our regulatory submission is on track for 2018, with commercialization expected in 2019.","Moving now to upadacitinib, our oral selective JAK1 inhibitor, in development for six indications. Last month we announced top line results from the second of our Phase III studies, the SELECT-BEYOND study. In this trial, which evaluated patients who did not respond adequately or were intolerant to biologic DMARDs, both doses of upadacitinib met all primary and ranked secondary endpoints at week 12 and patient-sustained clinical response through week 24.","Upadacitinib drove very high levels of response at ACR20. But more importantly, it drove strong levels of response on more stringent clinical endpoints, such as ACR50, ACR70, low disease activity, and DAS remission. We saw levels of efficacy in this difficult-to-treat refractory population, similar to efficacy more typically observed in bio-naive patients.","We are aware that there continues to be significant investor interest regarding the topic of DVT and PE event rates. As we stated on our last earnings call, we have a comprehensive monitoring program in place for upadacitinib and have not observed anything in our Phase III program that we consider a signal, and the rate of DVT and PE across the program is consistent with the expected background rate in an RA population.","While we can appreciate the desire to characterize event rates for upadacitinib, it is important to keep in mind that estimates based on individual events or a subset of trials have the potential to be inaccurate and misleading. The upadacitinib program is designed to provide a comprehensive safety database with more than 3,000 upadacitinib-treated patients. Evaluation of unblinded event rates and comparisons to rates in control groups and expected background rates must be done in the context of our overall program once the core studies have read out.","Given the fact that we have reported data from two of our six registrational trials and that the majority of our database remains blinded, we view any attempt to calculate event rates or compare rates across upadacitinib and control groups as premature at the present time. Furthermore, providing unblinded data from ongoing studies could impact the integrity of these trials, which is something that we obviously cannot and will not do.","In addition to our internal safety monitoring program, we have an independent data monitoring committee, or DMC, in place for upadacitinib in order to ensure patient safety. The DMC has access to all data from the program, including unblinded data, and monitors it for safety on an ongoing basis.","The DMC is also obviously aware of the heightened interest in DVTs and PEs in this setting and has consistently made the recommendation to proceed with the program without modification. We remain very confident in upadacitinib and are investing in and advancing multiple indications in a manner that is consistent with our confidence.","We also recently reported positive top line results from the upadacitinib Phase II study in atopic dermatitis, demonstrating very strong efficacy across all doses compared to placebo. In the trial, we saw very rapid response times, with upadacitinib demonstrating reduction in pruritus within the first week and improvement in skin lesions within the first two weeks for all doses. Roughly half of patients achieved a 90% or greater improvement in skin lesions by week 16. Based on these data, we plan to advance upadacitinib into Phase III studies in atopic dermatitis in the first half of 2018.","Moving now to oncology, in the third quarter, we reported that the DMC for the Phase III MURANO trial recommended we unblind the study for efficacy, indicating that VENCLEXTA in combination with RITUXAN met the primary endpoint of the study of demonstrating significantly prolonged progression-free survival in patients with relapsed\/refractory CLL compared to a combination of bendamustine and RITUXAN, a standard regimen in this patient population. We plan to present detailed findings from the trial at an upcoming medical meeting, and the data will support our regulatory application for broader use in the relapsed\/refractory CLL population.","Also in the third quarter, we received regulatory approval for the use of IMBRUVICA in chronic graft-versus-host disease after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy. And before the end of the year we expect data from an interim analysis of the SHINE study in front-line mantle cell lymphoma, which if successful would support a label update for IMBRUVICA in this indication.","We continue to make good progress with our solid tumor efforts as well, where we currently have more than 20 solid tumor assets in the clinic, 17 of which are in Phase I studies. We have started seeing early data from several of these programs, and we look forward to many more readouts as data mature over the next 12 to 18 months.","At ESMO last month, we presented early data from the Rova-T BASKET study in neuroendocrine tumors. While the data are very early, we are encouraged by the findings, which showed reduction in tumor burden and confirmed responses in solid tumors beyond small cell lung cancer.","Our Phase III Rova-T studies in small-cell lung cancer continue to progress, with the TAHOE study in the second-line setting and the MERU study in the front-line setting both now well underway.","TRINITY, our registrational study in third-line or greater small-cell lung cancer, also continues to progress well. As we prepare for our forthcoming regulatory submissions, we've been actively engaged in discussions with regulators. We recently received feedback from the FDA that they would like to see six-month durability data as part of our regulatory submission data package. This request is not unusual in development programs where single-arm studies are being used to support approval. We anticipate that six-month data will be available in the second quarter of 2018. Therefore, we have moved the final analysis for the TRINITY study to the second quarter of next year in order to meet the FDA's request. We continue to expect our regulatory submission to follow shortly thereafter.","In the area of virology, early in the third quarter, we received regulatory approvals in the U.S., Europe, and Japan for MAVYRET. And in the area of women's health, we submitted our regulatory application for elagolix as a treatment for women suffering from endometriosis-associated pain. And this morning, we announced that we received a Priority Review designation from the FDA.","While 2017 to date has already been a very eventful and productive year, we anticipate seeing several additional clinical development milestones in the coming months, and 2018 will also be a milestone-filled year.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on our third quarter performance. Bill?","William J. Chase - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Mike.","We are very pleased with our strong third quarter results. Total net revenues were nearly $7 billion, up 8.8% operationally excluding a 70 basis point favorable impact from foreign exchange.","We reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.41, up 16.5% compared with the third quarter of 2016. Adjusted EPS exceeded the midpoint of our prior guidance range by $0.04 due to favorable sales and operating margin profile dynamics. There was also a $0.02 benefit in the quarter related to the divestiture of an equity position.","HUMIRA's global sales in the quarter were $4.7 billion, up 14.8% operationally, reflecting continued strong demand. U.S. growth was 19.1%, driven by prescription growth approaching 12% and mid-single-digit price contribution. The growth rate versus 2016 also reflected some benefit from customer ordering patterns in the third quarter of 2016. Wholesaler inventory levels were below 0.5 month in all quarters.","International HUMIRA sales were $1.6 billion in the quarter, up 6.8% on an operational basis. With its unique product profile, years of physician experience, and broad set of indications, HUMIRA remains the undisputed market leader across all therapeutic categories despite competition.","Global IMBRUVICA net revenues in the third quarter were $688 million, up more than 37% versus the prior year. IMBRUVICA continues to drive strong uptake in front-line CLL and remains the market share leader in CLL across all lines of therapy, with total patient market share of 35% in first-line and over 70% in the second-line-plus setting.","Global HCV sales in the third quarter were $276 million. During the quarter we received regulatory approval for MAVYRET, our next-generation HCV offering in the U.S., Europe, and Japan. While we are still in the early stages of our launch, we've been pleased with its initial uptake globally, and physician feedback on the product has been very favorable. Global sales of MAVYRET approached $100 million in the quarter.","Global sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease, grew 22% on an operational basis in the quarter. We also saw a strong growth contribution from Creon and Synagis.","Reviewing the P&L profile for the quarter, adjusted gross margin was 80.8% of sales, slightly favorable versus the prior year. This was inclusive of 50 basis points of dilutive impact related to partnership accounting.","Adjusted R&D was 17% of sales, up 50 basis points over the prior year, reflecting increased funding of the pipeline. Adjusted SG&A was 20.7% of sales in the third quarter, down 70 basis points versus the prior year, driven by sales leverage and operational efficiencies.","The adjusted operating margin was 43.1% of sales in the third quarter compared to 42.8% in the prior year, an improvement of 30 basis points despite an increase in R&D spending as a percentage of sales.","Net interest expense was $252 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 19% in the quarter.","Third quarter adjusted earnings per share excluding intangible amortization expense and other specified items was $1.41, up 16.5% year over year.","Turning to full-year guidance, as Rick mentioned, we are raising our full-year adjusted EPS guidance range to $5.53 to $5.55 per share, representing growth of 14.9% at the midpoint. This excludes $1.26 per share of non-cash amortization and other specified items. Our full-year GAAP guidance has been updated to reflect recent milestone payments and overall progress on the risankizumab program.","We continue to forecast full-year top line operational growth approaching 10%, with minimal impact from foreign currency on a full-year basis. This forecast contemplates global HUMIRA operational growth approaching the mid-teens. In the U.S., we continue to expect HUMIRA full-year sales growth in the mid to high teens. For international HUMIRA, we expect full-year sales growth on both an operational and reported basis to be in the mid-single digits. And we remain on track to achieve the full-year sales guidance that we outlined in January for the other products across our portfolio.","We continue to forecast full-year gross margin as a percentage of sales to be 80.5% and operating margin to be approximately 42.5%. We also continue to expect full-year net interest expense of approximately $1 billion, and we expect the adjusted tax rate to be approximately 19%.","For the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $1.42 and $1.44. This adjusted EPS guidance excludes roughly $0.41 of non-cash amortization and other specified items, which represents year-over-year growth of 19.2% at the midpoint.","We expect fourth quarter operational sales growth of approximately 10%. And at current exchange rates, we would expect foreign exchange to have a 2% favorable impact on reported sales growth in the fourth quarter.","In closing, we are pleased with our strong performance in the quarter, delivering top-tier revenue and EPS growth while continuing to advance our pipeline and successfully executing on our long-term strategy.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Rick.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","All right. Thank you, Bill. I'll apologize in advance. This section is fairly long. As a reminder, we have posted a slide presentation to our website. These slides are intended to be a supplemental resource for today's call. However, my prepared remarks will not directly follow these slides.","When we launched AbbVie in the beginning of 2013, our objective was to build a high-performing biopharmaceutical company capable of delivering top-tier financial performance over the long term. The actions we've taken over the last five years have been designed to support just that objective.","Along the way, we have consistently communicated our objectives, sharing with investors how we intend to execute on our strategy and how we're tracking against our goals as a company. And over the last five years, we have consistently delivered a top-tier financial performance, demonstrating that we have created an organization that is capable of executing at a very high level. We've also consistently shown our ability to overcome obstacles and challenges while still meeting or exceeding our commitments.","As we look back and we evaluate our performance versus our peer group of 11 companies over the last five years, whether measuring our performance over the past year, past two years, three years, four years, or launch to date, we're pleased that AbbVie has performed first or second in total shareholder return and revenue growth and EPS growth in nearly every one of those periods. We have met or exceeded our EPS guidance in all 19 quarters since becoming a public company, exceeding our guidance in 16 quarters. Additionally, we have acted boldly to build a robust pipeline that will sustain growth over the long term.","AbbVie simply isn't the same company it was in January of 2013, and we have delivered exceptional shareholder return over this period, returning a significant amount of cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks.","To that end, today we announced that our board declared an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $0.64 per share to $0.71 per share, an increase of 11%, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2018. Since inception, we have grown our quarterly dividend more than 77%, and we've repurchased a significant number of shares.","As you recall, in October 2015, we outlined AbbVie's long-term strategic and financial objectives, including our growth prospects through 2020, our expectations around biosimilars, and our aspirations for our pipeline. Now that we are nearly at the midpoint of the five-year time period, we thought it would be helpful to recap our progress against our long-range plan as well as provide updates where appropriate.","As a reminder, we forecasted the annual revenue growth on average to be approximately 10%, with total revenue growing to $37 billion by 2020. Through 2017, we're on track to deliver revenue growth of more than 10.5% annually, and we remain committed to meeting or exceeding our revenue growth objectives for 2020.","We also projected the HUMIRA sales would exceed $18 billion by 2020. Clearly, we're on track to achieve that target in 2017. As such, we now expect that HUMIRA sales will approach $21 billion in 2020. This growth will be driven by continued biologic penetration, as HUMIRA maintains its strong position as the leading front-line therapy.","We guided to IMBRUVICA revenues of $5 billion in 2020, and we remain confident that we will achieve that target. Our market share projections and additional indication approvals have all met or exceeded our assumptions at the time of the acquisition, and we remain committed to our guidance for IMBRUVICA.","We guided to HCV franchise revenue of $3 billion by 2020. While we're currently tracking behind that projection, the strength of the rest of our business has more than offset any shortfall. We remain confident that our next-generation HCV therapy, MAVYRET, will allow us to significantly grow our position within the HCV market, and it will ultimately deliver multibillion-dollar peak-year sales.","We indicated that we would achieve significant improvements in operating margin, driven by a reduction in the HUMIRA royalty burden, leverage from a growing top line, and ongoing efficiency programs. We remain on track and committed to delivering on our target of a 50% operating margin by 2020.","And finally, we forecasted double-digit adjusted EPS growth on average for the five-year period through 2020. Through 2017, we're on track to achieve EPS growth of 13.6% annually, and we remain committed to meeting or exceeding our EPS objective.","And while we're still in the midst of our annual planning process, based on our high level of confidence and the continued strong underlying performance of the business, we are now in a position to provide a high-level view regarding our expectations for next year.","For 2018, we expect adjusted EPS of $6.37 to $6.57, representing growth of approximately 15% to 19% from the midpoint of our revised 2017 guidance range. This level of growth positions AbbVie to be among the industry leaders for bottom line growth once again in 2018. We have delivered significant earnings growth since our inception. The midpoint of our 2018 guidance is more than double the adjusted EPS we reported in the first year as an independent company five years ago. We'll provide detailed guidance for 2018 on our fourth quarter call.","AbbVie's performance since we became an independent company has demonstrated our strong commitment to meeting or exceeding our objectives. Ultimately though, in order to sustain this high level of performance over the long term, a company like ours needs a robust pipeline. We have focused a tremendous amount of attention to ensuring that our pipeline is full of differentiated assets that will fuel industry-leading performance over the long term.","We've spoken at length about our near-term growth drivers, a collection of derisked pipeline programs where we have a high level of confidence in the probability of regulatory and commercial success. These innovative late-stage products are designed to deliver differentiated clinical profiles with distinct and compelling patient benefits.","As we look back over the past 18 to 24 months, we're pleased that we have been successful in achieving each of the key development objectives related to our near-term growth drivers. Our successes to date give us a high degree of confidence that these assets will achieve strong competitive positions within their respective markets.","Our portfolio and pipeline span some of the most attractive segments of healthcare, areas of significant unmet need, including immunology, oncology, neuroscience, and virology, with focused investments in other areas where we have unique assets or strong strategic fit.","AbbVie's leadership in immunology stems from more than a decade of experience developing 13 indications for HUMIRA and actively treating more than 1 million patients worldwide. HUMIRA has played an integral role in defining the standard of care. Based on recent developments, including the settlement of our patent dispute with Amgen, we remain confident that our IP will protect HUMIRA from direct biosimilar competition in the U.S. until at least 2022.","Over the next five years, HUMIRA will continue to drive meaningful growth. And following the entry of direct biosimilar competition, whether in the U.S. or internationally, we believe our strategy will enable HUMIRA to maintain its strong and meaningful market share position with a manageable erosion curve. As a result, HUMIRA will remain a significant source of cash flow for the company for many years to come","Another equally important yet underappreciated aspect of our immunology portfolio is our industry-leading immunology pipeline. Our two late-stage pipeline assets, risankizumab and upadacitinib, each have the potential to significantly advance standard of care. With the forthcoming commercialization of these two assets, our immunology franchise will evolve from a single product with HUMIRA to a portfolio of therapies that has the potential to restate our current leadership position and move into new areas, such as atopic dermatitis.","Risankizumab, our anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody licensed from Boehringer Ingelheim, has the potential to become a transformative therapy in a number of immune-mediated diseases by potentially providing an unmatched level of efficacy, durable effect, and safety across a broad set of indications, and all with the convenience of quarterly dosing. As Mike mentioned, we're very pleased with the strong Phase III results we reported this week, which demonstrated very high levels of skin clearance, and we look forward to submitting our regulatory application next year.","Beyond psoriasis, risankizumab is currently being evaluated in Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and psoriatic arthritis.","We believe risankizumab could be an important treatment option in the IBD segment particularly in patients with an inadequate response to biologics, where there's a growing patient population and a high unmet need. We reported mid-stage data in Crohn's disease where risankizumab demonstrated strong activity, with highly impressive remission and endoscopic response scores. The risankizumab Phase III Crohn's disease program is expected to begin this year, and the Phase III program in ulcerative colitis is on track to start next year.","We remain extremely excited about this asset's potential and believe risankizumab represents a significant opportunity for AbbVie. We estimate the nominal sales potential for risankizumab for the four indications I just outlined to be approximately $5 billion in 2025.","Moving now to our other late-stage immunology asset, upadacitinib, our oral selective JAK1 inhibitor in clinical development for six indications, upadacitinib has produced strong mid and late-stage data in rheumatology, dermatology, and GI. This summer, we reported top line results from the first two Phase III studies from the pivotal program in RA. Upadacitinib performed extremely well in both studies, meeting all primary and key secondary endpoints, with a safety profile in line with previous studies and as we expected. Upadacitinib drove very high levels of response on disease activity and remission endpoints, and the results from both studies compare favorably to other selective JAK inhibitors which are in development.","We think upadacitinib has the potential to be a best-in-class therapy in RA and could offer meaningful advantages over products on the market today or in development. We expect to see data from an additional pivotal study later this year, with data from two more trials and our regulatory submission expected in 2018 and commercialization in 2019.","In addition to RA, upadacitinib has the potential to launch in five additional indications by 2022: Crohn's disease, atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and ankylosing spondylitis.","In atopic dermatitis, we recently reported positive top line Phase II results, demonstrating strong efficacy across all doses and a clean safety profile. We saw rapid response time, with reduction in itch within the first week and improvements in skin within the first two weeks for all doses. We're pleased with these results and believe this further demonstrates that selective JAK1 inhibition may be a novel therapeutic approach across a broad range of immune-mediated diseases. Based on the data, we plan to advance into Phase III studies in atopic dermatitis in the first half of 2018.","In IBD, similar to risankizumab, ABT-494 has demonstrated impressive remission and endoscopic response scores in Crohn's disease, and we expect to begin Phase III studies soon. This agent holds strong promise in IBD, where current products show a waning response and high discontinuation rates, and we're very excited about this drug's potential within this segment of the market. All told, we believe upadacitinib will be a significant growth driver for AbbVie, with nominal sales across six indications of approximately $6.5 billion in 2025.","Moving now to oncology, where one of our key strategic priorities is to expand our already strong position in hematological malignancies. Despite the emergence of new treatments that have improved outcomes, unmet needs remain relatively high. We've built a strategic portfolio of assets, including multiple mechanisms of action that have vast potential alone and in combination.","With IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA, AbbVie has a set of assets that is capable of transforming treatment across a wide range of blood cancers. We're targeting CLL, AML, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and multiple myelomas as well as other conditions. These two therapies alone and in combination with other medicines are demonstrating extremely strong activity in a broad range of cancers, giving us the ability to create a leadership position in the hematological oncology market, a $30 billion market today, expected to grow to $50 billion by 2020 and $65 billion by 2025.","Given our portfolio, we're well positioned to drive the continued evolution of the treatment landscape, establishing BTK and BcL-2 inhibition as foundational therapies in CLL and other hematological malignancies. Our goal is to transform the therapeutic approach, allowing patients to achieve more durable, deeper responses. Through novel combinations of IMBRUVICA, VENCLEXTA, and other therapies, we'll drive better long-term control of blood cancers.","The growing body of data for both therapies in CLL and in other hematological malignancies will support label expansion, thereby driving increasing penetration and growth in the coming years. Our confidence in our ability to achieve and sustain a strong leadership position within this market stems from the truly impressive data we've seen from both of these assets.","IMBRUVICA has changed the treatment paradigm in second-line and greater CLL and in patients with the 17p deletion and is gaining strong momentum in first-line CLL by providing strong durable response and a superior survival benefit over standard of care. We're expanding IMBRUVICA's use in multiple segments of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma beyond the already approved indications and exploring potential in additional diseases. We continue to expect sales of IMBRUVICA of greater than $7 billion to AbbVie.","We've also seen outstanding results from VENCLEXTA's clinical program, which has shown high response rates in difficult-to-treat patient populations, including relapsed\/refractory CLL patients with a 17p deletion and CLL patients who have failed prior therapy with a B-cell receptor inhibitor.","We recently reported strong positive top line results from the Phase III MURANO study in relapsed\/refractory CLL, where combination treatment with VENCLEXTA and RITUXAN prolonged progression-free survival versus BR. Based on the positive results, an independent data monitoring committee has made the recommendation to unblind the trial. Analysis of the data showed that the combination treatment with VENCLEXTA and RITUXAN may offer another strong option for patients with relapsed\/refractory CLL. We plan to submit our regulatory application in the coming months, and we look forward to bringing this potential new treatment to the market in the broader relapsed\/refractory CLL population.","We also had development programs for VENCLEXTA in AML, multiple myeloma, and other blood cancers, where we've seen promising results, including strong data supporting two Breakthrough Therapy designations in AML. These indications have the potential to start adding significant value in the three- to five-year time horizon. We believe that VENCLEXTA's nominal sales potential in 2025 across multiple hematological malignancies is approximately $6 billion.","Another strategic priority for AbbVie is establishing a strong foundation in solid tumors. We've made significant investments, both internally and externally, in groundbreaking technology and platforms, and we've partnered with leaders across the field to identify and advance promising therapies to address the significant unmet need that continues to exist in this area.","We've made tremendous progress over the past several years. We currently have more than 20 solid tumor assets in clinical development, many demonstrating early signs of efficacy, and expect to advance at least 10 additional assets into human trials over the next year.","One of our strategic investments was the acquisition of Stemcentrx, which provided AbbVie a late-stage asset in Rova-T as well as a highly attractive discovery and early development platform. Rova-T represents a multibillion-dollar peak revenue opportunity as we advance into first-line small-cell lung cancer and other indications. As Mike mentioned, in the second quarter next year, we'll see results from the TRINITY study in third-line small-cell lung cancer, and we plan to submit our regulatory application for this indication soon thereafter.","Small-cell lung cancer is a devastating disease. And in the setting where Rova-T will initially be approved, third-line-plus, patients have extremely poor prognosis. There are currently no approved treatments, and the five-year survival is approximately 6%. There has been progress in the field with promising data from both Rova-T and I-O therapy. Recent data showed objective responses in I-O monotherapy in second- and third-line patients at 11% and I-O\/I-O combinations at 22%. This level of response is a meaningful improvement over the mid-single-digit response rates experts estimate are typical in the real-world setting.","Ultimately, we believe a combination of Rova-T and I-O therapy could demonstrate higher levels of efficacy, and we have ongoing collaborations to evaluate this approach with initial data expected next year.","Additionally, we have ongoing studies in the front-line and second-line settings. And in parallel, we're advancing studies to validate Rova-T's activity in a number of other solid tumors. The expression of DLL3 in metastatic melanoma, glioblastoma, and some prostate, pancreatic, and colorectal tumors suggests that Rova-T may be useful in these tumor types.","Beyond Rova-T, the acquisition of Stemcentrx also brought with it a pipeline of additional clinical development programs, including seven additional novel compounds which are currently in human trials, covering solid tumors from small-cell lung cancer to ovarian cancer and colorectal cancer, among others. Going forward, we're on track to advance roughly three novel assets from Stemcentrx to enter human trials each year.","In our early-stage oncology pipeline, we're continuing to explore new technologies that will extend our reach in the solid tumor market. For example, our next-generation immuno-oncology programs are designed to broaden and deepen responses beyond what we've seen with the first wave of I-O therapies. We're using novel approaches, including bi-specific technology to elicit T-cell activation in close proximity to tumor cells.","Over the past year, four next-generation immuno-oncology assets have entered the clinic, and we look forward to data from these studies over the next several years. As evidenced by our on-market presence, our late-stage pipeline, and our early discovery and development work, clearly we have a major strategic commitment to oncology. Oncology will be a major growth driver for AbbVie over the next 10 years and beyond, further diversifying our business.","In addition to AbbVie's efforts in immunology and oncology, our strategy includes investments and development activity in other attractive high-growth markets such as women's health, neuroscience, and virology.","In women's health, elagolix represents a potential new medicine and advancement for women suffering from endometriosis and uterine fibroids, both highly prevalent conditions with limited treatment options. There are millions of women unsatisfied with their treatment and cycling through oral contraceptives and pain medications. These women are dealing with significant levels of chronic pain. We believe elagolix represents a significant advancement for this large underserved population and represents a multibillion-dollar opportunity for AbbVie.","Neuroscience is an emerging area of focus for AbbVie, and we are investing internally and externally to develop disease-modifying therapies to treat neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and multiple sclerosis. We're currently evaluating mechanisms like and anti-tau and RGMa, which have the potential to translate to disease modification in degenerative neurological conditions, including Alzheimer's, MS, and spinal cord injury.","In virology, we recently launched MAVYRET, our next-generation HCV treatment, a pan-genotypic, once-daily, ribavirin-free therapy that has SVR rates approaching 100% across genotypes with eight weeks of therapy for the majority of patients. While it's still early, the global launch is progressing extremely well, with positive feedback from physicians, patients, and payers on its strong clinical profile and our go-to-market strategy, confirming our expectation that MAVYRET is a highly competitive product within this market.","Just nine weeks after the launch, MAVYRET has achieved a market share position in the U.S. of over 15%, predominantly driven by the public channel. Internationally, we've seen strong uptake in markets where we've launched, including Germany, which achieved a market leadership position with 40% market share 10 weeks after its launch. We view MAVYRET as a significant revenue opportunity over the long-range plan, with meaningful sales contributions beginning in 2018.","Clearly, we have one of the most impressive R&D pipelines in our industry, and we look forward to the evolution of our pipeline assets, from promising late-stage development compounds to high-growth marketed products in these areas of high unmet need. The combination of our own market products and our promising late-stage assets should produce robust growth for our business over the long term.","AbbVie represents a unique and attractive investment, offering both industry-leading growth and strong shareholder returns. There are two components of our company, our HUMIRA business and our growth platform, both of which provide a compelling growth story and high shareholder value.","HUMIRA will remain the cornerstone of our industry-leading immunology franchise. We have a high degree of confidence in our ability to deliver continued strong HUMIRA performance. And as I mentioned, we now expect HUMIRA sales to approach $21 billion in 2020.","Following the entry of direct biosimilar competition in the U.S., we expect that HUMIRA will maintain a strong market position with a manageable erosion curve. HUMIRA will generate robust durable cash flow through 2025 and beyond. These cash flows will fund our pipeline and fuel our ability to continue to provide an attractive return of capital to our shareholders through a strong and growing dividend and share repurchase.","Beyond HUMIRA, AbbVie has a stable base business and a highly attractive pipeline, which represents a significant underappreciated growth platform for AbbVie. Our non-HUMIRA business, which today has sales of approximately $9.6 billion, is expected to grow to more than $35 billion in 2025, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of almost 18%. This growth trajectory reflects the strength of our derisked late-stage pipeline, including over 20 new product or indication launches by 2020, supporting our ability to sustain top-tier revenue growth despite the entry of direct biosimilar competition.","Based on consensus estimates, AbbVie's top and bottom line growth over the next five years is projected to be in the top quartile of our peer group, while our P\/E multiple currently ranks in the lower third of our industry. So despite our recent strong stock performance, our P\/E multiple still has significant room for expansion to be valued consistent with our top-tier biotech peers, offering the potential for strong shareholder returns.","Our objective when we launched AbbVie was to build a high-performing biopharmaceutical company that was capable of delivering long-term top-tier performance. We are a company and a management team that has consistently achieved our objectives, and we have met or exceeded our commitments to our investors.","We're proud of our performance and our proven track record of execution, and we're certainly excited about AbbVie's prospects going forward. We look forward to engaging with the investment community in the coming weeks as we meet with investors and share our strategic vision for the company. We have a high degree of confidence in our ability to continue to successfully execute on our long-term strategy and deliver outstanding shareholder value.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Rick. We'll now open the call for questions. Operator, first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question today is from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.","Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC","Hi, everyone. Thanks very much for taking my questions. I've got a few quick ones for you. Just first off, there seemed to be a lot of focus yesterday around one of your competitor's commentary around the sudden decline or deterioration in the growth of the psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis markets. I'm not sure that we've seen it in some of the other companies reporting. I just wondered if you'd like to comment on what you see the market growth there.","Second, I know you're not going to give the rate based on what you said. But can you just confirm that upadacitinib you're seeing a rate below 0.8, which is I think is what one of your other competitors referred to as the upper end of the background rate that's out there?","Then just on hep C, you say in your slide deck you're trending below the $3 billion for 2020, which obviously is right based on the current numbers, but MAVYRET looks to be having a very impressive early launch. I know that we won't be through contracting until through 2018, and 2019 is probably the year that it really steps up. But are you not perhaps a little bit more confident than you indicated in the slide deck that you could be around $3 billion at least by 2020?","And then just last on elagolix, I note the Priority Review. That's really interesting, particularly in light of the opioid use that's there. I'm just wondering what kind of additional labeling support or just what you're looking for there to be able to make the case that this could be part of the solution to the opioid epidemic, particularly in those women with endometriosis. Thanks very much.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Okay. Mike, maybe why don't you start by talking about the rate, and then I'll cover the other three?","Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.","Certainly. So on upadacitinib, what we've said is that we monitor the program very carefully, and we look at the aggregate data. And so when we monitor the data at this stage, we're looking in a blinded manner across our entire database. And it's important to understand that because I can't give you a rate that is a upadacitinib rate today without talking about unblinded data and ongoing studies, and I can't do that. So what I'll do is I'll talk about aggregate rates.","And what we said and what remains true is that those aggregate rates are consistent with the background. And we've said that the background, there's variability in that background, but those estimates are around 0.8. And so that hasn't changed. It also hasn't changed that we haven't seen anything that we consider a signal. And the aggregate of our monitoring program tells us that all the statements that we've made are still holding.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Okay, so let me talk a little bit about the psoriasis market first. I think what is being confused here is the slowdown in our product versus the slowdown in our market, and we had something similar happen roughly a year ago with a different product.","If you think about when OTEZLA entered the market, it really drove a number of patients, particularly the more mild patients into the market. And if you recall correctly, we saw the psoriasis market rate grow very rapidly over that period of time, the market rate. And essentially, what we're seeing now is that that product is no longer gaining traction. And therefore, that group of patients and that growth is no longer in the market.","But if you strip that out, which is what we do all the time to look at our performance, because we really compete in more of the moderate patient population where the biologics tend to compete, moderate to severe, that rate has stayed the same or accelerated. In fact, it's actually accelerated a bit because you'll have patients that don't get adequate response on OTEZLA that then move on to a biologic. And psoriasis is one of the fastest-growing segments we operate in, mid-teens growth rate. It's a very robust market. It's a highly attractive market. We perform extremely well within that market.","And so I'd say our point of view is very different, and I think our performance clearly demonstrates that it supports our point of view as being different. So I think it's not a question of the market, it's a question of the performance of that asset and what it drove into the marketplace.","On your third question, which was HCV greater than $3 billion, look, we're certainly tracking below $3 billion today. MAVYRET is off to a very good start, and I think MAVYRET does offer a significant opportunity for us going forward. I'd also say that we need to see this market sort itself out. This is a more challenging market to have a high degree of predictability in what you're going to be able to achieve and sustain over the longer term. Patient volumes have changed pretty dramatically. The competitive response in this market has been robust in certain situations.","And so we're just too early in that launch to make those kinds of predictions. We've obviously dialed in a certain level of HCV performance for 2018 in what we're projecting. I'd say we're optimistic, in fact, I'd say very optimistic about the uptake that we're getting in the marketplace. But we probably won't reach a real steady-state level until the second quarter of 2018, and then I think we'll be in a much better position to make longer-term projections. And based on the fact that I made one of these projections before, I'll probably wait till I have a little better idea of what that rate looks like.","Elagolix, I think, Jeff, you make an excellent point. This is an area where women are suffering from a significant level of chronic pain, and our clinical trial clearly demonstrated that we could reduce the level of pain medication use. And I think we would be hopeful that that will be something that's identified in the label. I think the trial was designed in a way where that should be something that would be an objective for us, and we do think it will serve an important purpose in treating people with endometriosis.","And so we need to go through the regulatory process, but that certainly will be an objective that we have for the asset. I think it will be an important objective for the asset going forward. And I can tell you that we're extremely excited about the opportunity for elagolix.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff. Operator, we'll take the next question.","Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Rick, you provided a ton of information in your strategic update, and I'm sure you're tired of talking, but I have a really, really simple question for you. Do you see a cliff at all? And if not, can you grow the company through whatever cliff you might see or some erosion from HUMIRA?","And I ask the question because, obviously, the stock has had a big move. But my sense is that if you look at the multiple, as you correctly pointed out, it is still at the bottom third, reflecting my sense is that investors still view that there is a cliff coming, albeit pushed out. So is that the right way to look at it, or do you think this is a company without a cliff and a company that can actually even grow through that cliff? Thanks.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Jami, if you look at our objective when we launched the company, we knew from day one that there was a point of time when we would be dealing with biosimilar competition on HUMIRA. And our whole focus on building a pipeline, a robust pipeline, was designed to allow us to be able to grow through that period.","And we talked over and over again about the importance of the 2019 date in order to launch those products and ultimately be able to drive them up the growth curve to the point where they are profitable and they are contributing significantly. And I think as we continue to advance, we are hitting all of those milestones that we set for ourselves to be able to do that. And so I would tell you that our whole intent was to be able to drive through that erosion curve that we expected.","I'd also say that as we watch biosimilars play out, mostly in the international markets is where we've seen most of the experience. They are operating in a way and the counter-strategies that the innovators are using are operating in a way that is consistent with our model that we will use, and we'll actually start that model in 2018 in markets that are going to see at the end of 2018 biosimilar competition outside the U.S. We're seeing erosion that is consistent with what we assume. And I think we will be able to deal with that in a way that is effective.","And so I would say could you have some lumpiness at certain points? I think you could. Do I think will we be able to grow through it on an extended basis? I don't think there's any question that we'll be able to grow through it.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Jami. Operator, we'll take the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Josh Schimmer from Evercore ISI Group.","Joshua Schimmer - Evercore ISI","Great, thanks for taking the question, two of them quickly. Can you provide an update for how the managed care contract negotiations have gone for HUMIRA and the rest of the portfolio as you approach 2018 and then have greater visibility into 2019?","And then maybe a question for Mike, as you think about allocation of R&D spending to the Stemcentrx portfolio, can you discuss what percent of the R&D budget do you think those assets will eventually consume? And do you have any plans to assess other targeting technologies beyond the ADC approach that you're currently using? Thanks.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","On the managed care contracting, so we're through all the contracting for managed care and PBMs for 2018. HUMIRA has over 95% preferred covered lives coverage, so we're very pleased with our overall coverage range.","And so I don't know specifically how many of those bridge into 2019, so I don't have that data available. But there was one change, and that was in Aetna, where Aetna did change our status for new patients. We've maintained existing patients, but Aetna is not a large number of covered lives, so that doesn't have any material impact on the brand or on the company, obviously. But as I said, we have a little over 95% preferred access, which is clearly where we want to be.","Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.","Okay, and so this is Mike. I'll take the question about Stemcentrx and our overall portfolio. So as we mentioned on the call, we have a very robust portfolio overall in R&D. And certainly within oncology, we are building considerable momentum. As I mentioned, we have 20 programs in the clinic, 17 of those are in early development. And that's a mix between Stemcentrx and other AbbVie programs. And so that makes it difficult to give you a percentage that Stemcentrx will represent going forward because, of course, that's going to be based on the total number of programs that advance into later-stage development. What I would say is we're seeing encouraging signs across that portfolio, on stem programs and other programs of activity, so we'd expect to advance a number of those programs.","And with respect to your question about targeting technologies, we certainly have a number of ADCs in our portfolio. We feel that the talents we have as an organization fit that very well in terms of our skills in small molecule chemistry and protein engineering and antibody engineering, but we are in no way limited to ADCs. We have very robust capabilities in small molecules, in novel biologics beyond monoclonal antibodies. We have a presence now in oncolytic viruses and other novel means to modulate targets. And so we're going to look at the targets that we have available, and we're going to pick the best modality that we can to address them, and that is in no way going to be limited to ADCs.","Joshua Schimmer - Evercore ISI","Great, thank you.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Josh. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks very much, and appreciate all the commentary earlier on the call. Maybe the first question is for Rick. It's just expanding on some of those earlier psoriasis comments you made and just thinking about that business going forward. You obviously have a significant position here with HUMIRA, but there's a number of very effective agents, including your own IL-23, either launching or about to launch.","So can you just elaborate a little bit more on, A), how much more room do you see for biologic shares to increase here? Maybe B), how do you see TNF's positioning versus these newer agents? And then C), on the pricing dynamics side, does this lead to an area where there could be more price competition, given all the options patients have?","And then my second question is on capital deployment priorities. Just given all the traction you've had on the pipeline, can you just update us a little bit about how you're thinking about capital deployment on a go-forward basis? Thank you.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Okay. So I think if you look at the psoriasis business \u2013 and I'd say in general, if you look at all of the areas where HUMIRA competes, it has been and continues to be a relatively crowded market. That hasn't changed the performance of HUMIRA, and I don't expect it to change going forward either.","Certainly, there are room in this market for significant additional biologic penetration. In fact, if you look at the psoriasis market, it has the lowest biologic penetration rates of the three major segments \u2013 rheum, GI, and derm. Derm is the lowest of the three, so it certainly has the greatest opportunity to be able to drive additional biologic penetration.","And there clearly is an opportunity to have differentiated products within that segment where you have very, very high efficacy products, like our IL-23, that fit in a portfolio with products like HUMIRA. And in fact, as we look at our positioning within that market, that is how we think about it. We think about HUMIRA will still be a workhorse product within that market, and risankizumab will fit in for where physicians have patients that ultimately want a higher level of efficacy, and it clearly has a very durable response.","I think the perception is in derm that over time you see a waning effect of these drugs. And in fact, if we look at the risankizumab data, what we see is just the opposite. As we go out in time, the response becomes more robust. And in fact, if you look at total clearance, it's 60% I think at 12 months, which is very impressive. We haven't seen an agent that looks like that.","Convenience of dosing is going to be another significant thing. There will be patients who prefer a less frequent dosing regimen. And so we see these attributes being able to fit together quite nicely and serve the broader patient population.","I think there's always pricing dynamics in every market that you operate in. I don't see anything in this market that has changed significantly, and I don't anticipate that we'll see something that changes, certainly over what is a reasonable time horizon, the next couple of years. So I don't see any dynamics there that overly concern me.","This is still going to boil down to having the right assets and having the right team to be able to execute those assets. And we view the whole concept of both upadacitinib and risankizumab in combination with HUMIRA give us a powerful portfolio of medicines to be able to serve this market even more broadly than we serve it today, and that gives us tremendous opportunity to be able to grow this business going forward.","We've given you some projections of what we think the market will look like and what we think we'll be able to do. If you think about those projections, the market that we compete in, these assets, $5 billion to $6.5 billion is what we're projecting for each asset by 2025. That represents roughly 7% market share for each asset. This is a big market. It's a market that is growing at a very rapid pace, and it's a market that the fundamentals still suggest that you can drive biologic penetration levels higher. And certainly, our execution level around that has demonstrated that.","On capital deployment, we're in the nice position that we have a business that generates a tremendous amount of capital. And as we continue to grow it at the rates we're growing it, that cash is only going to grow over time. And our first priority is always to deploy that cash against strategic opportunities to be able to continue to grow the business.","One of the things we did when we started the company is we committed that we would put in a long-term strategy that would allow us to be able to create a pipeline and fund that pipeline in a way that we could sustain growth over the long term. So we're always looking out in that period of 10 years to say do we have sufficient assets in the pipeline to be able to grow it? So I would always tell you that we'll be looking for those kinds of opportunities. And when we find them, we're going to go after them, and we're in the position to be able to do that. And I think we have the team that can go out and has demonstrated it can execute to get those assets when we want them.","And then the second part is, obviously, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders. We've certainly demonstrated that, both in the dividend \u2013 I mentioned in my comments, we've grown the dividend over 77% since we became a public company, and we've made significant share repurchases over that five-year time period. So we're in a position where we want to continue to grow that and look for opportunities to grow that. If we get tax reform that gives us greater access to our offshore cash, that will allow us to invest more in the U.S., and it will also allow us to be able to return more cash to shareholders, and that would be desirable to us.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Chris. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Geoff Meacham from Barclays.","Evan Seigerman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi all, this is Evan on for Geoff. Congrats on all the progress, and thank you for some of the longer-term guidance and insights, and one quick thank you to Liz and her team for the great strategic slides. They're very, very helpful. One on hep C. Given the evolving commercial landscape for hep C, what are some of your lessons learned on pricing and reimbursement? And then I have a follow-up on Rova-T.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Well, I don't know that I would describe them as lessons learned. I think as we indicated when we launched MAVYRET, one of the things that we look carefully at is what segment of the U.S. market would be available for this asset and what was the right go-to-market strategy to be able to access that, because we certainly viewed that as the early opportunity. And then obviously, we drove our decision to come out with a WAC that was in the price range that we came out with it. So whether you call that a lesson learned or you just say that basically in our analysis of how to be successful in this segment of the market, that was the strategy we came up with. I think you can look at it either way.","Certainly, I think as we look back at that decision, that was a good decision that clearly has had the impact that we had hoped it would have. And I think in general, we like stability in this market. Certainly, this is a market that has had significant price erosion over the last several years. Most of our contracting is positioned in a parity fashion, and we're totally comfortable with that. In fact, that's our preferred position because we believe this asset can compete effectively, quite effectively, on the attributes of the asset itself. And I think that is the positioning that we're using in the marketplace, and it's been effective.","Evan Seigerman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's great. And then on Rova-T, how has the bar changed in small-cell lung cancer, given there being other novel treatment approaches and now that you've pushed the data out, what is it, a quarter or two?","Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.","So small-cell lung cancer remains an area of very, very substantial unmet medical need. The standard of care hasn't changed in many years. And we view it in a positive way overall that there are now some therapies that look like they can make a real difference here, Rova-T included.","I'm not sure that the bar has changed substantially though. So for example, if you look at third-line or greater small-cell lung cancer, there are no approved therapies. Response rates based on expert opinion, because there really are no good clinical studies here, would probably be in the low single-digit range, if not zero. And survival is dismal. And as Rick mentioned, with recent I-O releases, objective response rates of 10% or 20% are meaningfully different from that.","And so there's a huge unmet medical need here, and there's an unmet medical need that relates not only to response rates but also to getting patients on a course that allows them to have good long-term outcomes. And those longer-term outcomes have been a strength of Rova-T based on its stem cell-targeting approach, cancer stem cell-targeting approach. So while there are encouraging signs, there's still a huge unmet medical need, and I don't think the bar has changed substantially.","Evan Seigerman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great, thanks for the questions.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Evan. Operator, we'll take the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Scala from Cowen.","Steve Scala - Cowen and Co. LLC","Many thanks. I have two questions, first a question on the settlement with Amgen on the HUMIRA IP. Settlements of this nature almost always include language allowing the challenger, obviously in this case Amgen, to launch earlier under certain circumstances. And one such circumstance might be another company's at-risk launch, and in this case, earlier than January of 2023, at least in the U.S. Such language was not in the AbbVie release, and I think it would be material information. So I'm wondering why an earlier launch by Amgen appears to not even be possible under any circumstances?","And secondly, can you be more specific on what RA studies will support the ABT-494 filing? Will it be all six or some subset of them? Many thanks.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Okay, I'll handle the Amgen settlement piece. We have an agreement with Amgen that we have not released all of the specifics around the contract between us and Amgen, and I'm certainly not going to do that now.","What I would tell you is this. What gives us confidence that we're not going to have earlier launches? Let's disconnect it from whether or not Amgen would be able to go to the market or not, is the fact that, one, we believe this clearly demonstrates the power of our IP. Number two, we've been very clear about our position and how we'll enforce our IP. And if necessary, we will attempt to get a preliminary injunction to block anyone that launches if they violate our IP.","I think if you look at the rulings that have come out of the patent office around the formulation patents alone, I would say that would be an extremely compelling argument with the court in order to obtain a preliminary injunction against someone. And I think the precedents would suggest that it would be unlikely that the court wouldn't follow what the patent office had described as they reviewed those patents and reaffirmed those patents against the challengers.","And so I think what gives us confidence is we fundamentally believe, one, that's an incredibly risky strategy for someone to take based on the size of this asset and the damage that would be done and the consequences of that damage if they lost. Number two, I don't know that I can be any clearer about what our intent is, but I think they understand what our intent would be to defend it. And number three, I think our probability of success of getting a PI is high.","Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.","Okay, so this is Mike. With respect to the RA studies for upadacitinib and what will support an NDA next year, as you mentioned, we have six studies, and those cover a range of patients from methotrexate inadequate responders to biologic inadequate responders. They include active comparator studies and studies aimed to look at structural endpoints.","And so we will file with at least five studies of the six. We've always considered five studies our core. There was a sixth study, which is a structural study, which was originally anticipated to take longer than the others, but it is moving forward ahead of schedule. So it's possible that that could actually come in at a time that it can be included, but we're going to continue to evaluate that, but it would either be five or six studies that we would include.","Steve Scala - Cowen and Co. LLC","Thank you.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Steve. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Geoffrey Porges from Leerink.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you very much and thanks for all the background color, first question for Mike. Mike, you've talked about upadacitinib in your observations. But could you just give us a sense of \u2013 we can't help this question of the BTE rate given what's happened with other programs. So could you give us a sense of the total clinical experience in RA and the number of observed events so far in the RA studies? I know that the studies are still blinded or some of them are, but it will be helpful to know where you stand. And then could you just comment on whether you're seeing any platelet increases or decreases?","And then on a related note, I'm struck by the timing of the launches of upadacitinib and risankizumab in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's, which are out in 2022 and 2023. Is there a bottleneck in study sites or in patient recruitment? Because it just seems a long time to have to wait for those programs in IBD to mature. If you could, help us understand that. Thanks.","Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.","Certainly. So with respect to rates across the program, I think the best answer that I can give you is the answer that I gave you in my prepared remarks, which is that we monitor the program in aggregate across all of the studies. And of course, we're still blinded on the majority of the studies and therefore the majority of our database. And when we look at that and when we look at those rates, those rates are consistent with the background rate that we've stated on a number of occasions. We're going to continue to monitor carefully, but we do not see that situation change.","I'll also refer to the remarks I made about our DMC. We are firewalled from our DMC by design, but our DMC has access to all of the data, including the unblinded data, and they have consistently recommended that we continue the program without any modifications. And if they had concerns, you certainly wouldn't expect that to have been their course of action.","With respect to platelet changes, we've looked at it. We've not seen any changes with platelets. Platelets remain stable on therapy. And I think platelets don't seem to be playing any part of the picture for upadacitinib.","In terms of launches in UC and Crohn's, it's early on in those programs. So we're always going to try to move as quickly as we can and advance programs rapidly, but we're not seeing any bottlenecks in sites. We're not seeing any bottlenecks in patients. In fact, recruitment across the program has gone very well, I think indicative of strong investigator and patient interest in the upadacitinib program broadly.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Geoff. Operator, we'll take the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great, thanks so much for taking my questions and also for all the details today. So a couple thoughts around the long-term plan and just maybe some updates to your thoughts when you made the plan in 2015 and the update today. So specifically around HUMIRA, and if you can, just what your assumptions are on pricing growth in the U.S. for that product between now and 2020, what's baked into that $21 billion number?","Second, HUMIRA in terms of the EU biosimilar impact, obviously it still looks like it's end of next year. Just what your thoughts are, we have a little more experience now with biosimilars, in fact, than when we did two years ago, so what you guys are assuming the impact will be on HUMIRA in Europe starting I guess in 2019?","And then finally, just around once we do see U.S. biosimilar direct competition, it sounds like in January 2023, is there any change to your outlook on the rate of erosion at that point, maybe just with some of the changing pricing dynamics or payer dynamics in this country, or do you feel pretty much the same about the erosion curve after 2023? Thanks so much.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Okay, Vamil, this is Rick. So HUMIRA pricing was your first question as it relates the long-term guidance. I think obviously, we do a long-range plan. What you're seeing is the result of what comes out of that long-range planning process. That's where these numbers obviously come from.","And we have communicated previously I think to the investment community that our typical strategy is that we are conservative particularly on the out years because it's much harder to predict from a pricing standpoint, so we tend to be relatively conservative on those out years. We evaluate it as we get close to the coming year what we think the dynamics are. We have recently come out and said that in 2018, we'll have one price increase, similar to what we did in 2017. And that price increase, I can't remember the specific language. Bill probably can. But it basically said that it would be below double-digit, and that is how we plan on operating in 2018. And so I think it's consistent with all of that.","As far as biosimilars outside of the U.S., we've obviously spent a lot of time studying both the Remicade biosimilar, which has been out there for a longer period of time, the Enbrel biosimilar. We're watching the Remicade biosimilar here in the U.S. as well. And we've modeled both our strategy and our expected erosion curves against the experience that we've seen there and the competitive response that we've seen and the effectiveness of that competitive response.","We've communicated as part of the previous long-range planning guidance that we gave, is that what we expect is for the brand internationally to peak at in 2018 and then start a modest erosion curve as we see biosimilars enter the marketplaces outside the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2018 moving forward. And if you model that going forward all the way through 2020, what you essentially would see is from peak to 2020, the erosion is about 15% or 20%.","Now what you have to remember is, unlike some of these other drugs, we are growing volume. In fact, we're growing volume outside the United States at a rate of high single digits, low double-digit volume increases. And if you looked at some of the other brands, when the biosimilar entered the marketplace, they weren't growing volume, and so therefore, they would have a greater impact on what their revenues eroded over that period of time.","So if you actually dial back in what we're assuming in the way of volume growth that will occur at the same time, then instead of being 15%, as an example, the number would be closer to about 25%, let's say. And that's relatively consistent, probably a little bit on the lower end compared to Remicade or Enbrel, but I'd say it's within the range of what we've seen from them. Now obviously, we hope to execute even better than that, but I think for planning purposes, that's a reasonable way for investors to think about it.","Your third point was erosion starting in 2023 and the impact that price would have at that point. Again, we have an erosion model that we've built. I think that erosion model is reflective of what we think is likely. It has built into it what we think the pricing assumptions would be leading up to that. And 2023 is a long ways out though. So we need to continue to monitor that, and we'll obviously adjust it along the way. But I'd say right now it factors in a relatively conservative level of price leading up to the biosimilars entering the marketplace.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Vamil. We've got now almost 90 minutes, so we got only time for one more question. Obviously, after the call, we'll be available to answer and address any additional questions that we're unable to get to in the queue today. So, operator, we'll take the last question.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today is from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank.","Gregory D. Fraser - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. It's Greg Fraser on for Gregg Gilbert. On elagolix, how are you thinking about the size of opportunity for endometriosis versus uterine fibroids? And how do you see your current new product business being impacted as adoption of elagolix grows?","And then a quick one on VENCLEXTA, how should we think about the market opportunity with a broader label based on the MURANO data? Thank you.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","If you look at elagolix in endometriosis, that deck that we provided you will give you the specific numbers, but I'll do this from recall. There are approximately about 2.5 million women in the U.S. that are diagnosed. We think that undiagnosed is probably in the range of about 4 million women. So obviously, it's a big opportunity, and it's the earlier opportunity. Now, there are more patients who have uterine fibroids, but uterine fibroids are behind endometriosis.","And so clearly, we think this is so multibillion-dollar opportunity in endometriosis. It is one that will require education because this is an area where there hasn't been any real new therapies in this market for 10 years or so. So it is going to require both patient education as well as physician education.","And so it will have a ramp that is consistent with the kinds of assets that require that kind of market development. And we're going to start that market development from a disease awareness standpoint prior to the approval of the drug. So we'll be starting that in 2018 to start to prepare the market for the launch of elagolix. But I think it's a very significant opportunity, and it's one we're obviously preparing for a high-level success.","As far LUPRON is concerned because of the side effect profile of LUPRON, LUPRON is incredibly effective at this. The problem is that it completely shuts down the access, and so it has all of the implications of essentially putting the patient into menopause. And so it's not a very desirable drug to use for this particular indication, and therefore the sales for this area are relatively modest. So it won't have a material impact at all. My guess is it will have significant erosion of the little bit that it has, but that won't have any kind of material impact overall.","And on MURANO, obviously, today we have a label that's essentially for 17p deletion, which is a relatively \u2013 it's an important segment of the market for those patients because they have difficult outcomes, but it's a relatively small number of patients. The broader relapsed\/refractory indication in CLL is a very significant opportunity. So this will drive \u2013 once we have this in the marketplace, we would expect that this will drive significant revenue ramping of VENCLEXTA.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, everyone.

Welcome to the AbbVie first quarter 2013 earnings conference  call.  (Operator Instructions)","I would now like to introduce Mr. Larry People, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Larry Peepo","","Good morning and thanks for joining us.  Also on the call with me today is Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and Bill Chase, Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer.  Joining us for the question and answer portion of the call are Laura Schumacher, Executive Vice President of Business Development, External Affairs and General Counsel and John Leonard, Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer.  ","Today, Rick will discuss AbbVie's results from the first quarter as well as highlights from our commercial portfolio and pipeline.  Following Rick's comments, Bill will give a more detailed review of the quarter and then provide an overview of our outlook for 2013 and the second quarter.  Following our comments, we'll take your questions.","Before we get started, some statements may be forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

","So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick.","Richard A. Gonzalez","","Thank you, Larry.  Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for AbbVie's first quarter 2013 earnings conference call.  ","Today, we're pleased to report strong results in our first quarter as an independent company with adjusted earnings per share of $0.68 exceeding our guidance range for the quarter.  We delivered this strong performance despite the decline in TriCor sales due to generic competition.  ","During the quarter, we executed on AbbVie's key priorities.  We drove continued growth of HUMIRA with more than 17% global operational growth.  We advanced our pipeline with continued progress across our mid and late state R&D programs.  This includes our Phase III HVC program, which is well underway and enrolling rapidly.  And we delivered return to our shareholders through a strong dividend.  ","As we said before, 2013 is a year of transition as we absorb the impact from the loss of exclusivity of our lipids franchise.  But 2013 is also a year of execution across both our commercial portfolio and our pipeline.  And we're off to a strong start on all fronts.  ","As I mentioned, we continue to see strong momentum from HUMIRA, particularly robust growth in dermatology and GI.  Our global launch of UC is going well with strong uptake in both the U.S. and Europe.  Beyond UC, we continue our development efforts for HUMIRA with several new indications currently in late stage trials.  We expect a cadence of data, registrations, and regulatory approvals over the next few years.  This includes our U.S. regulatory application for (Axiospa), which is currently under review.  And we also expect to submit our U.S. regulatory application for pediatrics' Crohn's disease in the coming months.  ","HUMIRA currently offers the broadest label in the category.  Several of the new indications we are pursuing will be unique, unique to our label and will help us further differentiate from competitive products and add to the sustainability and future growth of HUMIRA.  All told, we expect new indications including those approved in 2012 to add roughly $1.5 billion in incremental global sales.  ","As we track new product entrance, performance continues to be in line with our expectations with HUMIRA continuing to gain or hold market share across all indications.  Bill will talk more about HUMIRA and our other product performance in the quarter as well as our expectations for the year.  But it's fair to say that HUMIRA is off to a strong start this year, well on track to achieve our sales growth outlook for the product in 2013.  ","Now moving to our pipeline, as a bio-pharmaceutical company, advancing our pipeline is paramount to our long-term success.  We're focused on delivering innovative therapies to address the most pressing areas of unmet clinical need.  And we're encouraged with our progress.  Over the past year, we've advanced two promising programs into Phase III development including our Interferon free HVC program, which I'll discuss in more detail here in a moment.  ","We also expect to advance seven additional programs into late stage clinical trials over the next 12 to 18 months.  For example, Atrasentan, our newly discovered compound in development with diabetic kidney disease.  We'll present results of our Phase IIB study at the European renal association meeting next month.  And we're on track to initiate the Phase III program in the first half of this year.  ","ABT-199, our next generation BCL-2 inhibitor in development in partnership with Roche Genetech has shown strong activity in hematological malignancies.  Earlier this month, we presented Phase I data showing patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with ABT-199 experienced rapid tumor reduction.  We'll present additional data at the upcoming ASCO and EHA meetings in June.  ","As discussed on our last quarterly conference call late last year, we paused dose escalation and recruitment in several ABT-199 studies as we worked to refine the dosing and monitoring approach for patients at risk for tumor lysis syndrome.  We recently proposed an amended study protocol for ABT-199 in CLL.  Upon approval by the FDA, dose escalation and new patient recruitment will resume.  ","It remains our goal to initiate Phase II and Phase III studies in relapse or refractory CLL patients this year.  We continue to have a high level of enthusiasm for this compound, which we believe holds promise in a number of hematological malignancies.  ","ABT-888 is another compound within our oncology pipeline poised to advance into Phase III in early 2014.  ABT-888 is a PARP inhibitor.  It has shown promise in enhancing the effectiveness of common cancer therapies such as chemotherapy and radiation.  It's currently in Phase IIB for bracket deficient breast cancer and other cancers.  ","ABT-126 is our alpha-7 NNR agonist, currently in Phase IIB trials for Alzheimer's disease.  And cognizant impairment associated with schizophrenia.  Data from our Phase IIA proof of concept study in Alzheimer's disease will be presented at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in July.  And we'll present results from the schizophrenia study in 2014.  Provided our Phase IIB clinical work is successful, we'll initiate Phase III trials in both indications in 2014.  ","ABT-719, our novel investigational compound for the prevention of acute kidney injury.  Additional confirmatory Phase IIB study is currently ongoing.  And we'll enable Phase III initiation in early 2014.  ","Elagolix is compound with a unique profile currently in development for endometriosis and uterine fibroids, both prevalent conditions with few treatment options.  Our Phase III program for endometriosis is ongoing.  And we recently initiated a Phase IIB study in uterine fibroids.  Again, pending success in our mid-stage trial, the fibroid program is also poised to advance to Phase III next year.","So as you can see, we have a number of exciting programs on track to advance to Phase III development over the next year or so.  In addition to these assets, we have several other promising compounds already in late stage development.  This includes Daclizumab, which is in Phase III development in partnership with Biogen, for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.  Data from the first of two registrational trials, the select study, were recently published in the Lancet.  And results of the second year extension of that study called Selection were recently presented at the American Academy and Neurology meeting.  We expect results from the second pivotal study in 2014.","And finally, a central program within our late stage pipeline is our Interferon free HCV combination.  All the Phase III studies that will be included in our initial registration are now underway and enrolling very well.  In fact, ahead of expectations.  As we said before, the primary focus of our program is on delivering Interferon free treatments and offer patients the best chance for cure.  Our approach is to maximize SBR rates across various patient types from na\u00efve patients to the most difficult to treat with the simplest possible therapy.  ","Earlier this week at the ESO meeting in Amsterdam, we presented data from our large Phase IIB Aviator study showing that conditions with reduced response to Interferon base therapies, such as the level of fibrosis or IL28B genotype do not impact response to our Interferon free therapy.  We expect our Phase III study to begin to read out later this year and into 2014.  Reporting registration submission in mid-2014 given that our compounds have been granted fast track status by the FDA, we expect market entry in early 2015.  ","So in summary, we've delivered a strong first quarter.  And we continue to drive strong performance with our flagship product, HUMIRA as well as other products in our specially focused portfolio.  And we continue to make notable progress in advancing our pipeline, which we believe includes a number of exciting programs that have the potential to address significant medical need.  For a company of our size, the potential sales projections in our late stage pipeline represent an opportunity for meaningful revenue growth beginning in the 2015 timeframe.  ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.","William J. Chase","","Thank you, Rick.  Today, I'll spend some time talking about our first quarter performance.  I'll then turn to our outlook for the remainder of 2013.","As Rick said, we're very pleased with the strong first quarter we delivered.  Total sales increased 5.1% on an operational basis excluding an unfavorable 1.4% impact from foreign exchange.  ","Excluding TriCor\/Trilipix due to loss of exclusivity, sales increased 8.6% on an operational basis.  ","The first quarter adjusted gross margin ration was 76.2% excluding intangible amortization and other specified items in line with our expectation for the quarter.  This reflects both the loss of exclusivity within our lipid franchise as well as the effect of unfavorable foreign exchange on the ratio.  ","Adjusted SG&A was 27.9% of sales in the first quarter including continued investment in our growth brands and the incremental costs of becoming an independent company.  This level of investment was in line with our expectations for the quarter.  And we remain on track for a full-year adjusted SG&A of around 26% of sales.  ","Adjusted R&D was 14.6% of sales in the first quarter reflecting funding actions in support of our emerging mid and late stage pipeline and the continued pursuit of additional HUMIRA indications.  ","Net interest expense was $66 million in the first quarter.  And other income was $18 million.  The adjusted tax rate was 22.2% in the quarter.  ","First quarter adjusted earnings per share excluding non-cash intangible amortization expense and specified items were $0.68, which exceeded our previous guidance range.  On a GAAP basis, earnings were $0.60 per share.  ","Turning to product sales in the quarter, HUMIRA delivered global sales of more than $2.2 billion, up more than 17% on an operational basis.  In the U.S., HUMIRA sales increased nearly 24% driven by continued market expansion and share gains in the (duram) and gastro segments.  ","Internationally, HUMIRA sales grew 13% on an operational basis and nearly 11% on a reported basis as a result of strong market growth and some modest benefit from tender timing.  As we look to the second quarter for international HUMIRA sales specifically, we would expect a modest negative impact from tender timing in some markets, particularly Brazil.  On a global basis however, we expect low double digit sales growth for HUMIRA in the second quarter in line with our full year outlook.  ","AndroGel sales were up low single digits in the quarter following strong 2012 performance.  AndroGel continues to maintain more than 60% share of the testosterone replacement market.  ","Growth in the quarter was impacted by a moderation in the rate of overall market growth as well as the year-over-year impact of rebating actions implemented in mid-2012.  Based on current trends, we're forecasting AndroGel sales growth in the mid-single digits for 2013.  ","Global sales of Lupron were approximately $180 million in the first quarter.  For the full year 2013, we expect Lupron sales to be roughly in line with 2012.  ","Moving onto our lipid franchise, TriCor\/Trilipix sales were $128 million in the quarter, down roughly 50% due to the entry of generic Fenofibrate in November of 2012.  U.S. sales of Niaspan were $186 million in the quarter, down 2.6%.  As a reminder, we're forecasting 2013 sales of less than $1 billion for our combined lipid franchise, reflecting a decline of roughly $1.2 billion, which will be exhibited more acutely in the second half of the year.  We plan to offset our lipid franchise decline through growth of key marketed products including HUMIRA.  ","Moving onto Snythroid where U.S. sales were $119 million in the quarter.  Synthroid maintains strong brand loyalty and market leadership despite the entry of generics into the market many years ago.  For the full year, we expect to see Synthroid sales growth in the mid-single digits.  ","U.S. sales of Creon were $90 million in the first quarter, up more than 32% compared to the first quarter of 2012.  Creon maintains market leadership in the pancreatic enzyme market where we continue to capture the vast majority of new prescription starts.  This quarter, we received FDA approval for a new dosage strength of Creon.  The new 36,000 lipase unit dose is the highest available, which may help to reduce pill burden for some patients. This approval further strengthens our leadership position because we are able to offer patients the broadest range of dosage strengths in the class.  In 2013, we expect U.S. Creon sales to grow at a low double-digit pace.  ","Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease performed well in the first quarter with growth of more than 8%.  Duodopa is currently approved in Europe and other international markets.  We completed registrational studies last year.  And are in the process of pursuing regulatory approval in the U.S.  ","Turning now to our full year 2013 outlook, we are confirming our adjusted earnings per share guidance of $3.03 to $3.13.  This guidance continues to contemplate sales somewhat above $18 billion reflecting growth from key brands offsetting the expected decline in lipids.  Included in our sales guidance is an estimated negative impact from exchange of slightly less than 1%.  ","We're forecasting a gross margin ratio of around 76.5% for the full year excluding non-cash amortization.  This forecast reflects both the impact of loss of exclusivity events and the effect of unfavorable foreign exchange.  ","We anticipate R&D expense to be approximately 14.5% of sales reflecting funding actions in support of our emerging mid and late state pipeline and the continued pursuit of additional HUMIRA indications.  And we expect SG&A to be around 26% of sales.  ","We're forecasting net interest expense of approximately $300 million for the full year.  And we expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 22% in 2013.  ","Our adjusted earnings per share guidance range excludes $0.37 per share of non-cash intangible amortization expense and certain specified items primarily associated with separation related costs and ongoing restructuring activities.  Earnings per share would be $2.66 to $2.76 on a GAAP basis.  We're still in the process of quantifying certain one-time costs related to the separation.  And we will look to further refine our forecasts of these specified items as the year progresses.  Finally, we expect approximately $6 billion of operating cash flow in 2013.  ","Regarding our second quarter outlook, we expect adjusted earnings per share or $0.78 to $0.80.  This excludes roughly $0.12 of specified items and non-cash amortization resulting in a second quarter GAAP EPS of $0.66 to $0.68.  ","Our second quarter outlook reflects sales growth in the low single digits on a reported basis including a modest impact from negative exchange.  We expect the gross margin ratio for the quarter to be somewhat above our full year guidance.  And we expect R&D and SG&A as a percentage of sales to be in line with our full year outlook.  ","So in conclusion, we're pleased with our first quarter performance as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year.  With that, I'll turn it over to Larry.","Larry Peepo","","Thanks, Bill.  We'll now open the call for questions.  Elan, we'll take our first question.  ","","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator instructions).  Our first question today is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.  ","Jami Rubin \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you.  Just a couple of questions.  First, can you hear me okay?  ","Richard Gonzalez","","We can. ","Jami Rubin \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great.  So on HUMIRA, sales were up 17% on an operational basis.  Bill, you talked about tendering that could impact international sales, but still, your guidance for the full  year of low double digit growth does assume a, you know, decline in the pace of growth throughout the year.  I\u2019m  just wondering if you could talk about why you expect such a slowdown or if it\u2019s just too early in the year to make adjustments to your forecast?  ","And secondly, if John Leonard is on the phone, I just wanted to ask a question on ABT-199.  It sounds like you\u2019re making progress with the FDA in refining the trial so that you can remove the pause, but what gives you confidence that the tumor lysis syndrome is based on a dose response mechanism and not based on the drug mechanism itself?  Thanks very much. ","Richard Gonzalez","","Thanks, Jami. ","John Leonard","","Jami, it\u2019s John Leonard.  I will go first. Thanks for the question.  Just for everybody on the phone, let me remind you, we had, at the very end of last year some instances of tumor lysis syndrome in some of our early studies with ABT-199.  ","We voluntarily paused enrollment in some of the studies that we were doing and with the FDA, went on a partial clinical hold for the CLL studies.  In the last couple of months, we\u2019ve very carefully gone back retospectfully looking at all those patients to understand what might be any risk factors for TLS and now we\u2019ve been working with the FDA.  So let me give you a sense of exactly where we are.  ","We\u2019ve identified risk factors that we think are clearly related to the tumor burden itself.  In other words, those patients that had experienced any evidence of POS all had large tumor burdens associated with it.  And with that, we have taken that into consideration going forward.  ","So I\u2019m pleased to report that in the instances of multiple myrloma and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, we\u2019ve resumed enrollment, that site is actively going on.  And we\u2019re in the very final stages of working with the FDA to resume enrollment in the CLL studies.  ","Essentially what\u2019s going on is some final work to refine the actual prophylactic regiment for handling some well-known side effects of TLS.  ","I think to your question, Jami, we\u2019re pretty confident that one can step through dosing in a graded fashion and have tumor dye at a controlled rate and well-known, well-characterized prophylactic measurements \u2013 or measures.  We believe that we should be able to readily handle TLS.  ","Richard Gonzalez","","Jami, this is Rick.  So let me answer your HUMIRA question.  Certainly, we\u2019re off to a strong start.  Now, one of the things that Bill pointed out in his remarks is we did have some tenders move from second quarter into first quarter, so first quarter is, you know, slightly up and we\u2019ll see that reverse in second quarter.  But all in all, still overall, if you looked at the average, we have very strong growth.  We\u2019re also only a quarter into 2013, so it\u2019s probably a little early to change any projects that we have for the product.  But I \u2013 suffice to say, we\u2019re confident with the performance that we\u2019ve projected for HUMIRA and we\u2019ll just have to see how the rest of the year plays out.  ","Jami Rubin \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you.  ","Richard Gonzalez","","Thanks, Jami. ","Operator","","Thank you.  And our next question is from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.  ","David Risinger \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks very much.  ","Richard Gonzalez","","Good morning. ","David Risinger \u2013 Morgan Stanley","I have three questions on separate drug candidates.  First, and, you know, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth going into a lot of detail because there would be too much ground to cover on HCV, but if you could hopefully just frame, as you see it, the timing of launch for your all-oral regimen and if you could position that relative to Gilead\u2019s timing, that would be helpful in terms of the all-oral regimen.  ","And then second, with respect to ABT-199, I\u2019m just curious about whether there\u2019s any risk of the lower dosing constraining the efficacy?  I.e. yielding lower efficacy.  And then finally, with respect to ABT-126, I noticed in the press release that you\u2019re hoping to start Phase III trials next year.  Could you just talk about the timing of news flow for ABT-126 for Alzheimer\u2019s and also for cognition and schizophrenia?  Thank you.  ","John Leonard","","Okay, I\u2019ve been scribbling notes with your questions.  :Let me take them in reverse.  So ABT-126, let me give you a sense of where we are, David.  We\u2019re doing Phase IIb work as we speak and that\u2019s meant to extend the proof of concept, call it 2a work that was done with modified studies and limited dosing.  So what we want to do is more fully flush out what the efficacy curve might look like and with that, characterize even higher doses that we were not in a position to test when we did our first study.  ","Two different indications, you\u2019re correct.  Alzheimer\u2019s disease as well as cognitive disorders, so schizophrenia or CIA as it\u2019s now called.  ","With respect to the news flow, we will share the data from that first 2a study in Alzheimer\u2019s disease in July at the Alzheimer\u2019s meeting and our plans right now for the CIS data would be in 2014.  We haven\u2019t chosen a venue yet, but as we have that, obviously, we\u2019ll share that with you.  ","Let me move onto 199.  It\u2019s sort of an extension, I think, of Jami\u2019s earlier question.  The premise of your question, I think, is a little incorrect if I understood it.  I took it to imply that what we\u2019re doing is giving lower doses on a continuous basis of the patients, and therefore, the higher doses that we might want to get to may not be reached and therefore, efficacy might be constrained a bit.  That\u2019s not what we\u2019re doing.  Essentially what we\u2019re doing is a walking up doses and we\u2019re convinced that as tumor dies the risk of tumor lysis syndrome will recede because there\u2019s less material from the tumor to be dealt with and therefore you can get to those higher doses that have been associated with the outstanding activity that we\u2019ve observed today.  ","So it may take a little bit longer to get there, which is what we\u2019ll be working out here as we go, but in terms of being able to deliver what we want to deliver for these patients, we\u2019re very confident we\u2019re going to be able to get there.  ","And then finally HCV was the first question, launch timing. I mean, it\u2019s no secret that we\u2019re all working as fast as we can.  It\u2019s a very competitive space.  We have an excellent team on that.  They\u2019re working flat out.  We\u2019ve communicated along the way that we would expect a very early 2015 launch.  We\u2019re confident that we will meet that and we\u2019ll see where Gilead is with respect to that timing as well.  ","David Risinger \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Thank you. ","Richard Gonzalez","","Thanks David.  ","Operator","","Thank you.  Our next question is from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.  ","Jeff Holford \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Hi, good morning.  Thanks for taking my question.  I just got two really.  First off, on the additional HUMIRA patents that you have submitted to the patent office already, I think they\u2019re mainly manufacturing and formulation patents, can you give us any update on any expected timing of when we might see some more news on those?  And also, just around that as well, when you might begin to flush out how the new formulation work around HUMIRA and when we\u2019ll get some more visibility on that too.  ","And then the second question is just some dated thoughts really from you if you have any on the competitive positioning of your Hep C cocktail following these updates from Gilead and in particular, Bristol Myers as well.  Thank you. ","William Chase","","Thanks, Jeff.  I\u2019ll take the HUMIRA patent question and the reformulations and I\u2019ll let Dr. Leonard or Rick go with the latter question. ","You know, certainly we do have a number of patents that we have submitted at this point in time.  You\u2019re right to characterize those as process manufacturing, etcetera.  You know, obviously, this is very competitive space and you know, we\u2019re not going to provide a lot of granularity around what those look like and the timing, but it\u2019s safe to say that we do have a fairly significant and robust portfolio of applications in right now.  Obviously trying to do as much as we can to protect HUMIRA in the event that bio-similars do find a pathway to market.  ","In terms of reformulation, again, a similar story.  You know, we\u2019ve talked about opportunities to enhance the product both from a delivery mechanism as well as the product itself.  We\u2019re not going to be very specific in terms of what that looks like and the timing, but again, we are working on those.  We have a window here, our patents don\u2019t expire until later in the decade and we\u2019re putting forth as much effort as we can right now to enhance the products such that if someone is working towards a bio-similar of today\u2019s product, that may not be the product that exists down the road.  ","So I think I\u2019ll leave it at that, Jeff.  Hopefully that\u2019s helpful.  ","Jeff Holford \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Thank you. ","Richard Gonzalez","","Jeff, this is Rick.  So on the competitiveness of the HCV, you know, as I said in my comments, you know, our goal is to basically deliver therapy to the marketplace.  It gives patients the greatest opportunity to be cured.  And we want to do that as broadly as we possibly can across [inaudible].  We want to be able to do that for na\u00efve patients and we want to do that for even the very difficult to treat and all those fibrotic patients, et cetera.  ","I think as we look at our data and the data we just presented last week at EASL, I think we\u2019re demonstrating that.  You know, you look at the fibrosis data and the aisle 28b data that we presented at that meeting and I think we have outstanding performance, right.  It doesn\u2019t degrade at all.  So I think we feel very good about the competitiveness of our program based on the objectives that we have for it and we feel good about the timeline that we\u2019re operating against. ","And so, I think we have a high level of confidence in our HCV program. ","Jeff Holford \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Thanks very much.","Richard Gonzalez","","Thanks, Jeff. ","Operator","","Thank you.  Our next question is from Greg Gilbert from Bank of America.  ","","Greg Gilbert \u2013 Bank of America","Thank you, good morning.  A couple quick ones.  First, is there any color on HUMIRA outside the U.S. you can offer in terms of lumpy order patterns or tenders as we progress  through the remaining quarters of the year?  ","Secondly, I was curious if you\u2019re willing to quantify your royalty burden on the product and how that changes over time?  ","And third, for John, I wanted your take on your strategy for \u2013 and sort of your take on overall the breakthrough status versus fast-track status that is available to the industry and how that might apply to your novel portfolio.  Thanks. ","John Leonard","","It\u2019s John.  The regulatory question of breakthrough status, you know, it\u2019s an avenue that the Food and Drug Administration has opened up that we think is a valuable one in that it permits more access and more opportunity to discuss data as it emerges and to have good planning.  It doesn\u2019t necessarily predict a regulatory outcome, however, or accelerate the review.  So we filed for breakthrough status on some of our products and we\u2019re looking forward to hearing from the FDA so that we can, as always, welcome additional interaction with them.  ","But I think in terms of planning for review status and all that, I would treat it essentially the same way that we always have until now.  ","William Chase","","And Greg, it\u2019s Bill Chase.  On the \u2013 on your HUMIRA tender question, as you know, tenders occur fairly choppily throughout the year.  If you look at Q1 in international, even if you exclude those tenders, international still had double digit HUMIRA growth.  The tenders actually gave it about a 3% lift.  We\u2019d see that basically coming out of Q2 and then the second half of the year, a little difficult to call at this point in time, but it does have a tendency to move around a little bit on us and we\u2019ll certainly give you visibility as that occurs.  ","Greg Gilbert \u2013 Bank of America","Okay, so a few percentage points in a given quarter is a decent way to think about it? ","William Chase","","Yeah, I think that\u2019s the right way to look at it.  ","Greg Gilbert \u2013 Bank of America","Okay.  Thanks. ","Richard Gonzalez","","And Greg, this is Rick on the HUMIRA royalties.  You know, we don\u2019t provide product level P&L detail, so we\u2019re not going to go through the royalties in any level of detail.  What I would say is there have been reports put out, Jami\u2019s report in particular that came out recently.  I think the premise behind that report, we would feel is accurate, is appropriate.  And the range that was characterized in that report of 5 to 10%, if you looked at it across on a global basis I think is a reasonable range to think about it.  So I think that should give you some clarity around the royalties and the expiration of those royalties.  ","Greg Gilbert \u2013 Bank of America","Thanks. ","Operator","","Thank you.  Our next question is from Chris Shad from JPMC.  ","Chris Shad - JPMC","Great, thanks very much.  Just a couple questions here.  The first is, just with the negative opinion from [inaudible] last night in Europe, just mention any thoughts you might have of kind of what that means to the dynamic impact to the HUMIRA business, et cetera.  ","The second question, just coming out of EASL, I think there was some comments in the company that they would consider looking for partners in the [inaudible].  I just wonder if you could elaborate a little bit on that and talk about any priorities there.  ","And then finally on the oral [inaudible] programs, just update where we are there maybe as you\u2019re considering that, just maybe longer-term, how important do you see having an oral agent in the portfolio and maybe second, how much differentiation you believe you believe you\u2019re going to see between the various jacks that are out there.  Thank so much.  ","John Leonard","","Thanks for the question, it\u2019s John Leonard.  Let me start with the EASL comments.  Scott\u2019s comments were taken out of context and are not accurate.  We\u2019re very confident in the work that we have with our first generation program.  We\u2019re also extremely excited and confident about the elements of our second generation program.  We\u2019ve not been actively looking for partners.  I think the story was essentially a distraction.  ","With respect to Jack, the importance of having an oral jack, we\u2019ve shared our longer-term strategy in the immunology space is to try to enhance the overall benefit risk profile and I think we\u2019ve seen some evidence of how important that is.  Our goal is to take some of the learnings that have come from the jack space and try to tease that apart and build that into our own oral program with the intention of getting to higher levels of efficacy than achieved in the space.  That\u2019s our primary goal and of course, that\u2019s what we\u2019re striving for. ","With respect to where we are, you undoubtedly know that we have a relationship with Golopogas, they\u2019ve shared some early information on their compound, which we think is very, very exciting and they\u2019re moving into 2b work the middle of this year.  That will be dose ranging that will test q.d. and b.i.d regimens. We\u2019re very excited about its profile, particularly with respect to what we think is a very attractive adverse event profile and the efficacy, oh well, based on small patient numbers for a short duration, we think is definitely intriguing and worth pursuing.  ","Our own internal jack program goes for  great specificity to select out the jack 2 activity, which we think has been dose limiting in some of the first generation compounds and that\u2019s well into its Phase I program and progressing well.  ","Richard Gonzalez","","All right, Chris, this is Rick.  I\u2019ll cover the Pfizer comment.  I mean, basically we don\u2019t know much more about the Pfizer situation than you do, than what\u2019s been publically reported.  So you know, I think as far as the dynamics are concerned, our projections would have been a relatively modest impact in 2013 anyway in Europe, based both on the timing and how difficult this market is to break into.  I think you\u2019re seeing that in the U.S. launch today.  The challenge is that any competitor coming into this market tends to face.  I don\u2019t think it has any dramatic impact on what we had forecast and we\u2019ll just have to see how it plays out longer term as Pfizer continues to pursue approval of that product in Europe.  ","Thanks, Chris. ","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question is from Marc Goodman from UBS.  ","Marc Goodman \u2013 UBS","Yes, first on Duodopa, which we haven\u2019t talked about yet, can you just give us the sense of what are the major countries that it\u2019s doing well in in Europe and just flush out how you\u2019re doing on the new delivery system that you\u2019re working on? ","John Leonard","","With respect to Duadopa\u2019s launch, primarily in Europe, and it\u2019s used most in the Nordic countries, I think that\u2019s where it\u2019s getting most of its use.  ","Thanks, Marc. ","Operator","","Thank you.  Our next question is from Michael Tong from Wells Fargo","Michael Tong \u2013 Wells Fargo","Hi, good morning.  I actually want to ask an AndroGel question.  You made the comment about a slowdown in the growth of that market.  Do you think that\u2019s temporary or is that permanent and are you surprised that the market growth has actually decelerated with a couple of new entries or, you know, recent entries into the marketplace?  ","And then second question is, from Bill, if you can remind me your CapEx expectations for 2013?  Thanks. ","Richard Gonzalez","","Michael, this is Rick.  On AndroGel, you know, we have seen the markets slow down.  You have to remember, this is a market that grew very rapidly in 2012, so if you look at the average in the first quarter, I think it\u2019s down around high-single to 10% kind of range.  You know, I think that\u2019s probably a reasonable expectation to think about going forward from a market growth standpoint, that this market will grow roughly in the high-single digits kinds of ranges going forward.  I don\u2019t think that surprises us that much.  You know, every market tends to slow down over time and I think if you look at the fundamentals of this market, that\u2019s what we would expect going forward.  ","And so that \u2013 our planning assumptions are now built around that kind of market growth going forward for 2013. ","William Chase","","And Michael, it\u2019s Bill.  On a CapEx, this is a business that runs pretty lean on CapEx.  We are, over the next couple of years, obviously going to have to separate from Abbott, which will increase CapEx somewhat, but this year we\u2019re anticipating about 500 to $600 million. ","Michael Tong \u2013 Wells Fargo","Thank you. ","William Chase","","Thanks, Michael. ","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question is from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets.  ","Alex Arfaei \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","","Good morning.  Thank you for talking the questions.  Just a follow-up on HUMIRA. I was wondering if I could ask a higher-level question.  We\u2019d love to get your insight about some of the trends you\u2019re seeing in different geographies, for example, are things getting better in Europe?  You know, if you could elaborate a little bit more on emerging markets.  We know there are a few smaller biosimilars in a couple of emerging market countries, if you see that a, you know, what your outlook is with that in general.  Just an overall picture on, not just so much for arthritis but also different indications.  Thank you. ","Richard Gonzalez","","Alex, this is Rick Gonzalez.  So I think if you look at Europe and you\u2019re seeing this for a number of years now, we continue to see good strong robust growth in Europe in this particular area.  I think one of the things that Europe has really adopted and valued is the ability to be able to put the disease in remission and be able to hold it in remission for long periods of time.  So you know, we continue to see market growth in the double digit range in that market.  When you look at the penetration rates across all three major areas, the penetration rates are still relatively low and so we would expect that we\u2019ll continue to see that growth going forward in the programs that we have I place I think have been demonstrated to be very effective at both helping market growth as well as driving improvement in share, growth in share in the indications particularly [inaudible] as I indicated.  But also we\u2019re continuing to hold our own from an RA shares standpoint.  And so I think we feel good about the dynamics in Europe.  You know, there\u2019s still problematic countries in Europe, for sure, but I think overall, if you look at Europe in general it\u2019s performing within our expectations and I think it\u2019s a market that we think is a good market for products like HUMIRA.  ","As far as the emerging market, I think one of the things that\u2019s important to remember is that, you know, the majority of our business is still in the developed markets, roughly 85% of our revenues come from the developed markets.  There are some emerging markets like a Brazil that are relatively large markets for us but there are also a number of markets that are relatively small.  And so we have not seen any material impact from any biosimilar competition in the emerging markets or anything what we would perceive to be any kind of an issue for the business going forward in those emerging markets.  ","Alex (Arfaei) \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Great.  Thank you very much.","Larry Peepo ","","Thanks, Alex.  We have time for one more question today. ","Operator","","Thank you.  Our final question today is from Damien Conover from Morningstar Investment Services.  ","Damien Conover \u2013 Morningstar Investment Services","Hey, good morning.  Thanks for talking my question.  Just two questions.  One on HUMIRA sales in the U.S.A., very strong growth, but in the press release, rheumatoid arthritis wasn\u2019t really called out for the support of that growth.  I was just wondering if you could talk through some of the dynamics there.  ","And then secondly, when you\u2019re looking at the hepatitis C market in a broad picture, as these next generation of [inaudible] come to the market with very strong efficacy and lower side effects, I was wondering if you could share your thoughts on the expected treatment rates for this space given that it\u2019s very low right now, just so to take a look at the overall market growth.  Thank you. ","Unidentified Company Representative","","On HUMIRA U.S. sales, you know, on RA we called out the more rapid growers and that would be gastro and dermatology.  Certainly we do still see growth in RA, it\u2019s certainly more modest than those other two areas, call it mid-single digit growth for the market, maybe a little bit stronger for us.  And again, holding share  despite new entrance into the RA space, but certainly a lot of our growth continues to come from dermatology and gastro, derma on the low end of penetration rates, we continue to see a lift in penetration rates, which, as you know, are still only in the single digits at this point in time in dermatology.  So we called up the two biggest growers but RA continues to grow and we\u2019re holding share in that space.  ","Richard Gonzalez","And Damien, this is Rick.  On the HCV question, you know, as we look at this market, we do expect to see some acceleration, significant acceleration in market growth.  I mean, I think to frame the size of the market and give you some perspective on it, you know, today if we look at geno-type 1 and the G7, we would estimate somewhere around 2.5 million people are currently diagnosed as being infected with the disease.  If you go back to 2011, roughly 175,000  patients were treated.  And so there is some clinical capacity constraints that exist today with the current therapies.  As we bring these next generations of products to the marketplace in that 2015 timeframe, there\u2019re obviously simpler protocols to be able to administer from a physician\u2019s standpoint and the side effect profile is dramatically improved from the generation of products that exist today.  ","So you would expect that you would be able to increase the number of patients who are treated at that point.  We\u2019re estimating that that number could grow to the 350 kind of thousand range per year.  ","As far as the patient types, I think, you know, our perspective on it is, this is a disease that progresses very slowly and as these new therapies come to market, we think that healthcare systems and physicians will prioritize those patients that need the therapy the most and I think particularly if you can bring a therapy to market that has a 90% plus kind of mature rate for those patients, which hasn\u2019t been seen before with the current therapies that exist today, there\u2019ll be motivation to go treat those patients.  And so we think in the early parts of the launch, the first few years, that we should see a significant number of those patients being treated.  Obviously, that makes us feel good about our particular therapy.  Thank you. ","Operator","","That concludes today\u2019s conference call."],"502":["AbbVie Inc.

Following our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll take your questions.","So with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Rick.","Rick Gonzalez ","Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Today we are pleased to report strong results with adjusted earnings per share of $0.94, up more than 32% from the first quarter of 2014 and significantly exceeding our guidance range for the quarter. Our performance included strong operational sales growth of nearly 18%, we delivered these results with growth across the number of products in our portfolio including update of our new HCV therapy Viekira, as well as strong growth from HUMIRA, Synagis, Synthroid, Creon and Duodopa.","We continue to see strong underlying demand for HUMIRA with accelerating new U.S. prescription growth and continued market-share gains. We also saw improvement in gross margin to 82.9% and we continue to see our investment in the business deliver strong results. Based on our out-performance, we\u2019ve raised our full year EPS guidance range for 2015 by $0.05, reflecting our strong underlying business performance year-to-date and the expected continued positive trends through the remainder of the year and we\u2019ve also done this despite the negative impact of foreign exchange.","In addition to our strong financial results we also have advanced several of our most important strategic priorities during the quarter. Since the start of the year, we\u2019ve achieved a number of important regulatory and development milestones including the EMA approval of our interferon-free HCV treatment. The regulatory submission and priority review of our 2-DAA ribavirin-free once daily combination for genotype 1b HCV patients in Japan.","The U.S. regulatory approval for DUOPA our therapy for advance Parkinson disease and the U.S. and EMA regulatory submissions for Zinbryta, our novel treatment relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. We also reported positive top-line efficacy data results from the first goal ex-pivotal trial in endometriosis. And recently our partner Galapagos reported positive data on our partnered selective JAK-1 compound. Each of these milestones continue to underscore the advancement and robust nature of our mid and late stage pipeline. Importantly we recently announced the acquisition of Pharmacyclics, a strategic addition to our business that will provide significant benefit for our shareholders and the patients which we serve.","Pharmacyclics acquisition will add another compelling growth platform to add these existing strong prospects in immunology and virology. We'll accelerate AbbVie\u2019s clinical and commercial presence in oncology broadening our portfolio in haematological oncology an attractive and rapidly growing market and a segment where we have several other assets in mid and late stage development. While strategically important this acquisition will also drive strong financial benefits, it further diversifies our revenue base and significantly enhances our revenue growth across our long range plan. We expect the transaction will be accretive beginning in 2017 and significantly accretive in the years to follow specifically as we have outlined we expect accretion in excess of $0.60 per share in 2019, ramping to more than $1 per share by 2021.","The addition of Pharmacyclics will augment at these already strong position and growth prospects. We remain on track to complete the acquisition in the second quarter. When we launched AbbVie as an independent company nearly 2.5 years ago it was our stated goal to build an innovation driven patient focused biopharmaceutical company which can deliver strong sustainable performance over the long-term. Our efforts have been focused on developing our culture of innovation and building a strong and talented team, driving strong performance from our current portfolio and building a robust pipeline of innovative new drugs, and enhancing our efficiency and delivering outstanding returns for our shareholders.","As we look back at our performance we are pleased to say that we've made significant progress towards all of these objectives. Our 2015 guidance underscores our goal of driving industry leading growth this year. As we expect earnings per share growth of nearly 27% at the midpoint of our guidance range. Our strong first quarter performance certainly supports our ability to deliver on this objective. And we expect to be among the top performers over our long range plan. In fact given our execution across the number of fronts in the strategic actions that we've taken in the business and now the addition of Pharmacyclics we\u2019re well positioned to generate top tier growth through the rest of this decade and beyond.","As we look at our business following the acquisition we\u2019re strategically positioned with a number of compelling growth platforms. Clearly we\u2019re enthusiastic about our oncology franchise. The acquisition of Pharmacyclics is highly complementary with our existing oncology pipeline which is comprised of five late stage assets poised to launch over the next few years. This includes our BCL-2 inhibitor [indiscernible] and our dual PI3 kinase inhibitor Duvelisib both being investigated for the treatment of a wide range of blood cancers. So our portfolio will include three novel and promising mechanisms for the treatment of hematological malignancies.","BTK inhibition, Bcl\u20102 inhibition and PI3 kinase inhibition. We intend to move quickly to explore combination therapies that have the potential to significantly elevate the standard of care and approve efficacy in hematological cancers. The combinations have the potential to reduce or eliminate the toxic chemotherapeutic age being used in the management of these conditions. Our oncology pipeline also includes veliparib our PARP inhibitor being investigated for a wide range of solid tumors and ABT\u2010414 our antibody-drug conjugate for Glioblastoma Multiforme, both of which have demonstrated promising signals of efficacy.","We\u2019re also partnering with Bristol-Myers Squibb on elotuzumab in late stage development for front-line and relapsed\/refractory multiple myeloma. We'll see data from a number of our oncology programs as the year progresses including data from genetic labs and lapsed refractory CLL patients with 17p deletion as well as mid-stage data on veliparib in non-small-cell lung cancer, and Phase 3 data on elotuzumab and relapsed\/refractory multiple myeloma.","We also anticipate numerous readouts on Imbruvica, including data from RESONATE-2 study in CLL Phase 3 monotherapy data and relapsed\/refractory mantle cell lymphoma and additional details from the Phase 3 trial on the last refractory CLL.","Our combined late stage oncology franchise will represent a significant source of growth for AbbVie in the coming years with peak year sales estimated to exceed $15 billion. ","Our virology franchise will also be a growth driver for AbbVie going forward. With the launch of Viekira we've established a meaningful position in HCV, another large and growing category. Our global launch of Viekira which is been underway roughly three months continues to perform within our expectations. As a reminder the tracking services do not capture all the sources of prescription data for Viekira, including certain managed care organizations and number of government entities. ","When all sources are considered Viekira weekly prescriptions are tracking well ahead of reported levels. Our international launch is progressing faster than anticipated. And discussions with government payers in various countries are on the way and advancing rapidly. We are pleased with the pace of our progress internationally which is tracking ahead of our planning assumptions, this will lead to a higher level of international sales this year than we originally expected. Viekira will be a significant product for us and we continue to expect an annualized run rate of more than $3 billion in global sales by the end of 2015.","Our current position will serve as a strong base from which we will launch further enhancements and innovations. Our next generation HCV program continues to progress well. It is our goal with this program to bring to market our ribavirin 3 once daily pan-genotypic combinations. Our next generation HCV program is generating promising early SVR data. Earlier this month we disclosed preliminary results from a 79 patient Phase 2b study of our next protease inhibitor ABT\u2010493 and our next generation NS5A inhibitor ABT-530.","The interim data showed that treatment with the two compounds in non-cirrhotic genotype 1a and 1b patients receiving the ribavirin-free therapy for 12 weeks, resulted in SVR4 range of 99%. Full data from the Phase 2 studies will be presented at future medical meetings. Evaluation and another genotypes continues to progress with encouraging results. But also evaluating shorter durations of therapy with this combination the data expected later this year and we remain on track to advance our next generation HCV program into Phase 3 later this year with commercialization expected in 2017.","The HCV market is significant and we expect it will remain a large and attractive opportunity for many years to come. Our immunology franchise represents another compelling growth platform for AbbVie, clearly we have established a strong leadership position in the immunology market with HUMIRA, the world\u2019s leading anti-TNF.","Behind HUMIRA, we have a rich pipeline of mid and late stage immunology assets in clinical development. This includes our two selective JAK-1 inhibitors currently in mid-stage development. As I mentioned our partner Galapagos recently announced promising top-line 12-week data from the first of two Phase 2b studies in RA supporting our thesis for JAK-1 specificity and drive high levels of efficacy while maintaining an appropriate safety profile. We look forward to seeing additional data from the ongoing trials as well as results from a mid-stage study of our internal JAK-1 inhibitor ABT-494 as the year progresses.","We\u2019re also working to advance several other mid-stage immunology programs including ABT-122, our anti-IL-17 TNF combination and an anti-IL-6 nanobody among others. All of our R&D efforts are focused on advancing the standard of care in each of our areas of immunology leadership.","As we have said, we expect HUMIRA to continue to drive strong growth and significant cash flow generation for many years. We have a multi-faceted strategy in place which we believe will allow us to protect and grow our immunology position. We had two new indications in late stage development, as well as a new formulation currently under regulatory review in U.S. and in Europe. We have a robust portfolio of intellectual property protecting HUMIRA which we intent to enforce if infringe by a bio-similar applicant. We have hundreds of patents globally covering the formulation, manufacturing and indications for which HUMIRA is approved. As a first fully human monoclonal antibody approved, the extensive clinical trial work, development and investment we undertook led us to many important inventions with HUMIRA. We have important intellectual property covering these innovations and we intend to enforce this intellectual property.","And we recently received a commission decision in Europe regarding compliance with the pediatric investigation plan for HUMIRA. With this decision, we\u2019ll now apply for a six-month extension through our composition of matter patent extending the date for this key European patent from April 2018 to October 2018. Beyond the pipeline assets I\u2019ve already mentioned, we have a number of other compelling pipeline programs that have potential to deliver significant peak year sales. All told we have more than 40 active development programs underway, spanning large and growing specialty categories. And our late stage pipeline has been significantly de-risked as a result of our ongoing clinical work are demonstrating safety and efficacy. This includes Zinbryta which as I mentioned is currently under U.S. and EMA regulatory review for relapsing, remitting multiple sclerosis.","Elagolix, which is our compound in Phase 3 development for endometriosis and Phase 2b for uterine fibroids. Atrasentan, our internally discovered compound in late stage development for diabetic kidney disease and a number of other attractive assets in mid to late stage clinical trials. We have a number of attractive growth platforms which set within the context of a company that consistently generate strong financial results and consistently meets financial commitments. We believe AbbVie has a unique investment identity, as we are promising pipeline prospects along a strong growth and compelling shareholder returns.","Our business generates significant cash flow which we expect will grow in 2015 and beyond with new product introductions. To that end earlier this year, we increased our quarterly dividend to $0.51 beginning with the dividend payable May.","This increase follows an increase of nearly 17% late last year, since our inception as an independent company in 2013 we\u2019ve increased the dividend nearly 28%. We intend to maintain our strong commitment to a growing dividend going forward. Additionally, we\u2019ve utilized our strong cash flow to enhance our pipeline through licensing and partnering activities. We view these activities as an important component of our R&D strategy and we expect to continue to augment our pipeline from the coming years.","And finally, operating margin expansion is a key priority for AbbVie. We have initiatives in place to improve efficiency across our operations and we've delivered significant improvements in our operating margin profile since we launched in January 2013 to the current level today of just over 40%. We\u2019re forecasting additional improvements in operating margin profile in 2015 reflecting these efforts as well as favorable leverage across our income statement, and we remain committed to improving this metric across our long range plan.","In closing since AbbVie became an independent company we've been focused on executing our key strategic priorities. We've established a strong track record consistently exceeding our financial commitments, generating strong shareholders returns and driving leading performance of HUMIRA and other products in our portfolio. We have also built a promising late stage pipeline which will fuel our future growth and we gained regulatory approval on several important products and advanced many more.","We set a strong foundation for the company. The addition of Pharmacyclics significantly strengthens our long-term growth prospects, positioning AbbVie for top tier growth through the rest of the decade and beyond.","With that I will turn the call over to Bill for some additional comments on the first quarter performance as well as our second quarter outlook. Bill?","Bill Chase","Thank Rick. This morning I will review our first quarter performance and provide an update on our outlook for the remainder of 2015. As Rick said we\u2019re very pleased with the strong quarter we delivered. Reported sales were up 10.5% despite a challenging foreign exchange environment. Operational growth on the top line was a very strong 17.8%. HUMIRA delivered global sales of more than $3.1 billion up 26% on an operational basis. We continue to see strong momentum from HUMIRA with robust growth across categories driving all-time high market share for the brand.","U.S. HUMIRA sales increased 39.6% driven primarily by prescription volume increases in excess of 20% and favorable pricing impacts. Wholesale inventory remain constant at fourth quarter 2014 level of less than half a month. International HUMIRA sales grew 14.8% on an operational basis excluding a 14.6% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. As occurs periodically the first quarter was favorably impacted by the timing of shipments in select markets.","For the full year 2015 we continue to expect global HUMIRA sales growth in the mid-teens on an operational basis. International sales of Synagis were $335 million in the quarter up 8% on an operational basis. Synagis which protects at risk infants from severe respiratory disease is a seasonal product with the majority of sales in the first quarters and fourth quarters. We continue to expect 2015 Synagis sales growth to be similar to 2014 performance. Global VIEKIRA sales in the first quarter were $231 million. In the U.S. many of our contracts have start dates in the April and May timeframe and we expect those to begin to ramp in the second quarter and third quarters and build for the remainder of the year. Our commercial efforts are focused on driving strong penetration in the AbbVie exclusive accounts. We've been successful in this regard with our largest contract which is been in place since the beginning of the year.","Internationally we've been able to secure reimbursement in many markets faster than we had originally anticipated. As a result as Rick indicated we expect a higher mix of international sales this year than originally forecasted. Globally we continue to expect an annualized run rate of more than $3 billion in sales by the end of 2015. Global Lupron sales were $192 million in the quarter up 3.8% on an operational basis. For the full year 2015 we expect Lupron sales to be roughly in line with 2014 sales.","U.S. sales of Synthroid were $186 million up 18.8% versus the prior year quarter. For the full year 2015 we expect Synthroid sales to be roughly flat from 2014 level in line with market trends. AndroGel sales were $153 million down significantly due to continued market declines in the entry of generic competition for the 1% formulation. As we said previously we expect AndroGel sales of less than $500 million for the full year 2015.","U.S. Creon sales were $127 million in the quarter up 18.8%. We continue to capture the vast majority of new prescription starts in the pancreatic enzyme market, and we expect double-digit sales growth for Creon in 2015.","Sales of Duodopa our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease grew 19.5% on an operational basis in the quarter. We expect continued double-digit growth for Duodopa with a modest level of U.S. sales in 2015. Our U.S. launch will be getting underway in the second quarter and third quarters and as we said previously we anticipate a gradual ramp for product sales in the U.S. this year as physicians grow familiar with the product.","The foreign exchange environment has clearly been challenging for our industry over the last few quarters and like our peers we saw a negative impact on our top-line in the quarter as a result. While we are not completely immune from currency swings, our global business structure and hedging actions we\u2019ve taken will allow us to deliver our bottom-line commitments despite foreign exchange headwinds and protect shareholders from the negative impact.","As a result of this mitigation, we will see a favorable effect on our margin profile. We showed continued improvement in gross margin as a percentage of sales in the first quarter. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 82.9%, up 450 basis points from the prior year quarter driven by the effects of exchange, product mix and operational efficiencies. Adjusted R&D was 16.1% of sales, reflecting funding actions in support of our mid and late stage pipeline assets. Adjusted SG&A was 26.7% of sales in the first quarter, down from the prior year contributing to continued improvement in operating margin leverage.","The adjusted operating margin in the first quarter was 40.1% of sales, up 620 basis points to prior year quarter. The majority of this improvement was driven by product mix and efficiencies. We are on track to deliver an operating margin profile in excess of 40% in 2015. Adjusted net interest expense was $67 million and the adjusted tax rate was 22.3% in the quarter. First quarter adjusted earnings per share excluding non-cash amortization expense in specified items were $0.94, up 32.4% year-over-year and exceeding our previous guidance range. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share were $0.63.","As Rick communicated, this morning we increased our adjusted earnings per share guidance range for 2015 by $0.05. Our adjusted EPS guidance range is now $4.10 to $4.30. This range reflects EPS growth of 23% to nearly 30%. The increase in guidance is reflective of the strong underlying performance of the business that we see playing out this year. And we have raised our outlook despite the increasingly negative impact from foreign exchange.","We are now forecasting roughly 7% negative top-line impact from currency this year which we have covered in our guidance increase. Our 2015 adjusted guidance range includes the previous communicated $0.20 dilutive impact of the Pharmacyclics acquisition. It excludes $0.53 of amortization in specified costs including Pharmacyclics transaction costs booked in the first quarter. We plan to communicate specific profile guidance for the combined company as well as 2015 accounting impacts of the transaction on our second quarter call in July.","Regarding the second quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $1.04 to $1.06. This excludes roughly $0.09 of specified items and non-cash amortization and includes the modest amount of Pharmacyclics dilution based on a partial quarter impact.","So in conclusion, we are very pleased with our out-performance in the first quarter and its impact on our full year projection. We\u2019ve driven strong top and bottom-line growth and delivered operating margin expansion, while also advancing on our strategic priorities. This puts us in a strong position to deliver industry leading growth this year.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Larry.","Larry Peepo","Thanks, Bill. We\u2019ll now open the call for questions. Evan, we\u2019ll take our first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is from Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI.","Mark Schoenebaum","Congratulations on fantastic P&L management this quarter. Rick I heard during your opening comments you talked a little bit about your long range plan kind of qualitatively about operating margin improvement as part of your long range plan. What I'd like to know perhaps is can you -- are you willing or can you yet quantify where you see operating margins going over the medium to long-term? And if you can\u2019t do that today, well it should be understandable view that plans to maybe said on analyst meeting or some other venue at which you might communicate a long range plan with investors?","And then also can you comment on whether or not your assumption for operating margin improvement over the medium to long-term is or is not dependent on revenue, in other words can you commit to your investor base that AbbVie can and will expand its operating margin even if the top-line were to come in below your internal expectations and obviously there the focus will be the HUMIRA bio similar erosion curve?","Rick Gonzalez","This is Rick. I think probably the best way to answer your question is to maybe talk for a few moments about the philosophy by which we manage the business and how we think about investment, and how we think about revenue, and ultimately how we try to deal with changes in those dynamics. So let me share by saying, I am sure you understand that our business strategy is really designed to maximize both short and long-term profitability to business. Getting sure the strong returns and strong value over that long period of time, that philosophy really plays out in how we look at investment decisions, whether we\u2019re increasing investment or decreasing investment.","And what I\u2019d say is this management team at AbbVie, they came out of Abbott has always been disciplined in our approach to resourcing opportunities as well as overall P&L management. We managed the business with the objective of driving robust growth in both revenue and EPS but at the same time improving operational efficiencies and I think you have seen some of that and I will talk more about that in a moment.","In cost, in order to maximize shareholder returns but again short-term and long-term. And the examples I will give you is this. Just take a look at what we you have seen play out since we launched a new company. For example our gross margin profiles improved from 76.2% in the first quarter of 2014 to 82.9% this quarter. Additionally if you look at despite building the infrastructure that was necessary to be an independent public company operating margin profile was improved from 33.7% in first quarter of 2014 to 40.1% in the most current quarter.","So we've delivered significant improvement in both of those metrics and we\u2019re committed to continue to do that. And importantly we delivered six points of operating margin profile improvement in the last four quarters. The other thing I would say is we've seen a number of comparisons to various peers group as it relates to AbbVie. And I think it's important to recognize that no two companies are identical when it comes to product mix, geographic coverage, the size of the market that they operate in, the brands responsiveness to investment and many other factors. And I realized it is tempting to do these macro comparisons and I would even agree to some extent that is instructive at some level. But I'll also tell you there are limitations and flaws in doing it.","I can tell you that we benchmark and compare ourselves to many companies and we believe that we compare favorably to most of our peers and we will give you a couple of examples here. When you compare AbbVie to the other large cap pharma peers, Bristol, Lilly, Merck, Pfizer, what you would see is the following. Our gross margin profile is on average approximately six points higher. Our R&D profile on average is five points lower. Our SG&A profile on average is three points lower. And our operating margin profile is about 13 points higher. Our geographic footprint is similar to many of those peers but our product mix is different. They have more primary care.","And when you compare AbbVie to the pure biotech peers specifically Amgen, Biogen, Celgene, what you see is that our gross margin profile is on average six points lower and as due to differences in the product mix. Our R&D profile is approximately four points lower. Our SG&S profile is approximately five points higher and that\u2019s driven by geographic distribution of our revenues especially the percentage of revenues that come from international sales as you probably know is about 45% for us and many biotech companies have 70% of their revenues coming from the U.S.","And there are other anomalies that you have to be careful, such as some biotech companies have a definition adjusted SG&A that excludes the impact of equity-based compensation which we include and there are other accounting differences as well. So finally when you compare to this group and you look at our operating margin profile it's approximately seven points lower as it exists today. But the conclusion of assuming that that\u2019s related to investments spending is not accurate. In fact I would tell you it's misleading. If you look at our total investments spending R&D and SG&A our investment spending on a profile basis is slightly below those peer companies. The entire difference is in the gross margin profile because of the product mix. And we've shown significant improvement there with more to come we\u2019re committed to deliver more but that\u2019s the fundamental difference between those peers groups.","And again as we look at this data it is instructive and on balance I would tell you that based on the geographic footprint that we have it's larger than any biotech companies, the product mix and investment in R&D and SG&A the analysis shows us that we\u2019re favorable to both of those peer groups. But in the end what really matters is what investment decisions do you make in the business and what\u2019s the return that you ultimately get from. So you maximize the short-term and long-term value for the shareholder, and our philosophy is we invest in businesses and the brands to maximize that value, meaning we increase investment when we can drive a strong return and we reduce investment when we can't or a product gets to the end of its lifecycle. And I would tell you that I believe we do both very well. And we give you an example of each.","If you think about the last two years, we've protected shareholder profitability for the last two years as our $2.5 billion Lupron franchise went generic. We did it by drastically reducing costs in that brand and other parts of the business. We\u2019re doing the same thing right now on AndroGel, it's the obvious decision for us. I would just tell you it's the culture that we have here.","Now let\u2019s take the opposite example of that, HUMIRA. HUMIRA is a complex business model. HUMIRA sales and profit contributions come from a broad geographic footprint with about 40% of its sales coming from outside the United States. HUMIRA has an unparallel breath of indications and we use the unique selling model for HUMIRA. We utilize specialized and dedicated sales organizations for all major indications. We manage and invest in HUMIRA to maximize in short-term and its long-term value to the company and to our shareholders.","And I think it\u2019s pretty hard to argue with our success when we took the company public a little over two years ago, HUMIRA was $9 billion product. Today in 2015 HUMIRA is a $14 billion product, $5 billion of growth in 2.5 years despite the foreign exchange headwinds, the brand\u2019s 55% larger. If you take Enbrel and Remicade together over that same period of time HUMIRA grew almost twice as much. So we think the performance speaks for itself. And I can tell you that based on the performance the strong potential for future continued growth, accelerating strip trends in the U.S. and strong international growth cutting HUMIRA, spending today is not a prudent long-term strategy for us.","And finally, I\u2019d make two last points, we\u2019ve been very clear that we\u2019re committed to driving strong continued improvement in operating margin profile, you saw that this quarter and we\u2019re going to drive further improvements in 2015 and across the long range plan. Our goal is to drive strong growth and operate as efficiently as we possibly can to maximize profitability.","We\u2019re not going to make a prediction right now because we just made a significant acquisition and we need to start to integrate that acquisition and we will be in a position to be able to communicate things after that. Second, I get to the final part of your question because I think what you're really trying to ask me is if there was some unforeseen surprise around HUMIRA how we would react to that?","So let me begin by saying the following; we do not in any way expect that type of event to happen. In fact I yell you quite the contrary. We anticipate HUMIRA will be a growth driver for us for many years and our investment and new indications like HS and Uveitis speak volumes for our confidence. However to answer your questions, it's a bare scenario played out and threaten to materially impact the profit contributions of HUMIRA we would apply our investment philosophy in an appropriate manner.","We will take prompt and appropriate action to reduce our expense base accordingly with an eye to minimize the impact for the investors. To us as I said before, that\u2019s the obvious strategy, it's part of our responsibility to shareholders as management. As a new company, we have met or exceeded expectations in every quarter of our existence including this quarter. We take our responsibility to deliver on our commitments and our performance to shareholders very seriously. If we saw any unforeseen event impact the business, we'd aggressively pursue actions to preserve profitability.","As part of the culture and the commitment that we have and in fact I tell you we\u2019re doing that right now. We\u2019re protecting shareholders against significant foreign exchange impact and so that\u2019s the philosophy we run the business and hopefully that answers the question that you asked.","Mark Schoenebaum","I really appreciate it Rick. Look forward to more communication after PCYC closes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin","And I don\u2019t want to be the dead horse obviously there has been a lot of focus on operating margins, but Rick or Bill maybe just comment on our math here. I mean clearly we see the improvements in gross margins and much about will come from royalties going away on HUMIRA as R&D seems to be in line with other large biotech peers that SG&A seems to be where things appear to be a bit out of kilter. If I do a bottoms-up analysis on HUMIRA it would seem that it will be difficult to spend more than 1 billion maybe a 1.5 billion if you really stretch it, so that leads about 4 billion to 4.5 billion for the rest of the portfolio and when I look at the rest of the portfolio, I mean Synagis, Lupron, Synthroid these are drugs that I don\u2019t think require active promotion and I can\u2019t imagine requires the multi-billion dollars and expenses.","Obviously there is other stuff thrown in there, but when I sort of bring it all back to really start it out here, it seems that there is about $2 billion in excess spending. Can you comment on this? And is there anything structural that would prevent you from eliminating that without really touching taking HUMIRA spend? And just maybe another way to go about this is that is there anything structural that would impede you from achieving large cap biotech operating margins which in the next couple of years are forecasted to be in the low 50% range?","Rick Gonzalez","Well, first Jami I disagree with your analysis on the investment expense, because if they take your own report and I had to gather the SG&A and the R&D spend for those three companies that I mentioned were slightly below total investment, when you include SG&A and R&D. So it's a question of how you distribute your investments, I would say the second thing is in any cases, we have a broader portfolio of products and broader geographic spread of our products within some of those companies still.","Is there anything structural? No, there is nothing structural, I mean obviously we have a geographic footprint it's much larger than many of those other company companies. We believe that\u2019s a competitive advantage. As far as HUMIRA spending is concerned, we obviously do bottoms up budgeting every single year, we justify what we\u2019re going to spend, I would tell you that the selling model that we have is somewhat unique in the industry, but it also tell you that the performance that it's delivering is unique as well.","And products don\u2019t sell themselves and so at the end of the day we believe we\u2019re getting a good return out of the investment that we\u2019re making. And we\u2019re balancing our ability to be able to perform in best long-term as well as short-term significant return, and we may increase all the time. I would also say that when you look at some of those brands the broad conclusion that they don't require promotion is not an accurate conclusion. Lupron has promotional activities associated as an example with it.","And so generally speaking what I would say is that there is nothing structural that would cause us not to be able to make significant changes. And as I mentioned in my comments to Mark if we were in a situation where ultimately that was something that we believe it was in the best long-term interest of shareholders then we will make that change. But we\u2019re certainly not in that position now. If you look at our performance this quarter we\u2019re growing rapidly, we expect to continue to grow. We have a number of pipelined drugs, as we believe will be approved over the course of the next two years we\u2019re certainly going to put ourselves in a position to be able to launch those drugs and be effective and we\u2019re going to balance the investment we\u2019re making in other areas against that investment to try to be as efficient as possible. And we believe that is the appropriate way to run the business. And we don't believe it is appropriate to try to hit some margin target whatever the number is by cutting R&D or productive SG&A. We don't think that is in the long-term interest of the shareholders.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.","Jeff Holford","Three questions. The first is just a very short one, just wanted if you can comment a bit more in terms of the gross margin uplift you've had there. Just give us a bit more breakdown in terms of what was mix, what was efficiency and what was FX? Second I wonder if you could maybe comment around there are quite a few experts speaking about patents on HUMIRA, really focusing on dosing and formulation and specifically potential weakness is there. Would you say that that\u2019s the key area of the IP portfolio to focus on? Or are there potentially other stronger areas that are being discussed? And then lastly also on IP, I wonder if you can talk to any of the IP that have in the areas of Alzheimer's, it is antibody, and just tell us a little bit more around that?","Bill Chase","So Jeff its Bill Chase I'll start with your gross margin question. I am actually going to expand it to operating margin as well, because exchange impact those profile metrics differently. So on the gross margin basis exchange made up a little bit over half of the improvement in the quarter, the remainder was product mix and efficiency. And I would say you can split those remainder two-thirds, one-third. On the operating margin line where exchange has less an effect, what we saw was about a one-third impact of exchange and the rest being leverage on the P&L product mix and efficiencies.","Laura Schumacher ","This is Laura, I'll take the question on IP. As we said before we've a robust portfolio of IP that covers a wide variety of patents including manufacturing patients, formulation patents, process patents and patents that cover virtually every indication for which HUMIRA is currently approved. We think these patents have a very broad applicability to any bio-similar application and the earliest of these patents expires in 2022.","When thinking about these patents it's important to note that HUMIRA was the first fully human monoclonal antibody as such little was known about how to use fully human monoclonal antibodies, and the work that we did in the area was foundational.","Collectively we think these patents were the subject of extensive prosecution in the patent and trademark office over nearly a decade and we think given the innovative nature of our work and the rigorous prosecution that the patents are strong and will withstand challenge.","Rick Gonzalez","Who wants to talk about the Alzheimer's IP?","Mike Severino","With respect to IP, this is Mike Severino. With respect IP in Alzheimer's disease, we\u2019re active from a research perspective in a wide range variance and we\u2019re active in Neuroscience as well and that work generates IP it's done so in the past and we will continue to do so in the future. So I think you will see us continue to pursue research activities in this area over time.","Rick Gonzalez","Yes, we just haven't provided a lot of detail there yet Jeff. ","Operator","Our next question is from Marc Goodman from UBS.","Marc Goodman","On the VIEKIRA overseas can you give us a sense of what countries the growth came from? And what new countries are coming on, so we can get a sense of just the geographical mix there? And then you mentioned at your -- can you just give us an update on that product we haven't talked about that in a long. Where is it? When do we get to see data? And then third questions is why are there still such significant separation cost that you are excluding from the numbers given that we\u2019re couple of years out from the separation form Abbott. ","Rick Gonzalez","This is Rick. I will talk a little bit about the international roll-out. Obviously we've launched in a number of European countries and in a number of other select countries outside of Europe, Germany is a good example of one that has gotten significant uptake. But you will see Italy coming online, Spain has come online and a number of other ones have come on line. So it's the major European countries that you would expect to be the greatest value. And then assume -- we\u2019re assuming Japan we will see in the fourth quarter as well.","Mike Severino","This is Mike Severino. With respect to offsetting status that\u2019s our molecule that's been studied in diabetic neuropathy that is progressing well, it's in the Phase 3 study, that\u2019s an outcome study and it's invent driven. So it's hard to make exact predictions about when it will read out, but I think those data will continue to mature over the next few years and so I think you can expect to hear more from it in that timeframe.","Rick Gonzalez","I think it is fair to say that because it's an outcome driven trial this trial will take a significant period of time to hit the number of events based on the endpoint that we\u2019ve assumed.","Mike Severino","That\u2019s correct.","Rick Gonzalez","Several years.","Mike Severino","And then Mark on separation expenses, when we separated from Abbott, we operated under a number of transition service agreements. It generally had a two to three year timeline. The majority of those were off with the exception of two large ones and that has to do with the rollout of the existing back office in Abbott and how quickly we could create a new back office and we\u2019ve made great progress on that rolling out a very efficient shared outsource model, but we\u2019re not completely done with that, we\u2019ll be done at midpoint of this year. The other major initiative as you can imagine is just entangling the IT environment and infrastructure in general is extremely complex and that will be done by the third quarter and those are the majority of the costs you're still seeing coming through.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Arfaei from BMO.","Alex Arfaei","Rick or Laura, the intellectual property, the HUMIRA intellectual property that you referred to, will that protect you against biosimilars manufactured outside the U.S.? In other words are there ways for biosimilar companies to circumvent those patents with ex-U.S. manufacturing? And second question on HUMIRA, the U.S. growth is truly impressive, you mentioned I think old time take market-share could you put some numbers around those market-shares in major indications?","And then finally on Hep C why did you exclude cirrhotic in your Phase 2 and will you how cirrhotic data that is this year?","Laura Schumacher","I\u2019ll take the IP question first, with respect to the IP the patents that I am talking about broadly are global patents. So we have global patents covering manufacturing and process. The specific indication patents that I referenced are U.S. patents. We have patents pending outside the U.S. right now. Those patents have not issued yet, but we think the portfolio we have is very broad and we think that we will have some protection outside the United States as far as -- certainly right now manufacturing process and formulations.","Rick Gonzalez","In terms of market-share Alex, let me give you just a quick snapshot, rheumatology we\u2019ve got about a roughly 25% share right now and dermatology it's approaching a 40% share and in the gastro space it's kind of around 45% market share for us, so very strong market share.","Mike Severino","So this is Mike Severino, with respect to our next generation HCV program, I think you're referring to comments we made about a 99% SVR4 response rate in genotype 1 non-cirrhotic patients. Those are simply the first data that we have available. We have not excluded cirrhotic patients on our Phase 2 program. You\u2019ll see our Phase 2 program continue to mature a little course of this year and we'll be providing update as appropriate.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse.","Vamil Divan","So just couple more on the Hep C side; one, can you just share your kind of internal sense of the market share breakdown right now, it's obviously a tougher market than usual for us, you kind of see from the outside between Merck and Gilead any color there in terms of the breakdown would be helpful.","And then in terms of the next gen we\u2019re seeing some good day over here at ESOL from competitors. How do you think about duration there, does there need to be any regimen? Are you looking maybe then potentially shorter than that? How do you think about they are giving what the competitors are showing over here?","Rick Gonzalez","This is Rick, I\u2019ll cover the market-share piece. So we\u2019re obviously still pretty early on in the launch with three, four months into the launch and maybe the easiest way to characterize it is this, if you actually look I am going to give you a slightly different number than we\u2019ve given you in the past because it will relate better to the overall market-share. So if you look at what we have under contract now and preferred or exclusive contracts total in other words there is still a percentage of covered lives that have not contracted yet and that percentage actually has stayed pretty constant for the last 30 or 45 days. So that\u2019s why I am going to give you a total market-share.","You say that we have about 21% of the market that\u2019s under contract as a preferred, well we have preferred agent within those accounts. The vast majority of those have come online roughly in the March timeframe and there actually spread for March, April, May, obviously ESI came on early on and we\u2019ve now demonstrated within the exclusives that we\u2019ve been in for 90 days that we\u2019re able to achieve high share. But ultimately we will deliver the overall share in the U.S. market will be ramping up in these other preferred or exclusive accounts and we\u2019re not going to be able to see that data probably for another 90 days or so as they come online and we ramp.","So, I think the best way I need the best way to think about the U.S. just qualitatively would be that you will see this essentially this lighter ramp in the first half of the year for the U.S. and a faster ramp in the second half of the year. Then the parody accounts obviously we've had a number of those under contract and we\u2019re ramping there, they are not ramping as high as the exclusive accounts did. And so the blended share will be determined it's really too early I think to give you a prediction yet, but within 90 days or so I think we will be in a better position to be able to predict that. But it will be a blended share between what we\u2019re able to drive in these preferred accounts, a level we get in parody accounts and then obviously in the areas where our volumes are indicated, we\u2019re getting some share out of their exclusive accounts and it will be the blend of all of those.","But now I would say you should be thinking about it in the teens right now, on a low end of the teens but should ramp from there.","Mike Severino","This is Mike Severino. With respect to data coming out of ESOL and short course therapy in the future for Hep C. I think it's still a bit early to say where various regiments around the industry are going to sort out with respect to treatment duration. We've seen hints that six weeks maybe possible but those have sort of come and gone in the past and I think we\u2019re going to need more data to know where treatment durations will really sort out over the next few years. What we do know is that it's very important to have high response rates to very high cure rates and I don't personally believe that people will be willing to sacrifice a lot on secured rates to say for example two weeks of the treatment duration and that\u2019s certainly the philosophy that we\u2019re taking.","So I think those data will continue to evolve and we'll keep a close eye and with respect to our next generation program we\u2019re going to study eight weeks and we will go where the data take us. We will go as short as we think the data support. Again while maintaining those very high cure rates. So I think when I look at all the data coming out of ESOL I still see our regimen is very, very competitive and I think treatment durations that we\u2019re exploring are going to be appropriate with the landscape that we see out there in three to five years and beyond.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Scala from Cowen.","Steve Scala","I have a few questions. On the January call AbbVie said it would provide more specific guidance on 2015 VIEKIRA sales expectations as the year unfolds. What uncertainties still exists such that a single point full year guidance number is not being provided now? So that\u2019s the first question. Second question is I thought both the ABT-199, 17p deletion and elotuzumab readouts were supposed to be in early 2015. What does it imply that the data is not yet available?","And then lastly what has been the tone and the substance of your conversations with partners J&J, with ibrutinib and Roche with ABT-199 post the news of the Pharmacyclics acquisition. It would seem that there could be some issues and our concerns and I am just wondering if that\u2019s the case.","Rick Gonzalez","This is Rick, I'll take the guidance question. It's specifically two things, it's what I just mentioned a moment ago that many of these exclusive accounts are just now coming on and if we look at our experience in the earlier ones that has taken us about 90 days to get to peak share. And so we need to make sure that we can demonstrate that level of share in those accounts to be able to give you an accurate prediction because obviously that drives a significant part of the share and the volume. And then the second thing is it's this issue that we described before and that is clearly we\u2019re having greater success than we had planned in the international markets. And so the mix is different than what we expected in our original planning process.","And so we need more time to see that rollout and that\u2019s gated based on how you get reimbursement in those countries. So we don't want to give you an inaccurate number and we want to see it play out a little bit longer. But what we do know is we feel confident that we should be able to hit the greater than $3 billion run rate by the end of the year. And we've looked at that carefully and we've really communicated that. When we\u2019re at a point that we feel comfortable we can give you a full year estimate we will provide that to you.","Mike Severino","This is Mike Severino. With respect elotuzumab and ABT-199 specifically the 17p del data. The question if I can paraphrase is, are we on track? And when we can see more data from these programs? We\u2019re on track with both programs. Elotuzumab you will see an update at ASCO so that\u2019s in a very near future. With ABT-199, and 17p del, we\u2019re on track where we\u2019re working with the data recall that this is an open label study so we\u2019re working with the data. And what we see is consistent with our expectations. We'll look for an appropriate venue and timeframe to share details for those data externally. But we continue to have confidence in that molecule and have a view towards the regulatory submission later on this year.","Rick Gonzalez","The partner aspect of it, first let me start with J&J. Obviously Pharmacyclics is an independent company right now and the relationship that they have with J&J is that something we can interfere with or be directly involved and we've had communication with J&J it's been very, very positive, I think we\u2019ve worked with J&J in other aspects relationships that we've very had and our prior experience with Abbott and they are fine company, I think the relationship will work extremely well. I make similar comments about Roche, I think Roche, Genentech we\u2019ve had very good relationships with and we don\u2019t anticipate any challenges and managing our way through this relationship between the two partners.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Robyn Karnauskas from Deutsche Bank.","Robyn Karnauskas","Just two questions I guess for Rick, so first of all I guess are you opposed to an Analyst Day just to help us understand in greater depths your rationale behind the confidence in HUMIRA, how you run your business? And the second question is and I appreciate that your confidence in HUMIRA business, but when you talk about disaster scenario what is that for you, is that a launch of a biosimilar or is that massive share loss? And do you run your business like that is the possibility or do you run your business like we are so confident in HUMIRA that is something we were not really worried about, just trying to understand how you're run your business versus your confidence?","Rick Gonzalez","Two big questions. So the Analyst Day, we had kick around the idea of an Analyst Day, we may do something post closing Pharmacyclics so we -- that was just something we need to plan for and not only we\u2019ll be able to talk about the other aspects of the business that talk about our oncology strategy in more detail. So I would stay tuned on that and we think there a number of things if we could communicate kind of the summer, fall kind of timeframe. I think would be the most appropriate time and now there is a suggested similar suggestion to us about doing an Analyst Day. So that is something we\u2019re considering.","What I would tell you on the HUMIRA situation, it is not the launch of a biosimilar, obviously we had a strategy in place that we believe will allow us to continue to drive strong performance out of HUMIRA a post launch of a biosimilar. But what I would tell you is we obviously have contingency plans that we have in place that we will pull the trigger on. Remember it's going to be not just one single launch, right, because HUMIRA is sold all around the world. So there will be different countries, obviously the U.S. is significant part of that and the major European countries are another significant part of it. But we would be evaluating every single country on an ongoing basis and we would make a determination and I\u2019d say the disaster scenario for us would be that ultimately we were significantly unable to achieve the objective that we built into our long range plan.","Obviously built into the plan expectations, how we would deal with any price erosion that might occur, any share erosion that might occur and then we have a contingency plan that basically will be built around missing that particular set of assumptions, and you wouldn\u2019t pull it all at once, you basically start to titrate if you are missing in a way to be able to offset or mitigate any financial impact versus what you had planned for. And so I think that\u2019s the way to think about it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Schott from JP Morgan.","Chris Schott","First of all just on HUMIRA, was just interested in your perspective and how you're thinking about the biosimilar Remicade launch in Europe this year. I guess what you're expecting there in terms of uptake? And how should we think about this launch as a comp that if a biosimilar HUMIRA was to enter the market in Europe let's say in late 2018, is the Remicade biosimilar ramp something that we should think about as a reasonable comparison there?","Second question was on leverage and business development priorities post PCYC. What is the sense of urgency at this point you add or build upon existing growth verticals with further end market product acquisitions post this deal, is that short of priority or should we think about AbbVie kind of coming back to focusing on some of these earlier stage more R&D focus transaction is going forward?","Rick Gonzalez","So on HUMIRA and the biosimilar launch in -- the Remicade biosimilar launch expanding beyond the countries that has been in now for a couple of years. What it says we\u2019ve been watching these launches carefully in the countries that they have been in for some period of time. If you look at those countries relatively modest share has been achieved by the biosimilar product in most of those countries and its well within the expectations of what we would have assumed. We\u2019re watching the competitive response and learning from how that competitive response works. And I\u2019d say so far that\u2019s been consistent with what we would have expected from a pricing standpoint and a strategy standpoint.","And so within the countries we\u2019re in now, where we\u2019re seeing these launches I can tell you HUMIRA is not impacted. We\u2019re continuing to grow patient share within those countries and so there certainly isn\u2019t any direct impact on HUMIRA within those countries what where we see it today. Is it a good metric in order to measure what we could expect with HUMIRA? I think that\u2019s probably a little bit difficult to judge because again it all bodes boils to your position in the marketplace and I\u2019d also say that the European market and international markets are different than the U.S. market for a number of different reasons.","And so if you were to assume that a HUMIRA biosimilar would be in the U.S. prior to the international markets then I would say it's not a good surrogate at all to look at because I think U.S. will be a very different kind of competitive situation.","And I think even in the European markets each product is positioned a little bit differently within the market and it bodes down to how to stay competitive response handle the launch of that product. So that one is a little tougher for me to answer. But I would say for right now it's tracking the way we would expected it to be. On the BD priorities post deal, if I understand the question correctly, are we looking to go out and find another large growth platform? The answer is no. We've obviously made a significant commitment here with the acquisition of Pharmacyclics and it positions us well in this sector. And ultimately it was platform play for us and it's a platform play that we would assume that we needed or wanted going forward.","So now I think you will see us go back to a similar kind of strategy that we had before which is more looking for individual products that we build out. The areas that we had specific therapeutic interest in like immunology, like virology, like oncology and continuing to add on to that potentially some tuck in kinds of acquisitions, smaller acquisitions to add to it, but more of what you've seen from us in the past.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today is from Colin Bristow from Bank of America.","Colin Bristow","Just to piggyback on Vamil's question, we\u2019re seeing a new dates that Merck and Gilead ESOL I was just curious how do you see VIEKIRA PAK competitive position as we move into 2016 given the sentence upon competitive landscape? And there is another one on Hep C, there has been some discussion in the Hep C community that new world realize cure rates for VIEKIRA PAK could be a greater delta to those in clinical trial versus Harvoni given the complex measurement. I would like to get your feedback here based on your experience so far.","And then just one quick one Imbruvica. Your peers recently entered in a partnership with the BTK inhibitor for autoimmune conditions including RA, is it something you planned to perceive with Imbruvica?","Mike Severino","So with respect to ESOL, we continue to feel confident that VIEKIRA PAK will provide competitive efficacy in the timeframe that\u2019s you are describing in the 2065 timeframe and beyond. Recall that cure rates of VIEKIRA are very high and that duration is been well tolerated and we don't see major shifts for example in duration of therapy in the timeframe that you are describing that would change that picture in any meaningful way. Of course over the longer-term we have our own next generation program which I talked about a little bit earlier in this call, which will continue to drive innovation in this space. And so we feel good about our presence in Hep C today. And we'll continue to do so over the years to follow.","With respect real world cure rates with VIEKIRA PAK that doesn't match our experience. And so I really can't comment on that report. Our real world experience is actually a quite good with respect to adherence to the regimen and therefore realizing the cure rates that have been demonstrated in clinical trials. ","With respect to Imbruvica, we're each obtaining inhibition in autoimmune disorders, obviously that\u2019s something that has been a focus of research for a number of companies including ourselves. It's something we'll continue to investigate. I think we will be positioned very well to pursue that aggressively given our extensive experience in immunology and post close given PCYC's experience in BTK inhibition. So it's certainly something that we will keep a close eye on something that we would pursue.","Larry Peepo","And that concludes today's earnings conference call.

Welcome to the AbbVie First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Elizabeth Shea","Good morning and thanks for joining us. Also, on the call with me, today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Severino, Vice Chairman and President; Bill Chase, Executive Vice President of Finance and Administration; and Rob Michael, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that some statements we make today are or may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.","Additional information about the factors that may affect AbbVie's operations is included in our 2018 annual report on Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings.

These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions.","So, with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick.","Rick Gonzalez","Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll discuss our first quarter performance and highlights, as well as our full year guidance, which we are raising this quarter. Mike will then provide an update on recent advancements across our R&D programs and Rob will discuss the quarter in more detail. Following our remarks, we will take your questions.","I'm pleased to report that we're off to an excellent start in 2019, reinforcing our confidence in the long-term fundamentals of our business. We are seeing strong momentum across all aspects of our operations, with excellent growth from our hematological oncology portfolio, continued robust growth from HUMIRA in the US, international biosimilar impacts is trending within our expectations for 2019. And importantly, our late-stage pipeline continues to deliver, with the recent approval of SKYRIZI in major markets globally.","We delivered first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.14, representing growth of more than 14% versus the prior year, and once again exceeding our guidance. Total revenues of more than $7.8 billion were also ahead of expectations for the quarter, with several key products contributing to that growth. We saw excellent performance from our hematological oncology business, with global operational sales growth of more than 43%.","US HUMIRA grew more than 7% versus a last year, driven by continued robust demand. International HUMIRA sales were down 23% on an operational basis, reflecting the impact of direct biosimilar competition in Europe and other international markets. The international biosimilar trends and dynamics have been consistent with our expectations.","We also saw a substantial contributions from several other products in our portfolio, including Mavyret, Creon and Duodopa. We're certainly pleased with our commercial performance and our financial results for the quarter, and we remain well-positioned to deliver double-digit earnings growth once again in 2019. As noted in our earnings release, we are raising our full year 2019 guidance and now expect adjusted earnings between $8.73 and $8.83, reflecting growth of 11% at the midpoint.","In addition to the strong financial results, we have continued to make significant progress, building a pipeline that will allow us to maintain a growing and vibrant business. Since our inception, we've put tremendous effort and resources toward developing new therapies that advance the standard-of-care across a spectrum of important disease states. With special emphasis on doing so in a broad range of immune-mediated diseases, our central focus has been on advancing new medicines that will raise the bar and address important therapeutic needs for patients.","We believe that risankizumab and upadacitinib have achieved the objectives that we set forth. Both of these therapies have demonstrated differentiated clinical profiles versus HUMIRA, as well as other mechanisms on the market or those in development. This profile coupled with our strong commercial execution gives us tremendous confidence that both will be the new standard-of-care in their respective indications.","We recently announced the approval of risankizumab now known as SKYRIZI in the US and Japan for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. These approvals mark a major milestone for AbbVie and further demonstrate our commitment and leadership in immunology. We're certainly pleased with the approved label for SKYRIZI, which reflects its best in category efficacy, favorable benefit risk and quarterly dosing.","As you know, we also have a highly experienced team, including the leading immunology marketing team and sales force, which will support this launch. Given its compelling product profile, we expect to secure rapid and broad formulary coverage for SKYRIZI, with more than 50% commercial access by the end of July, a 90-day access metric not achieved by any other recent launch in the psoriasis category. SKYRIZI represents a significant long-term opportunity for AbbVie, with multi-billion dollar peak sales potential.","We have also been planning and preparing for the forthcoming regulatory approval and commercial launch of upadacitinib, our JAK1-selective inhibitor in rheumatoid arthritis. We've been extremely encouraged by the level of efficacy and benefit risk profile observed across the entire upadacitinib clinical program, including its clear superiority versus HUMIRA, the current gold standard for the treatment of RA. Based on the data generated across our program, we believe upadacitinib will offer meaningful advantage over other products on the market today for those in development and we remain on track for US regulatory decision in the third quarter.","With a robust and differentiated data we produced from our assets and the launch of several new products now under way, we remain confident that the strategy we have in place is working extremely well. We're excited to see the evolution of our pipeline assets from promising late-stage development compounds to successful on-market products. SKYRIZI marks the 12th new product or major indication approval for AbbVie in the last five years, demonstrating the productivity of our R&D investments, which is vital for the long-term success of any innovation-driven biopharmaceutical company like ours.","So, in summary, I'm extremely pleased with the strong execution and pipeline advancement we're seeing, leading to our increase in expectations for 2019. We are off to an exceptional start of the year, followed by several years of market-leading performance and we're well-positioned to continue to deliver top tier financial performance in 2019 and beyond.","With that, I will turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?","Michael Severino","Thank you, Rick. I'll start with immunology, where, as Rick noted, we've made significant progress with both of our late-stage assets. We recently received approval in the US and Japan for SKYRIZI in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and expect an approval decision in Europe very soon. Based on the positive CHMP opinion we received at the end of February. These approvals are supported by a broad clinical development program, where SKYRIZI demonstrated a very start strong profile in Phase 3 studies across more than 2,000 patients.","We are pleased with the SKYRIZI label, which reflects the efficacy and safety profile demonstrated across our program. As we evaluate the available biologic treatment options, we believe SKYRIZI has a best in disease product profile, with differentiated attributes across the categories that physicians and patients the most important, including skin clearance, durability of response and dosing, with a favorable benefit risk profile.","In our Phase 3 studies, SKYRIZI demonstrated very high rates of durable skin clearance, with more than 80% of patients achieving PASI 90 and 60% of patients achieving PASI 100 or complete skin clearance at one year. Importantly, the proportion of SKYRIZI treated patients who achieve these high levels of response increased over time. In fact, the level of complete skin clearance at the one-year mark is the highest reported in a Phase 3 program to our knowledge.","In psoriasis both speed and durability of response are important considerations for an optimal therapy, as loss of efficacy is a key concern for both patients and physicians. Our clinical trials demonstrated clearance after just a single dose of SKYRIZI, as measured by the mean change in PASI score. The average skin clearance following the first dose was 58%, increasing to 91% after two doses and 95% after five doses.","SKYRIZI also provides a best in category dosing profile, with convenient quarterly dosing and flexibility for in-office or at home self-administration. We look forward to bringing this new treatment option to psoriasis patients. We also continue to make good progress with the development programs for SKYRIZI in several other immune-mediated conditions, with late-stage studies ongoing in several follow-on indications. We look forward to providing updates on these programs as the data mature.","Moving now to our other late-stage immunology assets, upadacitinib, where regulatory applications are currently under review for its initial indication rheumatoid arthritis. Our regulatory submissions are based on a comprehensive Phase 3 program. In our program, upadacitinib demonstrated strong results across a wide range of patients, including patients early in the treatment paradigm, who are naive to methotrexate, as well as patients who are heavily pre-treated with biologics. Upadacitinib is the only JAK1-selective inhibitor to meet all primary and secondary endpoints across all registrational trials.","Importantly, upadacitinib demonstrated clear superiority versus HUMIRA across all key measures evaluated in a head-to-head study, as well as clear structural benefit in two Phase 3 studies. Upadacitinib also performed extremely well as monotherapy, which we view as another important differentiator, because although methotrexate is commonly used as a first-line therapy, many patients do not respond to or cannot tolerate methotrexate treatment.","Based on the data generated across our clinical program, we remain confident in the benefit risk profile for upadacitinib and believe that it will offer meaningful advantages over other therapeutic options. We continue to anticipate a regulatory decision in the third quarter and look forward to bringing this new therapy to the market.","Moving now to our hematologic oncology portfolio. In the quarter IMBRUVICA received FDA approval for its 10th indication. For using combination with GAZYVA in front-line CLL. This represents the first approval for a chemotherapy free combination regimen and treatment-naive patients with CLL.","The approval is based on results from the Phase 3 iLLUMINATE study, in which treatment with the combination of IMBRUVICA and GAZYVA demonstrated a significant improvement in the risk of progression or death compared to treatment with Chlorambucil and GAZYVA. iLLUMINATE trial is one of several important Phase 3 studies that have demonstrated treatment with IMBRUVICA alone or in combination significantly prolongs progression-free survival compared to therapies such as FCR, BR and GC and previously untreated CLL patients.","These studies add to the breadth of data supporting IMBRUVICA, providing physicians more evidence of its compelling clinical benefits in the front-line setting. The data from three of these studies have been reflected in the NCCN Treatment Guidelines for front-line CLL, which now position IMBRUVICA as the only preferred regimen in the major segments of this market. We anticipate submitting data from other Phase 3 studies in front-line CLL for label augmentation later this year or early next year.","Moving now to VENCLEXTA, where our supplemental NDA and front-line CLL is currently being reviewed by the FDA under its real-time oncology review program. In conjunction with this submission VENCLEXTA received priority review, as well as a fifth breakthrough therapy designation. If granted, this approval will provide physicians and patients an important new treatment option and substantially expand the addressable population for which is VENCLEXTA is approved in CLL. We anticipate a regulatory decision later this year.","Last month, we disclosed top line data from the Phase 3 Bellini study in patients with relapsed-refractory multiple myeloma. While the study met the primary endpoint of progression-free survival, a higher proportion of deaths was observed in the VENCLEXTA arm compared to the control arm. Based on these data the FDA placed a partial clinical hold on all trials evaluating VENCLEXTA in multiple myeloma.","We're working with the FDA to further analyze these results. But based on the data we have produced today, we continue to believe there is a potential role for VENCLEXTA in the biomarket defined myeloma population. We will provide updates on the multiple myeloma program as they become available.","Moving now to the area of women's health, where we're nearing completion of our pivotal program for Elagolix in uterine fibroids. Our registrational program evaluated nearly 800 women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in two pivotal studies.","The results of the two pivotal studies demonstrated that Elagolix in combination with low-dose hormone add-back therapy significantly reduced heavy menstrual bleeding compared to placebo. Current non-surgical treatments are limited in this area and women suffering from uterine fibroids need more therapeutic options.","The results from these studies represent a significant advancement for women suffering from uterine fibroids and approval in this disease would represent an attractive follow on indication. We remain on track to submit our regulatory application in the middle of this year.","And in neuroscience, we are in the process of initiating a Phase 3 trial to support registration of ABBV 951, our innovative, subcutaneous levodopa\/carbidopa delivery system. Continuous delivery of levodopa\/carbidopa has proven to be very effective in managing motor fluctuations in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. Duopa has helped to establish AbbVie's presence in this market and by providing patients with a less invasive non-surgical delivery option, this next-generation approach has the potential to broaden the treated patient population and help strengthen AbbVie's position in the advanced PD market.","In summary, we're extremely pleased with the productivity of our R&D organization, as we continue to invest in our pipeline to develop innovative medicines and support our long-term growth. We're seeing progress across all stages and in all therapeutic areas of our pipeline. With many important catal -- catalysts expected over the next 12 months to 18 months.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our first quarter performance. Rob?","Rob Michael","Thanks, Mike. As Rick mentioned, we had another quarter of outstanding performance. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.14, up more than 14% compared to prior year and $0.08 above our guidance midpoint. For the first quarter, net revenues were up 0.4% on an operational basis, excluding a 1% -- 1.7% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Strong growth from several key products offset the impact of the first full quarter of international biosimilar competition.","US HUMIRA sales were $3.2 billion, up 7.1% compared to prior year, driven by continued strong demand. Wholesaler inventory levels remained below half a month in the quarter. International HUMIRA sales were $1.2 billion, down 23% operationally, reflecting biosimilar competition across Europe and other international markets, and in line with our expectations.","Hematologic oncology global sales were $1.2 billion, up 43.2% on an operational basis, driven by the continued strong growth of both IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA. IMBRUVICA global net revenues were more than $1 billion, primarily driven by continued uptake in the front-line CLL segment. In CLL, IMBRUVICA remains the market leader across all lines of therapy, with new patient share of more than 25% in the front-line setting. VENCLEXTA revenues were $151 million, driven by continued progress in the broad relapsed refractory CLL segment and our recent launch in first-line AML.","We continue to be pleased with our strong global position in HCV. In the US, HCV revenues were up more than 17%, reflecting higher market share versus the prior year quarter. Our International business has also experienced positive share dynamics. But given patient de-warehousing in select markets during the prior year quarter, International HCV revenue declined approximately 25% on an operational basis, consistent with our expectations. We also saw continued strong operational sales growth for both Duodopa and Creon.","Turning now to the P&L profile for the first quarter. Adjusted gross margin was 83.3% of sales, up 310 basis points compared to the prior year, including a 280-basis-point benefit related to the expiration of HUMIRA royalties. Adjusted R&D investment was 15.3% of sales, supporting our pipeline programs on oncology, immunology and other areas.","Adjusted SG&A was 20% of sales, consistent with our expectations. The adjusted operating margin was 48.1% of sales, an improvement of 400 basis points versus the prior year. Net interest expense was $325 million and the adjusted tax rate was 7.9%.","As mentioned earlier, based on our strong performance year-to-date, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $8.73 to $8.83, reflecting growth of 11% at the midpoint. Excluded from this guidance is $1.47 of known intangible amortization and specified items, as well as a non-cash charge for contingent consideration related to the recent approval of SKYRIZI.","We plan to communicate details about this charge on our second quarter earnings call. This revised guidance continues to contemplate full year revenue growth of approximately 1% on an operational basis. At current rates, we now expect foreign exchange to have approximately 1% unfavorable impact on full year reported sales growth.","As Rick and Mike noted, we're pleased with the recent approval of SKYRIZI. Given the quarterly dosing schedule and our free goods program to bridge patients to commercial access, we expect very modest sales contribution from SKYRIZI in the second quarter. For the full year, our revenue guidance includes approximately $150 million of SKYRIZI sales, which will predominantly occur in the second half of the year. All other full year 2019 forecast assumptions for our key products remain unchanged.","Turning now to the P&L for 2019. We now expect an adjusted gross margin ratio approaching 83% and we now expect adjusted operating margin to be just above 47%, roughly 250 basis points above prior year and inclusive of the required investments for our new product launches. All other full year 2019 guidance assumptions remain unchanged.","As we look ahead to the second quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.20 and $2.22, excluding approximately $0.30 of non-cash amortization and other specified items. As mentioned earlier, this guidance excludes a non-cash charge for contingent consideration related to the approval of SKYRIZI. We anticipate second quarter adjusted revenue above $8.1 billion.","At current rates, we would expect foreign exchange to have an unfavorable impact on reported sales growth of approximately 1.5%. For US HUMIRA, we expect sales growth of approximately 7%. We expect International HUMIRA sales of approximately $1 billion assuming current exchange rates. And for IMBRUVICA we expect global sales approaching $1.1 billion .","Moving now to the P&L for the second quarter. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio comparable to first quarter results. We anticipate higher spending in the second half of the year related to new product launches. And we expect the adjusted tax rate to be in line with our full year guidance, which is just above our 2018 rate.","In summary, AbbVie has once again delivered an excellent quarter, with results well ahead of our expectations. Our strong growth prospects have enabled us to position the business for another year of double-digit earnings growth in 2019, despite Biosimilar dynamics and the required investments to support several major product launches. We are very pleased with AbbVie's strong performance.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.","Elizabeth Shea","Thanks, Rob. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Steve Scala from Cowen.","Stephen Scala","Thank you. I have a few questions. First, raising guidance after the first quarter is clearly a sign of confidence in the outlook. I believe, AbbVie raised after Q1 last year on its way to a great full year performance. How many times in its history has AbbVie raised guidance after the first quarter?","Secondly, on the gross profit margin was quite strong. You mentioned the royalty relief. Were there any other one-time benefits in the quarter? And then, lastly, AbbVie has an exciting late-stage pipeline, but also an expansive early to mid-stage pipeline. Within the early to mid-stage pipeline, what products look most interesting and promising? Thank you.","Rick Gonzalez","Hi, Steve. This is Rick. I'll take the first question. I mean, obviously, we feel good about how the year started, and I said, we've started with a tremendous amount of momentum. Certainly, as we look at the performance of the hematological oncology business and US HUMIRA, and many other products are performing extremely well.","And so, that's certainly driving the level of confidence that we're seeing. As well as, we've now seen a substantial period of time that I think we can measure the impact of biosimilar competition outside the US and feel good about how that is tracking against our expectations.","Specific to your question, we raised guidance three times in the first quarter and we've raised guidance, I think, 13 out of the 25 quarters that we've reported. And certainly we do not raise guidance in the first quarter unless you had a level of confidence that you could deliver that or greater performance across the year. That would just be a foolish position to take.","So in both of the prior years where we raise in first quarter, those ended up being years where we outperformed significantly. So I think it is a good indication of the level of confidence that management has in the business whether it be our business or any other business, I think, it demonstrates a level of confidence, otherwise we wouldn't choose to do that.","And certainly, I am extremely pleased with how we've come out of the blocks in 2019 and I'm pleased with what -- how the pipeline has continued to deliver, and obviously, we'll be launching two major products this year SKYRIZI and ultimately we anticipate being able to launch upadacitinib this year in addition to the products we've already launched recently and are driving a tremendous amount of growth. So I have a lot of confidence in how the business can perform. With that, I will turn it over to Rob to answer your second question.","Rob Michael","Hi, Steve. It's Rob. So we feel very good about our progress in gross margin. We just printed a new high. The lion's share of improvement you're seeing comes from the termination of HUMIRA royalties. We do have efficiencies in foreign exchange helping cover the impact of partnership accounting. But as you can see from our full year guidance, we have a lot -- we feel very good about the progress we've made in gross margin. So I wouldn't anticipate a lot of one-time impacts.","Rick Gonzalez","Mike, why don't you answer that?","Michael Severino","Sure. So, this is Mike. We have obviously invested considerably in our late-stage pipeline. But we've also paid a large amount of attention and invested to make sure that we have broad and promising early to mid-stage pipeline as well. So I'd highlight programs from a couple of areas.","Although, it's a late-stage program, I think, it's one that doesn't get a lot of attention, and so, I think, it's worth mentioning, which is Depatux-M, which used to be known as ABT-414, which is our EGFR targeted ADC in EGFR-amplified glioblastoma multiforme. That has delivered very interesting mid-stage data in the second-line patients with GBM and is in a randomized Phase 3 study with overall survival as a primary endpoint now in front-line GBM. So, I think, that is potentially a very interesting opportunity, because there really is very limited treatment options available for these patients and so that's one that I think we can keep an eye on.","Turning to our early pipeline. I would highlight in oncology. Our work in apoptosis, which is really an extension of what we learned discovering and developing a venetoclax or BCl-2 inhibitor. We have a Phase 2 study ongoing now with the different molecule with the venetoclax, which inhibits both BCL-2 and BCL-XL and that combination inhibition, that pattern of inhibition has potential in myelofibrosis and can specifically address the clone that drives that very serious hematologic disorder. There's really only one pathway currently that treat that disease. The current standard-of-care is Jakafi.","In our Phase 2 study we're looking at patients who failed or didn't respond to Jakafi. We're looking at a pretty resistant population and even early on we're seeing some very interesting responses. And I think there's also real potential that we could address the underlying pathophysiology and therefore be disease-modifying in the bone marrow fibrosis. So that study is accruing by the end of this year, early next year, we will be in a position to make a decision to advance that program into later stage development.","We also have number of other programs that are just a little bit behind that one in apoptosis. Programs like our TRAIL program, which is an apoptosis related program that has promising solid tumors including things like colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer and we're seeing some very interesting responses in good PK-PD relationship in our early studies there. And we have a BC-XL targeted delivery for solid tumors also that add about the same stage of development.","If we shift to immuno-oncology, we've done a lot of work to advance our pipeline there. And one of the most novel programs in that area is program called GARP, which is now ABBV-151. That modulates TGF-beta and T-reg function which is thought to mediate the tumor immunosuppressive environment. So that's a program I think has a lot of solid science behind it is now in the clinic and we have a number of other novel IO programs in the clinic as well.","If we now shift our focus to immunology, a couple of things I would point to our TNF steroid ADC that has promised to deliver very high levels of response to patients, because we know that steroids are highly effective at managing the symptoms of RA and other immunological mediated diseases, but they can be given at high doses for long periods of time. So this program attempts to deliver a novel steroid directly to the immune effector cells in RA without systemic consequences or systemic adverse effects.","What we know from the early studies is we are able to dose this molecule in the range where we would expect to see efficacy without seeing those widespread steroid like effects and we're now moving into a randomized study that will give proof-of-concept and should read out next year. We've invested in other programs in immunology as well, like our CD40 antagonist and our jack BTK combination program. So a lot of data to come there.","Last area I focus on is neuroscience. People are familiar with our TAL antibody, which is in Phase 2, but we've built a broad pipeline behind that and our two neuroinflammation assets that we're developing in partnership with Alector are now in the clinic and so those are some very interesting programs. So there's a lot of data to come over the next 12 months to 18 months.","Stephen Scala","Thank you.","Elizabeth Shea","Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Schott from JP Morgan.","Chris Schott","Great. Thanks very much for the questions. My first one was on SKYRIZI and just how we're thinking about that launch ramp. I guess, historically, we've seen some of the newer psoriasis agents having relatively gradual ramps and then maybe a few years to really gain momentum. I guess, is that fair to think about in this situation or when we think about the higher payer access you cited in the commercial infrastructure you have, should we think about all the different dynamic here?","And your second question, just kind of building on that is, how are you thinking about HUMIRA dynamics in dermatology with this launch and with a range of new agents coming in. I know that business remained fairly healthy, but should we think about the growth slowing at that indication over time?","And maybe the final one was just on business development priorities, just latest thoughts on how you're thinking about business development, and I guess, specifically, how you're prioritizing revenue growth potential versus diversification as you think about potential deals that you'd be looking at? Thanks so much.","Rick Gonzalez","Hi, Chris. This is Rick. I think if you look at SKYRIZI and you look at the ramp and you compare to historical ramps, one of the limiting factors in the historical has been their ability to be able to get market access -- broad based market access in a reasonable period of time and that's always a limiter, no matter what product we're talking about, what specialty product we're talking about, if you don't have access, it makes the launch extremely difficult, but what most companies do is subsidize with free goods for a period of time until they can get access. But no one has gotten access like we're describing here. So, certainly, access should enhance the ramp of SKYRIZI.","Now having said that, it takes a few months even in our case, to get to the level of access that we're talking about. So in the current quarter, you shouldn't expect much in the way of SKYRIZI revenue, because we are going to use free goods extensively during that period of time, but that access should ramp dramatically as we get toward the end of the quarter and moving into the next quarter. And then you should expect that the product will ramp.","As with any new mechanism, it obviously take some time to get physicians familiar with it, but I would expect SKYRIZI to ramp more significantly than what you've seen with historical ramp. So I think that would be a reasonable way to be thinking about it.","As it relates to HUMIRA dynamics. I think if you have to look at the profile of SKYRIZI and think about where it would fit in the treatment paradigm for patients. Here you have an agent that has PASI 90, PASI 100 scores, like we've never seen before and it's an agent that has a good benefit risk profile. So from a safety standpoint, I think, there will be a high level of comfort around it and it's an agent that obviously has significant advantages from a dosing standpoint, where patients will only have to inject themselves once a quarter.","So when you look at all of those dynamics, you have to ask yourself the question, why wouldn't that be a front-line agent and indeed that will be certainly how we will be positioning this agent, it has the profile to be able to deliver against that criteria that would be appropriate for front-line naive patients, and obviously, an agent that will also be used extensively for those patients that are switching from a therapy that ultimately -- they're not getting the level of efficacy that they desire and need.","Now, HUMIRA, obviously, will maintain, there's a large number of well maintained patients on HUMIRA. Obviously you don't switch a patient that is well maintained. It is not just appropriate. And so -- but I would expect that you will start to see HUMIRA slow somewhat in the psoriasis category as SKYRIZI starts to ramp in a very significant way.","The last question is around business development. And what I would say there is, if you look at our business, obviously, our business continues to perform well. We launched a significant number of products over the course of the last several years, you're starting to see that diversification.","In fact, last year, if you look at the -- what drove our growth, it was very balanced growth between IMBRUVICA, HUMIRA, Mavyret and to a lesser extent VENCLEXTA. So you're starting to see that diversity or that diversification play out and obviously we're launching significant number of additional assets, we launched some at the end of the year and then more will launch this year with SKYRIZI and upadacitinib. That will drive over time more diversification.","Having said that, we have a business that generates significant cash flow and our first priority is always using that cash flow to be able to invest back in the business. And so we look at all different kinds of transactions, small ones, medium-sized ones and larger ones.","We look at them all in the backdrop of do they strategically fit in the enhanced long-term performance of the business and are they value at a point which we can get a good return for the investment that we need to make. And when we find those, we obviously act on those and we have the financial wherewithal to do that. So that's how we think about it, and I wouldn't say that's different than how we've historically thought about it, but that is how we look at business development.","Chris Schott","Thank you.","Elizabeth Shea","Thanks, Chris. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Gerberry from Bank of America.","Jason Gerberry","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess just first one on the EU HUMIRA guidance. I think the 2Q guidance was for $1 billion, which is about 40% down. So I was just wondering if you could help square that for us in terms of the 30% erosion for the full year. And then also help us reconcile, I think, Biogen yesterday mentioned that there's about 35% biosimilar share in Europe.","So just trying to put these data points together, it would seem like, perhaps, the erosion profile might be a little bit worse in Europe than you would -- than the last guidance. So if you can provide a little clarity there that would be helpful?","And then, I guess, just second question, just on the ORILISSA launch, can you just give us a little color how this is progressing, it is progressing according to plan, are there some early challenges that there maybe a little greater than initially anticipated, that would be helpful as well? Thanks.","Rick Gonzalez","Okay. Jason, this is Rick. I'll answer those questions for you. First, to the point that you made about the erosion, the erosion that we quoted on the call was 30% against the total international base. I think we said at the time, if you just looked within the segment that we are growing in biosimilar that was around 40% or 44%, something in that range. So it is consistent with that. The guidance is consistent with what we originally talked about, and I'd say that's the guidance that we are absolutely comfortable with as things are playing out.","If you look specifically to the Biogen comment. I think for Biogen said, although, I didn't read the transcript, but others did, is I think what they said was that share was in Germany. And I'd say, it's in the range of that in Germany. I can't remember the specific number that they quoted, remember, Germany has a quota system that they use and that quota is that 40% of the prescriptions written by their doctors, their physicians should be biosimilar products and so they are obviously going to drive to that 40% and they're not -- they're approaching that now. So I don't think that is a big surprise.","If you look more broadly across all of Europe -- all of the areas that are affected by biosimilars in Europe, then the share would be about 16% right now in the first quarter. We would expect that that will rise over the course of the year, which is just how we planned it. We plan two things, rising share and more price erosion as we advance toward the fourth quarter and that is how our forecast is built.","So it's tracking against that forecast well. I think if you look at Biogen and Amgen, I'd say they have been the most aggressive in the market thus far. So Biogen quoted what they were getting up that share in Germany, I have no reason to believe that that wasn't accurate and but that's essentially how the biosimilars are going. So I'd say, I think, now actually we had more experience, we're pretty comfortable with how the biosimilars are sorting themselves out.","On ORILISSA, the ramp is going or the launch is going as we would expect. We have spent quite a bit of time out educating physicians. This is a physician population that hasn't had a new medicine in this area in order they prescribe a lot of these types of medicines in their practice generally. I'd say the receptivity that we're seeing physician -- from physicians is very good, very positive. These feedback we're getting from patients as they start I think is encourage. It would be suggestive of the fact that even into 150-milligram dose patients are seeing rapid relief of pain. So I think that's certainly positive and they like the profile of the drug.","We started the DTC campaign a couple of months ago and that will be an important aspect of this launch. And we said all along, this is a -- this is an area where we're ultimately going to have to build the market. And it's important to remember, these patients are typically younger women, right, and they don't go to their doctor every couple of months. They go to their doctor typically once a year. So engaging them and making them understand that there is a therapy available, and therefore, they should go to their doctor off cycle is an important part of this launch and building this launch.","I would say it's tracking well, compared to what we would have expected. The drug has right now about a $60 million running rate and growing. So it's within the expectations that we had. And long-term, I can tell you, our expectations are still. This will be a very sizable product for us going forward, albeit, it's going to be more of a slower ramp than some other products like HCV where they ramp very rapidly.","Jason Gerberry","Got it. Thank you.","Elizabeth Shea","Thanks, Jason. Operator, we'll take the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Navin Jacob from UBS.","Navin Jacob","Hi. Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe a question for Bill and a question for Rick, if I may. Bill, with the nice increase to your operating margin guidance to 47% for 2019. How confident are you in your 2020 operating margin guidance of 50%, I mean, that -- what's driving that 300 bps of increase?","And then second question for Rick. Obviously, the Pharma Group over the last two weels, three weeks has been under significant pressure, last week lease was associated with Medicare for all concerns, before that IPI and rebate rule. There's a lot of things proposed a lot of things discussed. I guess, Rick, help us understand beyond, obviously, I'm not going to ask you to handicap political outcomes, but beyond the political hurdles, what are some of the practical hurdles associated with broader form such as Medicare for all?","And then with regards to the rebate rule, what are your expectations going into next year, assuming implication -- implementation? How that will affect AbbVie's ability to deal with marketplace, which is fundamentally has been driven with the inflammation marketplace, which has fundamentally been driven by -- a lot by how payors position products? Thanks.","Rick Gonzalez","Okay. Thank you. Rob, why don't you answer the first?","Rob Michael","Hi, Navin. This is Rob. So we're in the process of developing our LRP right now. So I'm not going to give you 2020 guidance. But let me tell you how to think about it. If you think about the 2019 profile, we're up about 250 basis points, despite the investment for new product launches and flattish sales. In 2020, you should see increased P&L leverage as those new products ramp and the overall top-line grows. So that's the way I would model it.","Rick Gonzalez","Yeah. As it relates to the debate that's ongoing about affordability of healthcare and affordability of medicines. It certainly is obvious to everyone that there is a very significant debate that is ongoing here. I think fundamentally comes back to having patients have access to the medicines that they need and making sure that those medicines are priced in a range where they are affordable and they are justified based on the pharmacoeconomics of those particular agents. We should hope it will get to that debate. I think eventually it will get to that debate.","And so as you look at patients ability to be able to access medicines. I think it's important to think about it in the backdrop of where is the challenge in that. I would tell you as an example, and I don't think we're unusual, but we have a very extensive patient assistance program and that program actually allows patients up to 600% of poverty, which I think is around $150,000 a year worth of income for a family of four somewhere thereabouts, that in the event they can't afford their medicines, they can come to us and we obviously will provide the medicine even free of charge and we provide a significant amount of medicine to those patients.","Those programs are available to commercially insured patients, to uninsured patients, and therefore, there shouldn't be a patient that falls into that category. It doesn't have access to an AbbVie medicine regardless of their ability to be able to pay. Now do people fall through the net and they don't realize it. We are looking into that and we may actually do some additional awareness campaigns to make sure patients understand how to be able to access that that program. But I can tell you we have pretty broad coverage of that program, and we monitor how many patients don't qualify because of their income levels and we always constantly look at whether or not we have that set appropriately for patients who can't afford the medicine.","And so we adjust it in time based on the percent of over poverty income to ensure that we're trying to cover the vast majority of those patients. So, you shouldn't have a significant problem with those kinds of patients. Then you look at commercially insured patients, obviously, the industry provides a significant level of co-pay assistance to those patients and so that shouldn't be a challenge.","Where the challenge does exist, because these programs are not available broadly to patients on Medicare Part D, is in Medicare Part D. The non-LIS portion of Medicare Part D has very high out-of-pocket costs for medicines, particularly specialty medicines and to sort of put in perspective for you, a Medicare Part D patient, if you compare their out-of-pocket expense to a commercially insured patient, a patient on Medicaid, a patient who isn't Part D, but part of the LIS program, their out-of-pocket expense for something like HUMIRA is a little over 50 times, five-zero times, what it is compared to those other patient populations, which is a pretty significant burden on those patients.","And so I think, one of the things, we're trying to drive as we go through this process is, I think, it is the industry's responsibility to help step up and try to cover some of that cost and share some of that with the government to be able to make it affordable for those patients, that is just too high a burden on Medicare patients to be able to afford that. And I think that's the area that you have the greatest challenge from an ability to access these kinds of medicines. And so, we are obviously trying to come up with ways that we can suggest or try to participate in the process to help alleviate that challenge and I think we should be willing to come to the table and help drive that.","Now, people say, well, what about the cost associated with that? If you look at the Part D plan and you look at the overall cost, compared to how enrollment has increased over time, I would tell you that the Part D plan has worked extremely well from a competitiveness standpoint, the insurers that negotiate this and the PBMs that negotiated on behalf of the government, drive a pretty hard bargain and you see fairly significant rebating or discounting in this program.","I think one of the challenges and I will get to that here in a minute when we talk about rebate. One of the challenges is it would appear most of that rebate is being put back into the premiums, lowering the premiums and so there is this debate, where should that rebate money go back, should it go back against the actual drug costs or should be built back into the premiums and look that's not a decision that we make and I think that is part of where the rebate challenge comes in.","Now, as it relates to patients, well, certainly, I think, most of us believe that patient shouldn't be paying against the list price of their substantial rebates. And so the rebate rule as its proposed right now, would allow manufacturers like us to discount at the point-of-sale or point of pharmacy to be able to reflect that and then that would be reflected in what the patient pays. I can tell you we are totally supportive of the patient paying off of the rebated price or the discounted price. I think that is absolutely appropriate.","Whether the rebate rule goes through as it is or some modification or doesn't go through at all, look, I can't handicap that. We have analyzed how it would as is currently proposed and as we've said many times, it doesn't affect our business, one way or another, whether it's a rebate or a discount, they are one and the same.","And so, I think, we're comfortable with -- if that were to go through, being able to manage our business in a very similar way to the way we manage our business now. I think one of the challenges with Medicare for all would be you'd have to look pretty carefully at this drug benefit, because you would have patients who if they switched off one of those other programs and went on Medicare, at least the way Medicare Part D works right now. Their co-pay out-of-pocket is going to go up dramatically. And I think that's not something that they would necessarily like. So I think that's a significant challenge.","But I think one way or another we have to attack that and resolve this. This group making sure that they have good access, affordable access to drugs that they need. Now these are drugs that don't get abused. Now at the end of the day, take a drug like HUMIRA. HUMIRA is step edited has prior authorization. The patient has to fail all the lower cost alternatives before they ever get access to a medicine like HUMIRA. So there is not any real risk of abuse in this kind of a category. And so I think that's something else that's important to put in perspective as we have this debate.","Elizabeth Shea","Thanks, Navin. Operator, we'll take the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Josh Schimmer from Evercore ISI.","Joshua Schimmer","Thanks for taking the questions. Just want to clarify some of the points on guidance. On the fourth quarter call, you had indicated ORILISSA would be around $200 million this year. Is it on track for that or might that take a little longer to achieve?","And then just follow-up on your answer to Jason's question about the OUS guidance for HUMIRA this year, sorry, in the second quarter being down 40% year-over-year. You talked about the expected cadence of erosion in Europe. But OUS is still projected to be down 40%. So you can elaborate on the answer and reconciling that with the initial guidance of 30% for global US for the -- ex US for the year? Thank you.","Rick Gonzalez","So on ORILISSA -- Josh, this is Rick. On ORILISSA I would say that we are tracking against that number. So we're not changing our guidance on that number. And obviously, as I said, it has a running rate right now of about $60 million. And so it's ramping significantly from that. And I'd say, based on everything we know today, we're comfortable with that ramp. I'm not 100% sure I understand the question that you asked on the second one. Rob, I mean, you said something about 40% in the second quarter?","Rob Michael","So, Josh, this is Rob. If you look at the guidance and compare that to our total international sales in the prior year that would put you at a 33% operational decline. So I'm not sure how you're getting your 40%.","Bill Chase","And that -- Josh, this is Bill. That would be in the second quarter, as you look at the gating of the impact around biosimilars recognized in Q4, we are going to be comparing against a quarter in the prior year that already had some biosimilars. So you would expect actually that year-over-year impact to be less than what we're seeing in the first three quarters. So it averages out to our overall guidance.","Joshua Schimmer","Okay. Thanks.","Elizabeth Shea","Thanks Josh. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Geoff Meacham from Barclays.","Geoff Meacham","Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for the question. Just had a few. Mike on VENCLEXTA and myeloma the imbalance I'm sure was a surprise, what's the hypothesis at this point. I'm not sure it's clear, what's different about myeloma versus CLR or AML in terms of unique safety tolerability risk and how does this alter your long-term view of the value of the drug?","And then, Rick, had another one on capital allocation. You guys have obviously expressed confidence in the long-term trajectory and without a large transaction. So my question is whether there are triggers that would evolve that strategy, for example, like if the -- if OUS HUMIRA is worse than expected later this year or next or your launches don't have initial objectives, what do you do from there and how much of a priority is the payout in that scenario? Thank you very much.","Michael Severino","Okay. So, this is Mike. I'll take the first one. So with respect to Bellini and the imbalance that we observed in mortality in the overall population. Yes, obviously, that was a surprise to us. That's not something that we would have expected to see. I think it's hard to say with certainty what drove that. But I think comparing and contrasting the situation to CLL is important.","So what we know about CLL is that CLL is BCL-2 driven and you see that in the efficacy results that we've driven across our CLL program from the very early studies in 17p del from the MURANO study and all the work that we've done. If you look at multiple myeloma, there are, from our perspective, really, really two groups. Now I'm speaking from a BCL-2 biology perspective.","There is a subset, which is this subset. So it's a subset, but it's about 20% of multiple myeloma and add it to obviously a significant proportion given that -- we have seen it improved given that myeloma overall is very big. And that subset is very highly BCL-2 driven in its biology.","Then there is the broader population where the hypothesis was a little different. There the hypothesis was primarily synergy with proteasome inhibitors that we've seen mechanistically and that we saw in earlier studies. And so the Bellini result is that overall non-selected group. And so while we can't tell you with certainty today what drove that, what we can tell you is that that behavior is very different than what we've seen in other populations. In the group, it's very BCl-2 driven. The early data that we've seen suggests that we should see a good effect and that's why we continue to expect that the drug has a role in that population.","Now, obviously, we're going to need to take the time to work with the FDA around the issues of the partial clinical hold, but we do believe that in the long-term there will be a role or at least potential for a role in that population. So that's really the difference between multiple myeloma and CLL. So does this change our long-term view of the value of the asset? No it doesn't change our long-term view of the value of the asset. It doesn't change our view of CLL in anyway. And we had always felt that the larger opportunity because the clearer link to the biology for VENCLEXTA in myeloma was in that biomarker driven population.","Rick Gonzalez","Geoff, this is Rick. So on your question, I think, the best way to think about it is this. If you look at 2019 and I think it is a good test. Our ability and our strategies ability to be able to withstand significant LoE. If you think about 2019 roughly just under $5 billion of HUMIRA that's facing LoE and probably something in the neighborhood of about $500 million of AndroGel that's facing LoE.","And you are in the very early stages of the launch of several of our new products like ORILISSA, like SKYRISI and ultimately it will be like upadacitinib. So you're not getting much benefit. In fact if anything you're getting a little downdraft because everyone knows in the first year or so, the pharmaceutical launch of lose money because you have to apply a significant amount of SG&A to it to create the ramp. So you actually have headwinds from a profit performance standpoint.","So -- and you can see based on that, we have a business now that still has positive revenue growth and has EPS growth of 11%, let's call it. And yes, there's some share repurchases in there. But if you adjust that share repurchase out, it's still high single-digit EPS growth. So tremendous EPS growth despite those headwinds that we're facing. And I think that demonstrates the strength of the underlying business and it was really designed to be able to deal with that.","Now having said that, I don't know that those kinds of dynamics are what's going to drive, how we look at opportunities that exist from an acquisition standpoint. What drives that is what I described before. It is always better to have a stronger business than we can't have too strong of the business.","So resets the philosophy that we operate with. And so as we look at different kinds of transactions we evaluate them against their strategic fit. And then, can we get a good return on those assets and if our analysis suggests that we can, then we obviously try to act on those and that's what drives from a capital allocation standpoint where we invest.","And I don't see a dramatic change in the way international biosimilars behave, because obviously, I think, we've seen enough of that now that we have a pretty good idea of how they are behaving. And that would drive -- that would be a trigger event in and of itself. I think what will drive -- what we do is ultimately can we build a stronger business, if we were to acquire an asset, whatever that asset maybe.","Elizabeth Shea","Thanks, Geoff. Operator, we have time for one final question.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today is from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse.","Vamil Divan","Hi. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. So just two on the product side. First for upadacitinib, I think we're about four months from the PDUFA date. Just wondering, I don't know if you -- I apologize, if you mentioned on your prepared remarks. I am wondering, if you have any updated thoughts on the likelihood of the AdCom ahead of decision. And just the impact with other recent safety update on XELJANZ regarding the -- you raised some more questions about thrombosis risk with JAK inhibition and wondering what you -- how you think that might impact the review?","And then second one on SKYRIZI, you mentioned the dosing advantage you guys have with TREMFYA, just looking at the label, there is a little bit higher rate of immunogenicity with the product that with TREMFYA. I think it's about 14% of patients had antibodies that can be classified as neutralizing. So just wondering how you think physicians might think of the trade-off between more convenient dosing, but maybe a little bit more immunogenicity for a chronic condition like psoriasis? Thanks.","Michael Severino","Sure. So, this is Mike. I'll take those. With respect to upadacitinib, we are still in the relatively early stages of our review, but we are several months into it. With respect to the likelihood of an AdCom. What I've said before, is that advisory committees are common for these sorts of applications. So for novel molecular entities and rhemathoid arthritis. So it wouldn't be necessarily surprising, if we had one or concern to us if we had one. But based on what we're hearing today, we do not anticipate one. And so, obviously, as we get closer, we'll be able to provide additional color on that.","With respect to XELJANZ and the safety finding that came out of their large-scale study. I'd say a couple of things. One, we need to see the data presented in full. We need to see how that translates through their label, but I would point a couple of features. One, that was at a dose that was higher than approved in RA for XELJANZ and it was in a very particular patient population, because it was in their cardiovascular safety study.","So these were patients who were selected to be at high risk for cardiovascular disease. So they were a little different than the broader patient population. Our program hasn't demonstrated an increased risk for VTEs for upadacitinib compared to essentially all of the competitors that we had in the trial, which include HUMIRA, includes methotrexate and in our monotherapy studies, for a portion of time, it even includes true placebo. So we feel very good about our data set.","With respect to SKYRIZI. What I would point to is the performance of the product. We have very, very strong performance. We are clearly covering the pathway very effectively and doing that with the favorable benefit risk profile. We have skin clearance that's actually rising over time and very durable out to a year. And so I don't see that as a concern at all for us.","Vamil Divan","Okay. Thanks for taking the question.","Elizabeth Shea","Thanks, Vamil. That concludes today's conference call.

On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions.","So, with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick.","Rick Gonzalez","Thank you, Liz. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. I'll discuss our second quarter performance and highlights as well as our full year guidance which we are raising again this quarter. Mike will then provide an update on recent advancements across our R&D programs and Rob will discuss the quarter in more detail. Following our remarks, we'll take your questions.","AbbVie once again delivered an outstanding quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $2.26, representing growth of 13% versus last year exceeding our guidance. Total revenues of more than $8.2 billion was also ahead of our expectations for the quarter with several key products contributing to that growth.","We saw excellent performance from our hematological oncology business with global operational sales growth of nearly 40%. IMBRUVICA is performing exceptionally well with robust share growth across multiple lines of therapy in CLL including new patient share of approximately 35% in the frontline setting, up approximately 10 share points over the past year. This strong momentum directly relates to the growing body of clinical evidence, label augmentation, and recently updated treatment guidelines which now position IMBRUVICA as the only preferred therapy in the frontline CLL market.","VENCLEXTA also continues to make very good progress in the broad relapsed\/refractory CLL setting and has established a strong growth trajectory in the recently approved indications for first-line CLL and AML.","U.S. HUMIRA grew more than 7.5% versus last year driven by continued strong volume growth across all segments. And despite a very competitive environment, HUMIRA remains the market leader across each of the three primary categories; rheum, derm, and gastro.","During the quarter, we also announced our ninth global settlement agreement resolving all IP-related litigation with BI over their biosimilar HUMIRA. This final settlement agreement reinforces our confidence that we will not see direct biosimilar competition in the U.S. until 2023.","International HUMIRA sales were down 31% on an operational basis, reflecting the impact of direct biosimilar competition in Europe and other international markets. The international biosimilar trends and dynamics remain consistent with our expectations.","And SKYRIZI, our recently approved treatment for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis is performing significantly above our expectations, contributing nearly $50 million in revenue this quarter. The launch is going extremely well. We are seeing strong prescription volume well above recent launch analogs in the psoriasis category.","Through the first 11 weeks of launch, we already have approximately 1,700 prescribing physicians and approximately 3,750 patients have been treated with SKYRIZI including those in our bridge access program. We're extremely encouraged by this uptake which supports our continued confidence in the asset.","Commercial access for SKYRIZI is also tracking in line with our expectations. As a result of the launch progress and the momentum, we are increasing our full year guidance for SKYRIZI and now expect full year global sales of approximately $250 million. The outlook for SKYRIZI remains very strong and it represents a significant long-term opportunity for AbbVie with multibillion-dollar peak sales potential.","We're also very pleased with our overall commercial performance and financial results for the quarter. We remain well-positioned to deliver double-digit earnings growth once again in 2019.","As noted in our earnings release we are raising our full year 2019 EPS guidance and now expect adjusted earnings between $8.82 and $8.92 reflecting growth of 12.1% at the midpoint which is at the very top of the expectations for our peer group.","Clearly, this is an extremely exciting time for AbbVie. Before I turn the call over to Mike and Rob, I want to speak briefly about our proposed acquisition of Allergan and the progress we are making. We've had an opportunity to speak with many investors over the past several weeks since the announcement to share the strategic rationale for the transaction and our outreach with investors will continue as we have a number of opportunities to engage with shareholders in the coming months.","The integration planning is already underway and we are working to ensure a seamless transition on day one. We've identified individuals within AbbVie that will lead the integration process and there will be dedicated teams to ensure there is no disruption to our strong momentum.","And finally I'll be meeting with the Allergan employees in the coming weeks. I look forward to engaging with and ultimately welcoming this experienced and very talented organization into AbbVie.","We remain incredibly excited about the transaction which has significant strategic merit. The acquisition represents a unique opportunity for AbbVie to accelerate our non-HUMIRA business, the AbbVie growth platform by adding highly valuable on-market assets with leadership positions across attractive growth segments.","AbbVie's new growth platform will achieve stand-alone scale immediately with sales of more than $30 billion in 2020 and top-tier growth prospects. And it will enable enhanced funding of our innovative R&D platform and provide ample resource for additional pipeline expansion which remains the core focus for AbbVie.","The combination of AbbVie and Allergan will also unlock significant value for our shareholders as we've outlined. The transaction delivers immediate robust financial benefits with EPS accretion of 10% in the first full year of combination increasing to above 20% at peak. This is inclusive of more than $2 billion in annual pre-tax synergies and cost savings which is expected in the third year post-closing. ","This combination also provides significant additional earnings in the period following the loss of HUMIRA exclusivity. And the transaction provides enhanced cash flow to support a strong and growing dividend while rapidly paying down debt and continuing to invest in our innovative pipeline through increased R&D funding and the acquisition of mid to late-stage assets.","And finally, we're actively seeking the relevant approvals for the transaction and are working towards our stated goal for closing in the first quarter of 2020.","In summary, we're extremely pleased with our outperformance in the quarter and with the continued strong momentum of our business leading to another increase in our expectations for 2019. Since 2013, we have built a strong foundation through outstanding execution and the advancement of our robust pipeline of new innovative medicines. Looking back, we have delivered 16 quarters of double-digit earnings growth and have consistently been among the peer group leaders for revenue and EPS growth. ","We've launched 13 new products for major indications which have and will continue to contribute considerably to our growth. While this level of consistent performance is truly exceptional, especially given the challenges which inevitably arise in a large complex business like ours the key to long-term sustainable strong performance has always been forward planning.","And Allergan represents another example of our proactive planning to ensure we will continue to deliver top-tier performance into the next decade. Our strong track record of execution combined with the momentum of our business gives us tremendous confidence in our ability to continue to successfully execute on our long-term strategy and deliver outstanding shareholder value going forward.","With that I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?","Michael Severino","Thank you, Rick. We had another productive quarter with continued progress across all stages of our pipeline. In the area of hematologic oncology, we received FDA approval in May for VENCLEXTA in combination with GAZYVA for previously untreated patients with CLL. This marks another major milestone for the VENCLEXTA program and illustrates its growing utility across CLL patient populations.","The frontline CLL indication is the fourth approval for VENCLEXTA and was based on data from the Phase 3 CLL14 study which were reviewed under the FDA's Real-Time Oncology Review program and led to approval in just over two months following submission.","The CLL14 data demonstrated that VENCLEXTA plus GAZYVA significantly prolonged progression-free survival in patients with previously untreated CLL compared to a combination of GAZYVA plus chlorambucil reducing the risk of disease progression or death by 67%. The VENCLEXTA combination also achieved significantly higher rates of complete response and minimal residual disease negativity versus the comparator regimen.","At the recent EHA meeting, we presented detailed results from the BELLINI study, evaluating VENCLEXTA in combination with Velcade and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed\/refractory multiple myeloma. In a subpopulation of patients with a t (11;14) translocation treatment with the VENCLEXTA combination resulted in an observed 89% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death.","Following consultation with the FDA, we recently resumed the CANOVA study, our registration-enabling trial in this biomarker-defined patient population. Based on the data generated today, we believe there is a role for VENCLEXTA in this patient group, which represents roughly 20% of the multiple myeloma population. We expect data from the Phase 3 CANOVA trial in the 2021 time frame.","Moving now to IMBRUVICA, where we continue to build the body of evidence supporting IMBRUVICA across various patient segments in CLL as well as in other blood cancers. Results from the CLL12 study a placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial designed to evaluate IMBRUVICA versus no treatment in the asymptomatic watch-and-wait population were presented at the recent EHA meeting.","In this early CLL population, current standard of care has been observation rather than therapeutic intervention. However, we believe there are patients with high-risk features within this segment who may benefit from treatment with IMBRUVICA.","Data from the CLL12 trial showed that treatment with IMBRUVICA significantly improved event-free survival, progression-free survival and time to next treatment in patients with treatment-naive early-stage CLL when compared to placebo. Importantly, safety results from the study demonstrated that most adverse events were seen at similar rates between IMBRUVICA and placebo with the exception of atrial fibrillation, bleeding and hypertensive disorders, which we believe to be on-target BTK effects. We are encouraged with this data as they further illustrate IMBRUVICA's potential in patients who typically don't receive treatment today.","In the area of solid tumors, we recently completed the Phase 3 study evaluating veliparib in BRCA-mutated breast cancer as well as the Phase 3 study in ovarian cancer, which is being run in collaboration with the gynecologic oncology group. In both studies, veliparib achieved the primary endpoint of progression-free survival and safety was consistent with that observed in the previously reported studies.","We are continuing to analyze the data from these two studies and plan to discuss the findings with regulators to determine if they are sufficient for registration. Detailed results from both studies will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting.","Now moving to immunology. We continue to make great progress with our two late-stage assets SKYRIZI and upadacitinib as well as with our early-stage immunology assets.","Early in the second quarter, we received U.S. and European approvals for SKYRIZI in psoriasis and we anticipate an FDA decision in the coming weeks for upadacitinib in its initial indication of rheumatoid arthritis. We believe both of our next-generation therapies have proven to be differentiated assets in their respective initial indications and have the potential to be best-in-category medicines across more than a dozen diseases.","We expect data readouts from several follow-on indications over the next 12 months to 18 months and we look forward to providing updates as these programs progress. And while we believe SKYRIZI and upadacitinib will set new standards across a broad range of indications, we believe we can push the standard of care even higher with our early-stage programs which include ABBV-599 our JAK-BTK inhibitor combination in Phase 2 for RA with proof-of-concept data expected last year and beginning Phase 2 in lupus later this year; ABBV-323 our CD40 antagonist in Phase 2 for ulcerative colitis with proof-of-concept data expected next year and beginning Phase 2 in Sjogren's syndrome later this year; and our TNF steroid conjugate program where early clinical work is ongoing and proof-of-concept data are expected next year as well.","In the area of women's health, we expect to submit our regulatory application for elagolix in uterine fibroids in the coming days. Many women with uterine fibroids suffer from heavy menstrual bleeding and painful periods and elagolix has demonstrated the potential to become an important new treatment option for the large number of women suffering from this disease. This regulatory submission will mark another major milestone in our elagolix development program, and we look forward to bringing this innovative new medicine to the market once approved next year.","And lastly, a few updates in the areas of -- in the area of neuroscience. We recently made the decision to stop the Phase 2 study for ABBV-8E12 in Progressive Supranuclear Palsy or PSP following a futility analysis showing that AB 12 did not demonstrate the efficacy we had hoped for in PSP patients.","Alzheimer's disease and PSP differ in a number of important ways including the genetic background in which they occur and the distribution and potentially the nature of TAL pathology. Therefore, the ongoing Phase II study in Alzheimer's disease will continue as planned. Also in the quarter, we began the Phase III program to support the registration of ABBV-951, our innovative subcutaneous Levodopa\/Carbidopa delivery system.","In summary, we've seen tremendous progress across all stages of our pipeline in the first half of the year and we remain on track for further advancements in the remainder of 2019.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our second quarter performance. Rob?","Rob Michael","Thanks Mike. As Rick mentioned, we had another quarter of strong performance. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.26, reflecting growth of 13% compared to prior year and $0.05 above our guidance midpoint. For the second quarter, net revenues were up 1.5% on an operational basis, excluding a 1.5% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Strong growth from several key products offset the impact of international biosimilar competition.","U.S. HUMIRA sales were $3.8 billion, up 7.7% compared to prior year with volume growth of approximately 7% and a modest positive price impact. Wholesaler inventory levels remained below 0.5 month in the quarter. International HUMIRA sales were approximately $1.1 billion, down 31% operationally, reflecting biosimilar competition across Europe and other international markets and in line with our expectations.","As Rick previously mentioned, we are extremely pleased with the performance of SKYRIZI, with sales of $48 million in the quarter. Hematologic oncology global sales were nearly $1.3 billion, up 39.1% on an operational basis, driven by the continued strong growth of both IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA. IMBRUVICA global net revenues were $1.1 billion, primarily driven by continued uptake in the frontline CLL segment. In CLL, IMBRUVICA remains the market leader across all lines of therapy with new patient share of approximately 35% in the frontline setting.","VENCLEXTA revenues were $169 million, driven by continued progress in the broad relapsed refractory CLL segment and our recent approval is for frontline CLL and AML. We've seen market share gains across all approved indications including AML, where the launch is exceeding our expectations.","Global HCV revenues were $784 million in the quarter, down approximately 17% on an operational basis, mainly driven by lower treated patient volumes in select international markets. We also saw continued strong operational sales growth for both Duodopa and Creon.","Turning now to the P&L profile for the second quarter. Adjusted gross margin was 82.7% of sales, up 220 basis points compared to the prior year including a 290 basis point benefit related to expiration of HUMIRA royalties, partially offset by the impact of partnership accounting. Adjusted R&D investment was 14.9% of sales supporting our pipeline programs on oncology, immunology and other areas.","Adjusted SG&A expense was 19.6% of sales, consistent with our expectations. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 48.2% of sales, an improvement of 290 basis points versus the prior year. Adjusted net interest expense was $302 million and the adjusted tax rate was 8.7%.","In the quarter, we recorded a specified charge of $1.55 per share for the contingent consideration increase related to SKYRIZI future milestone and royalty payments. This non-cash charge includes the impact of both a higher risk-adjusted cash flow forecast following the recent regulatory approvals for SKYRIZI as well as lower discount rates.","As mentioned earlier, based on our strong performance year-to-date, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $8.82 to $8.92, reflecting growth of 12.1% at the midpoint. Excluded from this guidance is $3.13 of known intangible amortization and specified items. We are also increasing our revenue guidance for the full year and now expect growth of approximately 2% on an operational basis. At current rates, we continue to expect foreign exchange to have approximately 1% unfavorable impact on full year reported sales growth.","Included in this guidance are the following assumptions for our key products. We now expect U.S. HUMIRA sales growth approaching 80%. We continue to see a robust volume growth and maintain a strong leadership position across all segments. For our hem\/onc franchise, we now expect global revenues of approximately $5.3 billion. This includes IMBRUVICA global revenues of approximately $4.6 billion with U.S. sales growth of approximately 27%.","For SKYRIZI, as Rick mentioned, we now expect global revenues of approximately $250 million. We're now forecasting global HCV sales approaching $3.1 billion, which we expect to be split evenly between U.S. and international. And for ORILISSA, we now forecast sales to be approximately $100 million. We are still in the early stage of market development. And while the launch ramp is slower than initially expected, we continue to believe ORILISSA will be a significant long-term opportunity for AbbVie. All other full year 2019 forecast assumptions for our key products remain unchanged.","Turning now to the P&L for 2019. We now expect adjusted net interest expense of approximately $1.2 billion. All other full year 2019 guidance assumptions remain unchanged. As we look ahead to the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.28 and $2.30 excluding approximately $0.43 of non-cash amortization and other specified items. We anticipate third quarter adjusted revenue of approximately $8.4 billion. At current rates, we expect a modest unfavorable foreign exchange impact.","For U.S. HUMIRA, we expect sales growth of approximately 8%. We expect international HUMIRA sales of approximately $1 billion, assuming current exchange rates. And for IMBRUVICA we expect global sales of approximately $1.2 billion.","Moving now to the P&L for the third quarter, we are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 48%, and we expect the adjusted tax rate to be in line with our full year guidance, which is just above our 2018 rate.","In summary, AbbVie has delivered another excellent quarter with results well ahead of our expectations. We expect this momentum to continue in the second half of 2019 putting us in a strong position to once again deliver top-tier earnings growth.","And with that I'll turn the call back over to Liz.","Liz Shea","Thanks, Rob. We'll now open the call for questions. Operator, first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today is from Steve Scala from Cowen.","Steve Scala","Thank you. I have two questions. Rick in Q1 you warned us that SKYRIZI was unlikely to have meaningful sales in Q2 and today you delivered one of the biggest launch numbers in my memory. So what is going on? What has been better than expected? So that's the first question. And the second question is the fact that it appears there will not be upadacitinib AdCom, could be great news or a bit troubling. Great, if approval is going to be an FDA rubber stamp and troubling if it implies the FDA is unlikely to approve the drug on August 19. So any perspective on what's going on with the regulators would be helpful. Thank you.","Rick Gonzalez","Okay. All right, Steve. I'll cover the first question and Mike will cover the second one. I would say, we have been extremely pleased with the market reaction to SKYRIZI. I think it's a clear demonstration as to the value of this asset in the marketplace, the higher level of efficacy, and the other attributes of the product. And so I think it has clearly beaten the expectations that we have, and have gotten there much faster than we would've expected it to get to this level of performance. I mean, it's truly outperforming all of the analogs that are out there in this category. I think one of the more impressive numbers from our perspective is, if you look at the in-play share, which we define in-play share to be naive patients plus all switching patients SKYRIZI after 10 or 11 weeks has already achieved 24% of the in-play share. And to put that in perspective prior to the launch HUMIRA was at 28%. So it's almost to the level of what HUMIRA was as the market leader in that category.","And interestingly enough about 75% or a little more than 75% of that volume is coming from other biologics. We've only seen HUMIRA trend down slightly from that. So it's clear that SKYRIZI is capturing significant competitive opportunities in the marketplace. So, I mean, I think we're obviously pleased with it. It's reinforcing the expectations that we had long-term for the drug and I think we'll get to the ramp much faster than we had expected. So it's great news from our perspective. Mike?","Michael Severino","So, this is Mike. I'll take the question on upa. So we submitted upa in late December of last year under a six plus two review clock. So we're pretty far along in the review process. We have said in the past and it continues to be true that we do not expect an Advisory Committee. We feel good about the performance of upa both from an efficacy and a benefit\/risk perceptive across the program and we do not have any concerns about approvability.","Steve Scala","Thank you.","Liz Shea","Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Geoff Porges from SVB Leerink.","Geoff Porges","Thank you very much for taking the question. Just a couple of things Rick that have come up since the deal was announced. Could you comment on whether AbbVie has any opioid liability flowing through from legacy Abbott? And then secondly could you talk a little bit about the percentage of your revenue that comes from Part B and Part D and your view on the Grassley-Wyden bill? It seems to be getting bipartisan support. So what effect would that have on your business outlook? Thanks.","Rick Gonzalez","All right. Great. So I'm going to have Laura answer the first question and then Rob and I will cover the second one.","Laura Schumacher","Okay. With respect specifically to opioid liability flowing through we do not have any liability for opioid relating to Abbott's co-promotion with Purdue Pharma.","Geoff Porges","Great. Thanks.","Laura Schumacher","Yes.","Rick Gonzalez","Okay. So maybe let me talk first about the Senate proposal that is out. I'd say from the standpoint of -- as we've said in the past, we're obviously very supportive of anything that lowers patients' out-of-pocket costs. I mean I think one of the most significant challenges that we face in the U.S. is that the way the Part D design was built originally it didn't necessarily envision the level of specialized medicine it would develop over time, and the out-of-pocket cost for patients made many of those drugs unaffordable for the average senior. And so anything we can do to reduce that, I think is a positive for the industry and it's certainly a positive for patients and we think that's a big plus.","The Senate bill will reduce out-of-pocket costs to some extent. I think the question is, is it enough? Can patients really afford the $3,100 of out-of-pocket cost, the average patient on Medicare? I think that's an important question to be debated.","The second thing that I think is important to be debated is, it's still very front-end loaded for the patient, meaning in the first few months of the year, they have to come up with the $3,100. And that's difficult for many of these patients to be able to do from a cash flow standpoint, have the ability to be able to do that.","So we would be looking to try to advocate for something that would spread that out across the year to make it more affordable on a monthly basis for these patients. And I think that's an important debate that should occur as we go forward.","I would say, there are some aspects of the legislation that we believe are punitive, particularly the innovation-driven companies. And clearly, it does give benefit to some other companies that don't have specialty products that get into the catastrophic phase.","And so, I don't know that that was the intent that companies should pay lower than what they pay today. I doubt that was the intent. But that is the nature of the way it\u2019s structured today, and I think that's something that ought to be debated and discussed.","But, it's a long road from here as you know. This will be debated and worked through. These kinds of legislations are complex and they take time, and there'll be likely extensive changes that occur to the draft legislation. But I think, the merit of going after things that reduce patient out-of-pockets, I think is a good thing.","It's a bit premature at this point to start understanding or projecting what the impact would be on AbbVie's business. I think anything we can do to lower out-of-pocket costs will obviously drive some level of increased volume and that has to be taken into consideration, but there's a lot of things that will be worked on between now and the time anything ultimately gets implemented.","And then, as far as the percentage of business, I'm going to have Rob cover that.","Rob Michael","Yeah. This is Rob. So Part D is about 20% of our U.S. sales or 14% of our global sales. Part B is very small less than 1% of our sales.","Geoff Porges","Great. Thanks very much.","Liz Shea","Thanks, Geoff. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Jason Gerberry with Bank of America.","Jason Gerberry","Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First I just wanted to follow-up on Geoff's question actually. This idea around the Purdue co-promote, because Abbott seems to be saying something different about where that liability could fall. So, is your comment that AbbVie does not have any liability, is it really just on the fact that the issue is just not ripe yet, and it's just premised on so many hypotheticals that you don't want to cause fire or characterize that as a liability? So, just trying to understand if that's really it or if you guys have fundamental differences around the separation agreement when AbbVie spun off in 2013.","And then my second question just on upadacitinib. If approved, how quickly do you think that drug could replicate the early commercial success of SKYRIZI that we've seen so far? And if you can frame any of the critical variables in the labeling determination that you think would facilitate that sort of outcome. Thanks.","Rick Gonzalez","Okay. Jason, this is Rick. So on the first one, look, what we're describing to you is essentially our view, and I think our view is consistent with the language of the agreements of where the liability would fall. And just like any other company, I'm not going to speak for another company's liability. They should speak for it themselves, but what we're telling you is that it's not an AbbVie liability. I don't know how much clearer I can be than that.","The second one is the -- on upa. Obviously, upa is a drug that was built around the same kind of premise that we looked at SKYRIZI. We were looking for an asset that could outperform HUMIRA that could demonstrate superiority to HUMIRA. It's obviously an oral delivery, which is an advantage from a patient standpoint. And it's demonstrated outstanding efficacy in clinical performance.","So we would expect it to be able to -- whether it can replicate exactly what SKYRIZI is doing or not, we will certainly put it in a position to be able to do that. And I don't think there's another more confident organization to be able to launch a product like upadacitinib or SKYRIZI than we are. And so, I think clearly, we will be able to drive this asset to achieve its maximum level of performance.","And I can tell you that obviously we're very excited about SKYRIZI and how it's performing and it's certainly meeting or beating our expectations, which is a good thing. And I think I'm equally excited about upadacitinib, when I looked at the clinical performance of that asset and the attributes of that asset. So we like to get it on the market and go out there and launch the product and get it into the marketplace as quickly as possible.","Elizabeth Shea","Thanks, Stephen. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Navin Jacob from UBS.","Navin Jacob","Hi, Thanks for taking my questions. A couple if I may. Rick, wondering if you could comment on what the potential is for international reference pricing proposals that are potentially out there from -- perhaps coming from the Trump administration. If that's feasible in any way to be pushed over to Part D, obviously the focus has been Part B, but there's also been discussion that it could be pushed over to Part D. Is that feasible in any way in your mind?","And then just on upa, all the data we've seen thus far looks incredibly differentiated versus the other JAKs in terms of safety, but wondering just from a regulatory standpoint, if the agency has a view around the class as a whole. Do they distinguish the JAKs as being different between each other? Certainly, the data would point to that from what we've seen, but wondering how your conversations with the regulators are going with regards to that, especially given the fact that literally just as we were speaking a few minutes ago the agency updated the XELJANZ label to include a black box warning for VTE DVT? Thank you very much.","Rick Gonzalez","Okay. Very good. So let me cover number one and -- the first question and I'll have Mike cover the second question. I think if you look at the international reference pricing that was being proposed in Part D, as you know, we obviously have a very small Part D business, so it doesn't have a significant impact for us. Whether or not, a structure like that or something similar to that could be moved over to D I think in a broad way that would require legislative action I believe based on the way the law is written today.","But it doesn't mean that there couldn't be pilots or other kinds of methods to ultimately look at that. So it's -- I think it's difficult to predict what it would look like. I think the Senate proposal I think is a good start with some modifications. I think the Senate proposal could be modified in a way that it could solve many of the issues that are out there.","And I think that one has a structure that then plays -- that could require some level of modification. But I think the framework around it is a good framework. And so I would hope that that would get some traction to move forward and be modified in the areas that I referenced before, potentially look at smoothing the out-of-pocket, potentially even look at maybe trying to take the out-of-pocket down a little bit further.","And then relooking at the distribution across all of the different drugs that approaches through Part D all of the proprietary drugs and making sure that that distribution is appropriate across the full range of medicines that patients buy as Part D. It would be some fundamental modifications that I think could be looked at there. Mike?","Michael Severino","Okay. I'll take the question on upadacitinib. So we feel very good about the performance of upadacitinib across its program, not only from an efficacy perspective, but from a benefit\/risk perspective. With respect to the agency's view, I can't speak for the agency, but that generally will differ across different components of the program. Obviously, there's been a lot of -- there's been a lot of focus on the DVT and PE issue with baricitinib. And then, we just saw this morning that the FDA has announced that they've updated the label for tofacitinib to include a box warning around similar events.","What we've said consistently is our program hasn't demonstrated that risk. So if we were to pick up labeling language like that or warnings around this issue, that would have to come from a determination from the FDA that they're going to move from some form of class labeling. And I'm not in a position to speak for them about that, certainly not today. Our review is ongoing so we will update on our label when we have more information.","Elizabeth Shea","Thanks, Navin. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research.","Tim Anderson","Hi, thank you. Two questions. Your share price was right at about $80 a share before you announced Allergan. It's now down over 15% since that transaction. You guys have had no setbacks in that time frame. You beat results today. So that says investors aren't enamored with the deal. From investors you've met with what's the biggest pushback on the transaction? And what do you think investors are not appreciating? And second question on ORILISSA. On the market for about a year now did $19 million in the quarter. Your prior guidance is $2 billion in 2025. Is that still realistic? Thank you.","Rick Gonzalez","Sure, Tim. This is Rick. I'll cover both of those. So first on the share price, I think it's important to put in perspective, all of the larger transactions that have been done over the course of the last several years.","So, Bristol-Celgene, Takeda, Shire and others, I've had a similar reaction out of the blocks down -- I'd say the data I looked at prior to our announcement was down in the range of 10% to 16% at announcement.","I would say as we went out following the announcement you saw that the stock rose about 3% per day on that Wednesday, Thursday and Friday and while we were on the road.","And that I think is a good indication as to, when you sit down and you get in front of investors. And you walk them through the strategic logic. And what this does for us longer term. I think most investors that we met with, walked away with a positive impression.","There are mechanical aspects of this, of how arms come in and short the acquirer. And we're obviously seeing our short volume go up significantly which is putting pressure on the stock. So, I don't think the stock's performing differently than what we would expect.","And I don't know that it's a specific indication to just the perception of the transaction. When we'll know what the perception of the transaction is, is when we close it. And the shorts move out of the stock and then the stock will trade on its merits.","And I would be -- I'm encouraged that I think the stock will trade on its merits quite well. This is a company that has performed extremely well over the last five or six years.","And this strategically puts us in a position, where regardless of what happens with HUMIRA in 2023. We can continue to perform at a very high level. And that was the intention.","And as I said in my formal comments, the reason we've been so successful is that we run the business in a way to make sure that when there are issues or risks around the business that we take proactive actions to be able to deal with those. And that's what investors would expect us to do and that's what we do.","And this is an example where it will protect the company and the shareholders from a range of outcomes around HUMIRA when we see the LOE in 2023 in the U.S. and that's the way to run the business.","And so, I'm excited about the Allergan transaction. I think it's a great set of assets. I think it's a very good organization, from an execution standpoint. And I think it will add to our business in a positive way.","And give us additional growth platforms that will allow us to continue to grow the company. As it relates to ORILISSA, our long-term guidance on ORILISSA remains the same. As we indicated to all of you when we started this -- this is an example of a drug where you have to go out and build the market.","Endometriosis hasn't had a new therapy in a decade or maybe even more than a decade. And so, you have to create the awareness. You have to create the confidence in a new therapy. And you have to get patients to be aware of it, and then to be activated to go to their physician and get treatment.","So, we're continuing to look at our launch strategy and make modifications where we think they are appropriate to accelerate the ramp. And one of the things that we're looking at right now is if you look at the profile of the drug, the profile of the drug is excellent.","There's -- it fits exactly the objectives that we need in a drug in this class. The physician uptake has been good. We're getting good trial out of the physician base and getting pretty broad coverage out of the physician base.","The third component for a drug like this is you have to -- as I said, you have to create awareness for patients. And you have to activate those patients to go into their physicians' office and talk about treatment of their condition.","And, I'd say, we're getting good awareness. In fact I'd say the awareness is slightly higher than what we would have projected. Where we're not getting enough activation, because these women are essentially -- they go to their physicians typically once a year or less on average.","So we want them to basically make a special visit, to ultimately come in and start to talk about their condition and what the appropriate treatment is for that condition. We're not seeing a lot of activation or -- at the level that we would expect of their routine visit schedule.","And so we are looking at some modifications to our current promotional strategy to try to increase that activation and that will obviously allow the ramp to increase. And that's the area of focus that we have today.","So, you constantly modify your strategy to make sure that you're dealing with the elements that could enhance it. And that's what we're doing.","Tim Anderson","Thank you.","Elizabeth Shea","Thanks Tim. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Baum from Citi.","Andrew Baum","Thank you. A couple of questions please. Firstly, could you help us think through the potential impact of biosimilar Enbrel introduction in the U.S. on your HUMIRA business?","What's your level of confidence that any usage will impact only treatment-naive RA patients? Or is there risks to your in-built franchise of established patients? So that's the first question.","Second with SKYRIZI. In relation to the usage anticipated with the drug how much do you expect to be home administration versus in the physician's office? And are there ready economic incentives for physicians in that to select SKYRIZI as a result of that?","And then finally, again on SKYRIZI the drug is not currently approved with psoriatic arthritis unlike some of your competitors. That's about 30% I believe of the current psoriasis market. To what extent is that a disadvantage given it's going to take a while before you get the data? And there may be some questions about the Sharp scores and the comparative nature of that data versus the approved IL-17? Many thanks.","Rick Gonzalez","All right. Thank you. So impact of biosimilar Enbrel, I will tell you that there is no data that would support that it will cause a change in well-maintained patients. We obviously have REMICADE biosimilar in the U.S. marketplace today. It's not having any of that kind of impact granted it's an infused product but it's a -- outside the U.S. when we had biosimilar Enbrel, it didn't have any material impact at all on HUMIRA. And so I don't expect that it would have any significant impact at all if Enbrel were to go biosimilar. And if it had any impact it would only be on naive patients so I don't think that's something that we would be overly concerned about.","On point number two what the split is between physician office and self-administered I don't know that I know the answer to that question so we may need to follow-up with you on that. So let us take a follow-up and get back to you on that. On the third one Mike why don't you cover that?","Michael Severino","So this is Mike. With respect to psoriasis in psoriatic arthritis there is a degree of overlap between those conditions but patients often present with more prominent skin disease or more prominent joint disease. So our strategy is to have a portfolio of options for those patients.","Today we have SKYRIZI which has demonstrated outstanding efficacy on the skin disease. HUMIRA we still believe is a gold standard for patients who have primary joint involvement and prominent joint involvement.","Going forward, we have Phase 3 programs both for SKYRIZI in psoriatic arthritis and for upadacitinib in psoriatic arthritis. So we think across that range of options we'll have the best treatment option for each of those individual patient profiles.","Rick Gonzalez","And the only thing I'd add is you have to look at the data that's coming out today. I said the bulk of the volume that's coming to SKYRIZI today 77% of it is coming from other biologics. And I can tell you a significant portion of that is the IL-17s. And just think about it from this perspective between SKYRIZI now and HUMIRA we really should capture almost 50% of all in-play patients. So I think that gives you some idea of the kind of impact that it's having and the competitiveness of SKYRIZI versus those alternatives that are available whether they're 17s or other 23s or TNFs.","Liz Shea","Thanks, Andrew. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Terence Flynn from Goldman.","Terence Flynn","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the SKYRIZI launch. One question. You mentioned in the past Rick that some smaller divestitures might be required as part of the Allergan deal. I think some investors assume Allergan's IL-23 would be one of those products. So just wondering if that's a fair assumption. And then what's your confidence level in retaining SKYRIZI?","And then the second question I had relates to the U.S. HUMIRA erosion curve. Can you give us any sense of how you're thinking about that in the 2023 time frame and where Allergan fits into that? You mentioned managing the business where there's kind of risks and different outcomes but how did you guys think about that 2023 erosion curve with respect to Allergan in the business there? Thank you. ","Rick Gonzalez","So let me talk a little bit about the divestitures. We've commented on questions that have come up from investors in the broader nature of are we interested in divesting anything out of the portfolio. And generally I would tell you no. There could be some overlaps from an FTC standpoint and that -- and therefore we would deal with those. Laura, is there anything additional you want to comment on from an FTC standpoint?","Laura Schumacher","Yes. I guess I will just say we filed our initial HSR filing. And obviously, we're working with the FTC to the extent that our product overlap. Specifically with respect to SKYRIZI, we do not anticipate that the FTC would require that divestiture at the very least because it's on market for a different non-overlapping indication. And from the standpoint of the FTC's review of the overlap both the SKYRIZI product and the Allergan IL-23 will be considered pipeline assets.","And SKYRIZI is being developed for a number of different indications while the Allergan product is only being developed for a couple. So we really don't believe the FTC would require divestiture of SKYRIZI simply because it's on the market for a different nonoverlapping indication.","Rick Gonzalez","Okay. And then on the HUMIRA erosion curve -- we're obviously not in a position where we're going to talk to you what that erosion curve looks like this far out because obviously things can change along the way. And when we get closer to the point that we can give you a predictable erosion curve, we will obviously supply that to the market. But we want to do it, when we have a high level of confidence that we can give you a number that is accurate.","Having said that, as we've gone out and talk to investors, what we've described to them is, we have a base case erosion curve that we have built. We have -- we update that erosion curve at least once a year, but sometimes more often than that based on -- as we see circumstances play out. We have updated the erosion curve based on the experience that we've seen in the international markets.","And I'd say specifically, we've updated the speed at which the curve drops in 2023 because the experience in the international markets is that it's not and has not been a stair step over a number of years. It has come down to basically where a year or three would've been and it's pretty much flattened out. And we are seeing the market outside the U.S. in most countries around the world, reach a point where the competitive dynamics are clearly well within the expectations that we've built in our plan and are somewhat stabilizing I would say.","So we've updated the U.S. erosion curve to look more like that international curve in the shape of that curve. And then, we obviously do downside scenarios where we look at okay what scenarios could come together in a way that would create a higher level of erosion? And that's based on a number of competitor\u2019s, interchangeability, changes to the U.S. health care system and we do a number of different modeling assumptions around that to determine what a downside case might look like.","If you look at the Allergan transaction, I think the beauty of the Allergan transaction is it guards against the full range of those options. So, if we ended up on a downside scenario, the Allergan transaction allows us to totally buffer that impact. If we end up on the base case, then obviously AbbVie is in a much better position. And so there really isn't a downside scenario that I can come up with that the Allergan transaction doesn't make AbbVie stronger as we go through the LOE. And that was the premise of the transaction and I think everything that we know about it today, only reinforces that that is the appropriate way to be able to manage the business over the long term.","Liz Shea","Thanks, Aaron.","Terence Flynn","Great. Thanks you.","Liz Shea","Operator, we have time for one last question.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today is from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger","Great. Thank you very much. So the results in the quarter were obviously very strong. I just want to understand a little bit better the gross margin. So the sales growth sequentially was over $400 million versus the first quarter, but the gross margin declined from 83.4% to 82.7%. So, if you could just give us some color on that.","And then could you talk a little bit about the benefits of leveraging HUMIRA in autoimmune disease with payers? I think that management has discussed in the past that payers appreciate the fact that AbbVie is a major player in autoimmune disease and the company can offer bundled programs to facilitate adoption of SKYRIZI and that should also help upadacitinib as well. So, if you could just talk about leveraging the franchise. And then if there's any way to comment on the math that's involved so how you actually allocate rebates for example between SKYRIZI and HUMIRA that would be helpful. Thank you very much.","Rob Michael","David, this is Rob. So I'll take your first question. So, if you look at our gross margin profile through six months, we're right at 83%. That's very much in line with our full year guidance. I mean quarter-to-quarter, you'll see the profile fluctuate due to sales mix impact of foreign exchange and timing of spending, but we feel very good about the progress we've made in gross margin and we're tracking in line with our guidance.","Rick Gonzalez","So David, this is Rick. I guess the first thing I'd say is we don't leverage HUMIRA with our payers. We obviously have a portfolio -- or will have a portfolio of assets that we believe provides payers with the greatest flexibility to cover the largest number of patients and that's a benefit for those payers to be able to have assets that give them the greatest level of coverage for -- from a clinical standpoint for those patients.","And as far as what the rebates are, we obviously don't publicly disclose what those rebates are for competitive reasons. But what I would tell you is -- I mean I've heard this rumbling out there about somehow trying to leverage HUMIRA for SKYRIZI as an example. And I'd just point to this quarter as an example all right? HUMIRA grew 7.7%. It had 0.5 point of positive price, all right? So at the end of the day, obviously we didn't leverage HUMIRA to a great extent to get a position for SKYRIZI. There are benefits that we would provide to payers, who allowed both products to go on formulary and -- but there isn't a big leverage component here that the market seems to be perceiving or you wouldn't have positive price. So, I think that answers two and three.","Liz Shea","Okay. Thanks David.","David Risinger","All right. Thank you.","Liz Shea","Thanks David. That concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference.

All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer portion of this call.","I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Good morning and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are: Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Severino, Executive Vice President of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer; Bill Chase, Executive Vice President of Finance and Administration; and Rob Michael, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that statements we make today are or may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.

These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks we'll take your questions.","So with that I'll now turn the call over to Rick.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll discuss our third quarter performance, our full-year 2018 guidance, and I'll provide some comments about our expectations for 2019. Mike will then provide an update on recent advancements across our R&D pipeline and Bill will discuss the quarter in more detail. Following our remarks, as usual, we will take your questions.","We delivered another quarter of outstanding performance with results once again ahead of our expectations. We've driven strong commercial, operational, and R&D execution resulting in industry-leading top and bottom line growth. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.14, representing growth of more than 50% versus last year. Total adjusted operational sales growth of 18.5% was driven by a number of products in our portfolio including HUMIRA with global operational sales growth of nearly 10% and IMBRUVICA which grew more than 40% versus the prior year. HCV was a substantial contributor in the quarter with more than $860 million in sales, and we also saw strong performance from several other products including VENCLEXTA, CREON, DUODOPA and LUPON. Based on the continued strength of our business in the quarter and our progress year to date, we are raising our 2018 earnings guidance for the fourth time this year. We now expect full-year 2018 adjusted earnings per share of $7.90 to $7.92, reflecting growth of more than 41% at the midpoint. This represents exceptional earnings growth and puts us at the very top of our industry peer group.","And while 2018 certainly sets a very high bar for performance, we expect strong earnings growth once again next year. Although it's too early to provide specific growth targets for 2019 as we're still in the midst of our annual planning process, based on our strong underlying business momentum, we are confident in our ability to deliver double digit earnings growth once again in 2019. And importantly, we expect to deliver this level of growth despite a number of factors including direct biosimilar competition, impacting our more than $6 billion international HUMIRA business; a difficult comparison year, particularly in light of the rapid ramp of our HCV business in 2018; and the significant investment we will be making in 2019 to support new product launches including VENCLEXTA, ORILISSA, risankizumab and upadacitinib. Clearly 2019 will be an important year for AbbVie, an opportunity for us to clearly demonstrate our ability to continue to drive strong earnings growth.","In addition to the strong bottom line performance, we also expect to continue to generate significant cash flows. Underscoring the continued confidence in our business, today we're announcing 11.5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $0.96 per share to $1.07 per share beginning with the dividend payable in February 2019. Since our inception, we have grown our quarterly dividend nearly 170%.","Also in the quarter, we announced two additional patent license agreements over proposed HUMIRA biosimilar products. These agreements, of which there are now five in total, are yet another example of the strength of our intellectual property, and we remain confident that we will not see direct biosimilar competition in the U.S. until 2023.","As we look at our business and evaluate our prospects, just about every aspect of our business is performing at or above our expectations. Our pipeline remains one of the best in the industry and the progress we're making to bring new products to the market will allow us to support our long-term growth expectations. Let me highlight a few examples. We have invested significantly in oncology over the past several years to build a major new growth driver for AbbVie. Today our hematological oncology portfolio is now annualizing above $4 billion and growing at a robust rate, including growth of more than 48% in the third quarter.","As we continue to generate data that validates the utility of both IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA across a wide range of patient populations and cancer types, we expect this franchise to drive significant growth for many years to come. This growth will be driven by further penetration in front-line CLL where we have a very broad clinical program including numerous trials evaluating our assets in different combinations against the other first line therapies including the gold standard FCR. Growth will also be driven by expansion into other malignancies like AML and multiple myeloma, both sizeable indications that represent a multibillion dollar peak sales opportunity.","We're also well positioned to grow our strong leadership position in immunology, with the introduction of our two new therapies, risankizumab and upadacitinib. As we've built our immunology pipeline, our focus was to identify assets that not only improved performance over HUMIRA, currently the gold standard, but offered differentiated profiles versus other new mechanisms. We firmly believe that our two next generation assets have the potential to be best in category. Risankizumab and upadacitinib are on track to launch in 2019, and we're confident based on their profiles both will perform very well and drive significant growth. This gives us three to four years of ramp and the opportunity to drive significant uptake of these two therapies prior to the expected entry of direct biosimilar competition in the U.S.","Elagolix is yet another compelling asset that represents a multibillion dollar growth opportunity. The recent launch of ORILISSA in endometriosis is tracking right in line with our assumptions, with broad formulary coverage expected by early 2019. We expect to submit our regulatory application for uterine fibroids, another attractive follow-on indication, next year.","This is an extremely exciting time for AbbVie. We've entered a new phase of our evolution, the phase where we clearly demonstrate the strength of our business and the strength of our pipeline. The continued momentum of the U.S. business combined with the launch and ramp of several new products, including ORILISSA, risankizumab and upadacitinib, along with the outstanding performance of our heme-onc portfolio will allow us to grow through biosimilar impact in 2019 just as we had predicted.","So in summary, we continue to demonstrate outstanding performance driven by strong commercial, operational, and R&D execution. We're making significant advancements in our pipeline and delivering outstanding financial results as evidenced by our industry-leading performance year-to-date and our confidence in our expectation to deliver double digit EPS growth again in 2019.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike. Mike?","Michael E. Severino - AbbVie, Inc.","Thank you, Rick. This morning I'll highlight noteworthy pipeline updates from the quarter and discuss several of the key milestones we anticipate over the next 12 months. I'll start with oncology where we're making very good progress advancing our programs for IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA. As Rick mentioned, these two therapies have the potential to transform the treatment of CLL and other hematological malignancies by providing chemotherapy-free options that deliver better long-term disease control and improved outcomes for patients.","IMBRUVICA has already changed the treatment paradigm in relapsed\/refractory CLL and we're making significant progress in the front line setting. The current IMBRUVICA label in front line CLL is based on strong data from the RESONATE 2 study which evaluated IMBRUVICA versus chlorambucil in older CLL patients. We have several ongoing studies evaluating IMBRUVICA alone and in combination in additional patient populations and versus more widely used comparators. Our program includes studies in young and fit patients where we are evaluating IMBRUVICA versus regimens such as FCR, BR, and GAZYVA chlorambucil, often thought of as the gold standards in CLL treatment.","We are also conducting studies in patients in the watch and wait population who are at increased risk of depression. Data from two important studies in our front line CLL program the iLLUMINATE study and the Alliance study will be presented at the upcoming ASH meeting. In the iLLUMINATE study, we evaluated IMBRUVICA plus GAZYVA compared to a combination of GAZYVA and chlorambucil or GC. In June, we reported that the IMBRUVICA arm in this study demonstrated significantly longer progression-free survival compared to GC. Based on these results in the third quarter, the FDA accepted our regulatory application for IMBRUVICA in combination with GAZYVA for first line treatment of CLL.","At ASH, the Alliance Cooperative Group will be presenting results from a Phase 3 study which evaluated IMBRUVICA alone and in combination with Rituxan versus BR. In this study, treatment with IMBRUVICA alone or in combination with Rituxan demonstrated superior progression-free survival compared with BR in previously untreated CLL patients over the age of 65. The evidence from these studies demonstrate IMBRUVICA's compelling clinical benefit in front line populations beyond those addressed by RESONATE 2 and will provide an opportunity to treat significantly more patients in the front line setting. Over the course of the next few years, there will be additional data readouts for IMBRUVICA in front-line CLL that we believe will help drive further penetration.","We continue to make good progress with IMBRUVICA in other hematologic malignancies as well. In the quarter, we received approval for IMBRUVICA in combination with Rituxan as the first chemotherapy-free combination treatment for Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia. This marks the ninth FDA approval for IMBRUVICA.","Moving now to VENCLEXTA, where we are making substantial progress in several hematologic malignancies, including CLL, AML, and multiple myeloma, in the quarter, we received an expanded label for VENCLEXTA to include minimal residual disease negativity data from the MURANO trial. This follows our approval in the broader relapsed\/refractory CLL setting received this summer and is VENCLEXTA's second label expansion in 2018.","MRD negativity, which is undetectable disease at a threshold of 1 in 10,000 cells, is becoming an increasingly important goal in the treatment of patients with CLL. The rates of MRD negativity demonstrated in the MURANO trial support VENCLEXTA's ability to drive deep responses and potential to provide long periods of remission for these patients. The inclusion of these data in the VENCLEXTA label is another important milestone for our program.","We are also making very good progress with VENCLEXTA in the front-line CLL setting. We recently announced positive top line results from the CLL14 study, which evaluated VENCLEXTA in combination with GAZYVA versus GAZYVA plus chlorambucil. We expect to present detailed data from this study at an upcoming medical meeting. The CLL14 study will form the basis of regulatory submissions in the coming months and will move us further towards our goal of establishing VENCLEXTA as a foundational chemotherapy-free option in the CLL market.","Beyond CLL, we are also making good progress in other hematologic malignancies such as AML and multiple myeloma, where w0e've seen strong mid-stage data and are nearing completion of the first registrational studies in both indications.","Our U.S. regulatory application for VENCLEXTA in first-line AML patients who can't receive high-dose induction chemotherapy is currently under review with the FDA, with an approval decision expected by the end of the year. This accelerated approval will be based on compelling data from our Phase 2 study, with confirmatory results from our Phase 3 program expected in 2019.","In multiple myeloma, we're expecting data in the first half of 2019 from the Phase 3 BELLINI study, which is evaluating VENCLEXTA in combination with Velcade and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed\/refractory multiple myeloma. We are also exploring VENCLEXTA as a potential treatment in front-line multiple myeloma, with Phase 3 studies expected to begin in 2019.","Moving now to immunology, where we continue to make good progress across all stages of our portfolio, we have built a strong leadership position in immunology, and AbbVie has played an integral role in defining the standard of care across the rheumatology, dermatology, and gastroenterology segments. At the recent ACR, UEGW, and EADV meetings, we showcased our immunology portfolio and presented a total of 70 abstracts, reinforcing our deep scientific expertise and commitment to researching innovative therapies in these areas.","Our immunology franchise, which we believe is the best in the industry, is evolving to a portfolio of therapies with the forthcoming commercialization of our two late-stage assets, upadacitinib and risankizumab, next year. In late-stage development, we have registrational programs ongoing for upadacitinib, our JAK1 selective inhibitor, in five immune-mediated conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, atopic dermatitis, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. And we plan to begin Phase 3 studies in the sixth potential indication for upadacitinib, giant cell arteritis, in the first half of 2019.","In rheumatoid arthritis, the lead indication for upadacitinib, we remain on track to submit our regulatory application by the end of the year. At the ACR meeting last week, we presented nine abstracts for upadacitinib in RA, including data from three of the five Phase 3 registrational studies. As we gather long-term data from the Phase 3 studies in the SELECT program, we remain very encouraged by the profile that we have observed. Based on the data generated across our clinical program, we remain very confident in the benefit\/risk profile for upadacitinib and believe that it will offer meaningful advantages over products on the market today or in development.","At the recent UEGW meeting, we presented Phase 2 upadacitinib data in ulcerative colitis, demonstrating that significantly more patients treated with upadacitinib achieved clinical remission and a scopic improvement in clinical response following induction therapy versus placebo. These results look very promising based on the strong signal we've observed.","Moving now to our anti-IL-23 antibody, risankizumab, where like upadacitinib, we're evaluating the asset in several indications, in addition to the lead indication, psoriasis, we have Phase 3 studies ongoing in Crohn's disease, Phase 2 studies ongoing in ulcerative colitis, and expect to initiate Phase 3 studies in psoriatic arthritis in the first half of 2019.","The regulatory applications in psoriasis are currently under review, with approval decisions expected in the first half of 2019. Across each of the four Phase 3 studies in the pivotal program, risankizumab consistently showed very high and durable rates of skin clearance. Based on these results, we believe risankizumab has the potential to significantly improve upon current treatment options for both bio-na\u00efve and TNF-inadequate responder patients with moderate to severe psoriasis while providing the convenience of quarterly dosing.","We are also making very good progress advancing our early-stage immunology pipeline, with several of our next-generation assets recently starting Phase 2 studies and several more expected to begin Phase 2 over the course of the next 12 months.","ABBV-599, our JAK inhibitor\/BTK inhibitor combination, recently began Phase 2 in RA and will begin Phase 2 in lupus next year. ABBV-323, our CD40 antagonist, recently transitioned to Phase 2 in ulcerative colitis. And our anti-TNF steroid ADC program is moving through multi-dose Phase 1 studies, with Phase 2 expected to begin in 2019. We look forward to providing updates on these programs as the mid-stage data mature.","And lastly, in the area of neuroscience, we continue to make good progress with our preclinical and early clinical programs. Neuroscience is an emerging area of focus for AbbVie, and we are making considerable internal and external investments. We're advancing research across several neurodegenerative disorders with innovative approaches such as targeting tau, trem2, cd33, and alpha-synuclein, just to name a few. In 2019, we and our partners expect to transition several programs from our neuroscience collaborations into the clinic.","So in summary, we've continued to make significant progress advancing and accelerating our programs over the quarter, and we look forward to many more important pipeline milestones in the coming months and through 2019.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on our third quarter performance. Bill?","William J. Chase - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Mike.","We are very pleased with our strong third quarter results. Total adjusted net revenues were $8.2 billion, up 18.5% operationally excluding a 70 basis point unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.14, up 51.8% compared to the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted EPS exceeded the midpoint of our prior guidance range by $0.13 due to favorable sales and operating margin profile dynamics.","HUMIRA global sales were $5.1 billion in the quarter, up nearly 10% operationally. In the U.S., HUMIRA sales increased 12.5% compared to the prior year, with more than half driven by underlying volume growth plus a mid-single digit price contribution. The growth rate in the quarter also reflected a modest stocking benefit from the launch of our new citrate-free formulation. Wholesaler inventory levels remained roughly half a month in the quarter. International HUMIRA sales approached $1.6 billion in the quarter, up 4.2% on an operational basis and in line with our prior guidance.","In oncology, global sales of heme products were nearly $1.1 billion in the third quarter led by the continued strong growth of both IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA. In the quarter, IMBRUVICA net revenues were $972 million, increasing more than 40% versus the prior year, primarily driven by market share gains across all lines of therapy in CLL.","Venclexta revenues were $96 million in the quarter driven by uptake in the second-line plus setting as a result of our recent approval in the broad relapsed\/refractory CLL segment.","Global HCV sales in the quarter were $862 million. MAVYRET continues to perform very well, holding roughly 50% market share globally. As expected, we saw sequentially lower sales internationally as a result of fewer warehoused patients in certain markets. We also saw double-digit operational sales growth in both DUODOPA and CREON.","Turning to the P&L profile for the quarter, adjusted gross margin was 81.7% of sales, up 90 basis points compared to the prior year. This was inclusive of the year-over-year benefit related to the termination of certain HUMIRA royalties and the impact of favorable foreign exchange partially offset by the dilutive impact of partnership accounting.","Adjusted R&D was 15.4% of sales in the quarter, supporting our pipeline programs in oncology, immunology and other areas. Adjusted SG&A was 19.1% of sales in the quarter, a decrease of 170 basis points versus the prior year, reflecting sales leverage as well as operational efficiencies.","The adjusted operating margin profile was 47.2% of sales in the quarter, an improvement of 430 basis points versus the prior year. Net interest expense was $302 million in the quarter, and the adjusted tax rate was 9.1%.","Turning to full year guidance, as Rick mentioned, today we are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance range to $7.90 to $7.92 per share, representing growth of 41.3% at the midpoint. This guidance assumes an increase in adjusted net revenue which we now expect to approach $32.7 billion, with full year operational performance of approximately 15% which is also above our previously communicated guidance. At current exchange rates, we continue to expect a favorable foreign currency benefit on the year of less than 1%.","This forecast comprehends the following assumptions related to our key products. For IMBRUVICA, we now expect global revenues to AbbVie to be above $3.5 billion with U.S. sales above $2.9 billion. For international HUMIRA at current exchange rates, we now expect sales to approach $6.3 billion. This updated forecast incorporates the latest dynamics we are seeing following the introduction of biosimilar competition across certain markets in mid-October. We continue to expect U.S. HUMIRA sales of approximately $13.7 billion, and we continue to forecast global HCV sales of above $3.5 billion.","We forecast full year adjusted gross margin to be above 80.5% of sales and now expect adjusted operating margin to approach 45% of sales. All other full year 2018 guidance assumptions remain unchanged.","For the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be between $1.89 and $1.91. This adjusted EPS guidance excludes roughly $0.26 of non-cash amortization and other specified items, and represents year-over-year growth of more than 28% at the midpoint. We expect fourth quarter operational sales growth of above 7%. At current rates, we would expect foreign exchange to have an unfavorable impact on reported sales growth of less than 1% in the quarter.","In closing, once again, we have delivered outstanding performance in a quarter. We have driven top and bottom line growth that has been strong while continuing to advance our pipeline. Our increased guidance range for 2018 puts us among the top of our industry peers once again with the midpoint of the range representing growth of more than 41%. And underscoring our confidence going forward, as Rick mentioned earlier, today we announced an 11.5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend beginning with the dividend payable in February 2019.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Rick.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Thank you, Bill. Before we open the call for questions I wanted to say a few words about Bill so this is the part where I'm going to embarrass Bill. I guess you won't be able to tell that because you can't see him but Bill, as you know, recently announced his intention to retire in the summer of 2019. I can tell you that Bill has been my partner since we launched AbbVie, and he has played a very significant role in the tremendous success that we have been able to deliver.","I've known Bill and worked with Bill in some form or fashion at least 25 years. Between Abbott and AbbVie, Bill has had a tremendous 30-year career. I can tell you that personally I will miss Bill when he retires. I told him the story about me flunking retirement, that didn't seem to faze him very much. But in all seriousness, I know that Bill and his family are extremely excited about moving to Europe next summer and starting this new chapter in their lives. So I can tell you that all of us here at AbbVie wish him and his family all the best, and I know he'll do extremely well and he's extremely excited about this move.","As I mentioned, Bill will be with us until the middle of next year, so many of you will have an opportunity to congratulate him personally prior to his departure.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Rick. We'll now open the call for questions. Operator, first question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Steve Scala from Cohen.","Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you, and congratulations on a phenomenal performance. AbbVie is a couple weeks into direct international biosimilar competition. What have you been seeing so far? And how does that feed into your thoughts for the year? And what will be the major pushes and pulls in 2019? AbbVie will have international HUMIRA headwinds but offset by a promising group of new products. And it does appear that AbbVie is expecting a strong contribution from new products next year to blunt the headwinds to some extent. Thank you.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Steve, this is Rick. Thanks for the question. Let me start with international biosimilars. I know there's a lot of interest, so I'm going to go through it in a little bit of detail. Now having said that, I think as most of you probably know, the healthcare systems internationally are somewhat heterogeneous, so it's not like you can explain one system and explain exactly how biosimilar competition will work across all of the marketplaces. But I think I can give you a pretty good feel for what we're seeing out there and how we dialed that impact in.","We're only two weeks or so into the launch. Four biosimilars launched basically simultaneously: Amgen, Sandoz, Biogen Samsung and Mylan. I'd say that we have now seen pricing in every single market, so we have an idea of what pricing looks like in every single market. Doesn't mean it's stabilized in every single market yet, and I'll describe for you what that looks like in some level of detail here.","The discounting has been on the higher end of the planning scenarios that we had laid out. It's still within the planning scenarios that we had laid out but a little bit on the higher end of that and on the higher end of the relevant analogs. And what I mean by that is we use REMICADE and ENBREL biosimilars as the analogs that we have planned against.","We've seen discounting at ranges from as low as 10% to as high as around 80%. The higher discounting is seen in the Nordic tender countries. These are markets where it's winner takes all across the entire TMF category, so includes REMICADE and ENBREL as well. They have a policy of non-medical switching. I'd say they're a bit of an unusual market from that perspective, and that tends to drive deeper discounts.","So I would tell you this level of discounting is not a surprise to us in those markets. It's certainly not unprecedented. We've seen REMICADE tenders in these markets that were fairly early on at 72% discounts, some as high as 75% discount. So this wasn't unexpected at all. They're not a big part of our business. They represent about 4% or 5% of the overall revenue of our international business. And they don't tend to move into the other markets based on any of the experience that we've seen or any of the experience that we've had.","So we now have price points, as I said, for the vast majority of the business, the revenue in the countries. I'm going to characterize it in this way. I think two-thirds of the total revenue internationally I would consider to be locked. Now what do I mean about locked? So you can characterize locked as a country that's still protected, so it still has IP protection, so there is no risk in those countries; a country that has mandated discounting, so the country basically says when biosimilars enter the market, we're going to cut the price of both the innovator and the biosimilar, and they'll both be at the same price point. France is an example of that, and then they just go out and compete in that marketplace. Or it would be a country that has already tendered, and so we know what the pricing is in the tender, we know what our position was in that pricing. So that roughly represents about two-thirds of the overall volume.","There's a third that is still being negotiated. We have pricing in those markets. We have a pretty good idea of where we stand, but there's still an opportunity for some movement in those markets. And so we need probably another month or two for that to be able to play out and for us to have a firm understanding of where the discounting will settle out and where our volumes will settle out.","Now to characterize for you what are we seeing versus what we planned for, I'd say on average the discounting is coming in approximately 10 points higher than what we would have anticipated. So if you go back to the 18% to 20% that we've communicated before as a planning assumption that we had back a year or two ago, if you look at the new calculation, you would put that at 26% to 27%.","Now, I caution you about locking in on that number. I'm only giving it to give you a relative perspective versus where we were. Because obviously that number could move, and in all likelihood, I think it will move some. I don't think it will move dramatically, but I think it will move some. So we factored in all of this pricing that we've already seen. You've seen some of that in our fourth quarter estimates. So you can basically look at that and factor that through 2019 as well. We factored that into all of our estimates, and we factored in further room for more downside. And that's why we're coming back to you and telling you we're absolutely confident we can deliver double digit.","In the fourth quarter call, we'll give you \u2013 at that point we'll have more accurate information on that third that is left, and we'll give you a specific guidance range at that point. But you can assume that it will be double digit as a floor. So hopefully, that gives you some idea of where we stand from a biosimilar standpoint.","To the rest of your question, I think one of the things that is important to keep in perspective here is obviously we'll see some headwinds in our international biosimilar \u2013 or international HUMIRA business based on biosimilars. But fundamentally, the business continues to remain extremely strong. Our U.S. business continues to perform at a very strong rate, including HUMIRA.","Our heme-onc franchise that I described to you in my formal remarks continues to perform extremely strong. And in fact, we're starting to hit the inflection point with VENCLEXTA. With the MURANO data out and the excitement around AML, VENCLEXTA has moved up dramatically in patient starts. And so that will be an important contributor. And then obviously, we have a number of new products that we either have launched or will launch over the course of 2019. ORILISSA is going well, and upadacitinib and risankizumab will both launch in 2019. So I think our prospects going forward look very strong.","Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","The next question is from Jason Gerberry from Bank of America.","Jason M. Gerberry - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats to Bill on retirement. Best of luck in Europe, and it's been a pleasure. Just to follow up, Rick, on the biosimilar erosion commentary on ex-U.S., is that 26% to 27% blended across Europe and ROW markets which may not be impacted or may even be growing? I'm just trying to understand as we think about the impact on 2019, because I know that I think Canada \u2013 I don't think we expect biosimilars in Japan, and Brazil may not be impacted. So could you just provide some clarity there?","And then on U.S. HUMIRA, your confidence and ability to continue to capture mid-single-digit pricing benefit where it seems like the broader industry is migrating to low single digit in the U.S.? Thank you.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Okay. On the biosimilar erosion, I think the best way for you to think about it is it's across the book of the $6.3 billion of business. So it does include countries that are not exposed, so it's a blended rate across those. So it would obviously be higher in the countries that do have biosimilar exposure. And the number \u2013 I don't know, have we ever publicly described what the number is of the protected versus the unprotected?","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Not with any specificity, no.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Okay, then I guess I won't describe that.","On HUMIRA's confidence on price in the U.S., if you look at our HUMIRA business, it's primarily a volume-driven business in the U.S. And I would expect that we will continue, based on all of the contracts that have been negotiated for 2019, that we'll continue with a very similar price fall-through to what we had in 2018. So on the lower end of that mid-single digits is probably a reasonable expectation. So not a tremendous amount of price, but no significant change from what we've had.","Jason M. Gerberry - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thank you.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Jason. Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Josh Schimmer from Evercore ISI.","Joshua Schimmer - Evercore ISI","Thanks for taking the question. Maybe you can discuss your confidence in the outlook for approval of VENCLEXTA in the AML, despite not having a randomized data, as well as if you can quantify that part of the addressable market. Thanks.","Michael E. Severino - AbbVie, Inc.","Sure, this is Mike. I'll take that. So we've had Breakthrough Therapy Designation for AML in the U.S., which gives us good insight into the FDA's thinking on the standard for approval. And when you couple that with the very strong Phase 2 data that we've generated where the combination complete response in something that's called complete response with incomplete hematologic recovery, which is the way the data are looked at in that field, are on the order of about two to three times higher than historical comparators.","It's the strength of that evidence based on \u2013 and that coupled with our understanding of what it's going to take to get approved in the U.S. that gives us confidence.","We also have our Phase 3 studies up and running and well underway. And they're positioned to readout next year, so in 2019. So it's that full picture that gives us that confidence.","In terms of how much of the addressable market that represents, it's a substantial portion. AML tends to have a peak incidence later in life, and up to about half of patients can't undergo intensive induction chemotherapy and then go on to stem cell transplant. And for those patients, there really are very, very limited treatment options. And it's in those very difficult to treat patients that VENCLEXTA has demonstrated the data that I described. So we think that there is a very real opportunity here that will be very important both medically and commercially.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","And maybe to just give a little more color on VENCLEXTA, what we're seeing, because AML is obviously a portion of that, I mean, if you looked at the AML market in total, it's probably a couple of billion dollars. And as Mike said, roughly half of that is addressable, although I will say we are seeing some activity where physicians are pretreating patients prior to induction chemotherapy to get disease activity down. So it could be even larger than half of that population in AML.","As I indicated in my remarks a few moments ago, we are seeing VENCLEXTA take a fairly significant inflection in growth since we released the MURANO data, and I think physicians have become more aware of the AML data. If you actually look at patient starts compared to the first quarter of 2018 and looking at them versus the third quarter of 2018, they're up 73%. So obviously the brand is starting to really grow at a fairly rapid pace. It's at about a $400 million running rate right now and growing rapidly.","So I think you can expect that you'll continue to see very strong growth out of VENCLEXTA, and it will be an important contributor to our oncology growth going forward.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Josh. Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Great, thanks so much for taking the questions. Congrats to you, Bill, for the retirement. And just a couple actually on the margins I guess for you. One, the gross margins this quarter I thought were especially strong. Was there any sort of one-time impact that sort of drove anything there, or anything we should be aware of?","And then the comments from Rick regarding your expectation on biosimilars and sort of that 26%, 27% number, I'm curious how to think about your prior commentary on operating margins. You said 50% operating margin by 2020. Does this sort of change in discounting, you're on the higher end of your planning scenarios, does that impact how you think about what your operating margins might be in that 2020 timeframe? Thanks so much.","William J. Chase - AbbVie, Inc.","Sure. So if you look at the quarter, this is only the first quarter that we've seen the full impact of the termination of HUMIRA royalty that were previously in place. So we're picking up about 160 basis points of favorability related to that royalty reduction. That was the big mover in the quarter.","We also did see some favorable exchange, call that maybe a little under 0.5 point, and then offsetting that going the other way was about 120 basis points related to partnership accounting. As you know, we book the profit that we pass to our partner on IMBRUVICA as a cost of goods sold. So that actually has a dilutive impact on the gross margin line.","So when you add that all up, that's how you get to the number that we saw in the quarter.","In terms of progress towards 2020, look, certainly we're factoring in the biosimilar experience that we're seeing now into our 2019 plan, although I don't have a clear picture yet. Be what I can tell you is, if you look at this quarter, we had very, very strong operating margin growth. We've increased by over 400 basis points on the 47% range. I think that that is the base that you've got to think of us starting to build off of in our inherent run-rate. And then, next year we're going to pick up the benefit of royalty reductions, which ought to be about 170 to 180 basis points.","So we're not going to be there in 2019. We never said we were going to be there in 2019. But when you look at the rapid growth we'd be expecting in 2020 with the pipeline products really moving into full gear, we still remain confident.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Vamil. Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Baum from Citigroup.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thank you, a couple of questions, please. Could you give us some order of the magnitude of the royalties in relation to the settlements in Europe, whether they're meaningful or insignificant?","Second, there have been some recent publications addressing the platelet impact of BTK inhibitors, suggesting that the bleeding that's seen with IMBRUVICA may be a BTK-specific phenomenon, rather than drug-specific (45:44) thinking about CALQUENCE, your competitor, and whether it may not be such a better mousetrap as initially envisaged. And then finally, any update on the Boehringer Ingelheim District Court case? Many thanks \u2013 on HUMIRA.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Andrew, this is Rick. I'll cover one and three. So the magnitude of the settlement royalties, those are all confidential agreements, so I can't speak to the magnitude of those even in a qualitative way. I would just say that they're typical royalties that are associated with the license of important IP.","On the court case for BI, I can tell you we have confidence in our position. We don't fundamentally believe that the essence of what BI is describing is, if you get a large number of patents on a product, that in and of itself is a problem. I don't believe there is case law to support that, nor do I believe that there is evidence that would support that position.","I'd also say the following. Look, we have five settlements now. We have very sophisticated companies who have made a decision based on our IP to do a settlement agreement with us. I think that speaks for itself about the magnitude and the power of our IP, and we remain confident in our position.","Michael E. Severino - AbbVie, Inc.","All right, this is Mike. I'll take the question with respect to BTK inhibitors. It's been our view for quite some time that the bleeding risks that are associated with BTK inhibition are on target, and that BTK specificity from follow-on compounds are therefore not a way to address those risks. The risks are manageable. They are part of the overall benefit\/risk profile of a BTK inhibitor like IMBRUVICA, which is overall very strongly favorable. But that specificity isn't a way around that. And we say that based on our preclinical understanding, and we also say it based on clinical data.","And if you look at a number of follow-on BTKs that have come forward with arguments around putative selectivity, you see the same picture, which is in very early, very small studies, it's very hard to detect these sorts of effects. But as one moves into larger, longer-term trials, a very similar risk\/benefit profile emerges. And I think we've seen that with a number of follow-ons, including CALQUENCE.","So again, we believe that the bleeding effects are part of the benefit\/risk of a BTK inhibitor, that they can be managed effectively, and we believe we have managed them effectively with IMBRUVICA. Obviously, the overall benefit\/risk is strongly positive, but we don't see any advantage in the follow-on BTK inhibitors in that respect.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","And the only thing I'd add there is I think the market data would now support that. I mean, if you look at the relatively small indication that they have in MCL, I think they peaked at market share around 10% \u2013 13%, and now they're declining to some extent. So clearly, the market uptake on the product does not appear to be representative of a product that has differentiation.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Andrew. Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.","Chris Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks very much for the questions. Just coming back to the HUMIRA biosimilar erosion, how predictive do you see this higher 2019 erosion rate to be as we think about longer-term annual erosion for the drug OUS? So beyond 2019, do you think this higher 26% \u2013 27% erosion rate is how we should think about this, or are you viewing 2019 more as an outsized one-time step down, and then a less severe annual impact as you think about 2020 and beyond?","My second question was just on SG&A for 2019. AbbVie stepped up spending this year. Does that put the company's spending at levels that can support these significant upcoming launches, or should we think about another step-up in spending as we look out to 2019? Thank you.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Okay, Chris, this is Rick. I'll take the biosimilar question. I think what we've seen is as the biosimilars entered the market, and it's probably somewhat consistent with the fact that four of them entered basically simultaneously, the pricing has been more aggressive, which all along we've said we would see the biggest impact at launch in that first year, and then it would taper off as we got to the follow-on years. And I think what we've seen play out now only supports that further.","So I think you can expect a much bigger impact in 2019 in the countries that had an impact. And then it will slow as we get into 2020-2021. Now there will be countries that come on in the later years, and they'll experience probably a similar kind of a curve as we enter those markets. So I think that's the way we think about it, and I think it's the best way for the investment community to think about it.","William J. Chase - AbbVie, Inc.","Chris, speaking in absolute dollar terms, we certainly will be putting more money into SG&A next year to support our launches. If you look at the quality of the assets and the importance of the assets to the overall AbbVie growth story, we are not going to do anything that would impede our ability to maximize their ultimate potential.","So from a dollar standpoint, we will certainly be putting money in for both risa and upa. Obviously, a lot of the spend is already in the base for VENCLEXTA and to a degree ORILISSA. However, moving into AML, there will be additional spend there. And ORILISSA, we have not seen this year the startup of the full DTC campaign. So I think you should model increased spending on those assets.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Chris. Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks very much. So I have two questions. So Rick and Bill, I was hoping that you could talk a little bit more about your view on capital allocation. Obviously the company has been quite aggressive with respect to buying back stock and increasing dividend, but it appears that equity investors are more focused on the company's long-term revenue growth and seem to hope for more pipeline enhancement transactions rather than some of the other capital allocation opportunities for the company. So I was just hoping that you could comment on that and how you see that balance?","And then separately, with respect to the 26% to 27% that you mentioned, Rick, could you just clarify? I had thought that the 18% to 20% was over the two-year period, i.e. between 2018 and 2020, so is the 26% to 27% over a two-year period such that you're talking about low teens ex-U.S. HUMIRA sales decline in 2019, and then again in 2020? Or are you talking about a 26% to 27% decline in ex-U.S. HUMIRA sales in 2019? Thanks so much.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Yeah, David. It's Rick. So let me answer number two first. So what I'm describing to you is the level of erosion that we would expect in 2019. It will moderate, but there will be some impact in 2020. You are correct that what we described to you was 18% to 20% over that two-year period of time. So, you're thinking about it the right way. So obviously there's higher levels of erosion. Now, I will say, as I mentioned a moment ago, I think we have seen a deeper discounting strategy out of the blocks. And that will moderate some as we go forward. But I think you should assume that you will see more erosion in 2020 which would obviously raise that number going forward. I don't think it will be dramatic, but I think you will see some impact.","On capital allocation, I think our overall strategy is very similar to what we've operated with for quite some time, and that is that we view returning cash to shareholders as an important strategy. Our dividend we're committed to a growing dividend, and obviously we've demonstrated that again in this call. We view our dividend as our primary vehicle to do that, although we have done some substantial buybacks as we saw the stock at a value that we thought was undervalued. We thought that was an appropriate use of it.","Our first priority is always building the business for the long-term. We're fortunate that we have a strong pipeline, and therefore we can drive significant growth. So we focused a lot of attention on assets that we could bring in that would have an impact in that 2023, 2024, 2025 timeframe which are typically earlier stage, smaller kinds of transactions. But we've been active in that area across the range of areas, oncology being a good example, immunology being a good example. We have done some transactions now in the area of fibrosis, and so we have a pretty active program in that area.","We look at almost everything. We look at small opportunities, medium opportunities, larger opportunities, and we evaluate each of those. It goes through a filter of, first, does it strategically fit, and second, is the value at a point that ultimately we can get a good return on it for our shareholders? And so we evaluate all these opportunities versus that. I don't see a fundamental shift in how we've operated from a capital allocation standpoint though.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, David. Operator, we have time for one final question, please.","Operator","Our final question today is from John Boris from SunTrust.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for taking the questions. So, Rick, just on biotech valuations, we've obviously seen a significant contraction. I think at an investor conference you indicated that you were interested in possibly doing a transaction somewhere in the $20 billion to $30 billion range. Just your thoughts about the environment, at least currently, relative to biotech valuations contracting. Second question on the dissolution or the termination of the royalties, I think, Bill, a third of them went away in 2018. Two-thirds go away in 2019. Can you just give some commentary or quantitatively what the impact is on the 2019 gross margin? Thanks.","William J. Chase - AbbVie, Inc.","So I'll start with that one first, John. So you're exactly right in terms of the gating between 2018 and 2019. I think you should expect next year to pick up about somewhere between 170 to 180 basis points on the gross margin line as a result of those royalties being eliminated.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","On biotech valuations, I guess I'll clarify the $20 billion to $30 billion comment. What I was trying to describe in that meeting was what we viewed as a larger bolt-on, not that we were actively pursuing a transaction in that range. But having said that, if you look regardless of value, if I look at biotech valuations now, although they've come down some, they're still valued pretty highly, and valued in a forward-looking way. And what I mean by that is if you get some early data, you tend to see valuations rise very rapidly in anticipation of future positive data.","But when we look at a transaction, just like everybody else in the industry, you have to evaluate the risk of that data not playing out in a larger study, a later study. And so valuations are still \u2013 for the stage of the product, still have a tendency to get ahead of where the right balance is for the risk reward of a good return. Doesn't mean every single one of them is that way. But I'm talking in generalities now. And certainly all of us continue to look for those opportunities where there's the right value and an exciting opportunity. We have seen some of those that we've brought in, and we'll continue to look for those.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, John.

(NYSE:ABBV) Q2 2014 Earnings Conference Call July 25, 2014  9:00 AM ET","Executives","","Larry Peepo \u2013 VP, IR","Richard Gonzalez \u2013 Chairman and CEO","William Chase \u2013 EVP and CFO","","Operator","Good morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie Second 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen-only. This conference is being recorded by AbbVie.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Larry Peepo, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin sir.","Larry Peepo","Thank you. Good morning and thanks for joining us. On the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Chase, Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer.","Rick will begin by discussing AbbVie\u2019s results from the second quarter and then provide an update on our pipeline and some of the key milestones we expect this year. Bill will give a more detailed review of our quarterly performance and then provide an overview of our 2014 outlook.","As a reminder we are currently operating under the UK takeover code and will be until the Shire transaction is completed. The UK takeover code governs what we are able to disclose regarding the specifics of the transaction as well as the various aspects of AbbVie\u2019s underlying business, including operating performance, product details and pipeline milestones.","To help investors we have added a Q&A section to our earnings news release today which addresses a number of typical questions we receive. Due to the UK takeover code we will only be providing prepared remarks during our conference call today. There will not be a question-and-answer portion of today\u2019s call.","Before I turn the call over to Rick I remind you that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.","Additional information about the factors that may affect AbbVie\u2019s operations is included in our 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law.","On today\u2019s conference call as in the past non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie\u2019s ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our regulatory filings which can be found on our website.","And with that I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Rick.","Richard Gonzalez","Thank you, Larry. Good morning and thank you for joining us this morning. We\u2019re pleased to report a strong second quarter result with adjusted earnings per share of $0.82, exceeding our guidance range for the quarter. This included sales growth of nearly 5% also ahead of our outlook for the quarter despite the positive impact from loss of exclusivity in our lipid franchise.","Sales growth was led by continued robust performance from HUMIRA and other key products including Synthroid, Sevoflurane and Duodopa. We have been pleased with our performance in the first-half of the year and as a reminder last month we raised our full year 2014 earnings per share guidance range to $3.06 to $3.16 on an adjusted basis, reflecting strong underlying business performance.","Beyond our strong financial performance we had a very productive second quarter with a number of important pipeline advancements, clinical trial results and other strategic activities. We submitted our U.S. and EU regulatory applications for interferon-free HCV combination. Both applications are currently under active priority review. We continue to anticipate U.S. approval later this year and EMA authorization in early 2015. We are also working to advance our Next-Generation HCV assets which are currently in Phase 2 development. We expect data from the Phase 2\/b program in 2015 and plan to start Phase 3 development next year as well.","We have also made progress with several assets in our oncology pipeline. At the recent ASCO and EHA meetings we presented interim-results from our Phase 1 clinical trial of ABT-199 our BCL-2 inhibitor in combination with Rituxan in relapsed refractory CLL patients. The data showed an overall response rate of 84% and a complete response of 36% which compares favorably to trial results from other therapies in this patient population. This combination is being investigated in an ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of relapsed refractory CLL.","We are also evaluating ABT-199 in a variety of other cancer types including AML. We expect to present data from the AML study at an upcoming medical meeting. Also at ASCO AbbVie released preliminary results from an ongoing Phase 1 study of ABT-414 an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody drug conjugate used in combination with chemotherapy. The study showed a level of response not typically seen in patients with recurrent or unresectable GBM. GBM is the most common and most aggressive type of malignant primary brain tumor. Patients currently have few treatment options and the five year survival rate for this type of cancer is less than 3%. We are working quickly to advance ABT-414.","We recently announce the initiation of a Phase 3 study of our PARP inhibitor ABT-888 in patients with HER2 negative breast cancer containing BRCA gene mutations. The start of this trial follows initiation of Phase 3 clinical work in two other settings; non-small cell cancer and neoadjuvant treatment of triple negative breast cancer. This fall we will present data from the mid-stage trial on lung cancer that supported our decision to advance the Phase 3 development. We have a number of other mid-stage trials that we expect to read out in the coming months.","In June we announced positive top line results from our Phase 3 daclizumab study. It demonstrated that patients treated with daclizumab had a statistically significant 45% reduction in annualized relapsed rates versus on active comparator. We are excited about these results and we are in the process of working with our partner to complete our global regulatory application.","In our immunology pipeline we recently advanced two bispecific DVDs in to Phase 2 development; ABT-122 for RA and ABT-981 for OA. Additionally, we continue to make progress on our selective JAK-1 inhibitor programs. We recently initiated a second Phase 2 trial in RA with our internal JAK-1 compound ABT-494 and we look forward to seeing data from the Phase 2\/b Galapagos collaboration early next year.","Since becoming an independent company 18 months ago AbbVie has built a strong and sustainable strategy for the business. Last week we announced an important step in taking that strategy to the next level, the proposed merger with Shire. The combination of AbbVie and Shire represent a compelling opportunity to create a new world-class biopharmaceutical company. The combined company would have leadership positions within multiple important areas of medicine, a deeper and broader pipeline and greater access to its global cash flows. This transaction offers significant strategic and financial benefits for our respective shareholders and companies as well as the patients that we serve. The combined company would be larger more diversified company with significant financial capacity for future strategic investment.","Additionally the proposed combination offers an opportunity for enhanced shareholder return of capital and shareholder value creation. We\u2019re currently seeking the relevant approvals for the transaction and are working towards our stated goal of closing in the fourth quarter of 2014.","In summary we\u2019re very pleased with the strong performance we\u2019ve had in the first half of 2014. In the second quarter we saw strong performance across our portfolio, including double-digit growth from Humira, We made significant progress advancing our pipeline and expect a number of additional milestones over the next six to nine months. And with the recent agreement to merge with Shire I believe we\u2019ve taken an important strategic action to enhance our position as a world class biopharmaceutical company.","With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill. Bill?","William Chase","Thank you Rick. This morning I\u2019ll review our second quarter performance and provide an update on our outlook for the remainder of 2014. As Rick said we are very pleased with our results this quarter. We exceeded our guidance on both the top and bottom line. Total sales increased 4.8% on an operational basis, excluding 0.2% favorable impact from foreign exchange.","Excluding sales from our lipid franchise, due to loss of exclusivity total sales increased 12.3% on an operational basis. Humira delivered global sales of nearly $3.3 billion, up 25.4% on an operational basis and 26.2% on a reported basis. In the United States Humira sales increased 35.6% driven by continued market expansion, share gains and particularly strong growth in the gastro segment.","Growth in the second quarter also benefited from retail buying patterns and a favorable comparison to the prior year. Second quarter wholesaler inventory levels remain at roughly two weeks consistent with the first quarter. We expect third quarter Humira sales growth in the U.S. to be reflective of underlying product demand and pricing trends, partially offset by a reduction in retail buying patterns. As a result we are forecasting high teens growth in the U.S. for Humira in the third quarter.","Internationally Humira sales grew 16.2% on an operational basis and 17.8% on a reported basis. International growth continues to be driven by the uptake of new indications, share gains and double digit market growth in most markets. Performance in the quarter also benefited modestly from the timing of international shipments. We are forecasting low double digit growth for Humira internationally in the third quarter driven by strong underlying trends, partially offset by the timing of shipments in international markets. On a global basis we continue to expect double digit sales growth for Humira in 2014.","AndroGel sales were $218 million, down 15.6% from the prior year quarter. We continue to see a notable slowdown in the market with overall prescriptions down more than 20% in recent months. We expect these market trends to continue.","U.S. sales of Synthroid were $166 million, up 8.7% year-over-year. Synthroid maintain strong brand loyalty and market leadership despite the entry of generics into the market many years ago. The overall market has experienced low-single digit growth with Synthroid growth outpacing the market including product pricing trends.","U.S. CREON sales were $110 million in the quarter, up 4.1%. CREON maintains its leadership position in the pancreatic enzyme market where the product continues to capture the vast majority of new prescription starts. Global Lupron sales were $186 million in the quarter, down 5.2% on an operational basis. Lupron continues to hold a leadership position and maintain significant share of the market. Performance this quarter is roughly in line with our full year expectation and is also consistent with recent market trends.","Sales of Synagis were $74 million in the second quarter up 16.3% on an operational basis. Synagis which protects at risk infants from severe respiratory disease is a seasonal product with the majority of sales in the first and fourth quarters of the year. Growth in the quarter was driven by continued product uptake and strong commercial execution. Sales of Duodopa our therapy for advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease approved in Europe and other international markets were $56 million, up 24.2% on an operational basis this quarter. Performance in the quarter is in line with recent trends as well as our full year outlook for the product.","And sales of Niaspan and TriCor \/Trilipix were both down significantly due to generic competition. We expect these trends to continue for the remainder of 2014.","I will now turn to the P&L profile for the second quarter. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 79.6% in line with our expectations. This reflects loss of exclusivity in our lipid franchise offset by favorable mix impacts across the portfolio and margin enhancing initiatives we\u2019ve implemented. Adjusted R&D was 16.1% of sales in the second quarter. R&D spending was up sequentially over the first quarter as we increased funding of our mid and late stage pipeline assets and additional Humira indications.","Adjusted SG&A was 27.1% of sales in the second quarter. As expected SG&A spending increased from the first quarter, reflecting continued investment on our growth brands and preparations for our upcoming HCV launch. Net interest expense was $69 million and the adjusted tax rate was 22.2% in the quarter. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share, excluding non-cash amortization expense and specified items were $0.82 exceeding our previous guidance range of $0.75 to $0.77. On a GAAP basis earnings per share were $0.68.","Moving on to our outlook for the remainder of 2014, for the full year we are confirming our recently increased adjusted earnings per share guidance of $3.06 to $3.16. For the third quarter we expect adjusted earnings per share of $0.77 to $0.79. We are forecasting low to mid-single digit operational sales growth in both the third and fourth quarters of 2014. As a reminder our 2014 outlook excludes any potential revenue from the expected 2014 U.S. launch of our HCV therapy.","We expect the third quarter gross margin ratio to be approximately 79%. For the fourth quarter the ratio is expected to be somewhat lower than the third quarter driven by product mix particularly an increase in lower margin Synagis sales.","As noted on our fourth quarter earnings call in January we are forecasting a higher level of SG&A expense in 2014 driven primarily by investments we are making for the upcoming launch of our HCV regimen in the U.S. and Europe. For the third quarter we expect a modest sequential increase in absolute SG&A expense from the second quarter.","For the fourth quarter given the proximity of the U.S. HCV launch we\u2019d expect a more meaningful sequential increase in absolute SG&A expense from the third quarter level. This has been reflected in our recently increased adjusted earnings per share guidance. We currently have a significant number of Phase 3 programs in active development including exciting opportunities in oncology, HCV immunology and other areas that warrant investment. As a result we expect R&D expense to be above 16% of sales for the full year 2014 reflecting a meaningful increase in the spending over the prior year.","For the third quarter we expect a sequential increase in absolute R&D investment from the second quarter level. For the fourth quarter we are forecasting a more modest sequential increase from the third quarter level. This has been reflected in our recently increased adjusted earnings per share guidance. So overall we\u2019re pleased with our strong quarter performance in the second quarter as well as our outlook for the remainder of 2014. And with that I\u2019ll turn it back over to Larry.","Larry Peepo","Thanks Bill. And that concludes today\u2019s conference call.

These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions.","So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick.","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, I'll briefly discuss our fourth quarter performance, and our 2015 operational highlights. Mike will then provide updates on recent advancements across our R&D programs, and Bill will discuss the quarter, and our 2016 guidance in more detail. As always following our remarks, we'll take your questions.","We delivered another strong performance in the fourth quarter, with results ahead of our expectations, including adjusted earnings per share of $1.13, representing growth of 27% versus the fourth quarter of 2014. Our fourth quarter performance caps off a very strong year for AbbVie, with sales and earnings well above our original projections for the year. We delivered 22% global operational sales growth in 2015, and we increased ongoing earnings per share by more than 29%.","We've driven strong commercial, operational, and R&D execution, resulting in industry-leading performance, with both strong revenue growth and improvement in our operating margin profile. AbbVie's EPS growth for 2015 ranks us among the top growth companies in our industry.","Clearly, 2015 was a year of excellent performance. We delivered outstanding results from our current portfolio, with strong growth from HUMIRA, which drove 19% global operational growth in 2015, including U.S. growth of nearly 29%, and international operational growth of 8.6%. We saw continued strong momentum from IMBRUVICA, with full year 2015 sales in excess of $1 billion.","Global VIEKIRA performance, although below our original expectations, generated more than $1.6 billion in its first year on the market and we had strong performance from other products in our portfolio including Creon, LUPRON, and DUODOPA.","Over the past year, we've seen significant pipeline advancement and achieved a number of important development and regulatory milestones. We secured approvals for several assets including HUMIRA as a treatment for HS, our once-daily HCV combination in Japan, and our partner received approval for elotuzumab for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.","We successfully completed registrational studies and submitted regulatory applications for a number of programs including venetoclax for relapsed refractory CLL, IMBRUVICA for first-line CLL, ZINBRYTA for multiple sclerosis and HUMIRA for uveitis. We successfully completed mid-stage clinical trials and transitioned into the registration enabling phase of development for several key programs including our selective JAK1 inhibitor, ABT-494 in RA, our pan-genotypic next-generation HCV combination Elagolix for uterine fibroids and ABT-414, our antibody drug conjugate for glioblastoma multiforme.","We also reported compelling data from several development programs including Elagolix pivotal data in endometriosis, the HELIOS and RESONATE-2 IMBRUVICA data which we anticipate will be reflected in the product label this year and venetoclax data in several cancer types including robust results in CLL and AML.","In fact, the data we presented on venetoclax this year has resulted in three breakthrough therapy designations, a status granted by the FDA when clinical evidence indicates that a medicine may demonstrate a substantial improvement over existing therapies. We believe venetoclax has significant potential across a wide range of blood cancers with the first of potentially numerous indications coming in the first half of this year.","The progress we've made with our pipeline including the impressive data we've shared over the past year has further increased our level of confidence and de-risked many of our key R&D programs. Numerous assets in our late-stage pipeline have the opportunity to generate multibillion dollar peak-year sales and represent an opportunity for meaningful revenue growth in the years to come.","2016 promises to be another milestone filled year with significant activity across our pipeline which Mike will discuss in more detail here in just a few moments. In 2015, we also augmented our portfolio and our pipeline through strategic licensing and acquisition activity. The acquisition of Pharmacyclics provided a major new growth platform in a key strategic area, hematological oncology. IMBRUVICA which is now a blockbuster therapy offer significant growth potential towards existing and expanding list of indications and lines of therapy. We remain excited about the potential for IMBRUVICA and we are pleased that our thesis is playing out as we expected.","Within the hematological oncology segment, we have invested strategically to build a portfolio of medicines with the potential to transform the care of a large range of malignancies. Our portfolio includes three novel mechanisms of action; BTK inhibition, Bcl-2 inhibition; PI3 kinase dual inhibition.","These mechanisms are either on market, under regulatory review, or in registration enabling trials. We're well positioned to build upon our leadership in this category with unique combinations of these and other agents.","Over the past year, we've delivered a strong return of capital to our investors, including a rapidly growing dividend, which is growing 42% since our inception, as well as share repurchase. We remain committed to a balanced capital allocation strategy, returning cash to shareholders while continuing to add strategically to our pipeline.","Following our acquisition of Pharmacyclics last year, our focus in the near-term is on continuing to augment our therapeutic areas of focus especially oncology and immunology. We evaluate opportunities that fit our strategic criteria and can deliver strong returns.","In 2015, we also drove improved efficiency across our operations, delivering significant operating margin expansion while continuing to invest in R&D and SG&A to drive future growth. We have delivered a significant level of margin expansion to-date, and we remain committed to doing more to improve our operating margin profile going forward. Our focus on operating efficiencies will drive our adjusted operating margin profile to greater than 50% by 2020.","We've entered 2016 with strong momentum which we intend to build upon to drive a high level of performance across our operations and strong growth. Our full-year 2016 EPS guidance of $4.90 to $5.10 represents growth of 16.5% at the midpoint, positioning AbbVie to be among the industry leaders for EPS growth once again this year.","On our third quarter conference call, we outlined our long-term guidance for a number of key metrics including our expectations for top and bottom line growth and margin expansion over our five-year plan. We remain committed to delivering on these long-term objectives which will generate double-digit EPS growth on average through 2020.","So, in summary, we're pleased with our strong execution and significant advancements we made in 2015. Over the past year, we've demonstrated a strong track record of success with positive clinical data and regulatory outcomes, and we look forward to numerous important pipeline milestones in the year ahead.","We've consistently delivered on our commitments and are positioned for another year of strong growth. We've built a strong foundation, and we're focused on generating top-tier financial performance in the years to come.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on R&D programs. Mike?","Michael E. Severino - Executive Vice President, Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer","Thank you, Rick. In 2015, we significantly advanced and de-risked our pipeline and achieved a number of important regulatory milestones. And we expect 2016 to be a very productive year as well with a potential for several regulatory submissions and approvals, key data readouts, and phase transitions. We have a broad pipeline that includes more than 50 active clinical development programs including more than 20 new products or indications in late stage development or under regulatory review. Today, I'll highlight recent updates and discuss some of the milestones we anticipate in the year to come.","I'll start with hematologic oncology, an area where we have invested heavily and are uniquely positioned. As Rick mentioned, we have built a strategic portfolio of assets including multiple mechanisms of action that have significant potential alone and in combination. The development program for our flagship oncology product, IMBRUVICA, continues to progress nicely. Our next opportunity for label expansion is in the first line CLL setting.","Data from the RESONATE-2 trial in treatment-na\u00efve CLL patients recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed treatment with IMBRUVICA resulted in an 84% reduction in the risk of disease progression versus chlorambucil with 87% of patients remaining on single agent IMBRUVICA treatment at 18 months. Additionally, treatment with IMBRUVICA showed an 84% reduction in overall mortality.","We believe RESONATE-2 represents a practice-changing study that will set a new treatment standard for many treatment-na\u00efve patients. We submitted a supplemental new drug application to the FDA which is currently under priority review and we anticipate approval in the first half of 2016.","IMBRUVICA is also being evaluated in mid to late stage trials in follicular lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, multiple myeloma, graft versus host disease and pancreatic cancer.","At the recent ASH meeting, 65 IMBRUVICA-related abstracts were presented, including data from several studies and potential new indications. And there is potential for data flow and possible regulatory submissions this year for several indications including treatment-na\u00efve mantle-cell lymphoma, relapsed\/refractory follicular lymphoma, and treatment na\u00efve diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, with timing dependent on event-driven analyses of ongoing studies.","In the area of immuno-oncology, ongoing trials evaluating IMBRUVICA in combination with checkpoint inhibitors are progressing well, with a potential to see proof-of-concept data in solid tumors over the course of the year.","Another important strategic asset in our oncology portfolio is venetoclax, our novel BCL-2 inhibitor, which has demonstrated strong efficacy, achieving deep levels of response and durable disease control, both as monotherapy and in combination with Rituxan in patients with relapsed\/refractory CLL. Venetoclax is currently under priority review for relapsed\/refractory CLL, including patients whose tumors harbored the 17p deletion mutation. And we expect FDA action in the first half of 2016.","At ASH, we presented data in the relapsed\/refractory CLL patients in combination with Rituxan, showing an overall response rate of 86% and a complete response rate of 47%. Additionally, minimal residual disease negativity in the bone marrow was observed in 55% of all patients treated with the combination.","We're very encouraged by the depth of the responses driven by combination therapy in this patient population. Based on these data, earlier this month the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation for venetoclax when used in combination with Rituxan.","We also believe BCL-2 will be effective in other hematologic malignancies. We recently presented encouraging venetoclax data in treatment na\u00efve AML patients over 65 years of age who are ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy. The early data showed combination treatment with venetoclax and hypomethylating agents resulted in complete response rate of approximately 71%, which is roughly double the response rate that would be expected with the current standard of care.","And based on these promising results, earlier this week the FDA granted the third venetoclax breakthrough therapy designation. We are moving expeditiously into registrational trials for this indication.","In addition to IMBRUVICA and venetoclax, we are developing a dual PI-3-kinase inhibitor, Duvelisib, currently in late-stage development. In collaboration with our partner, Infinity, we'll see data on Duvelisib in relapsed\/refractory NHL and CLL in the second half of the year with potential regulatory submissions to follow.","We're well positioned to continue to evolve the treatment landscape in CLL and other blood cancers by exploring novel combinations including the programs in our pipeline and other mechanisms with the goal to achieve deep, durable disease control and\/or remissions while reducing or eliminating the use of toxic chemotherapy.","To that end, we have numerous combination trials underway or starting n 2016. This includes our Phase III study of a chemotherapy-free combination of venetoclax and Gazyva in first-line unfit CLL patients. This study is underway and enrolling well. A large Phase III study is being initiated in collaboration with the German CLL working group to evaluate treatment with venetoclax in combination with a variety of therapies including Gazyva and IMBRUVICA in previously untreated, fit CLL patients.","This study, which we expect to initiate midyear, will assess the ability of venetoclax-based combinations to drive achievement of minimal residual disease, which has been associated with improved survival in CLL patients.","To augment ongoing investigator-sponsored and collaborative group studies evaluating venetoclax and ibrutinib combinations, we are designing company-sponsored studies to evaluate the combination in first line CLL patients. In addition, AbbVie and Genentech are finalizing plans to pursue registrational studies evaluating combinations of venetoclax with proteasome inhibitors in multiple myeloma and, as I mentioned previously, in combination with hypomethylating agents in AML.","Finally, we are preparing to initiate a dose finding study evaluating venetoclax and Duvelisib in patients with a variety of hematologic malignancies.","In addition to our work in hematologic oncology, we have also been investing in a number of programs for the treatment of solid tumors, including our PARP inhibitor, veliparib, with five Phase III studies underway in lung, breast and ovarian cancer, and ABT-414, which is in development for glioblastoma multiforme, or GBM.","GBM is the most common and most aggressive type of malignant primary brain tumor. Previously reported interim results from a Phase I clinical trial of ABT-414 showed that roughly 25% of patients with EGFR amplification or the B3 variant treated with ABT-414 in addition to standard of care achieved an objective response. These results illustrate a level of efficacy not typically seen in this difficult to treat cancer where historic data of response rates in our refractory population have been less than 10%.","Later this year, we'll see additional data for ABT-414 and second-line GBM. If the data are consistent with the earlier studies, these trials could represent a path to a regulatory submission in the second half of 2016. In parallel, larger randomized comparative registrational trials are ongoing in first and second-line GBM.","We also have an active program focused on driving the next wave of immuno-oncology development beyond checkpoint inhibitors. We recently entered into a collaboration with MD Anderson Cancer Center focused on the discovery and development of new immuno-oncology therapies.","Through this agreement, we're pairing MD Anderson's cutting edge pre-clinical translational and clinical capabilities with our strength in biology, protein engineering and chemistry with a goal to accelerate the development of new medicines. We anticipate a number of immuno-oncology assets moving into the clinic this year and we look forward to sharing more details on our strategy in this area at our R&D Day in June.","Moving on to immunology, our strategy is centered upon identifying treatments that offer differentiated profiles relative to currently available therapies with a goal of continuing to raise the standard of care. We have multiple mid and late stage pipeline assets with best-in-class potential. In late 2015, we initiated a Phase III program in rheumatoid arthritis for our selective JAK-1 inhibitor, ABT-494, following positive results from our mid-stage clinical trials.","We are particularly excited about the results of ABT-494 in a difficult-to-treat population, anti-TNF inadequate responders, a growing segment of the RA market. Results from the BALANCE-I trial in this patient population recently presented at ACR illustrate the agent's potential to be a best-in-class therapy with ACR20 responses up to 73% and ACR50 responses up to 44%.","Additional data from our Phase II program will be presented over the course of 2016 and we expect to commercialize ABT-494 in 2019. We also have additional immunology candidates in development and we'll see mid-stage data from multiple programs in 2016.","Finally, in immunology, we continue to innovate with HUMIRA. Last year, we received the EU and U.S. approval for a new formulation of HUMIRA. Additionally, we have submitted regulatory applications for an improved HUMIRA Pen device. And our U.S. and European regulatory applications for uveitis are currently under review with decisions expected in the second half of this year.","Moving now to virology where our goal is to develop a next-generation asset that offers high cure rate in ribavirin and ritonavir-free regimen. Mid-stage data indicate that our new pan-genotypic combination can deliver cure rates approaching 100%. And we believe the majority of patients will be well-served with an eight week treatment option.","Late last year, we initiated a comprehensive registrational program including six global Phase III studies. We'll start to see data from our registrational trials later this year. And this combination is poised for commercial entry next year.","In neurology, we're focused on therapies for the treatment of conditions like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's, MS, and other neuro-degenerative conditions. ZINBRYTA is our first in class investigational biologic for relapse-remitting multiple sclerosis which is currently under regulatory review in the U.S. and Europe with the regulatory decisions expected in the first half of 2016.","The filings are based upon strong pivotal trial results which demonstrated patients treated with ZINBRYTA had a statistically significant 45% reduction in annualized relapse rates versus AVONEX, an established standard of care.","Given the product profile, novel mechanism of action and its once monthly subcutaneous administration, we believe ZINBRYTA has the potential to be an important therapeutic option. Last year, we entered into a collaboration with C2N Diagnostics to develop and commercialize a portfolio of anti-tau antibodies for the treatment of serious neuro-degenerative disorders. Last year, we initiated a Phase I program in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy, and we remain on track to start clinical development with C2N in Alzheimer's disease in 2016.","Finally, Elagolix is our compound in Phase III development for endometriosis and uterine fibroids. Our goal with Elagolix in endometriosis is to bring to market an oral therapy that provides a high level of efficacy, with minimal menopausal side effects such as hot flush while preserving bone health.","We reported positive results from our first pivotal trial in endometriosis last year, and plan to report top line results from the second pivotal study in the first quarter of 2016. We also plan to present more detailed findings from both registrational trials at the ASRM Meeting in October. We also recently initiated a Phase III program investigating the effect of Elagolix on bleeding related to uterine fibroids.","So in summary, we continue to make significant progress with our pipeline, and are on track to advance several programs in 2016. We've built a promising late-stage pipeline comprised of potentially transformational medicines, which will fuel our future growth. We look forward to covering our full pipeline in more detail, and an R&D pipeline review to be held in Chicago during the 2016 ASCO Meeting in June. We hope you will join us.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on the quarter, and our 2016 guidance. Bill.","William J. Chase - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Mike. This morning, I'll share with you the highlights of our full-year 2015 performance, provide an overview of our fourth quarter results, and then walk through our outlook for 2016. We had a strong performance in 2015, allowing us to raise our full-year EPS guidance range twice during the year and ultimately deliver sales, margin expansion, and earnings projections that exceeded our original expectations.","For the full-year 2015, adjusted net revenues were $22.8 billion, up 22% on an operational basis. We expanded our adjusted operating margin profile to 42.3% in 2015, up 610 basis points for the year. And as Rick mentioned, we reported adjusted earnings per share results of $4.29, up more than 29% for the year.","Turning to the fourth quarter, total adjusted sales were $6.4 billion, up more than 24% on an operational basis. Unfavorable impacts from foreign exchange rate fluctuations reduced sales growth in the quarter by 6%.","HUMIRA delivered global sales of $3.8 billion in the quarter, up 16% operationally excluding the impact of foreign exchange. In the U.S., HUMIRA sales were more than $2.3 billion, increasing nearly 21%, reflecting exceptional growth across all three major categories: rheumatology, gastro and dermatology.","Internationally, HUMIRA sales were nearly $1.4 billion in the quarter, up a strong 9.7% on an operational basis excluding an unfavorable impact from exchange. Global HUMIRA sales for the full-year 2015 were $14 billion, up 19.1% operationally versus the prior year. International HUMIRA sales in 2015 increased 8.6% on an operational basis.","Global IMBRUVICA net revenues were $343 million in the quarter. U.S. sales were $295 million and our international profit sharing was $48 million. Since the closing of the Pharmacyclics acquisition on May 26, IMBRUVICA has driven $754 million of new revenue for AbbVie, and we are pleased with its progress. A significant portion of our valuation for Pharmacyclics is attributed to advancing in the first-line therapy in treatment na\u00efve CLL patients and the submission of the strong RESONATE-2 data to the FDA this quarter bodes well for this assumption.","Global VIEKIRA sales in the fourth quarter were $554 million. The international launch has exceeded our planning expectations resulting in a higher mix of international sales again this quarter. As expected, VIEKIRAX, our two-drug, once-daily ribavirin-free combination for the treatment of genotype 1b in Japan launched late in the fourth quarter.","Global sales of DUODOPA, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease grew 24.4% on an operational basis in the quarter. We saw continued double-digit growth internationally for DUODOPA with a modest level of U.S. sales as expected. Global DUODOPA sales for the full-year 2015 were $231 million, up 23.5% operationally versus the prior year.","Global Creon sales were $185 million, up 22.8%. Full-year sales of Creon were $632 million, up 22.5% versus 2014. Creon maintains its leadership position in the pancreatic enzyme market with roughly 70% share. Global LUPRON sales were $235 million in the fourth quarter, up 15.6% on an operational basis. For the full year, global LUPRON sales were $826 million, up 9.3% exceeding our expectations. LUPRON continues to hold the leadership position and maintains significant share of the market.","Turning to the P&L profile for the fourth quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 80.5%, excluding amortization and other specified items.","Excluding the impact of Pharmacyclics, we saw a nearly 100-basis improvement year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, adjusted R&D was 15.9% of sales, and adjusted SG&A was 23.9% of sales, contributing to continued improvement in our operating margin profile. Operating margin in the quarter was 40.1% of sales compared to 35.8% in the fourth quarter of 2014.","Adjusting for the negative impacts of foreign exchange and the acquisition of Pharmacyclics, operating margin increased by 540 basis points. As a reminder, the fourth quarter margin profile is generally the lowest of any quarter during the year. This reflects seasonal product mix impacts from higher sales of products like SYNAGIS, a lower-margin partnered product.","Net interest expense was $199 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 21.6% in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $1.13, excluding non-cash amortization expense and specified items. On a GAAP basis, we posted EPS of $0.92.","As we look ahead to 2016, we are confirming our previously issued full-year adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.90 to $5.10. This guidance excludes $0.42 per share of non-cash amortization and non-cash Pharmacyclics acquisition impacts, as well as $0.03 per share of other specifieds. On the top line, we expect mid-teens revenue growth on an operational basis, excluding roughly 2% negative impact from exchange.","Included in our top line guidance, our assumptions for our key products as follows: HUMIRA has averaged well over $1 billion of annual growth for a number of years. In 2016, we expect HUMIRA to once again be an important contributor to our performance with high-teens growth expected in the U.S.","Internationally, we are forecasting mid-single-digit operational growth, reflecting the latest market dynamics including the launch of a biosimilar for Enbrel. For IMBRUVICA, we expect revenues to AbbVie of at least $1.8 billion. We anticipate global VIEKIRA sales of approximately $2 billion for the year. This level of sales includes significant international growth with a full year's of sales in Japan.","We expect continued double-digit growth for DUODOPA, including an increased U.S. sales contribution. As mentioned on previous calls, we anticipate a gradual ramp for product sales in the U.S. as physicians continue to get more familiar with the product.","For SYNAGIS, we expect mid-single-digit operational growth in 2016. Regarding AndroGel, we're forecasting 2016 sales of roughly $500 million. For Creon, we expect high-single-digit sales growth. For LUPRON and Synthroid, we expect sales to be roughly flat year-over-year. And we expect declines in several products with continued lipid franchise erosion as well as negative market trends in HIV and other mature products.","Turning back to the P&L for 2016, we are forecasting an adjusted gross margin ratio approaching 82%. We are forecasting R&D expense above 15% of sales and we expect to see sales leverage with SG&A levels at approximately 23% of sales, well below the 24.6% booked in 2015.","As a result, in 2016, we are forecasting an increase in our operating margin profile of 100 basis points, reflecting ongoing initiatives and sales leverage. Excluding year-over-year impacts of foreign exchange and Pharmacyclics, this operating margin improvement would exceed 300 basis points. We are forecasting net interest expense of about $800 million for the full year, and we expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 21% to 22% in 2016.","Regarding our first quarter outlook, we expect adjusted earnings per share in the quarter of $1.13 to $1.15. This guidance reflects growth of approximately 21% at the midpoint. Our first quarter adjusted EPS guidance excludes roughly $0.11 of non-cash amortization and specified items.","We are forecasting revenue growth in the first quarter just above 20%, excluding roughly 4% negative exchange. While our full-year outlook for international HUMIRA growth is mid-single digits, in the first quarter, we anticipate an operational international growth rate of 3%. This is the direct result of a difficult comparison to the prior-year quarter where we posted a 15% increase for the brand due to shipment timing.","So, as we look back, we're very pleased with AbbVie's performance in our first three years as an independent company. In 2015, we delivered sales, margin expansion, and earnings well above our original outlook, and we expect to build on that momentum in 2016 with industry-leading growth and an exciting pipeline.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry.","Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Bill, we'll now open the call for questions. Sheryl, we'll take our first question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","All right, sir. Thank you. Our first question comes from Mr. Chris Schott of JPMorgan. Sir, your line is open.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much and thanks for the questions.","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","First one here, just any perspective on the recent Amgen IPR decision on your formulation patent and what that means for HUMIRA. And maybe while we're talking about IP, maybe \u2013 any touch as well on the Coherus and BI filings on your dosing patents. That will be my first question. Second one, the mid-single digit growth for international HUMIRA, can you just elaborate a little bit more on the drivers and assumptions there. Specifically, what are you anticipating in terms of pricing or volume competition when we think about biosimilar Remicade and Enbrel? Thanks so much.","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Hi, Chris. It's Rick. So, I'll cover those two. Let me do the HUMIRA one first. So, as we mentioned in our previous call, we are anticipating that we will see indirect biosimilar competition outside the U.S. meaning Enbrel biosimilars outside the U.S. this year. So, if you think about our growth rate, we finished this year internationally at about 8.6% and we're guiding for next year at about mid-single digits.","And you can break it up into sort of two components. One would be obviously as the brand gets a little bit bigger, the growth rate as a percentage is slowing down a bit. And then we have built in what are a set of assumptions of what kind of price impact we might see from Enbrel in certain markets, particularly in Europe I would say. And that represents about 2% of our growth. So you can think of it coming down about 2% based on that. So that's the HUMIRA piece.","On the Amgen IPR and the other IPRs, I think in general across all of the litigation aspects of HUMIRA, I think it's important to recognize that we have now entered a new phase of our biosimilar strategy. And in our third quarter call, we laid out a detailed explanation of our patent estate in an effort to really provide the investment community with a comprehensive set of information around the IP and what we thought the litigation timelines would look like going forward.","What I can tell you is nothing has changed from that assessment. We still believe in everything that we've described to you as part of that. But now we're in the active litigation process with other players, whether that be IPR litigation or other kind of litigation that will start to play out. And it's just not prudent for us to lay out for the world a play-by-play analysis of our positions around this. That's just not the \u2013 that's not the smart thing to do from a litigation standpoint.","So what I'd tell you is I'd reiterate the points that we made before. We have a large, robust portfolio of IP. We have done significant work from an innovation standpoint in this area, and we have prosecuted all of this IP based on the work that we've done and the investment that we've made, and we feel good about the IP in our portfolio.","And as we've said before, we intend to vigorously defend our IP, and this is going to need to play out over time. We're certainly pleased with the decision of the patent office, but we're not going to basically do a play-by-play on this because that potentially could jeopardize our position.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Thanks very much.","Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Chris. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ms. Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs. Ma'am, you're line is open.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. I just want to talk about U.S. HUMIRA sales this past quarter. I guess, 20% or 21% was a bit below consensus expectations. If you look at volume growth and price contribution, that should have led to slightly higher growth. I'm wondering if you can talk about what is happening to net price increases, are they sticking? And with respect to your high-teens guidance for U.S. HUMIRA sales in 2016, what again are your assumptions for price? Thanks very much.","Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Jami.","William J. Chase - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Jami. It's Bill. Look, I think we've seen spectacular growth numbers out of HUMIRA in the U.S. all year long, and certainly Q4, 21% isn't a bad number. And if you look at the market, TRx growth right now in the quarter was about 13%. From an inventory standpoint sequentially quarter versus quarter, it stayed roughly flat at a little less than half a month.","But one thing that is impacting this number is we had slightly higher inventory numbers in the channel in Q4 2014. And if you adjust that out, it pretty much gets you back to where guidance had us. So we haven't seen anything on this brand that would lead us to pause and restate our expectations. And as I said in the call, in my comments, we're expecting high-teens growth, so it's going very well.","From price perspective, it's normal for these sorts of products to take price increases towards the end of the year or the beginning of the year. We certainly have done that at the beginning of the year. So there is going to be a price dynamic on HUMIRA in 2016, and we want to see how things pan out as the year progresses above and beyond that.","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And Jami, this is Rick. The only thing I would add is much like the discussion we had last quarter about international third quarter, if you look at our ordering or if you look at our growth rate patterns over the last several years, what you'll see is typically fourth quarter is a little bit lower from a growth standpoint. But I think what you're asking is are we seeing any kind of a slowdown in the U.S.; we're not. The U.S. is performing very robustly. We guided, I think, at the beginning of this year to about the same number, high teens, and obviously overachieved that. So I mean, we feel very good about the performance going forward with HUMIRA.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Jami.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Marc Goodman of UBS. Sir, your line is open.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Yes. Good morning. You mentioned the HUMIRA price increase which was like 10-ish%. How much of that is actually flowing through to the bottom line this year that you project and how has that changed as far as the growth scenario in the past couple of years?","And then second, if you could talk about hepatitis C a little bit. Obviously, the U.S., there's one dynamic and obviously with Merck coming in, they got approved. They set their pricing last night. If you could comment on that.","And then secondly, if you could talk about Japan, where we are and how it's doing. I know you didn't have a lot of Japan in the quarter, but now it's been a good month and a half later. So, maybe you could just give us a sense for how Japan is doing in the ramp and how much Japan is going to be a piece of that O-U.S. this year.","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. So, let me take the HUMIRA price piece. I understand all of the focus on price. I mean, I think all of us in this industry recognize all of the headlines we've seen around price and I think an important perspective to step back and think about for our business. This is not a business that is highly dependent upon price, our business I'm talking about. So if you look at our operational growth in 2015 of 22%, only 2% of that was price across the business. And if you look at HUMIRA, roughly around 25% of the overall growth is driven by price.","Now, you do have certain managed care contracts that have some level of price protection, so all the price doesn't fall through at 100%. And depending upon where the price increases are and the magnitude of those price increases, less of it will fall through in a later price increase, as an example.","But overall, the vast majority of our growth, whether it be HUMIRA or other assets in our pipeline, is driven by volume growth, and I think that's an important perspective for the investor community to understand.","As far as HCV is concerned, as we've planned out for 2016, I'd say the Merck label came in pretty much spot-on what we had expected, so I think it's within our expectations. We have built into our assumptions for HCV a level of competition and some level of price competition.","We're going to have to see how that plays out. We don't believe we have any exposure there at all, so we're not concerned about that. But we have built in what we believe is an appropriate level of both price and volume competition that we could see in the marketplace in 2016.","Japan, to your point, we launched very late in the fourth quarter, and so far I had an update just a week or so ago from the team, Japan is going well. It's tracking on our expectations.","Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Marc. Next question please, Sheryl.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is open.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys. Thanks. Wondering if I could take a left turn here away from hep C and drug pricing and talk a little bit about your pipeline, which is arguably not discussed a lot on the Street. So, number one, I'd love to \u2013 and also competition. So, first of all, I'd love to get your thoughts on there's been a lot of news in the JAK space. I'd love to get your thoughts comparing baricitinib to 494.","I'd also love to get an update on how you're thinking about ABT-122 and ALX-0061. What's the next step, when we make a next step? And if possible, throw in a comment about ACP-196 versus IMBRUVICA. This molecule has obviously come into the headlines after AZN paid, I think, $7 billion for it. Thank you very much.","Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Mark.","Michael E. Severino - Executive Vice President, Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer","Sure, Mark. This is Mike. I'll take those questions. Your first question was about our JAK franchise and competition. I think that if we look at JAK inhibitors, there had been a fair amount of enthusiasm several years ago that actual results didn't live up to expectations for the first generation of those molecules, such as tofacitinib. But the current generation, I think, have very nice profiles. And I think baricitinib has generated a nice profile based on the data that we've seen today. We'll see more as they proceed through the regulatory review.","And I think the class is going to get used over time. What we see with this class is, it tends to start slow and build over time and work from more resistant patients up to all the other lines of therapy, and we see that with therapies in RA and in immunology in general.","So when I compare the two, I feel very encouraged by the results that we've seen with ABT-494. We've seen very strong efficacy, not just at the ACR20 level, but at much higher levels of response, ACR50, ACR70, DAS remission, et cetera. And we've seen that across two large Phase IIb studies, including a TNF-inadequate responder study, and those are the results that I mentioned in our opening comments.","And there, we see a level of response in TNF-inadequate responders that we believe has the potential to be best-in-class. And so if you link that up with what I said about how RA dynamics play out, those data can be very important, and we believe that that is a big opportunity for this molecule. We do believe over time that 494 will certainly have use in earlier lines of therapy. But when you look at the balanced profile of 494, we feel very good about it.","So moving on to ABT-122 and Ablynx, those are in mid-stage trials, and we'll see data from ABT-122 mid-year, and from Ablynx towards the back end of the year. And once we have those data, then that'll be the time to make decisions about next steps, so we'll be sharing those data as soon as it's reasonable to do so after we get them.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","What are the hurdles for success in those trials?","Michael E. Severino - Executive Vice President, Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer","Well, our general approach has been that we believe we need to raise the standard of care. So what we're going to want to see is something that is over and above the level of efficacy that can be achieved with comparable agents, if you will. So ABT-122 combines 17 in TNF, so you're going to want to see something in the disease populations we've studied in RA and in psoriatic arthritis. It's better than one can get with those mechanisms alone. And Ablynx is another approach at IL-6, you'll see something that's better than the existing therapies that are out there. Now, obviously, these aren't comparative studies, but we'll have the data, we believe, to make those assessments and to determine whether we will advance those programs this year, as I've said.","So, with Acerta, there certainly has been a lot of talk about Acerta given its relatively early stage of development. What I would say, first and foremost, is we've set a very high bar with IMBRUVICA. We've set a very high bar with efficacy and also with safety. I quoted some of the numbers from RESONATE-2. We don't believe we've left any room on the table for there to be a story of improved efficacy. And we feel very good about the safety profile of IMBRUVICA.","With Acerta, we're looking at much earlier data. We're looking at Phase Ib, Phase IIa studies. I think the study that's garnered the most attention is about a 61-patient dose rising study with an expansion. And it's really just not possible to compare those very early trials to a molecule like IMBRUVICA which has multiple phases of readouts and has been on the market now for a considerable period of time.","So we'll see as their programs continues to progress, what they're able to demonstrate. They have comparative studies, so a readout in a couple of years' time, and I think that's really the first time we'll be able to make any sort of comparative assessment. Those are open-label studies, and that's a limitation of them.","And I'll also add that Acerta's comparative studies are in relapsed\/refractory patients, and IMBRUVICA is moving to the front-line over time. And that momentum is going to keep up. So we feel very confident in our position with IMBRUVICA.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Thanks a lot.","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The only other thing I'd add is \u2013 this is Rick.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Hey, Rick.","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","When we did the acquisition of Pharmacyclics, we did it with the knowledge of Acerta. So we thoroughly reviewed, based on the information we had at that time, the compound and evaluated whether or not we thought it was a risk. And I think one of the things to keep in mind is a follower strategy in oncology, at least historically, has not worked very well.","And the reason it doesn't work very well is if the innovator keeps advancing the bar, the regulatory environment changes on the follower and what they need to do to be able to get their approvals, it's more difficult, takes more time, it's more expensive because it can't do single arm studies to get approval.","The second thing I'd say is there seems to be two theses out there. One would be improved efficacy, one would be improved safety profile, particularly around bleeding and AFib. I wouldn't say that those are issues that are inhibiting our ability to be able to advance the brand and standard of care today. But what I'd also say is as we have evaluated it, we believe that the vast majority of the data would support that those are on-mechanism side effects.","And so we'll have to see what their data proves out and we'll have to see what their inclusion and exclusion criteria is on the trials that they run to make sure it's a balanced view to be able to demonstrate what the bleeding AFib rate would be. And remember, we didn't see AFib in IMBRUVICA until we got to something like 1,500 patients or so. And I think we saw bleeding at about 500 to 600 something like that, right?","So we have to see a lot more data to see a real signal, and it has to be in the population that's consistent with the population that's being treated. And we'll see what the data looks like, but I think the evidence today would suggest that those are on mechanism. And so we'll have to see how it plays out, but I would tell you that we're confident in our position with IMBRUVICA.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Thanks, Rick.","Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Mark. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. David Risinger of Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is open.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. So, I wanted to go back to the positive IPR decisions. Could you please characterize the breadth of those two patents, the 157 and 158 patents which were surprisingly upheld? Specifically, you must have an opinion on the likelihood that other biosimilar manufacturers beyond Amgen will infringe these patents because it's challenging to make a stable monoclonal antibody without infringing.","And then second, I'm interested in your perspective on duration of therapy for IMBRUVICA currently and how you expect that to evolve with new indications. And then also if you could share any thoughts on venetoclax on that front with respect to expected duration of therapy as well, that would be very helpful. Thank you.","Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, David.","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. David, this is Rick. On the IPR part, I guess what I'd say is it wasn't surprising to us. We obviously have a pretty high level of confidence in the IP. As far as others that would infringe, I mean, we're certainly not in a position to be able to answer that question because we don't know what their formulations are. I guess the best place to get that answer would be to ask them.","But as I said, we're not going to talk a lot about how we're positioning things and how we plan on running the IPR process going forward. The most important thing here is that we prevail. And I realized that probably doesn't give you great comfort, but you have to recognize our responsibility is to make sure that we put the best position forward and that we don't tip off our opponents in this process as to what our strategy is. And so I apologize for that part of it, but that's the tradeoff we have to make here.","And you're going to see more of this play out over time and I think you'll get a feel for it and you can get other people to evaluate what you think that will look like from an IP standpoint, although I'd say much like this particular patent, some people opine that they didn't think it was very strong and you saw at the patent office made their decision, right? So, I think that's about all we can talk about as it relates to the litigation.","The second would be on duration on therapy on IMBRUVICA. If you look at the duration on therapy today, I'd say it's tracking on what we expected as part of the original deal model that we put together. To give you some flavor for that, I'd say it's about 75% of the clinical trial duration. It has been increasing over time. There are a number of elements that basically we've analyzed and have programs in place. Some of those are payer-related and some are other kinds of things that we have to continue to work through.","I think one of the things that will be extremely helpful is the RESONATE-2 data here because now you have absolute data that supports that if you keep these patients on therapy for a longer period of time, then you get very good outcomes. And so I think not only from the standpoint of allowing us to be able to move into front line, but as another piece of strong, credible evidence that maintaining therapy over a longer period of time gives patients the benefit they were looking for.","One of the things that we did see is in certain physician populations, from a duration standpoint, when blood counts improved, some physicians would take patients off of therapy. And obviously, that's not something that we would want. And so I think RESONATE-2 is a strong supporting set of data that will help give physicians the knowledge and information they need to be convinced that they should keep them on therapy even though the blood counts have improved.","And then on venetoclax, I don't know. Mike, can you talk at all about that? I mean, it's a little hard to tell at this point.","Michael E. Severino - Executive Vice President, Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer","Yeah. I think \u2013 this is Mike. With respect to duration of therapy with venetoclax, I think it's early to make a statement because we're treating many different populations now in clinical trials. We have a large number of patients continuing on therapy, so those mean durations of therapy are increasing as the data set matures. So, I think we can't give a specific number. I think what we can say is that the responses we're seeing are very good. We're keeping patients on therapy. There's good durability of those responses. And as the data set matures and as we move to a label, I think we can update you on that.","Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, David.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question, please, Sheryl?","Operator","Our next question comes from Ms. Vamil Divan of Credit Suisse. Ma'am, your line is open.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah. It's actually \u2013 this is Vamil. Thanks so much...","Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Vamil.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","...for taking my questions. Hi. How are you doing? I get it. All sorts of interesting moves with my name. But anyways, a couple of questions if I could. One, just in terms of hep C, I appreciate the comments you made for next year and how are you looking to that. Can you give us a sense have you've seen any impact on prescription trends from the label change that you had to make back near the start of the fourth quarter and if that's impacted things at all?","And then maybe on the pipeline again, I appreciate all the comments that were made earlier also in response to Mark's question. Maybe if you could just streamline things a little bit and just flag, if you could, the two or three most important data releases that you think investors should be focused on for AbbVie between now and your June R&D day? Thanks so much.","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Vamil, this is Rick. I'll take the HCV one. We have seen an impact. Maybe the best way to describe it would be this, you saw what our revenues were in the fourth quarter. We had flagged that the $3 billion running rate in the fourth quarter that we thought we \u2013 I flagged that we might miss it, but we would be relatively close and that is what we have been tracking against for the fourth quarter.","I'd say in the fourth quarter, there were two impacts, and one of them is going to be a label change. That's why I'm going through this explanation for you. So one was the VA volumes stayed very low through the fourth quarter because of the funding issue in the VA. And so that was one of the impacts. But then the second was, what we saw from collateral impact on the label. And I'd say we lost about one share point. So there was some bleed-over impact to other segments because the Child-Pugh B isn't worth one share point.","It has stabilized now at that level. And so, I think the impact has flowed through, and we've assumed that in what we've built for 2016. But that's been the overall impact.","Michael E. Severino - Executive Vice President, Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer","And in terms of data releases to keep an eye on, as we said in our remarks, we're going to see results from the Elagolix endometriosis second pivotal study in the first quarter. We'll top line that, so that'll obviously be something to keep an eye out for.","At EASL, we'll present a large amount of data on our next-generation hep C program, including 8-week and 12-week components of our Phase II program. So that'll be something to keep an eye on. And at ASCO, I would look to our data in CLL in venetoclax, and also AML and venetoclax as updates that we can keep an eye out for.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Vamil. We'll take our next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Arfaei of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, folks, and thank you for taking the questions.","Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Obviously, there's quite a bit of skepticism about your 2020 HUMIRA guidance. And given what you said today about Europe and the fact that biosimilar competition will only increase there, can you help us understand how you get there, basically help us bridge the difference between where consensus is right now to your expectation for greater than $18 billion by 2020 for HUMIRA? And then I'm curious about what are some of the things that you'll be looking for during the upcoming Remicade biosimilar FDA panel? Thank you.","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. So, Alex, this is Rick. If you think about what we described for you on the 2020 HUMIRA guidance ex-U.S., we basically said that we would see direct biosimilar competition in the fourth quarter of 2018. We'd have some impact from indirect biosimilar starting in 2016. I described earlier in the call what that impact assumption is for 2016.","It will obviously have a flow-through impact into 2017, as that expands and basically flows through. But then, if you think about the erosion curve that I described on the third quarter call. So what we said was internationally, the brand will peak in 2018 and then it will gently start to decline and if you get to the end of 2020, it's down about 15% or so. That's a combination of volume and price.","Now, I'd also tell you that because the category is still growing, obviously then the growth would have been there and some of that growth went to a biosimilar player. So it basically says, that about 30% of the total opportunity would have gone over that period of time. And, that's the point at which we see some level of stabilization going forward.","So I think that's the way you would characterize it, and although we don't have direct knowledge of how each analyst builds consensus around their international and U.S. sets of assumptions, what I would say is the biggest difference between consensus and our forecast is that some people are still forecasting that HUMIRA sees biosimilar competition in the United States. The number is too big to be anything other than that, the change.","So after our guidance, what we did see is we saw HUMIRA move up pretty significantly, but not all the way out to our 2020 forecast. So there are still some individuals who are assuming that they see biosimilar competition, probably now in that 2019 timeframe it's pretty much slid out to. So it's the difference between that and ultimately our assumption that we'll get through 2020 to 2022, right? And I think that's the biggest single impact.","As far as the Remicade panel, I think as we've talked about internationally we've been watching this play out in the international markets and studying it carefully. And as we've indicated to the marketplace many, many times before, we're not seeing a direct impact on HUMIRA. And obviously, if you look at our growth rates in 2015 and you look at our growth rate in the fourth quarter, I think that's indicative of the fact that we're not seeing any substantial impact as well. And so we wouldn't assume that there would be an impact in the United States either. It really fits in a different category.","I think the one thing that will be interesting to look at in the panel is we have assumed in our planning assumptions that biosimilar players get extrapolation. We don't agree with that. We think it's important for any drug to be tested in the indication that it's going to be used in and generate some clinical data. But I'd say we plan from a conservative standpoint that we will see extrapolation in all the major markets around the world.","I think as we go forward here, if somehow we got an indication that that were not going to be the case in the United States that would be a positive to us. So that's one of the things we'll be looking at.","Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Alex. Operator, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","All right, sir. Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. Steve Scala of Cowen. Your line is open.","Stephen M. Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. You mentioned the $2 billion in VIEKIRA sales in 2016. That is less than annualizing Q4 2015 sales, which were already a bit held back as you described a couple of minutes ago. So it seems as these expectations \u2013 or you're expecting a slowdown quarter-over-quarter in 2016, despite the launch in Japan. So, where are you expecting to see the pressure? Secondly, where specifically in Merck's hep C label does AbbVie see competitive advantages for VIEKIRA, if any? And then lastly, what has been the uptake of the new formulation of HUMIRA in the EU? Thank you very much.","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Steve, this is Rick. I'll take the first one. So, you are correct that if you look at what we're guiding going forward, it is less than our fourth quarter annualized. And that is our intent. I'd say there's two factors there. Let's be honest, we've had trouble predicting this number. And so we wanted to go into 2016 with a number that we had a very high level of confidence that we could hit, so that's certainly a component of it.","The second component is we are assuming some level of competition from Merck. So, we'll have to see how it plays out, but I would say we're going to set this one at a number that we have a high level of confidence that we think we can deliver, and I'd much rather surprise you on the positive than sit here and apologize on the miss. And Mike, why don't you cover the label?","Michael E. Severino - Executive Vice President, Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer","Okay. Well, so recognizing that the Merck label has just come out, what I would say is we would look particularly at the impact of RAVs on response. And this is something we've been saying since the Phase III data were presented. The U.S. label recommends RAV testing for Merck and guides both regimen and treatment duration based on that.","And with VIEKIRA, that's not the case. And also when we look at our next generation regimen and we look at activity in a number of pre-clinical systems in viruses that carry those resistance mutations we see very high levels of activity for our agent. So we think that that's going to be a strength for our programs going forward.","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And then on your last question, we have not launched the new HUMIRA formulation internationally or in the U.S. We need a new pen device for this formulation. And so we have submitted the pen in both jurisdictions. We'll have to wait for that to get approved, once that's approved then we'll make our decisions on launching those.","Stephen M. Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks. Next question please, operator.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Boris of SunTrust. Your line is open.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the results.","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, John.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","First question has to do with the Japanese market. Are you anticipating any impact to your franchises from price decreases in Japan in April? The second question, what percent of HUMIRA revenues in U.S. and ex-U.S. come from rheumatoid arthritis? And can you give some color on timing around when the pen might see or secure approval?","And then last question just has to do with ABT-494. It seems that competitively baricitinib and the developers there have latched on to an important area of diabetic nephropathy that appears to have an effect; that would be a very large untapped market. I'm sure you'll talk about this in June, but any thoughts around further broadening the development outside of RA for ABT-494? Thanks.","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. So, John, this is Rick. I'll take the first one. So the Japanese market price adjustments, we are aware of it, it has been communicated to us. So it's built into our 2016 guidance. I don't think it's something we can tell you because really the Japanese authorities need to release that, not us. But I'd say it was in the range, slightly lower than we would have expected. So I think it's fine and as I said it's in the guidance already. But we are aware of what the number is. The HUMIRA indication mix, it was RA you said?","William J. Chase - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. RA, John, right now is just a bit under 35% of global sales.","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And then the pen devices, they were submitted recently. So we're thinking second half of 2016.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks.","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And then ABT-494, Mike?","Michael E. Severino - Executive Vice President, Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer","Sure. This is Mike. So with respect to broadening out ABT-494 development, we obviously believe that ABT-494 has broad potential in RA. In other immunologically mediated conditions, we have programs underway in inflammatory bowel disease, and I think the data support that we're likely to see a good effect there.","With respect to diabetic nephropathy, it's an intriguing idea. It's certainly something we consider. And perhaps that is a good topic for our R&D Day in June.","Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, John. Appreciate the question. Next question please, operator?","Operator","Our next question comes from Colin Bristow of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Colin N. Bristow - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Morning, and thanks for taking the questions and all the useful color. So first on HUMIRA, just in the 4Q, can you comment specifically or at least qualitatively on the level of rebating in the quarter and how it compares year-over-year and sequentially? Second on hep C, can you give us some idea of the number of contracts perhaps as a proportion of 2015 which you secured with exclusivity for 2016?","And then thirdly, and sorry if I missed this, but on the HUMIRA ex-U.S. front, can you give us an update on the impact you're seeing from biosimilar Remicade? I think previously you said around 3% share. And then just following on from that theme, how do you anticipate the threat from the biosimilar Enbrel given that it's an injectable versus an infusion? Thanks.","William J. Chase - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Colin, it's Bill Chase. On the rebating around HUMIRA, obviously, we don't go to any great lengths explaining the levels of rebating. What you need to think about with our pricing dynamic on HUMIRA is price increases in the latter half of the year tend to have less of a fall through that's related to basically pricing caps in certain programs. So to the extent that we take price later in the year, our rebate goes up for those particular programs, but I don't want to get into any specific numbers around that at this point in time.","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","On the HCV contracting, when we originally launched and the exclusive contracts that we had were multiyear contracts with the exception of the Medicaid contracts which many of those are annual contracts, get bid out on a yearly basis. So I'd say, certainly, the majority of our business is under a multiyear contracting strategy. On HUMIRA, Remicade, I may not have heard the question correctly, but we haven't communicated that it had a 3% impact, in fact it had virtually no impact on our business. Overall, if you look at their overall biologic share is somewhere around 3%, but the vast majority of that has come from Remicade.","And then Enbrel is what I described earlier that we are anticipating about a 2% impact from a growth rate standpoint. The majority of that, the vast majority of that is price. There are certain markets where there will be a price impact.","Colin N. Bristow - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you.","Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Colin. And operator, we have time for one more question please.","Operator","All right, sir. Our last question comes from Mr. Andrew Baum of Citi. Sir, your line is open.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thank you. Three questions, please. Firstly, you've expressed previously your confidence in the robustness of the 135 patent within the U.S. and I know it had a very lengthy prosecution history to attain inclusion in the USPTO. Could you contrast that with the withdrawal of the similar patents from Europe? What underpins the confidence in the U.S. building on the lengthy prosecution, if you'd like to comment?","Second, perhaps if you could go into a little bit more detail in terms of the reference pricing for anti-TNF agents within Europe. What was the thinking of the impact of Enbrel in dragging down the prices of the category?","And then finally, just on Acerta's BTK inhibitor, do you believe that they infringe AbbVie's intellectual property? Thank you.","Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Andrew.","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. On the 135 patent as I said before, I mean we're not going to go through a lot of detail back and forth. But one thing I do want to clarify is remember, IP in Europe is different than IP in the United States in how it is ultimately prosecuted.","The second thing is, it's important to remember that although we withdrew the parent patent, we did it because there was one particular assay that we had a second patent that didn't have that question and therefore we pulled that patent in order to basically just focus on these other patents. So it's not like we withdrew it because we were concerned about it. And so ultimately \u2013 but that is not an issue from a U.S. standpoint, and I think that's probably as much as we're going to talk about it.","Reference pricing, obviously part of what I indicated earlier is reference price, but I'd say also there are some markets where there could be some hospital negotiations also that could have an impact here. And so we factored in what we think is certainly a conservative number. But I think it's an appropriate number to be able to ultimately plan for 2016.","And then on Acerta BTK, the IP, again, we have significant IP in this area. And if we believe Acerta infringes that IP, we'll enforce the IP.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thank you.","Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Andrew.","Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations","And that concludes today's conference call.

Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Today, we\u2019re pleased to report strong results with adjusted earnings per share of $0.71, exceeding our guidance range for the quarter. This included strong operational sales growth also ahead of our outlook for the quarter. We delivered this performance with strong growth across a number of products in our portfolio, including Humira, Synagis, Synthroid, and Creon. Our performance this quarter illustrates our ability to grow our business despite the impact of generic competition. It also provides confidence in our ability to deliver meaningful sales and EPS growth starting next year as we launch our HCV therapy. ","In 2014, our focus remains on continued strong commercial and operational execution as well as pipeline advancement. Today, I\u2019ll briefly discuss our first quarter performance and provide an update on our pipeline and some of the key milestones we expect to occur throughout the year. Then I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill, who will provide you additional detail on our performance and our second quarter outlook.","Our first quarter performance was led by Humira, which delivered more than 18% global operational growth. We continue to see increasing penetration across therapeutic categories and geographies which is driving strong market growth. Additionally, Humira continues to gain market share across segments. Humira is off to a strong start and we\u2019re well on our way to achieving our sales growth outlook. Beyond Humira, we also saw a strong performance from other products in our portfolio, including Creon, Synthroid, Synagis, and Sevoflurane. We continue to be pleased with the performance of these durable and growing brands. ","In addition to our strong commercial performance in the quarter, we also made significant progress advancing our pipeline. So far in 2014, we have achieved a number of key regulatory and clinical objectives. This includes an important milestone for our interferon-free HCV combination. As you may have seen, earlier this week we announced the submission of our U.S. regulatory application for HCV therapy for genotype 1 patients. Our European regulatory application will occur in early May based on specific dates allowed for submitting applications to the CHMP. In anticipation of U.S. commercialization in late 2014 and European approval in early 2015, we\u2019ve continued to make good progress in building the appropriate infrastructure. ","Detailed results from several of our Phase III registrational studies were recently presented at EASL and published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The comprehensive body of data demonstrates that our combination provides high rates of cure across genotype 1 populations, including difficult-to-treat patients. As we evaluate the HCV market and consider which patients which likely be treated in 2015 to 2017 time frame, we believe the most advanced patients \u2013 those with cirrhosis, fibrosis, and patients who have previously failed treatment \u2013 will be treated sooner. This view is consistent with feedback we\u2019ve received from payor organizations and physicians around the world, and based on the high level of efficacy demonstrated by our therapy in these difficult-to-treat patients, we believe we\u2019re well positioned for success in this market. ","Further, because we\u2019ve conducted independent studies across specific genotype 1 patient populations, we\u2019re able to characterize the performance in each patient type with a very high degree of confidence and we believe this will be an important point of differentiation. During the quarter, we also presented results from our mid-stage HCV trials in Japan as well as initial data on our next-generation HCV assets. Given patient characteristics and the prevalence of genotype 1b in Japan, we are evaluating a 12-week 2daa once daily ribavirin-free treatment for these patients. Data from our Phase II study with this combination in Japan demonstrated SVR12 rates in the mid-90% range. Our Phase III program is ongoing and enrolling rapidly, and we expect to submit our regulatory application in the first half of 2015. Japan represents the second-largest HCV market globally, and given our commercial presence and the potential product profile, we believe we\u2019re well positioned relative to the competitive offerings. ","At the recent CROI meeting, we presented initial data from our next-generation HCV assets, including ABT493, a potent protease inhibitor, and our new NS5A inhibitor, ABT530. As we\u2019ve said before, it is our goal with our next-generation program to bring to market a ribavirin-free, once daily pan-genotypic combination. As I mentioned last quarter, we have ongoing efforts to further simplify our initial offering with a once-daily formulation, and we\u2019ve continued to make progress in this regard.","Certainly there has been significant attention regarding the competitive landscape for this market. While we can\u2019t make direct comparisons between studies, we do believe there are important differences between the clinical trial designs across various programs. This includes significant differences in cohort size for specific subgroups and patient populations, and the confidence intervals around trial results. We believe these factors will be important considerations for physicians, payors, and patients. Based on the large body of data supporting our therapeutic profile across genotype 1 patients, our global footprint and our ability to execute commercially, we continue to believe we\u2019re in a strong position.","AbbVie will be an early entrant into this market where there is clearly a strong desire from both physicians and payors for multiple therapeutic options. Well-tolerated treatments like ours that demonstrate high levels of efficacy, particularly in difficult-to-treat patients, will fare well; and considering the number of patients afflicted and both the physician and payor capacity, we believe there will be a steady cadence of patients treated annually, making this a very attractive market for many years to come. ","While HCV certainly garners significant attention, today I\u2019d also like to highlight some of the other important pipeline programs and milestones that we expect throughout the remainder of 2014. ","We continue to have a high level of enthusiasm on our late-stage oncology assets, including our BCL-2 inhibitor, ABT-199, in development for a number of hematological malignancies, including our late-stage trials for our vanguard indication, CLL; our PARP inhibitor, ABT-888, in development for more than a dozen different cancer types; elotuzumab in Phase III development for multiple myeloma. The ABT-199 clinical program, which is partnered with Roche Genentech, continues to progress very well. As a reminder, last spring we refined the dosing and monitoring approach with ABT-199 in CLL to minimize the risk for tumor lysis syndrome. Since initiating the new protocol, we\u2019ve collected and analyzed data on a significant number of patients. There have been no clinically significant events of TLS reported. We recently shared these findings with the U.S. regulatory authorities and reached agreement to remove the hospitalization requirement for a significant portion of patients going forward. We plan to present these safety data at an upcoming European Hematology Association meeting.","As you know, last year we initiated a large Phase II single agent study in relapsed refractory CLL patients with 17p deletion. The initial date readout from this trial is expected in the first part of 2015. If the data warrants and regulatory agencies agree that ABT-199 addresses an unmet medical need, these data have the potential to serve as a path to early registration. ","We have a number of ABT-199 data presentations and other activities that are also expected this year. We plan to present initial Phase I combination data with Rituxan in relapsed refractory CLL patients at the upcoming AASCO and EHA meetings. Later this year, we expect to present initial single agent AML data and multiple myeloma data, and also later this year in collaboration with our partner, we plan to start a Phase III combination study of ABT-199 plus GA101 in first-line CLL patients. ","We\u2019ve also seen good progress with ABT-888, our PARP inhibitor. We recently announced the initiation of a global Phase III trial evaluating ABT-888 in patients with previously untreated squamous non-small cell lung cancer. The data supporting the decision to advance the Phase III development will be presented at a medical meeting in the second half of this year.","Earlier this year, we started a Phase III study of ABT-888 for neo-adjuvant treatment of triple-negative breast cancer. Several other mid-stage trials will complete in 2014 with the potential for additional Phase III transitions yet this year. ","Also in late stage development in our oncology pipeline is elotuzumab for multiple myeloma, the second most common blood cancer, in partnership with Bristol-Myers Squibb. Two Phase III studies are ongoing in relapsed refractory and first-line patients. Results from the event-driven trial are expected in early 2015. ","Now turning to our other late-stage pipeline assets. This summer, we\u2019ll see data from the second of two registrational studies on daclizumab. As a reminder, the DECIDE trial is designed to show a reduction in annualized relapse rates and disability progression in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis versus an active comparator. Despite advances in this category, there continues to be a significant need for high efficacy agents and we believe daclizumab has the potential to deliver the right balance of clinical activity and an acceptable safety profile.","In our neuroscience pipeline is Duopa. Regarding our U.S. regulatory application, we recently received questions on the submission. FDA did not identify safety issues in the clinical data and no new clinical trials were requested. The questions were primarily related to the use of the delivery system. We\u2019re in the process of addressing the questions and plan to submit a response when that process is complete.","Moving on to Elagolix, our compound in Phase III development for endometriosis and Phase IIb for uterine fibroids, we\u2019ll see initial data from the first of two pivotal studies in endometriosis in the second half of 2014. Finally, we look forward to seeing Phase IIb data in RA in our partner-selected JAK1 inhibitor. Beyond our partnership with Galapagos, we have a robust pipeline in mid-stage immunology assets, including an internal selected JAK1 inhibitor, an IL6 nanobody, and DVD bispecific biologics, among others.","In closing, we\u2019re off to a strong start in 2014. We delivered strong performance in the quarter and we continue to make good progress executing on our key strategic priorities, including pipeline advancement. As we evaluate our pipeline prospects, including a number of potential opportunities, we believe our pipeline is the strongest it has ever been. We\u2019re on the cusp of a number of important data milestones, phase transitions, and product launches. Given the progress we\u2019ve made, we continue to expect strong sales and earnings growth beginning in 2015.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill for a more detailed view of our results.","William Chase","Thank you, Rick. This morning, I\u2019ll review our first quarter performance and provide an update on our outlook for the remainder of 2014. As Rick said, we\u2019re very pleased with the strong quarter we delivered. Total sales increased 6.7% on an operational basis, excluding a 1.3% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Excluding sales from our lipid franchise due to loss of exclusivity, total sales increased 13.5% on an operational basis.","Humira delivered global sales of more than $2.6 billion, up 18.4% on an operational basis. In the U.S., Humira sales increased 24.7% driven by continued market expansion, share gains, and particularly strong growth in the gastro segment. Internationally, Humira sales grew nearly 14% on an operational basis and more than 12% on a reported basis. International growth is being driven by continued uptake of new indications, share gains, and double-digit market growth in most key countries. On a global basis, we continue to expect double-digit sales growth for Humira in 2014. ","International sales of Synagis were strong in the first quarter at $354 million, up 9.3% on an operational basis. Synagis, which protects at-risk infants from severe respiratory disease, is a seasonal product with the majority of sales in the first and fourth quarters. Androgel sales were up 6%, benefiting from a favorable comparison versus the market dynamics of the prior year quarter. While Androgel continues to gain share, we have seen a notable slowdown in the market this year with overall prescriptions down roughly 10%. We expect Androgel performance for the year to be in line with these market trends.","Global Lupron sales were $189 million in the quarter, up 5.6% on an operational basis. For the full-year 2014, we expect sales to be down modestly from 2013. U.S. sales of Synthroid were up $157 million with the year-over-year growth rate aided by a favorable comparison to the first quarter of 2013, which was unfavorably impacted by customer ordering patterns. Synthroid maintains strong brand loyalty and market leadership despite the entry of generics into the market many years ago. For the full-year 2014, we expect low double-digit sales growth for the brand.","U.S. Creon sales were $107 million in the quarter, up 18.4%. Creon maintains its leadership position in the pancreatic enzyme market where we continue to capture the vast majority of new prescription starts. We expect low double-digit sales growth for Creon in 2014. ","Sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease, grew nearly 30% on an operational basis this quarter. For the remainder of 2014, we expect continued double-digit growth in Europe and other international markets where Duodopa is currently approved. ","All of the products in our lipid franchise are now experiencing generic competition. Sales of Niaspan were $47 million and TriCor Trilipix sales were $23 million, both down significantly versus the first quarter of 2013. We expect these trends to continue for the remainder of 2014.","I\u2019ll now turn to the P&L profile for the first quarter. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 78.4%, in line with our expectations and up 220 basis points from the prior year quarter. This reflects loss of exclusivity in our lipid franchise offset by favorable mix impacts across the portfolio and margin-enhancing initiatives we\u2019ve implemented. Adjusted R&D was 16.9% of sales, up 22% from the prior year driven by increased funding of our mid- and late-stage pipeline assets and the continued pursuit of additional Humira indications. The level of R&D investment in the quarter was above our guidance. ","Adjusted SG&A was 27.6% of sales in the first quarter, reflecting continued investment in our growth brands and preparations for our upcoming HCV launch. Adjusted SG&A investment increased 4.6% from the prior quarter. We remain on track for a full-year adjusted SG&A profile approaching 28%. ","Net interest expense was $65 million and the adjusted tax rate was 22.3% in the quarter. First quarter adjusted earnings per share, excluding non-cash amortization expense and specified items, were $0.71, up 4.4% year-over-year and exceeding our previous guidance range. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share were $0.61. ","Moving on to our full-year 2014 outlook, we are confirming our adjusted earnings per share guidance of $3 to $3.10. This guidance range excludes $0.37 per share related to amortization expense and ongoing separation and restructuring costs. We continue to expect sales of approximately $19 billion this year with growth from our key marketed products offsetting the decline in lipids from generic competition. Included in our sales guidance is an estimated negative impact from exchange of roughly 1% for the year.","We\u2019re committed to improving our gross margin ratio in 2014 despite the loss of high-margin lipid sales. As a result, we continue to forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio approaching 79% for the year, reflecting actions we\u2019ve taken to further improve our margin profile.","As you know, we have a record number of Phase III programs in development, including a number of exciting opportunities in oncology, HCV, immunology and other areas that warrant investment. We now expect R&D expense to be somewhat above 16% of sales as we continue to advance our late-stage pipeline. As I noted during our call in January, we expect to see an increase in SG&A this year as we invest in our key brands and our upcoming HCV launch. As a result, we continue to expect SG&A expense to approach 28% of sales in 2014. We are forecasting net interest expense of about $270 million for the full year and we continue to expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 22%. ","Regarding our second quarter outlook, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $0.75 to $0.77. This excludes roughly $0.10 of specified items and non-cash amortization resulting in a second quarter EPS in the range of $0.65 to $0.67 on a GAAP basis. Our second quarter outlook reflects a flat to slightly increasing top line, including a modest negative impact from foreign exchange. We expect gross margin as a percentage of sales to be in line with our full-year guidance.","The amount of investment in R&D and SG&A in the second quarter is expected to increase sequentially from the first quarter as we accelerate spending, particularly for our upcoming HCV launch. This has been captured in our EPS guidance range for the second quarter. ","In conclusion, we\u2019re pleased with our first quarter performance as well as our outlook for the remainder of 2014. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Larry.","Larry Peepo","Thanks Bill, and we\u2019ll now open the call for questions. Elan (ph), we\u2019ll take our first question, please.","Question and Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. [Operator instructions]","Our first question today is from Steve Scala from Cowen.","Steve Scala \u2013 Cowen & Co.","Thank you so much. I have three questions. First regarding the hep-C opportunity, has your strategy on how to approach the market changed at all in the past six months, and if so, in what ways? Secondly on Duopa, I assume the PDUFA date will be pushed out from the early May time frame. Do you have visibility on for how long? And then thirdly, maybe a bit of a bigger picture question. Some companies are philosophically opposed to changing full-year EPS guidance at the end of Q1 because it\u2019s simply too early in the year to do so. Does AbbVie share this view, or would the company have increased its full-year EPS guidance already if it thought that was prudent? Thank you.","Richard Gonzalez","Okay Steve, this is Rick Gonzalez. I\u2019ll take the first one and the last one \u2013 let me start with the last one. Yeah, I think we are in a position where it just doesn\u2019t make sense based on first quarter to change guidance. I wouldn\u2019t say we have a philosophy where we won\u2019t change it if ultimately we believe it should be changed going forward, but it\u2019s just too early in the year to ultimately make that decision today. ","As far as hep-C is concerned, I think it is a very interesting market as it\u2019s evolved over time, but the one thing I\u2019d roll out is we said early on in the process that we thought we had a very competitive profile on our product and we thought we could position this product well in the marketplace. If you recall, one of the things that we talked about is that we had done a significant amount of market research in this area and there were really three key drivers of success. One was clearly cure rates \u2013 SBR12 rates in both na\u00efve patients but more importantly in difficult-to-treat patients; and second was therapies that were highly tolerable. Those two factors alone drove the vast majority of physician prescribing patterns. Convenience was a distant third \u2013 a very, very distant third is what we said. ","At the same time, we also said that this was a large market and would stay a large market for a long period of time because of the clinical capacity and the triaging of patients over time, and that physicians and payors would want multiple options in the marketplace. We also said that we believe that the patients that would get treated first were cirrhotics, fibrotic patients, and experienced patients, that they\u2019d be a significant amount of the treatment in the first several years.","When you look at the way the market is playing out today, it\u2019s playing out pretty close to what I just described to you, and that\u2019s what we articulated more than a year ago. If you look at our product profile against that, we have very strong SBR12 rates in cirrhotic patients and experienced patients. We have strong individual patient data around sub-populations with very tight confidence intervals. We have extremely high tolerability with or without ribavirin. We have very low relapse rates in these patients, and we\u2019re going to be an early entry into the marketplace and provide an alternative to the other competitive offerings.","So when I look at it, it\u2019s playing out very similar to what we expected, and I think we\u2019ll be in a very good position to compete very effectively in this market. ","Scott Brun","This is Scott Brun and I\u2019ll take the second question on Duopa regarding the PDUFA date. So certainly through our interactions with FDA, they acknowledge the importance of Duopa in providing an option for patients with severe Parkinson\u2019s disease who other than deep-brain stimulation really have no other options, so we\u2019ve been working very closely with them to address some questions predominantly related to the use of the delivery system. Really, we\u2019ve gotten no concerns with regard the safety efficacy profile of the product. I think this is more a factor that this is a very unique drug-device combination and we\u2019re working with multiple constituent parts of the FDA beyond just the drug review division, so certainly there are some additional questions related to patient use, instructions for use. We\u2019re working through those with the various FDA divisions, our partner who manufactures the pump, and our own internal AbbVie experts. ","I don\u2019t want to give you guidance on the PDUFA date right now. Certainly it will extend beyond May, but we\u2019re working very expeditiously in partnership with the FDA to address those questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you. Just a couple questions \u2013 Rick, I\u2019m not even really sure where the question is here, but maybe you can comment on this. As you know, Sovaldi sales this quarter were $2.2 billion. J&J\u2019s Olysio sales this quarter, one single agent protease inhibitor generated $350 million in sales annualizing at $1.4 billion, and I look at consensus numbers for AbbVie\u2019s hep-C regimen next year and they\u2019re under $800 million. What do you think the world is missing here, because we\u2019ve seen really good data, et cetera, but I don\u2019t know \u2013 maybe you can just comment on what you think the gaps and misunderstanding are.","Secondly, Scott to you on your second-generation hep-C regimen, clearly I think one of the key messages at EASL is just how aggressively your competitors are moving in this space, and I\u2019m wondering if you can give us an update on your development timelines for your second-generation hep-C regimen and if we will see data at AASLD.","Then just lastly on the news, Rick, on ABT-199, so are you saying that we are now out of the woods on TLS with respect to ABT-199? Thanks.","Richard Gonzalez","Thanks Jami. Okay, so I\u2019ll cover the question on hep-C. I\u2019m not sure what the gaps are. I mean, I just went through how I think our product fits against the market criteria, and I think that\u2019s consistent with our view of how we\u2019ll compete in the marketplace. I will say, look \u2013 the data is evolving here very rapidly. We just saw a lot of the competitive subset data at EASL, and the market probably needs a little time to digest that over a period of time and make some determinations as to how they want to value each of the competitive alternatives in the marketplace. But I can tell you from our perspective, we feel pretty good about our position and we feel it\u2019s playing out very consistently with what we thought would play out in the marketplace.","Having said all that, it\u2019s certainly better to delight than disappoint, and so the number that\u2019s out there I think is a number that certainly is one that we have confidence we can beat.","Scott Brun","Jami, it\u2019s Scott. Maybe I\u2019ll go on with the HCV second-generation. So as Rick said, we presented data at CROI showing the characteristics of our new protease inhibitor, ABT-493 and our new NS5A, ABT-530. Both are pan-genotypic with very balanced activity against genotypes 1 through 6, activity against the first generation compound typical mutations that we see arise, and frankly very interesting characteristics with regard to their barriers to resistance. So certainly if you compare these against other next-generation compounds, these compounds are ranking near the top \u2013 extremely favorably.","We are in Phase II right now. We have established to our confidence that these are indeed once daily compounds without the need of ritonavir. We are very pleased with regard to what we\u2019re seeing in patients, and we are moving forward with our Phase II program that\u2019s going to incorporate elements of, let me say, much of what we\u2019ve been learning about where the competition is moving with the next wave of therapy. We certainly feel we are on track for these therapies to be available in the 2017 time frame.","Moving on to ABT-199, as Rick said, after we changed our dosing protocol to start at a somewhat lower dose and ramp up more slowly, we had been hospitalizing all of our CLL patients with the initiation of 199. We had monitored them very carefully, collected a very significant body of data, and certainly have seen no TLS \u2013 clinically significant TLS \u2013 with that approach. As a consequence of our analyses of these data, moving forward with the FDA we\u2019ve been able to remove the hospitalization requirement for, I will say the majority of patients. We\u2019re continuing hospitalization for those patients at highest risk with the most bulky disease, who frankly are also the ones who have the fewest options and the greatest ability to benefit from ABT-199 therapy. So the program is expanding rapidly with Phase III studies having initiated, so we\u2019re going to be getting a lot more patient experience. You\u2019re going to see what we\u2019ve seen at the upcoming AASCO meeting.","Always want to be careful about saying out of the woods, but I will say strongly off to the races based on what we\u2019ve been seeing.","Jami Rubin \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.","Jeff Holford \u2013 Jefferies","Hi, thanks very much for taking my questions. Just on the once daily formulation of the current offering, wondering if you can just give us a bit more color around timing of that and what you\u2019re required to do for that in terms of any clinical studies or work with the FDA. Secondly, can you just let us know if you\u2019ve had any indication around guideline advantage potentially in patient groups like cirrhotics or any other hep-C population where you think you have a higher level of evidence than he competitors so far in terms of specific trials? And then just a last question, what do you guys think the percentage of the global hep-C opportunity that\u2019s driven by tender or preferential access based pricing, just to give us a sense of how important pricing might be in this market? Thank you.","Scott Brun","It\u2019s Scott Brun again. So with regard to our once daily formulation of our first generation regimen that will take our twice daily non-nuke polymerase ABT-333 and coformulate with the once daily 450 267, we are finishing up some of our pharmacokinetic work to make sure that we\u2019re selecting the optimal candidate formulation. Certainly based on what those data look like and how similar the PK profiles are to the regimen with (indiscernible) will drive exactly what our next steps are going to be. Certainly if there is additional clinical work required, we fully anticipate that we\u2019re going to be beginning that work before the end of the year, and this regimen will slot in between the entry of the first generation regimen and, as I referred to, the second generation.","With regard to guidelines, certainly we work very closely with the various groups that drive the prevailing global guidelines, certainly to make sure that they understand the breadth and depth of our program. I think typically guidelines are driven by weight of evidence. Certainly you can see ADC gradings with regard to how strong evidence is, and having dedicated data in some of the most important patient groups \u2013 those that are the hardest the treat \u2013 in very significant numbers that shrink your confidence intervals and provide you greater certainty, I think is going to resonate with these guideline groups. Again, those guidelines haven\u2019t been written yet, but if you look at how these are conventionally put together, it\u2019s a weight of evidence approach and I think we feel very, very confident in our body of data, particularly in the groups that you referenced, such as the cirrhotics.","Richard Gonzalez","Jeff, this is Rick on the tender question. Well, as you know, the U.S. is a big part of this market, which isn\u2019t a tender-driven kind of market, and then obviously a lot of the major European countries would be the other significant part, and Japan. So if you look at pure tenders across the G7, it will be a relatively small percentage of the overall revenue in this market as it exists today. ","Jeff Holford \u2013 Jefferies","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Yes, thanks very much. Good morning. I have a number of questions but I\u2019ll try to just ask three, if that is okay. The first is relatively straightforward, just a simple numbers question. IMS has been reporting mid to high single digit TRX growth for Humira in the U.S. in the first quarter. Could you just break down the reported 25% U.S. Humira sales growth to give us some better perspective on underlying demand as you see it, in case the IMS TRX growth is misleading, and then also on price and any inventory stocking.","Second, with respect to HCV on pricing, maybe Rick, you could just give us your thoughts at a high level about how competitive one needs to be on price in a duopoly. I would think that in the initial duopoly, it would make little sense to price aggressively when you have just one competitor, but just wanted to get your perspective on that. ","Then third, with respect to HCV diagnosis, I think the HCV bulls are talking about significant diagnosis increases in the U.S., but I don\u2019t have a good perspective on what the real numbers are. So maybe you could talk about the number diagnosed in terms of whatever number you have recently, and how that number is really going to grow annually in the next three years. We think about the number diagnosed in the United States growing in the low single digit percentage annually or mid-single digit percentage. Any color on that would be helpful.","William Chase","So David, it\u2019s Bill Chase. I\u2019ll start with your Humira question. As you pointed out, the IMS scripts on Humira are high single digit. The numbers we see are actually a little higher than that typically on an annual basis. This thing is doing high single to low double digits, and then obviously you\u2019ve seen it when we\u2019ve taken price increases, so price does remain a component of the U.S. growth. ","Inventories \u2013 we try to minimize fluctuations from quarter to quarter on inventories as much as we possibly can. In both the fourth quarter and the first quarter, Humira inventories were about half a year. There were some impacts\u2014half a month, rather, I\u2019m sorry. There were some impacts in the first quarter of 2013 but that was maybe four to five points on the growth altogether. This is a brand that continues to perform very, very strongly in the U.S. You saw the numbers last year and certainly we expect continued performance this year.","David Risinger \u2013 Morgan Stanley","I\u2019m sorry \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you can hear me. Sorry to interrupt, but with respect to four to five points in the first quarter of \u201913, did you say there was a negative impact resulting in a somewhat easy comp for the first quarter of \u201914, given what happened in the first quarter of \u201913?","William Chase","There was a favorable comp versus the first quarter of 2013 related to ordering patterns.","David Risinger \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thank you.","Richard Gonzalez","Okay David, this is Rick. I\u2019ll cover the HCV one. As it relates to pricing, as we\u2019ve said before, if I look at the product profile that we have and I look at the mix of patients that are going to be treated first, we have a product profile that stands up quite nicely in the marketplace, so that\u2019s not our strategy going forward. So we\u2019re not going to talk specifically about how we\u2019re going to deal with pricing, as I mentioned on the last call as well, but I\u2019ll just tell you the product attributes of the AbbVie therapy, I think stand up quite nicely to what the market wants, and certainly that will be the driver of how we try to educate the market and market the product.","As far as diagnosis rates are concerned, I don\u2019t have the numbers directly in front of me but last time I recall we thought they were about 3.5 million patients in total in the United States. About half of those were currently diagnosed, and I\u2019d say in our LRP modeling we\u2019re not modeling out dramatic increases in newly diagnosed patients. I mean, there are obviously patients that are being diagnosed and coming into the system, but it\u2019s probably in that high single or low double digit kind of rate. You have to remember, there\u2019s a certain level of clinical capacity here to begin with just to get through the people that are already diagnosed that need treatment, so I think everybody will have campaigns to go forward and try to diagnose more patients, but the governing factor may be the level of clinical capacity that exists in the marketplace anyway. ","Scott Brun","David, it\u2019s Scott. I completely agree with Rick. You see some varying numbers with regard to, say the U.S., how many patients are actively in care with HCV. I\u2019ve seen numbers on the order of 400,000 \u2013again to Rick\u2019s point, maybe 1.5 to 1.7 diagnosed on the total of 3 million. But I think the more relevant question, as Rick laid out, if you\u2019re trying to see how this market is going to evolve is all the various factors in the patient, their journey not only diagnosis, clinical capacity, but then some of the things certainly both in the U.S. and globally with regard to how payors are going to be looking at the cadence of treatment with certainly all the signaling that we\u2019ve been seeing, those with the most advanced fibrosis and\/or prior treatment experience coming in first.","So I agree with Rick. We have not modeled and don\u2019t need to model very aggressive diagnostic uptake in our forecast.","David Risinger \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Schott from JP Morgan.","Chris Schott \u2013 JP Morgan","Great, thanks very much. Following up on the pricing topic here on the HCV side, I guess your competitors price and launch have obviously attracted a lot of attention from payors and some politicians. Can we have a little bit more on your view on how this all plays out? If price doesn\u2019t come down in this market, do you think we\u2019re going to see more efforts to restrict usage of these products that it medically makes sense at all to do, and I guess finally, does that attention at some point give AbbVie better negotiating position with payors? I guess it\u2019s a couple questions there, but just any thoughts would be appreciated. ","My second question was on ABT-199. I guess two clarifying questions there \u2013 first, how many patients have been dosed on the new regimen at this point? And the second question is, it looks like you could have a best-in-class product here but one that\u2019s going to be coming to market a few years later than some other highly effective, novel agents. How do you see that playing out commercially, the time to market issue here? Thanks very much.","Scott Brun","Chris, it\u2019s Scott Brun, so maybe I can talk about--. Obviously I don\u2019t want to be giving away exact numbers with regard to where we\u2019re at on our Phase II program, again just because of the competitive fervency here. But to your point, when I look at the characteristics of these drugs \u2013 and again, we\u2019re comparing in your minds the preclinical information that\u2019s out there and then certainly what I know about from what we\u2019ve seen in patients so far. No, I absolutely think that this particular regimen has the potential for best-in-class. We will know more over the ensuing years as we\u2014ensuing year as we continue our Phase II program. ","But when I say for a regimen that\u2019s going to be out in 2017, referring back to the prior question, this epidemic is going to be far from over, okay, and I\u2019m talking in the developed markets. You just look at our throughput, even if you assume in the G7, say, on the order of 250,000 patients coming through, they are going to be a number of patients still in need and certainly this number, as you made the point, is going to be affected by healthcare system decisions on how are patients going to be prioritized.","Now certainly this is a disease where the consequences occur decades after initial infection, so you do have some time before you have to act. You don\u2019t have to treat everybody with no or little evidence of liver scarring right off the bat. Certainly I think those patients who have more advanced fibrosis or scarring or other factors that are medical indications for treatment, I cannot imagine any healthcare system is going to be making the decisions to deny that care.","Richard Gonzalez","Chris, this is Rick. The only thing I would add to that is what will really drive access and who is treated is capacity, guidelines, and then ultimately whatever criteria the governments or managed care organizations put in place. I think those will be responsible and appropriate clinical guidelines that are put in place because they tend to come together, and the governing factor may be more one of capacity than it is other kinds of things.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. ","Vamil Divan \u2013 Credit Suisse","Yes, thanks for taking the question. So just following up a little bit on the pricing question there with hep-C, I just actually wanted to ask you a question as it relates to Humira. Obviously hep-C, there\u2019s some unique components here, but are you seeing or do you expect to see any greater pressure across other specialty care markets, I guess specifically with Humira in a class of anti-TNS where we do have a number of different competitors. I think we\u2019re starting to see some of these concerns maybe extend to areas that have been immune to this issue before, so just curious to hear your thoughts.","And then separated and unrelated question, just on Androgel \u2013 appreciate what you said about 2014. Just what do you think about the longer term potential for this class and your drug specifically, just given some of the safety concerns that have been raised? Do you see any potential to re-establish growth for this category, or not? Thanks.","Richard Gonzalez","This is Rick. So if you look at Humira and the class of anti-TNS, I think you have to reflect back on there have been many, many competitors in this market for a long period of time, and you still see Humira have a leadership position in this category. Obviously a component of that is working with governments and working with managed care organizations to ensure that you\u2019re demonstrating the right value proposition for the product and it is priced appropriately against that value proposition, and that\u2019s something we deal with every single day, every single year. I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019ve seen dramatic changes in the approach that we\u2019ve had to take with those organizations. Even recently, I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve seen dramatic changes.","As it relates to Androgel, certainly we\u2019re not projecting going forward that the market will accelerate dramatically, and so I think we\u2019re assuming in our modeling per our long-range plan that ultimately the market will be relatively slow growing to flat going forward. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital.","Alex Arfaei \u2013 BMO Capital","Good morning and congratulations on the quarter, folks. Three questions, if I may. Regarding your hep-C regimen, are you having discussions with payors already, and specifically I\u2019m wondering if your (indiscernible) Phase III in cirrhotics is resonating with payors given the importance of this group. Second, could you comment on the enhanced gross margin initiatives that you were talking about earlier? What are those initiatives, and what is your longer term outlook on gross margin given your plans to establish manufacturing in Singapore? Then third, when can we expect data from your own JAK1 inhibitor? Thank you.","Scott Brun","So maybe, Alex, going on with regard to our data particularly in cirrhotics and the payor community, look \u2013 we\u2019ve been sharing the specifics on these data with a variety of different stakeholders that are involved in the care of these patients, ranging from again clinicians to various payor groups around the world. As I\u2019ve said before, yeah, when you have been the only company that has done a dedicated study in a population that traditionally has had lower rates of response with any other HCV therapy that\u2019s been seen, there\u2019s great interest in how therapies are going to perform in this population, and I will say great appreciation to the fact that we did a very comprehensive 400-patient study in these patients to be able to provide them some granularity in terms of how sub-populations of cirrhotics will perform. Their view is we\u2019re not\u2014we understand there\u2019s a population, but the individual clinician is going to be treating the 1a cirrhotic relapsed patient \u2013 they're not going to be looking at a blended population when they make their choice, and that\u2019s exactly what payors want to be seeing. So I\u2019d say there\u2019s been a very robust interest in those data.","Maybe I could go ahead with regard to the JAK question. Certainly we have two selective JAK1 programs ongoing, our partnered program with Galapagos and then our own internal ABT-494 selective JAK inhibitor. Certainly we\u2019re looking at both of these in rheumatoid arthritis. We\u2019ve also been studying Galapagos in Crohn\u2019s disease. We will be seeing data on our JAK inhibitor on the first part of 2015.","William Chase","On gross margin, I would say that our gross margin profile has been a focus of emphasis on this business going back actually many, many years, even pre-spin. The way we drive those savings is a combination of everything from manufacturing efficiencies to purchasing efficiencies to even lean manufacturing techniques \u2013 that sort of thing. Certainly we\u2019re keeping our eye on all of those balls as we move forward through the LRP.","We expect over the next few years that you\u2019ll see some gross margin profile expansion. A lot of that is going to be driven by the launch of HCV, which as you can imagine, will be a higher margin product relative to our base, so I think you\u2019ll be very happy watching that line develop over the next couple years.","Alex Arfaei \u2013 BMO Capital","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Colin Bristow from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Colin Bristow \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking the questions. Another one on hep-C \u2013 just with regards to what you are seeing in terms of the Solvadi Olysio numbers, how has this changed your internal expectations regarding the number of patients treated and launch ramp? And you talked a little bit about capacity \u2013 where do you think we are now with regards to the sort of percentage of capacity, and what do you assume the limit is here?","On Humira, previously you\u2019ve given some good color on the share and trends in each of the indications. If you could give us an update on this, that would be great. And just one on ABT-199 \u2013 what are your expectations now for potential post-approval monitoring requirements? Do you envisage a scenario where patients are stratified based on tumor bulk regarding whether they need monitoring? Thanks. ","Larry Peepo","Thanks Colin \u2013 this is Larry. I\u2019ll start with some Humira overview, as you mentioned. Certainly we\u2019re seeing very good growth by indication. In general, I would say we\u2019re seeing the rheum growth in kind of the mid to high single digit range. The derm area is growing probably close to mid single digits, and in gastro we\u2019re seeing more strong double-digit growth there. Ex-U.S., it\u2019s a little bit harder to cut it by indication, but as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we continue to see nice double-digit growth across the major markets ex-U.S.","In terms of share at this point in time, we would say that we\u2019re seeing gains in rheum \u2013 we\u2019ve got about a 25% share there. We see steady derm share at about a 40% share, and gastro we\u2019re seeing share gains there and we\u2019re probably about a 45% shareholder there, toggled between number one and number two there, number one in derm. So very pleased with the progress that we\u2019re seeing, strong commercial execution across the board.","The mix of sales right now, we see RA in the U.S. is actually just a little bit below 40% of our overall sales. Ex-U.S., it\u2019s probably around 35%. The gastro space is probably around 25% or so of the overall sales mix, both here in the U.S. and ex-U.S. The derm space is probably in the range of 15% or so of sales in both geographies, and then the remainder is a little heavier ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis component ex-U.S. \u2013 call it 25% or so, and in the U.S. that component is around 20% of our sales mix, so it\u2019s becoming a nicely diversified book of business for us overall in both geographies. ","Scott Brun","Colin, it\u2019s Scott. I\u2019ll go ahead and take the 199 question. So with regard to speculating on post-approval monitoring, obviously a little bit early but as we\u2019ve said today, we\u2019ve been able to successfully remove the requirement for hospitalization for both the low and medium risk patients, which accounts for the majority of the patients, be it either first line or later line. We\u2019re going to continue with hospitalization for the time being on the high risk patients, which as you said are those with the bulkier tumors, but as we include more data on those patients, we\u2019re going to continue to see how we can refine any requirements for that type of monitoring. So I just think we need some more patients under our belts for us to be able to really say what it\u2019s going to look like at the time of launch.","Richard Gonzalez","Colin, this is Rick. I\u2019ll cover the hep-C one. We\u2019re obviously pretty early into this launch, so it\u2019s a little difficult, I think, to project off of one quarter. I\u2019d say it is relatively consistent with how we modeled it. If you go back to the initial PI launches, what you saw was some de-warehousing occurring and then in the first quarter or two it was high, and then it started to flatten out a bit and come down a little bit. So if you think through that and you say that was a model that you wanted to follow, that ultimately you might see it peak, come down, flatten out a bit and then you see another peak occur with the launch of all orals where you see more de-warehousing occur. But at this point, you\u2019re looking at one quarter, you\u2019re looking at one data point, so it\u2019s a little hard to model against that; but I wouldn\u2019t say it was out of the realm of what we anticipated.","As far as capacity is concerned, I think we\u2019ve talked before about the capacity. We do anticipate that there will be some expansion of capacity with all oral coming into the marketplace, so I think we will see, particularly in the United States, some expansion of capacity going forward, so we will see more patients being able to be treated by the time those products get to the marketplace.","Larry Peepo","Thanks Colin; and Elan, we have time for one final question.","Operator","Our final question today is from Mark Goodman, UBS.","Mark Goodman \u2013 UBS","Yes. Can you talk about the PARP and the market, and how you view your product in comparison to the other products?","Scott Brun","Yeah, definitely. Mark \u2013 Scott Brun. So Veliparib, our PARP, one of the things we\u2019ve tried to do differently from the competition is to not just limit the use of the PARP mechanism as monotherapy in genetically deficient tumors, such as breast cancer with the BRCA mutation. So I think you can see from the Phase III trials that we\u2019ve started so far, as a neo-adjuvant therapy in triple-negative breast cancer, these are for women who have been initially diagnosed with breast cancer where we treat with the Veliparib-based regimen prior to therapy to de-bulk the tumor. And then certainly in non-small cell lung cancer which is an area that no other PARP inhibitor has explored, we\u2019re able to go there because we found a way to successfully combine with carboplatin-based chemotherapy. So we\u2019re really looking to more broadly leverage the potential of PARP by using it in combination with chemotherapies reflected in our initial Phase III trials. We have an ongoing Phase II trial where we\u2019re using it in combination with whole brain radiation in patients who have brain metastases from lung cancer. That study is going to be reading out later this year. Looking at a variety of other solid tumors in combination with other chemotherapies as well.","So I\u2019d say through a lot of the work that we\u2019ve been doing, we\u2019ve been able to set the stage to be able to do things with our PARP that, frankly, the competition is not currently pursuing, so I think it really broadens our opportunity for Veliparib as a consequence.

So with that I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Rick.","Rick Gonzalez","Thank you, Larry. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. We\u2019re pleased to report strong Q2 results with adjusted earnings per share of $0.82, exceeding our guidance range for the quarter. This included strong operational sales growth of more than 5% ahead of our outlook for the quarter and adjusted gross margin ratios of more than 80%. ","We delivered this performance with strong and balanced growth across our product portfolio despite the impact of generic competition. And today we raised our full-year EPS guidance for 2013, reflecting continued momentum from HUMIRA and better than expected results from our other pipeline products including our lipid franchise.","We\u2019re now seven months into our first year as an independent company and we continue to make good progress executing our key business priorities including maximizing HUMIRA\u2019s full growth potential and advancing our pipeline. Our Q2 performance was led by HUMIRA which drove nearly 13% global operational growth. We continue to see strong underlying demand globally with particularly robust growth in dermatology and GI categories. ","As we\u2019ve said previously there are several factors we expect will continue to drive momentum, including increased biologic penetration rates, further geographic expansion, and new indications. HUMIRA offers the broadest label in the category. Our expanding list of uses includes nine approved indications in Europe and seven in the US, and we have several indications currently in late-stage trials. All told we expect new indications including those approved in 2012 to add roughly $1.5 billion in incremental global (inaudible) sales.","HUMIRA\u2019s utility and label supporting use across the broadest spectrum of autoimmune conditions is one of the many attributes that sets it apart from other products in this category. As we track new competitive entrants, performance continues to be in line with our expectations with HUMIRA continuing to gain or hold market share across indications. As I said, HUMIRA is off to a strong start in the first half of the year and as a result we now expect global HUMIRA sales growth of 14% to 15% on an operational basis in 2013. This is an increase from our previous outlook of low double-digit growth. ","Beyond HUMIRA we also saw a strong performance from several other products including double-digit growth of CREON, Synthroid, Zemplar and Duodopa. Bill will provide more color on HUMIRA\u2019s performance as well as some of the other products in our portfolio.","So today I\u2019ll spend some time discussing a few of our pipeline programs. Certainly pipeline development is critical to our long-term success and we\u2019re very pleased with the progress we\u2019ve seen across our mid- and late-stage pipeline programs so far this year. Over the past year and the past several months we\u2019ve also presented important data that support our advancing pipeline and illustrate its potential to address some of the most pressing areas of medical need.","I\u2019ll start with our late-stage HCV program where we recently completed enrollment in all six of our Phase III studies that will be included in our initial regulatory submissions. Over the past several months we presented additional data from our large Phase II-b Aviator study which enrolled as a reminder 571 non-cirrhotic patients. Data presented at the EASL and DDW meetings showed patients with high SVR cure rates regardless of baseline characteristics associated with lower response to interferon therapies including baseline viral load and level of fibrosis.","As I said before, our goal is to maximize SVR rates across various patient types, from na\u00efve patients to the most difficult to treat with the simplest possible therapy, and large body of data that we\u2019ve collected and presented thus far certainly support our objective.","Recently our direct-acting antiviral combination was designated as a breakthrough therapy by the FDA, underscoring its promise in the treatment of HCV. As I\u2019ve said, we\u2019re very pleased with the progress that we\u2019re making in our Phase III program. We expect registrational studies to begin to read out later this year and early into 2014 supporting regulatory submission in Q2 2014 and market entry in early 2015.","In addition to our late-stage efforts we\u2019re also advancing a compelling next-generation HCV program including a potent protease inhibitor, ABT-493, and a new NS5A inhibitor ABT-530. In preclinical studies these promising assets have shown pan-genotypic activity and excellent activity against key resistant mutants. These next-generation assets also support once daily dosing as well as the ability to co-formulate. ","Our development program is progressing well and we\u2019re on track to begin Phase II studies this year. Suffice it to say we are very committed to this therapeutic category and will continue to work to evolve the treatment paradigm.","Now turning to our oncology pipeline which includes several mid- and late-stage assets in development for more than a dozen different cancers. At the recent ASCO and EHA meetings we presented additional data on ABT-199, our first-in-class Bcl-2 inhibitor in development in partnership with Roche Genentech. These data showed strong single agent activity across a number of hematological malignancies including CLL, NHL, and mantel cell lymphoma. ","We recently started a large Phase II single agent single arm study in relapsed refractory CLL patients with 17P chromosome deletions. We believe this study has the potential to be a registrational trial and plan to engage with the FDA to confirm our view. While these patients represent the most difficult to treat early data have been promising.","In collaboration with our partner we also expect to begin a Phase III comparative trial, a combination study in relapsed refractory CLL that will evaluate ABT-199 plus Rituxan versus Rituxan plus chemotherapy. We plan on starting that in the next six to nine months. We believe that ABT-199 represents a potentially transformational approach to the treatment of CLL and other hematological malignancies and are working to quickly advance this asset.","Now moving to our next oncology asset, ABT-888, our PARP inhibitor. We believe this compound holds promise in enhancing the effectiveness of common chemotherapy and radiation. We have a number of mid-stage studies underway including trials evaluating 888 plus chemotherapy in breast cancer, ovarian cancer, non-small cell lung cancer as well as a study of 888 in combination with whole brain radiation in patients with brain metastases. ","We\u2019ll learn much more about the efficacy and utility of this compound as we expect a number of studies to complete over the next six to twelve months. It\u2019s likely that we will initiate Phase III studies with ABT-888 in the same timeframe as well.","Moving on to ABT-126, our Alpha-7 NNR agonist in development for Alzheimer\u2019s and cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia or CIAS. Earlier this month results from our initial Phase II-a proof of concept study in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer\u2019s dementia were presented at the Alzheimer\u2019s Association International Conference. ","These data demonstrated evidence that ABT-126 treatment effect on measures of cognition were present as well as a safety and tolerability profile that supports continued development. We\u2019re exploring a higher does range in our ongoing Phase II-b study where we\u2019re evaluating ABT-126 both as monotherapy and in combination with standard of care. The Phase II-b trial results are on track to complete later this year, and if successful we plan to start a Phase III development in 2014. ","We\u2019re also actively evaluating ABT-126 in mid-stage trials for CIAS. We\u2019ll present Phase II-a proof of concept data for this indication in 2014 and the ongoing Phase II-b study will read out next year as well.","Now moving on to Atrasentan, our internally discovered compound in development for diabetic kidney disease, a common complication of diabetes and the leading cause of chronic kidney disease in the developed world. We presented results from our Phase II-b study at the European Renal Association Congress in May. The mid-stage trial showed treatment with Atrasentan showed significant and sustained reduction of albuminuria, the presence of protein in your urine \u2013 a symptom that is predictive of renal function.","We recently initiated a large, global Phase III program which will evaluate the impact of Atrasentan on renal outcomes such as onset of end-stage renal disease, transplant, or death due to renal failure progression. This study will serve as a single global registration trial for the compound.","While I won\u2019t cover our entire pipeline today we have a number of other promising products in development which I\u2019ll mention briefly here. Daclizumab, currently in Phase III development in partnership with Biogen for multiple sclerosis \u2013 our second pivotal study will read out next year and we\u2019re planning global registration submissions in 2014 as well. Elagolix is being evaluated in Phase III for endometriosis and in Phase II-b for uterine fibroids. We have mid-stage trials on ABT-719 for acute kidney injury which are ongoing. We have two select JAK2 inhibitor programs in development for autoimmune diseases including our partnered asset with Galapagos as well as an internal candidate ABT-494, and we have a number of other exciting programs.","I\u2019ll conclude my remarks this morning with an update on our licensing activity where we continue to be very active. We recently entered into a global collaboration with Alvine Pharmaceuticals to develop a novel, mid-stage oral compound for the treatment of celiac disease, a common autoimmune disorder. The compound ALV-003 is currently in Phase II development and has the potential to be the first therapy to treat celiac disease. ","Currently there are no approved therapies for this condition and the only option for patients is to attempt to follow a strict lifelong gluten-free diet. Total exclusion of dietary gluten is difficult because gluten is one of the most common food ingredients. Further despite a gluten-free diet up to 60% of celiac patients still have symptoms underscoring the acute need for non-dietary therapies. Alvine will begin a Phase II-b study for this promising compound in the coming months.","We also recently extended our clinical development collaboration with Galapagos to include Crohn\u2019s Disease. Galapagos plans to begin a Phase II in this indication by early 2014. The Phase II program in Crohn\u2019s will be performed in parallel with the Phase II-b study in rheumatoid arthritis which was recently initiated.","So in summary we\u2019re pleased with our performance in the first half of 2013. In Q2 we saw another strong performance across our portfolio including double-digit growth from HUMIRA, CREON, Duodopa, Zemplar and Synthroid. We delivered higher than expected gross margin ratios and we continued strong levels of investment spending across both our marketed products and our pipeline opportunities. ","And we made significant progress in advancing our pipeline. We presented compelling data on a number of compounds, we moved a promising asset into Phase III development, and we augmented our mid-stage pipeline with two opportunities to build upon our expertise and our leadership in the GI field. We expect continued pipeline advancement over the next 12 to 18 months including late-stage trial completions, regulatory filings, and new product approvals.","With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill.","Bill Chase","Thank you, Rick. Today I\u2019ll spend some time talking about our Q2 performance as well as our outlook for the remainder of 2013. As Rick said, we feel very good about the strong quarter and year-to-date performance we delivered. Q2 adjusted earnings per share, excluding non-cash intangible amortization expense and specified items were $0.82, exceeding our previous guidance range. On a GAAP basis earnings per share were $0.66. ","Total sales in the quarter increased 5.1% on an operational basis which excluded an unfavorable 0.7% impact from foreign exchange. Excluding TriCor and Trilipix which are experiencing a loss of exclusivity, total sales increased 10.3% on an operational basis. Growth in the quarter was driven by HUMIRA which had global sales of more than $2.6 billion, up nearly 13% on an operational basis. In the US HUMIRA sales increased 16% driven by continued market expansion and share gains in dermatology and gastroenterology.","We\u2019ve been particularly impressed with HUMIRA\u2019s performance in the gastro segment following our strong UC launch where we\u2019ve already gained significant share globally. Internationally HUMIRA sales grew 10.1% on an operational basis. As expected we saw a modest negative impact from tender timing in some markets, particularly Brazil. Looking ahead to Q3 we expect global HUMIRA sales to grow in line with our updated full-year outlook of 14% to 15%.","AndroGel sales were $258 million in the quarter, down 6.5% versus the prior year. AndroGel continues to maintain a roughly 60% share of the testosterone replacement market. Sales this quarter reflect the year-over-year impact of rebating actions implemented in mid-2012 and certain account losses. We are now forecasting full-year AndroGel sales to be roughly flat versus 2012 levels.","Moving on to our lipid franchise we saw stronger than expected performance in Q2, particularly with Niaspan and Trilipix. US sales of Niaspan were $232 million, up 10% versus Q2 2012. Triplipix sales were $107 million, down 66% due to the entry of generic Fenofibrate in November of 2012. We continue to forecast 2013 sales of less than $1 billion for our combined lipid franchise, reflecting a decline of roughly $1.2 billion.","As we said previously this decline will be most pronounced in Q4 this year due to the expected entry of generic competition for Niaspan in September and the recently announced entry of generic Trilipix earlier this month.","Global sales of Lupron were nearly $200 million in Q2. Lupron continues to hold a leadership position and maintains significant share of the market. For the full year 2013 we expect Lupron sales to be roughly in line with 2012. ","US sales of Synthroid were $153 million in the quarter, up strongly. Snythroid maintains strong brand loyalty and market leadership despite the entry of generics into the market many years ago. For the full year we expect to see Synthroid sales growth in the mid-single digits. ","US sales of CREON were $106 million in the quarter, up more than 20% compared to Q2 2012. Performance in the quarter was impacted by the launch of our new 36,000-lipage unit dose. CREON maintains market leadership in the pancreatic enzyme market where we continue to capture the vast majority of new prescription starts. For the full year 2013 we expect CREON sales to grow at a double digit pace.","Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease which is currently approved in Europe and other international markets performed well in Q2 with growth of nearly 23% on an operational basis. We are pursuing regulatory approval for this product in the United State and expect a PDUFA date in the first half of 2014.","Moving on to our P&L profile, Q2 adjusted gross margin ratio was 80.7% excluding intangible asset amortization and other specified items. This was above our expectations for the quarter due to the impact of product mix across our portfolio including better than expected performance of our lipid franchise which as you know includes some of our highest margin products.","Adjusted R&D was 14.8% of sales in Q2 driven by increased funding of our mid- and late-stage pipeline assets and the continued pursuit of additional HUMIRA indications. Adjusted SG&A was 27.9% of sales in Q2 reflecting heightened investment across our growth brands. Net interest expense was $75 million in the quarter and other income was $7 million. The adjusted tax rate was 22.3% in Q2.","Turning now to our full-year 2013 outlook we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $3.07 and $3.13. This updated guidance contemplates sales of approximately $18.5 billion reflecting strong, balanced performance across our portfolio offsetting the decline in lipids from generic competition. Included in our sales guidance is an estimated negative impact from exchange of approximately 1%.","Given our performance year-to-date including the better than expected sales of our high-margin lipid franchise we are now forecasting a gross margin ratio of around 77.5% for the full year excluding non-cash amortization and specific items. In addition to raising our EPS guidance our performance this year has also allowed us to increase the level of investment behind both our pipeline opportunities and marketed products. ","As a result we now expect R&D expense to be approximately 15% of sales reflecting funding actions in support of our pipeline. And we now expect SG&A expense to be around 26.5% of sales in 2013 reflecting increased investment for continued growth of our key brands including HUMIRA where we\u2019ve identified opportunities to further increase penetration rates across indications.","We continue to forecast net interest expense of approximately $300 million for the full year and we expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 22% in 2013. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance range excludes $0.41 per share of non-cash intangible amortization expense, acquired in-process R&D, and certain specified items primarily associated with operations and ongoing restructuring activities. We expect that earnings per share will be $2.66 to $2.72 on a GAAP basis.","Regarding our Q3 outlook we expect adjusted earnings per share of $0.76 to $0.78. This excludes roughly $0.13 of specified items and non-cash amortization resulting in a Q3 GAAP EPS of $0.63 to $0.65. Our Q3 outlook reflects sales growth in the low-single digits on a reported basis including a modest negative impact from exchange. Our sales guidance for Q3 includes the estimated impact of Trilipix going generic earlier this month and Niaspan going generic in September.","We expect the gross margin ratio for the quarter to be somewhat above our revised full-year guidance and we expect R&D and SG&A as a percent of sales to be in line with our revised full-year outlook.","So in conclusion we\u2019re very pleased with AbbVie\u2019s performance in our first six months as an independent company as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year. And with that I\u2019ll turn it back over to Larry.","Larry Peepo","Thanks, Bill. We\u2019ll now open the call up for questions. Elan, we\u2019ll take our first question.","","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator instructions.) And our first question today is from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin \u2013 Goldman Sachs","A couple questions for you, Scott \u2013 are you there Scott Brun? Great. Okay, so a couple pipeline-related questions. Based on your now Q2 2014 filing timeframe for your all oral Hep C regiment, can you confirm that you are now neck-and-neck with Gilead in this horserace of bringing the all oral regiment to the market? And really most importantly if you could help us to think about what the trajectory might look like, because clearly initially I think people think there\u2019s a lot of low-hanging fruit and how are you and Gilead going to compete in the marketplace? I also think the market assumes that they\u2019re going to get the lion\u2019s share of the market.","And then secondly on ABT-199 the potential registrational trial, can you tell us if the FDA does accept that filing what is the timeframe for bringing ABT-199 to the market? And now since Pharamacyclics\u2019 Exchange A have already filed CLL indication how do you see that marketplace shaking up? It seems that it\u2019s getting somewhat crowded. Thanks a lot.","Scott Brun","Sure thing, Jami. Why don\u2019t I go ahead with the timing and such on the HCV and then I\u2019ll get Rick to talk a little bit about the market potential. So you know, as you said we\u2019re on track for a Q2 \u201914 filing. Acknowledging it\u2019s a very tight race we\u2019re feeling very, very good about our position. We\u2019re very pleased with the progress on the program and certainly it is a top priority for us to be able to move as quickly as possible on the filing. But things are going extremely well in that regard.","Rick Gonzalez","Jami, this is Rick. As far as the market launch obviously we\u2019re planning that these two products will launch very close to one another and we do agree there will be a fair amount of pent-up demand so we\u2019re certainly building up all of the assets we need to be in a position to be able to have an aggressive launch and feel good about our ability to be able to compete effectively in this market. You want to go back to the 199 question?","Scott Brun","Yeah, sure. So with regard to 199, yes \u2013 we just started a large trial looking at ABT-199 as an agent in the treatment of relapsed refractory CLL in patients who have the 17p deletion mutation, which is certainly traditionally a very hard population to treat. Indeed, if this trial is acceptable as a registration trial this could allow us to commercialize ABT-199 in the 2016 timeframe. ","Now Jami, as you said certainly there\u2019s a lot of activity going on with regard to development in the CLL space. We feel that with the exquisite activity of ABT-199, its ability to rapidly reduce tumor burden, it really provides us a number of opportunities to really transform the way that this disease is treated, looking at different paradigms in terms of raising the bar on response with measures such as minimal residual disease where you are clearing the body of tumor to a greater extent than we see with traditional response endpoints; and also looking at the potential to perhaps move away from chronic therapy into more limited-duration and bringing the concept of remission into CLL.","Jami Rubin \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Greg Gilbert with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Greg Gilbert \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, good morning, just a couple. I\u2019m hoping you can quantify that modest tender timing effect on HUMIRA sales. Secondly, sort of a bigger picture question on long-term growth for HUMIRA: as bio-similar versions of products that will compete with HUMIRA become available around the world I\u2019m curious on your view as to whether we will see more or less therapeutic substitution relative to what we\u2019ve seen in the small molecule world. And then I have one follow-up.","Bill Chase","So Greg, it\u2019s Bill Chase. The tender effect internationally was about 4%, so if you normalized for that ex-US growth would have been about 14%.","Greg Gilbert \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. ","Rick Gonzalez","Greg, this is Rick. On the therapeutic substitution, I mean certainly as we\u2019ve said all along we don\u2019t believe that in the area of biologics we\u2019ll see therapeutic substitution that\u2019s similar to oral solids \u2013 that\u2019s for sure. And we still believe that based on the safety track record of a product like HUMIRA, the broad indications and all the other attributes of that product that we would see certainly more modest kinds of erosions compared to anything that you\u2019d see in oral solid deals.","Greg Gilbert \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So safe to say you don\u2019t expect bio-similar versions of other products to create a negative growth scenario for HUMIRA, even if the HUMIRA bio-similar is years off?","Rick Gonzalez","Yeah, I don\u2019t believe it will have a dramatic impact on HUMIRA as an indirect bio-similar competitor.","Scott Brun","Especially if it\u2019s a bio-similar to Remicade for instance which is an infused product relative to an injectable. So we think that anything in that space would not have an impact on injectables like HUMIRA and\/or Enbrel.","Greg Gilbert \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And last is a question on the testosterone market \u2013 you\u2019re obviously big there and may be for some time depending on what you do on biz dev and lifecycle management. What\u2019s going on in that marketplace other than jockeying for contracting positions, formulator positions? What\u2019s up with the growth rate there and when can you get that turned around? Thanks.","Bill Chase","This is Bill Chase again. The growth rate has definitely slowed down versus what we saw last year. The growth in the market year-to-date through May is around 9%. We are seeing some account losses due to competitive pricing but that said we\u2019re maintaining over 60% share. There\u2019s a fair amount of churn in the market. We still think AndroGel is a very, very important brand and we\u2019re confident that the sales will remain flat through the year.","Scott Brun","You know, the 1.62% version of the product now accounts for about two thirds of the overall AndroGel franchise as well.","Greg Gilbert \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Risinger of Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Yes, thanks very much. I have a couple questions. First, in terms of our model the international HUMIRA sales were slightly above, the US were slightly below. I\u2019m just hoping that you could provide a little bit more color on the US performance of up 16% year-over-year. Was there any stocking or destocking in the year-ago quarter or in this quarter? And how should we think about second half US sales growth for HUMIRA? And then my second question is with respect to Duodopa, could you just update us on the potential approval timing and whether to expect a panel? Thanks very much.","Bill Chase","So David, this is Bill Chase. On HUMIRA I think the clearest thing to look at is the scrip trends which in the quarter were about 10% to 11% up in HUMIRA. We obviously did have an impact of price, so when you add it up that 16% was impacted somewhat by some channel changes in the quarter. We\u2019re very, very pleased with that growth and we\u2019re seeing no slowdown whatsoever in the United States. For the full year we expect growth to be in the mid-single digits, roughly split between price and volume in the US and things are going very, very well.","Rick Gonzalez","Did you say mid-single digits?","Scott Brun","Well, the outlook for HUMIRA globally is 14% to 15% this year, and as Bill said in his remarks in Q3 we also expect global growth to be in the 14% to 15%. But US specifically, David, there really shouldn\u2019t be a whole lot of deviation from scrips plus price. And as Bill mentioned there\u2019s obviously always a little bit of puts and takes with the channel as well.","Bill Chase","And David, the US growth was mid-double digits, not mid-single. I\u2019m sorry. ","David Risinger \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Got it.","Rick Gonzalez","Made you a little nervous for a second, huh?","Bill Chase","Sorry about that.","Scott Brun","And David, hi, it\u2019s Scott Brun \u2013 I can take the Duodopa question. So as you know with Duodopa we\u2019ve got a somewhat unique drug device combination system. Consequently we did have some data formatting questions of an administrative nature from FDA. We worked through those, addressed them. The NDA is filed. We\u2019re on a 2014 timeline. Right now we don\u2019t have any sense that there is going to be a panel but certainly as the review progresses we\u2019ll be able to update you on that front.","David Risinger \u2013 Morgan Stanley","And in terms of the 2014 timeline any more clarity \u2013 first half, second half?","Scott Brun","I think we can go ahead and say first half on that.","David Risinger \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Scala of Cowen.","Steve Scala \u2013 Cowen and Co.","Thank you. I have two questions on HUMIRA. You mentioned that the company has identified opportunities to further penetrate existing markets. I\u2019m wondering if you would elaborate and quantify the magnitude of those opportunities. And secondly AbbVie has previously said that HUMIRA has a patent portfolio including over 250 granted or pending patents. Are there any patents in that estate that if investors knew their full nature and content then investors would have a substantially different view of the duration and potential of the franchise beyond 2016 and \u201918? So I\u2019m not asking for you to identify the intellectual property or tell us what it is but since you know what it is I\u2019m just wondering whether we would have a very different view if we were aware of that data. Thank you.","Rick Gonzalez","Okay, this is Rick, Steve. So first on the penetration, we\u2019ve talked extensively about these markets still are penetrated at relatively modest levels. So a lot of our activity that is really driving the growth of HUMIRA across most indications is driven to a great extent by increased penetration and new indications. So I don\u2019t know that I can quantify it for you much more than that but I\u2019d say it\u2019s a substantial part of what we do see in growth as well as in certain markets we\u2019re seeing some additional market share.","As far as the patents are concerned, obviously that\u2019s a highly sensitive issue for us from a competitive standpoint. So I wouldn\u2019t give you any more color other than to say obviously we\u2019re looking at our patent estate in a very appropriate and aggressive way and we will ensure that no one violates those patents. And I\u2019m probably not willing to give you much more color than that.","Steve Scala \u2013 Cowen and Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.","Jeff Holford \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. So just first of all on HUMIRA, following the [Axio SPA] panel do you have any different view coming out of that on what the potential [bold form] indication, revenue potential is for HUMIRA? Just secondly do you have in mind based on what you know about Phase III readouts of when you would actually present your Phase III registration set of data for Hep C? Would we expect EASL next year to be the most likely venue for that? Thank you.","Rick Gonzalez","Why don\u2019t you cover HCV first?","Scott Brun","Hi Jeff, Scott Brun. Why don\u2019t I go ahead and take the HCV first. So yeah, certainly \u2013 it is our plan to have some significant data disclosures of the Phase III Program at EASL for next year. Certainly our full data disclosure plan is still in the works.","Rick Gonzalez","And then Jeff, on [Axio SPA] is a relatively modest opportunity from our perspective in the US. We\u2019d still like to get a label claim going forward but it\u2019s something less than $100 million. Really the big opportunity for [Axio SPA] is in Europe where it\u2019s already approved, and so it doesn\u2019t have any kind of significant magnitude of impact on the overall growth of HUMIRA.","Jeff Holford \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Thanks very much.","Scott Brun","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Shad from JPMC.","Chris Shad \u2013 JPMC ","Great, thanks very much, just two questions here. First on ABT-126, can you talk a little bit about the doses you\u2019re looking at in the Phase II-b relative to the data that was presented a few weeks ago? And then secondly on that product, it seems like the use here most likely might be in combination with Aricept in Alzheimer\u2019s. Can you just talk about your confidence that there\u2019ll be an additive benefit on top of Aricept? I think the data so far has been in a monotherapy setting. ","And then the final question coming back to bio-similar Remicade and the recommendation of full label there, were you surprised at all with the full label? And what are the implications of that for HUMIRA as we think about potential bio-similar competitors, the amount of clinical work they\u2019ll need to get a broad label as we look at the European market? Thanks very much.","Scott Brun","Scott Brun, Chris. On the ABT-126, as you referenced we recently presented proof of concept data looking at ABT-126 as monotherapy in the mild to moderate Alzheimer\u2019s Disease segment. And certainly what we saw there prompted us to move into our Phase II-b trials. I will say we are studying a higher dose range. I don\u2019t want to specifically disclose the doses that we\u2019re looking at right now because this as you know is quite a competitive area. But the Phase II-b program has both monotherapy as well as add-on to Aricept trials.","Certainly with regard to the mechanism of a nicotinic neuronal agonist, we certainly think that there is a potential for add-on or synergy with regard to the cholinergic mechanism by which Aricept results in its activity.","Rick Gonzalez","Okay, and then Chris, this is Rick on the bio-similar. I\u2019ll tell you we were surprised by the recommendation being broad without at least to our knowledge any clinical data to be able to support it. I\u2019d say our position is we don\u2019t think that\u2019s in the best interests of patients. I mean it\u2019s clearly unprecedented to have a biologic that you\u2019re going to get ultimately an indication for that you\u2019ve never studied in humans. And I\u2019d say most of the feedback we get from physicians in Europe, particularly GI physicians I\u2019d say is that they want to see data in here.","So we\u2019ll have to see how it plays out. There\u2019s a lot of time between now and the time HUMIRA will potentially face bio-similar competition so it\u2019s a little early to speculate how that might impact HUMIRA one way or the other. I think we\u2019ll have to see how it plays out.","Chris Shad \u2013 JPMC ","Thank you.","Scott Brun","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Marc Goodman of UBS.","Marc Goodman \u2013 UBS ","Yes, good morning. So you were talking about extra spending because you were doing better on the top line, so that spending, it looked like it was in the $100 million range in the quarter and it\u2019s going to be several hundred million for the year. So is it all HUMIRA or are you going to spend it on other things? Are you increasing sales forces there or is it just marketing? And can you give us a sense is it US or is it overseas?","The second question is on HUMIRA \u2013 can you just give us a sense of the GI part of it, the indication and how much that\u2019s helping? If you can quantify it that would be great. And then third on [Synergist], can you just help us understand how this product does quarter to quarter, what kind of timing we need to be thinking about just in modeling it quarter to quarter. And what happened this quarter relative to last quarter? Thanks.","Bill Chase","Okay, Marc, it\u2019s Bill Chase. On the spending you\u2019re correct \u2013 in our guidance we are raising profile for both R&D and SG&A, and what you\u2019re seeing there is really two different things. First of all on the R&D front we\u2019ve got a lot of programs that are very, very exciting. We\u2019re moving to continue to develop those as rapidly as we possibly can and we think that\u2019s the right thing to do for the long-term. ","On the promotional front, on the SG&A front I think the strong performance of our growth brands has shown that that\u2019s been a very, very effective use of investment and we are going to continue to invest heavily in those brands to make sure that we reach their full-year potential. So that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing. The expense is really on a global basis on the marketing side and certainly on the R&D side it\u2019s across the entire pipeline.","[Synergist], you had asked about the timing of the quarters. What you\u2019ll see with this product is typically the sales are more heavily weighted to the fourth and first quarters of the year. This quarter was obviously much lower based on that gating but typically the bulk of those sales fall in Q4 and Q1. And then with GI again, the gastro segment winds up being probably the fastest growing segment of HUMIRA. We\u2019ve been very, very pleased with both the market growth and our share growth where we\u2019re actually capturing share, and that\u2019s going to be a big part of the HUMIRA story as it develops over the next couple of years.","Rick Gonzalez","Yeah, you know the blended gastro share for us in the US is up about five points, and a lot of that has to do with not only the strength of the UC launch but just in general the marketplace around gastro. In ex-US markets, in Europe in particular we\u2019ve probably gained about a 20% share already in the UC space. So the launch of UC is off to a great start for us. ","Operator","Our next question is from Tony Butler from Barclays.","Tony Butler \u2013 Barclays ","Thanks very much. Scott, could I get you to outline for us the HCV program in Japan? Rick, may I ask you a question around the market in HCV in the US \u2013 do you know the net number of patients that are actually treated today under the care of a physician? And then finally, Bill, one for you: the $70 million Alvine payment was not counted in the non-GAAP earnings \u2013 I think that obviously was cash. And so I\u2019m just curious would that be a consistent practice that you would do with respect to royalty payments and upfront payments for collaborations, not only in this quarter but in the future? Thanks very much.","Scott Brun","Tony, it\u2019s Scott Brun, I\u2019ll start with the HCV Japan question. So as you know the epidemiology of HCV in Japan is very specific, very highly weighted to genotype 1b and then genotype 2. As a consequence our regiment under Phase II study there is a co-formulation of the protease inhibitor ABT-450 with the NS5A 267 and the Ritonavir boost resulting in a two pill once a day regiment. We\u2019re far advanced in our Phase II program and in ongoing discussions with PMDA regarding the transition to Phase III.","Bill Chase","And on the Alvine payment you\u2019re correct. IP R&D we treat as an item which we exclude from our non-GAAP estimates and that is our practice.","Rick Gonzalez","And Tony, as far as the number of patients being treated, the data obviously moves around a little bit but the latest data that we\u2019ve looked at historically, if you look at 2011 roughly 175,000 patients in the G7 were treated. We expect that to grow with these next-generation products to somewhere in the neighborhood of 2x that based on the capacity that we see in the marketplace from a clinical standpoint.","Tony Butler \u2013 Barclays ","Thank you very much.","Scott Brun","Thanks, Tony.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Good morning, thank you for taking the questions. First on ABT-199, based on what we saw at ASCO you seem to have a pretty compelling argument in the relapsed refractory CLL setting. I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s been any progress on tumor lysis syndrome that\u2019s concerned there. And then a follow-up on the Galapagos JAK1. The Phase II-a in RA at [Euler] was a bit disappointing. I\u2019m just wondering if you can just comment on the potential of that drug in RA from your perspective? Thank you.","Scott Brun","Sure, Scott Brun. So let me start with the ABT-199. Yeah, we agree that actually 199 has promise not only in relapsed refractory CLL but across a number of hematologic malignancy. With regard to tumor lysis syndrome which is a direct consequence of the explicit potency of 199 we have been enrolling CLL patients with a revised dosing schedule where we start at a lower dose and ramp up at a more slow rate, and so far so good with regard to the patients that we have been treating under that new protocol. So again, we have a number of CLL studies that are actively enrolling right now and we will continue to accrue more data with this new approach.","With regard to the Galapagos data, we\u2019re certainly not disappointed in the results. I think you need to be aware that the data that was generated included relatively small cohorts of 15 to 20 patients. And while yes, you can single out specific response metrics and bring up some questions with regard to what they mean, if you look in aggregate across all of the measures included in this study \u2013 the deaths, 28; the various ACRs \u2013 we feel that there is a very clear dose response relationship. But again, we\u2019re going to characterize much more clearly in the large Phase II-b study that includes a variety of doses.","Alex Arfaei \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Thank you.","Rick Gonzalez","Thanks, Alex. Operator, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","And our final question today is from Damien Conover with Morningstar.","Damien Conover \u2013 Morningstar ","Great, good morning, thanks for taking the questions. I have two questions. The first one, given the recent recommendation by the US Preventative Taskforce to provide Hepatitis C diagnostic testing, I was wondering if you thought there\u2019d be an increase in the relatively low amount of patients that are currently diagnosed; and also whether or not you think Medicare will start to pay for the sort of diagnostic testing outside of folks that are currently higher risk patients. ","And then just one other quick question on the Patient-Centered Outcome Research Institute, one of their first head-to-head studies is looking at comparative effectiveness from an anti-TNF-alpha versus steroids for Crohn\u2019s and UC. And I just wanted to see how well you feel HUMIRA is positioned against steroids. And then also just generally speaking within this patient group, these patients have refractory to steroid treatment or do they generally move right on to HUMIRA? Thank you.","Scott Brun","Scott Brun, why don\u2019t I go ahead with the HUMIRA questions. So certainly I can\u2019t speak to details of the comparative effectiveness trial that you\u2019re referring to, but certainly we feel the data that we have generated to date demonstrates the very compelling activity that HUMIRA provides in these steroid refractory patients. I think you need to be somewhat careful depending on the design of these comparative effectiveness trials. Certainly we\u2019ve seen other type trials that again, with real world experience if you\u2019re not carefully randomizing there can be biases with regard to how patients are included in certain treatments that could limit interpretation. And again I apologize I can\u2019t provide more specifics on this design since I\u2019m not familiar with it.","Rich Gonzalez","Okay, and Damien this is Rick Gonzalez. As far as the HCV diagnosis, I mean it\u2019s fairly well known that there are a large number of patients in the G7 that are still undiagnosed, in the US as well. And so I think screening more patients to find out those patients that are infected are a good thing, both patients as well as the market itself. I think as far as the expansion, I mean clearly we could see greater numbers of patients being treated as more and more physician capacity comes online, and we\u2019ll have to see how that plays out over time. Even without that this is a very, very large market.","So and your final point was as far as Medicare paying for it, I think that\u2019s a little tough for us to call one way or another. With the recommendation I think there\u2019s certainly a higher likelihood of that but it\u2019s a little hard to judge at this point.","Damien Conover \u2013 Morningstar ","Great, thank you.","Rick Gonzalez","Thanks, Damien. And that concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Welcome to the AbbVie fourth quarter 2013 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions.] I would now like to introduce Mr. Larry Peepo, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Larry Peepo","Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Chase, Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Joining us for the question-and-answer portion of the call are Laura Schumacher, Executive Vice President of Business Development, External Affairs, and General Counsel; and Scott Brun, Vice President of Clinical Development.","Rick will begin by discussing AbbVie\u2019s results from 2013 as well as highlights from our late stage pipeline. Bill will give a more detailed review of our fourth quarter performance and then discuss our outlook for 2014. Following our comments, we\u2019ll take your questions.","Before we get started, I remind you that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.","Additional information about the factors that may affect AbbVie\u2019s operations is included in our 2012 annual report on Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.","On today\u2019s conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie\u2019s ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website at www.abbvieinvestor.com.","So, with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Rick.","Rick Gonzalez","Thank you, Larry. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. As our first year as an independent company, 2013 certainly was an important year for AbbVie, one in which we set a strong foundation for the future. We\u2019re pleased with our performance, and as we look back of the year, we believe we exceeded expectations on all the goals we established for the organization.","We completed a seamless transition to operating as an independent country. We drove continued strong growth of Humira and several other key products in our portfolio. We delivered operational efficiencies, including improvements in gross margin. We made notable progress advancing our pipeline, including our late-stage HCV program as well as promising assets in our oncology portfolio.","We expanded our pipeline with the addition of several novel assets, and we exceeded our financial commitments to shareholders, generating strong financial results. As detailed in our earnings release, we delivered 3% global operational sales growth in 2013, despite losing nearly $1.1 billion in revenue due to generic competition in our lipid franchise.","Excluding sales from our lipid franchise, sales in 2013 increased nearly 10% on an operational basis. And we exceeded our original EPS guidance range, with full year 2013 adjusted earnings per share of $3.14, demonstrating the strength of our underlying business.","Our performance was led by Humira, where we added more than $1 billion in sales growth again in 2013 with more than 15% in operational growth for the year. And the dynamics are favorable for continued sales growth from Humira again in 2014. This year, we expect to deliver low double-digit global operational growth for the brand.","We also saw strong performance from several other products in 2013, including Creon, Synthroid, Synagis, and Duodopa. We expect that each of these products, which hold leadership positions in their respective markets, will remain important contributors to our performance in the coming year.","As we look forward to the future, one of the biggest priorities we have as a company is restoring our legacy of strong growth in 2015 and beyond. To position ourselves to achieve this objective, we view 2014 as a year of investment in our pipeline, our leading brands, and our upcoming product launches. This includes preparation for the launch of our interferon-free HCD combination, which we now expect to occur in the U.S. in 2014.","From a revenue perspective, as we\u2019ve said before, 2014 is a year of transition, as we absorb the remaining impact from the loss of exclusivity in our lipid franchise. We expect growth from our key brands to roughly offset the decline in lipids, and at this point, we have not included any potential revenue from our U.S. HCV launch in our 2014 revenue forecast.","As a result of all of these dynamics, we expect adjusted 2014 EPS of $3.00 to $3.10. Bill will provide more specific details regarding our planning assumptions for 2014 during his remarks.","We believe AbbVie has a unique investment identity, as we offer both a strong return to shareholders along with promising pipeline prospects. As you know, our business generates significant cash flow, and we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders. Our primary means to do so will continue to be our strong dividend.","We recognize the importance of a growing dividend to our shareholders, despite a flat top line and investment trends in 2014. As a result, upon final board approval, we expect a 5% increase in our quarterly common dividend, beginning with the dividend payable in May 2014.","We\u2019ve also utilized our strong cash flow to enhance our pipeline through licensing and partnering activities. In 2013, we added promising assets to our mid-stage pipeline. We view licensing and partnering as an important component of our R&D strategy, and we expect to continue to augment our pipeline in 2014 and in the coming years.","As a biopharmaceutical company, pipeline advancement is an important component to our long term success. We place a tremendous amount of organizational focus in this area, and over the past year we\u2019ve achieved a number of important development milestones.","Certainly, one of the more significant near term pipeline opportunities is our interferon-free HCV combination. AbbVie\u2019s multinational HCV program is the largest all-oral interferon-free clinical program in genotype 1 patients conducted to date. Genotype 1 is by far the most prevalent genotype in the developed world, and is roughly evenly distributed between genotype 1a and genotype 1b in the G7 markets.","Our Phase III program includes more than 2,300 genotype 1 patients and clinical sites in more than 25 countries around the world. The comprehensive program was designed to characterize the performance of AbbVie\u2019s therapy across genotype 1 populations. And importantly, because we have conducted independent studies in specific patient populations, we will be able to characterize performance in each patient type, with a very high degree of confidence and certainty.","Our goal is to maximize SVR rates across various patient types, from na\u00efve patients to the most difficult to treat, such as nonresponders to interferon-based therapy or patients with advanced liver fibrosis or cirrhosis. The large body of data we\u2019ve collected and presented thus far certainly supports our objective and demonstrates that we have a very compelling offering for patients and for physicians.","We\u2019ve now disclosed top line results from all six of our registrational studies. Late last year, we announced results from our two placebo controlled studies, the SAPPHIRE trials, which showed that in both na\u00efve and treatment experienced patients, our therapy, plus ribavirin, produced very high SVR rates of 96%.","Our combination produced consistent and virtually identical efficacy results across both na\u00efve and experienced patients and there were no differences observed between genotype 1a and genotype 1b patients. Additionally, the therapy was well-tolerated, with discontinuations due to adverse events reported in only 1% of patients receiving the combination.","This morning, we reported top line results from the four remaining Phase III trials. Our 380-patient TURQUOISE-II study is the only dedicated trial of an all-oral therapy in the difficult to treat cirrhotic patient population. Results from the trial show that 92% of the patients treated with our combination for 12 weeks achieved SVR 12 and 96% of the patients treated for 24 weeks also achieved SVR 12.","Results from the PEARL-II study showed that 100% of genotype 1 experienced patients treated with our combination without ribavirin achieved SVR 12. Results from the PEARL-III trial showed that 99% of genotype 1b na\u00efve patients treated with our combination with or without ribavirin achieved SVR 12.","We\u2019re particularly pleased with the high level of efficacy demonstrated in the genotype 1b population, which represents roughly half of the genotype 1 patients in the G7 markets. The PEARL-IV study showed that of even the more difficult to treat genotype 1 patients, 97% of patients treated with our therapy and ribavirin achieved SVR 12, and 90% of the patients in the ribavirin free arm achieved SVR 12.","So these data clearly demonstrate that our interferon-free offering provides a very high level of efficacy across genotype 1 patients with ribavirin providing additional benefit in some patients. As we look at the HCV market, and we consider which patients will likely be treated in the 2015 to 2017 timeframe, we believe the most advanced patients, those with fibrosis, cirrhosis, and patients who have previously failed treatment, will be treated first.","Given that these patients tend to be more difficult to treat, we believe most physicians will likely continue to use ribavirin to optimize the likelihood of cure. Based on the high levels of efficacy demonstrated by our therapy in these tougher to treat patients, we believe we\u2019re very well positioned for success in this market.","And while our initial combination represents a simple therapy, we\u2019re working to further simplify our initial HCV combination with efforts underway to reduce the number of pills through coformulation of all the components into a once-daily combination. We\u2019ve begun the necessary pharmacokinetic studies and are working to advance this enhancement.","We also continue to make good progress with our HCV program in Japan, where we recently started Phase III development. Japan represents the second largest HCV market globally, and we believe we\u2019re well-positioned relative to competitive offerings.","Given the prevalence of genotype 1b in the region, we\u2019ve advanced our 12-week 2DAA ribavirin free treatment in Japan. As a result, we expect to have a two pill once a day combination for this market. We\u2019ll present data from our Phase II program later this spring, and expect to submit our regulatory application in Japan in 2015.","We believe the HCV market will remain very large and attractive for many, many years to come. to that end, we\u2019ve recently begun a Phase II study of our next-generation HCV program, which includes a potent protease inhibitor, ABT493, and our new NS5A inhibitor, ABT530.","It\u2019s our goal with our next-generation program to bring to market a ribavirin free once daily pangenotypic combination. In preclinical studies, our next-generation assets have shown pangenotypic activity and excellent activity against key resistant mutants. They also support once daily dosing without ritonavir as well as the ability to coformulate. We\u2019ll present data from these promising assets later this year.","While HCV represents a significant and important opportunity, our pipeline includes many other promising assets. As we evaluate our pipeline prospects, including the number and potential of the opportunities, we believe our pipeline is the most robust it has ever been. We\u2019re particularly enthused about our late stage pipeline, where we currently have 10 programs in Phase III development or in for registration. And we\u2019re on the cusp of transitioning several additional programs into late stage trials.","Our late stage oncology pipeline includes several mid and late stage assets in development for more than a dozen different cancer types. Earlier this month, we entered Phase III development for two internally discovered assets in our oncology pipeline: ABT199 and ABT888. In collaboration with our partner, we recently began a Phase III comparative combination study of ABT199 in relapsed refractory CLL patients. We view ABT199 as an exciting compound within our pipeline and we\u2019re working quickly to advance this asset.","In addition to our vanguard indication of CLL, we\u2019re exploring ABT199 in a number of different hematological malignancies, including non-Hodgkins lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and AML.","Following the encouraging efficacy results from the I-SPY 2 clinical trial, we recently started a Phase III study of our PARP inhibitor, ABT888, for [unintelligible] treatment of triple negative breast. We\u2019ll learn much more about the efficacy and utility of ABT888 across a variety of cancer types this year, as our ongoing studies complete. We expect to start registrational studies in other indications in 2014 as well.","Elotuzumab is currently in Phase III development for multiple myeloma in collaboration with our development partner. Data to date have shown promising efficacy in terms of tumor responses and delay of disease progression. Two Phase III studies are ongoing with results expected in early 2015.","Daclizumab is our biologic in development for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. Results from the second registrational study will read out in mid-2014, supporting regulatory submission for daclizumab later this year. Despite advances in the MS category, there continues to be a significant need for safe, high-efficacy agents, and we believe daclizumab has the potential to deliver the right balance of high efficacy, a manageable safety profile, and a high level of patient compliance.","Elagolix is our compound in late stage development for the treatment of endometriosis. Elagolix has a unique profile, with the potential to provide symptom relief and reduction while avoiding adverse effects that can sometimes be associated with current treatments. We\u2019ll see initial data from the first of two pivotal studies in endometriosis in the second half of 2014. The Phase IIB study in uterine fibroids, which we initiated last year, also continues to progress well.","Altrasentan is our internally discovered compound in development for the treatment of diabetic kidney disease. In 2013, we initiated a large global Phase III registrational study. This trial, which will serve as a single global registrational trial, is expected to complete in 2017.","We also have two new Humira indications currently in late stage trials, and we have Duodopa currently under regulatory review. And in addition to the late stage programs I just outlined, we also have numerous promising mid-stage programs across therapeutic areas that we focus on, including several in immunology, where we have two JAK1 programs and several biologics in development.","We\u2019ve been pleased with our pipeline program over the past year, and we look forward to a number of important pipeline milestones in the year ahead. This includes numerous Phase III initiations, data readouts from multiple programs across our pipeline, the submission of regulatory applications for two major late stage programs, and potential product approvals.","So in closing, we\u2019ve had a very successful first year. We feel good about the high level of execution on our strategic priorities. We\u2019re focused on continuing to drive leading performance with our flagship product, Humira, as well as other products in our specialty focus portfolio, and we continue to make good progress advancing our pipeline, which includes a number of exciting programs that have the potential to address significant medical need.","As we look forward to 2014, we\u2019re focusing on maintaining our momentum while investing appropriately to ensure a successful future. We\u2019ve set an excellent foundation for the company in order to deliver strong growth in 2015 and beyond.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on the fourth quarter and 2014. Bill?","Bill Chase ","Thank you, Rick. This morning, I\u2019ll start with an overview of our fourth quarter performance and then I\u2019ll provide our outlook for 2014. We delivered a strong fourth quarter, capping off a year of excellent performance. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.82, excluding noncash intangible amortization expense and specified items. This exceeded our outlook for the quarter. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share were $0.70.","Total sales in the fourth quarter exceeded $5.1 billion, ahead of our outlook. Sales decreased 1.1% on an operational basis, which excludes an unfavorable 0.7% impact from foreign exchange. Excluding sales from our lipid franchise due to loss of exclusivity, total sales increased 7.9% on an operational basis.","Fourth quarter growth was led by Humira, which had global sales of more than $3 billion, up 13.4%. We continue to see strong growth in the underlying markets, and a positive impact from the global launch of the UC indication, which continues to progress very well.","In the U.S., Humira sales increased 18.1%, reflecting continued market expansion as well as share gains, particularly in the gastro segment. Internationally, Humira sales grew 8% on an operational basis.","As we forecasted in October, international growth was somewhat lower in the quarter, due to the impact of tender timing with [unintelligible] growth in the third quarter. International growth is being driven by continued uptake of new indications, share gains, and double digit growth in most countries. For the full year, international Humira sales increased nearly 12% on an operational basis.","Global Humira sales for 2013 were $10.7 billion, up roughly 15%, exceeding our original forecast for the year. As Rick mentioned, in 2014 we expect global Humira sales to grow at a low double-digit pace, excluding the impact of foreign exchange.","Androgel sales were $289 million in the fourth quarter, down versus the prior year, reflecting continued moderation of market growth and other dynamics. Androgel remains the testosterone replacement market leader, with more than 60% market share and achieved share gains during the second half of 2013. In 2014, we expect Androgel to be flat to somewhat down, as market conditions stabilize and we lap the impact of [rebating] actions and account losses in early 2013.","As expected, all of the products in our lipid franchise are now experiencing generic competition. Sales of Niaspan were $31 million and TriCor\/Trilipix sales were $29 million, both down significantly versus the fourth quarter of 2012. As forecasted, the decline in the lipid franchise was most pronounced in the fourth quarter, and in 2014 we expect these trends to continue.","Global Lupron sales were $209 million in the quarter, roughly flat on an operational basis. For the full year 2013, Lupron sales were $785 million. Lupron continues to hold a leadership position and maintains significant share of the market. In 2014, we expect Lupron sales to be down modestly from 2013.","U.S. sales of Synthroid were $189 million in the quarter, up 12.8%, with full year sales up roughly 13%. Synthroid maintains strong brand loyalty and market leadership, despite the entry of generics into the market many years ago. In 2014, we expect to see similar growth trends for Synthroid.","U.S. Creon sales were $115 million in the fourth quarter, up 9.3%. Creon maintains its leadership position in the pancreatic enzyme market where we continue to capture the majority of new prescription starts. We expect high single digit sales growth for Creon in 2014.","Sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease, grew 15.7% on an operational basis this quarter. Duodopa is currently approved in Europe and other international markets. In 2014, we expect continued double-digit growth for Duodopa, and in the U.S. we expect a regulatory decision on our filing in the first half of this year.","Moving on to our fourth quarter P&L profile, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 77.1%, excluding intangible amortization and other specified items. This was in line with our expectations for the quarter, and reflected operational efficiencies and product mix across our portfolio, including Humira.","Adjusted SG&A was 26.5% of sales in the fourth quarter, reflecting heightened investment in our growth brands. And adjusted R&D was 15.6% of sales, driven by increased funding of our emerging mid and late stage pipeline and the continued pursuit of additional Humira indications.","Net interest expense was $68 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 22.2% in the fourth quarter.","Now I\u2019d like to discuss our outlook for 2014 and specifically how we\u2019ve constructed our plan for the year. As Rick mentioned, we are now expecting a U.S. approval for our HCV regimen in 2014. As you know, we\u2019ve seen these types of products launch quickly, generating significant sales early in the launch.","Since we cannot yet forecast the specific date of our approval, our guidance for 2014 excludes any revenue benefit associated with the upcoming HCV launch. We have, however, included the appropriate level of investment to launch the brand, reflected in higher SG&A expense this year. We\u2019ll keep you apprised of our program status as the year progresses.","In the meantime, you should model the year as follows. We expect the total company 2014 sales of approximately $19 billion, reflecting growth from our key marketed products offsetting the remaining decline in lipids from generic competition. Included in our sales guidance is an estimated negative impact from exchange of roughly 1% for the full year.","We\u2019re committed to improving our gross margin ratio in 2014, despite the loss of high margin lipid sales. As a result, we are forecasting an adjusted gross margin ratio approaching 79% for the year, reflecting actions we\u2019ve taken to further improve our margin profile. As we\u2019ve noted, we currently have a record number of Phase III programs in active development, and are on the cusp of transitioning additional programs in 2014.","We have a number of exciting opportunities in oncology, HCV, and immunology, and other areas that warrant investment. As a result, we expect R&D expense to be around 16% of sales, reflecting an increase in R&D spending over the prior year. We also expect to see an increase in SG&A as we invest in our key brands, including Humira, where we\u2019re pursuing opportunities to further increase penetration rates across indications and drive both disease and brand awareness.","And, as I noted with our U.S. HCV launch in 2014, we\u2019ll be making the appropriate investments this year to maximize the potential for this important program. Therefore, we expect SG&A expense to approach 28% of sales in 2014, an increase over the 2013 profile.","We are forecasting net interest expense of about $275 million for the full year, and we continue to expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 22% in 2014. Given this profile, we are forecasting an adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $3. 00 to $3.10. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance range for the year excludes $0.37 per share, primarily related to noncash amortization expense and ongoing separation costs.","Regarding our first quarter outlook, we expect adjusted earnings per share in the first quarter of $0.67 to $0.69. This excludes roughly $0.08 of specified items and noncash amortization, resulting in a first quarter EPS in the range of $0.59 to $0.61 on a GAAP basis.","Our first quarter outlook reflects a flat top line, including roughly 1% negative exchange. We expect a gross margin ratio somewhat in line with our full year guidance and we expect R&D and SG&A as a percentage of sales to be higher than our full year outlook, consistent with historic quarterly trends.","So, as we look back, we are very pleased with AbbVie\u2019s performance in our first year as an independent company. We delivered on our commitments, and exceeded our original forecast for earnings per share. Looking forward, 2014 will be an exciting year, with numerous data milestones, key product submissions, and continued execution across the organization. The investments we\u2019re making this year are expected to drive meaningful growth in 2015 and beyond.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Larry.","Larry Peepo","Thanks, Bill. We\u2019ll now open the call for questions. Operator, we\u2019ll take our first question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Our first question today is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs","Question is regarding the whole hep C marketplace. Now we\u2019ve seen all of your data, we\u2019ve seen all of Gilead\u2019s Phase III data. We\u2019ve also seen the initial launch of Solvadi, which is clearly very, very strong. And then I\u2019m just wondering if you can sort of opine with us, how do you see the market shaping up? And just in terms of, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d want to provide any of your views in terms of market share differences, but how do you see the market share playing out between these [unintelligible]?","And then secondly, if you could talk about Humira and if you could confirm some of the [unintelligible] patents on Humira and what that might mean longer term for biosimilar competition.","Rick Gonzalez ","As far as the launch that we\u2019ve seen so far in the ramp in the HCV market, with the Gilead product, I think it\u2019s going as we would have expected it. This is a market, as Bill pointed out, that you get very rapid uptake. It will be important to see how much of the uptake is in genotype 2 and 3 patients, and how much of it is the impact of the existing PIs that are in the market today.","And so it doesn\u2019t surprise me at all, but it doesn\u2019t take a lot of patients to get that level of sales with these kinds of products. And it\u2019s one of the reasons why one, we\u2019re excited about the market, and two, ultimately it\u2019s one of the reasons why we chose not to build into our forecast the launch, because even a couple of months different can have a substantial impact on the performance of the business.","As far as how we\u2019ll compete in the marketplace, you\u2019ve seen all of our data, you\u2019ve seen the competitive data. We feel very good about the data. As we look at this market, as I indicated in my comments, and the dynamics of the patients that are likely to be treated first, and the other capabilities that you\u2019re going to need to have to be successful in this market from a commercial standpoint, from a market access standpoint around the world, I think we\u2019re very well positioned.","And as I said, if I look at the profile of our therapy, if I just go through each of the category of patients, you look at our cirrhotic data, it\u2019s the only trial that\u2019s ever been done in dedicated cirrhotic patients, clearly unprecedented results compared to standard of care. And I think we\u2019re very pleased with what we saw out of that trial for cirrhotic patients. If you look at our experience data, 96% [SER12]. When I look at that in comparison with the published ION2 data, with ribavirin, it matches up very nicely against that at 96.3 or 96.4.","If I look at genotype 1b naives, 99% without ribavirin. If I look at genotype 1b experienced without ribavirin, 100%. And 1bs represent 50% of the total population that we\u2019d be going after. Hard to beat 99% and 100%, so we obviously feel very good about that. And if you look at genotype 1as, with ribavirin, at 97%, highly tolerable therapy, very low adverse event rates, we feel good about our ability to stack up against anything that we\u2019ve seen out there and be able to compete very effectively against that.","It\u2019s a big market. It\u2019s a market I think that very clearly, if you look at payers, if you look at health systems around the world, if you talk to physicians and patients, they want alternatives, especially alternatives that perform at this level. And so I think we\u2019ll do very, very well. And what we\u2019re focusing on now is getting our submission in, getting the product approved, and launching the product aggressively in the marketplace.","Humira, as far as the patents are concerned, we haven\u2019t disclosed publicly a lot of the patent data. We\u2019ve obviously aggressively worked to not only take the existing patent portfolio that we have, which we have a fairly large patent portfolio around process patents, formulation patents, some method patents.","But we have a very large number of applications, in the neighborhood of a couple hundred. Many of those we\u2019ll issue. We believe that those are important patents, and certainly we will make sure that we enforce any patents that we have in this area, and it\u2019s one of the lines of defense that we have put in place, and I think we feel pretty good about it. But we\u2019re not prepared to give you a lot of specifics on any individual patents at this point.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Holford with Jefferies.","Jeff Holford - Jefferies ","Just first off, on the guidance, assuming obviously you\u2019re not including any revenues in the guidance, can we just safely assume, if you do get revenues that flow through in 2014, that would essentially be upside for the earnings guidance as well?","Secondly, I wonder if you can just help us think about your SG&A phasing through the year. When would you anticipate that we start to see the load from the hep C cost savings in the SG&A? Also, just in terms of the fixed dose combination, on the current [unintelligible] regimen, are you assuming you\u2019ll have to do a full Phase III there or would your development plan on that just be more like a bridging study?","Rick Gonzalez ","Maybe I\u2019ll take the guidance question, and then Bill, you can talk about the gating and SG&A, and Scott, you can talk about the fixed dose combination.","So maybe let\u2019s walk through and give you a little perspective on the timing. As I think you know, we have been given breakthrough therapy status for this product, and we expect to get priority review.","With priority review, we will have an 8 month PDUFA clock. And so we know the outer limits of when approval could occur based on when we\u2019re estimating that we\u2019ll submit to the agency, but as we look to priority reviews - and we\u2019ve seen priority reviews that are as short as 4.5 months, and we\u2019ve seen some that have gone all the way out to 8 months. And so there\u2019s this window that we\u2019re operating in that\u2019s just not clear to us at this point where we will be in that window.","So our goal is to get the submission in as rapidly as possible, and then start to work with the agency on answering any questions that they have. As we get closer through that review process, we will begin to get more clarity as to the timing of that, when we would get that approval, and we\u2019re obviously prepared to be able to launch as soon as we gain approval of the product.","So depending upon when that word would occur, if it was appropriate to adjust a quarterly guidance, we would go ahead and make that adjustment during that quarter. So we\u2019ll just have to see when we hit in that window that I just described to you.","Bill Chase ","On SG&A, obviously we\u2019re going to be doing everything we can to make sure that we live up to the opportunity that we have here. We\u2019re investing right now, but that said, the investment will grow over the course of the year, and we\u2019ll see, on a relative basis, more investment in the back half of the year than the first half.","Scott Brun","On our fixed dose combination, which takes all three of our direct acting antivirals and coformulates them into a once-daily presentation, we\u2019ve got a prototype formulation that has been performing very nicely with our pharmacokinetic assessments in humans. And right now we\u2019re moving forward very aggressively with the program. We\u2019re in discussions with regulatory agencies with regard to exactly what the program will take. And that\u2019s all I want to say about that right now.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Scala with Cowen.","Steve Scala - Cowen & Company ","Of the 2014 guidance for Humira, of low double-digit, can you dissect that by geography, so what we should be looking for in the U.S. and OUS? And in the U.S., how much of that might be from price and how much might be from volume?","Scott Brun","We are obviously guiding low double-digit for the entire year on Humira. It will be a little higher growth in the U.S. than ex-U.S. The pricing on this brand, as you know, we do see pricing pressures ex-U.S. that mute the overall growth ex-U.S. We have had the ability to take some price over the past couple of years in the U.S. So in that double digit guidance, I would expect slightly higher growth in the U.S., because of that pricing effect, but both markets will be above double-digit growth.","Steve Scala - Cowen & Company ","For many reasons, your P&L in 2014 is quite unusual, but it would appear that 2015 promises standout top line growth and substantial margin improvement. At this early juncture, would you have any objection to that thinking?","Bill Chase ","I think it\u2019s obviously a little early to be giving 2015 guidance. There certainly is a dynamic that\u2019s going to play out in \u201915 as we see the full brunt of HCV kick in. So that would certainly expect some gross margin expansion, because we\u2019d expect that to be relatively above our overall corporate mix. Likewise, on gross margin, we will remain committed to driving additional efficiencies. You\u2019ve seen some of that play out in 2013, and certainly we\u2019re signing up for some of that in 2014.","On the investment side, I think a lot\u2019s going to depend on what we have in our pipeline. We\u2019ve made it clear today that we\u2019re expecting to have 10 programs in Phase III or registration this year. We\u2019ve got a very robust pipeline. We\u2019ve got things moving into Phase III in the subsequent years.","And then likewise, on the SG&A side, what we know is Humira is the most promotionally responsive. We\u2019ve driven very, very nice growth on that brand. We have our HCV launch kicking into full gear in 2015, and then of course we\u2019ll have new products launching in the period right after \u201915, and we want to make sure that we provide appropriately for those products and opportunities as well. So we\u2019ll have to see.","Operator","Our next question today is from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets ","A follow up to your comments on TURQUOISE-II. To what extent do you think that trial, having that dedicated Phase II trial in those important patients, is a marketing competitive advantage? And then a couple of followups, if I may. Are we going to see ABT199 data this year? And can you give us some color on the market opportunity for Elagolix?","Scott Brun","With regard to the TURQUOISE-II, when you consider the fact that cirrhotic patients have traditionally been the hardest to treat, and certainly as we see the aging of the HCV population and the rates of cirrhosis going up, we thought it was extremely important to well characterize the response in this patient population.","And so absolutely. We feel these data are going to be of critical value to clinicians, to patients, to payers, in really demonstrating the characterization and certainty of response that you can achieve in this population. And as Rick said, we\u2019re extremely pleased. The results certainly surpassed my initial expectations. They\u2019re unprecedented, and provide considerable benefit over anything that\u2019s currently available.","With regard to 199 data flow, we\u2019re going to be presenting some initial Phase I combination data with ABT199 and Rituxan this year. Remember that that\u2019s the combination that\u2019s being studied in a Phase III trial that\u2019s getting underway that Rick referred to.","We\u2019ll also be showing some additional data in CLL that will demonstrate the longer term durability of our monotherapy, building on the very strong results that we\u2019ve already showed, where we had a 24% complete response in CLL with 199 as a single agent in lapsed refractory patients comparing extremely favorable to the new agents that are currently being studied there. And we\u2019re also hoping to be able to get some AML data out later this year.","Elagolix, currently in Phase III on endometriosis and Phase IIB in uterine fibroids. When you consider endometriosis, a condition that affects millions of women worldwide, resulting in considerable symptomatology for which there are really no good therapies right now. Existing ones, while they may be able to control symptoms, create their own set of problems by really putting women into a menopausal like state.","We feel there is significant potential for elagolix as a chronic therapy in endometriosis, certainly allowing patients to avoid more extreme measures such as surgery, which, when you consider the population of women here who are of an age where they\u2019re considering childbirth, certainly they don\u2019t want to have to take that type of option.","So with regard to its overall tolerability and efficacy profile, certainly we feel that there is very significant opportunity in endometriosis, as well as fibroids. Again, there\u2019s no chronic therapy available and all the other limitations that exist in therapy that I outlined in endometriosis are also present.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Schott with JPMC.","Chris Schott - JPMorgan Chase","I just wanted to follow up on your expectations for the HCV market. Can you talk about how you\u2019re thinking about competition based on price? Is that a lever that you consider to gain share?","Rick Gonzalez ","As we\u2019ve said a number of times, when you look at the attributes of this product, the performance speaks for itself. This is a highly competitive product against anything that we\u2019ve seen out in the marketplace. If you look at our capabilities from a commercial standpoint, and a market access standpoint, I think they speak for themselves as well. You only have to look to Humira, which has a lot more competitors than this market is going to have.","So I think from that standpoint, we feel good about our ability to be able to go into the market and compete effectively. Having said that, I\u2019d also tell you this is a highly competitive market and it\u2019s not prudent for us to lay out what our commercial strategy is going to be, and we\u2019re not going to lay out what our commercial strategy is going to be. And that includes we\u2019re not going to lay out what our pricing strategy is as part of that.","So that\u2019s probably not the answer you were looking for. Sorry, but certainly I think if you were sitting in our chair, that would be the prudent way to deal with this.","Operator","Our next question is from Colin Bristow of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Colin Bristow - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","Hep C in TURQUOISE-II, can you comment either quantitatively or qualitatively on the rates of anemia you\u2019re seeing? Just wanted to get a sense of the tolerability as you think about the real world setting. Also, on TURQUOISE-II, could you speak to the relapse and breakthrough rates in the genotype 1a population and\/or the treatment experience? And with regard to Androgel and the testosterone replacement market, script trends have indicated a modest decline over the last few months, and I just wanted to get your sense or what you\u2019re hearing from the front line regarding this, and your expectations for the overall market in 2014.","Scott Brun","Regarding TURQUOISE-II, first, getting at the tolerability, when you look at the results in both the 12 and the 24 week arms, we saw very low rates of discontinuations for adverse events, only on the order of 2%. Certainly, when you look at rates of anemia, while I don\u2019t want to quote specific numbers, certainly they were not different from what we\u2019ve seen in the non-cirrhotic populations within our program.","Again, I don\u2019t want to parse the TURQUOISE-II data to any greater extent than we\u2019ve released. We\u2019re going to be providing more detail on that at EASL, but you know, what I can say is that we anticipate that the majority of patients will only require 12 weeks of therapy to achieve these very high SVR rates, and certainly the 24 week therapy will likely only be applicable to a very limited minority subset of patients.","Rick Gonzalez ","And on Androgel, certainly the market has slowed, particularly versus what we saw in 2012. That said, we are picking up share and we\u2019ve seen nice progress on that in the back half of \u201913. And frankly, a lot of the pricing pressures are now behind us, and pretty stable. So we\u2019re pretty pleased with our position. That said, we are taking a realistic view of that market and brand in 2014, which is really the logic behind the guidance that we provided this morning.","Operator","Our next question is from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.","Vamil Divan - Credit Suisse ","On the pipeline, one on the ABT888. Just wanted to get a sense of how you see that potentially differentiating itself from other agents in the breast cancer space. Obviously some interesting data so far. But how do you see that playing out? And when will we actually see the data behind that one in breast cancer and the other indications that you mentioned?","And the other one, just on 199, do you see any change in your expectations around that being competitive in the front line or relapse [unintelligible] setting just given the strength we\u2019re seeing with [unintelligible] and the new data they\u2019ve commented on with the early stop of their study there, the strong data?","Scott Brun","With regard to 888 and its ability to differentiate itself from other agents in breast cancer, and certainly it\u2019s important to mention other malignancies as well, certainly there\u2019s some characteristics of [unintelligible] 888 relative to other PARP inhibitors that suggest it may actually be superior. It\u2019s able to cross the blood-brain barrier. And perhaps even more importantly, we\u2019re able to combine effectively with other chemotherapies, where some of the other PARP inhibitors really had challenges with that.","So as a consequence, the other PARP inhibitors are really limiting themselves to cancers with genetic susceptibility to PARP, those with the BRCA mutation, and certainly are also going more into late stage populations. We feel that, again, particularly with veliparib\u2019s abilities to combine with other modalities like platinum chemotherapies and radiations that also damage DNA, that we\u2019re able to have a much broader opportunity with our PARP.","Certainly the [Neoadjuvant] study allows them to take advantage of treating patients with earlier stage triple negative breast cancer. And going even beyond breast cancer, we\u2019ve got ongoing studies with combination therapies in ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and in use with [whole brain] radiation in the case of brain metastases from lung cancer. So we feel that we\u2019re able to fully leverage the full potential of the PARP platform with veliparib as a consequence of these characteristics.","With ABT199, when you look at the exquisite potency of the agent, its ability to drop CLL malignant cell counts in the blood by 90% within 8 hours, we feel that this factor is what\u2019s going to allow us to differentiate. Indeed, later in 2014, collaboration with our partner. We\u2019ll be starting a Phase III study in first line CLL, in combination with GA101.","And the thought here is that through the potency of 199, we can drive disease state to an extremely low level. I referred earlier to the very promising complete response rate that we\u2019ve seen, 24% with 199 as a single agent in patients who have cycled through, on average, four prior therapies. When you look at ibrutinib, in a similar population, those complete response numbers as a single agent are in the low single digits.","And so what we\u2019re doing is working on study designs to, again, really be able to take advantage of the potential to drive to very low levels of disease activity and potentially move away from chronic therapy, which is going to be the case with ibrutinib and [unintelligible], and really look at can we achieve disease free remissions and possibly even functional cures.","Operator","And sir, I am showing no further questions at this time.","Larry Peepo","Okay, terrific. Well, thanks, operator. We\u2019ll conclude today\u2019s call with some final remarks from Rick before I wrap up the call today.","Rick Gonzalez ","Thank you, Larry, and I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining us. As we indicated when we launched the company, we had a primary objective for making sure that we set up the organization in a way that we could be successful in 2013, and I think we accomplished that. And I think we\u2019re off to a good start in 2014.","We always said those would be transition years for us, and that we were setting ourselves up to be able to return to strong growth in 2015 and beyond, and that is still our intent, and I think we\u2019re tracking well against that objective.","If you think about 2015, as Bill mentioned to you, it\u2019s early to talk about guidance, but although we\u2019ll get a positive impact on HCV in 2014, as we launch the product, we will get a very significant impact in 2015. And we\u2019ll be in a position to be able to drive that product and see significant margin drop through in the 2015 timeframe from that product.","In addition, we will have worked our way through the loss of exclusivity of our lipid franchise, which is obviously creating a significant headwind for us in both 2013 and 2014. That will be gone, and we\u2019ll see the emergence of strong Humira growth again driving the bottom line, and we should start to see some efficiencies again in that area as well.","By the same token, we\u2019ll be in a position to be able to start to launch some of the new products that we have in our pipeline. We\u2019re particularly excited about our oncology pipeline with 199, and I will tell you personally I\u2019m excited about what I\u2019ve seen about 888 as well. I think it will have a significant opportunity for us going forward.","Daclizumab will also be a product that we\u2019re excited about that can launch in that 2015 timeframe, and elagolix following that. So I think we have built a robust pipeline that should give us an opportunity to be able to deliver on the expectation that we have for ourselves, and the one that we communicated to you. So we\u2019re looking forward to doing that.","Larry Peepo ","Thanks, Rick. And that concludes today\u2019s conference call.

All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operation Instructions] At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Good morning and thank you for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Severino, Executive Vice President of Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer; and Bill Chase, Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, I want to remind you that some statements made today are or may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.

AbbVie undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.","On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions.","So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. AbbVie delivered another strong quarter, with adjusted earnings per share of $1.42, up 12.7% versus last year and exceeding our guidance range. Our results included strong top-line performance, with global operational sales growth of 8.9%.","HUMIRA continues to drive outstanding performance, with nearly 15% operational growth in the quarter, despite the introduction of new mechanisms of action and competition from indirect biosimilars. In the U.S., HUMIRA grew 18%, reflecting robust underlying demand, including low double-digit prescription volume growth. Internationally, operational sales growth was over 9%, driven by strong market demand.","We continue to be pleased with the robust growth and strong market trends we're seeing across therapeutic categories and geographies. Another major growth driver for our business is IMBRUVICA, which continues to drive strong momentum and strong growth. In the second quarter, global IMBRUVICA sales were $626 million, an increase of more than 42% over the prior year.","We continue to make significant progress establishing IMBRUVICA as standard of care in several hematological cancers. In CLL, our largest single indication, IMBRUVICA is the market share leader in first-line patients, with new patient market share of 24% and total patient market share of 33%. In second-line CLL, IMBRUVICA is now used in more than 70% of patients under treatment.","We're also making good progress in other areas. We expect to receive approval soon of our sixth indication, chronic graft-versus-host-disease, demonstrating IMBRUVICA's broad utility across a wide range of serious conditions. Based on the significant long-term potential of IMBRUVICA, we've recently launched a dedicated sales team focused specifically on NHL indications.","We're also seeing good progress with the launch of VENCLEXTA in our initial indication, relapsed\/refractory CLL patients with the 17p deletion. We're tracking against our objective to achieve full-year sales guidance of $125 million, which represents more than one-third of the 17p deletion market. We look forward to the MURANO trial readout in the coming months and our subsequent regulatory submissions, which will significantly expand the market opportunity for this important therapy.","So overall, we continue to be pleased with the progress we're making with IMBRUVICA, VENCLEXTA and our broader oncology portfolio and strategy. We also saw strong performance from several other products in our portfolio, including Creon and Duodopa. In summary, we continue to demonstrate our strong commercial performance, and we're pleased with our financial results.","Moving on to our pipeline, we have made significant progress in the first half of the year with regulatory approvals, positive data and pivotal study starts. And, as we've noted, we have a number of important clinical development and regulatory milestones in the second half of this year. Mike will discuss our clinical programs in more detail, here in just a few moments, while I briefly highlight a few of the more noteworthy milestones.","In immunology, we continue to make good progress with our two late-stage assets. We recently announced strong top-line results from the first of our registrational trials of ABT-494 in RA and we'll see results from two additional pivotal studies in the coming months. We'll also see data from three of our risankizumab registrational trials in psoriasis later in the year.","In oncology, we'll see data from a number of pivotal programs, including results from the VENCLEXTA Phase 3 MURANO trial, data from the Rova-T TRINITY study in small cell lung cancer and data from ABT-414 in second-line glioblastoma as well as results from the IMBRUVICA SHINE trial in frontline mantle cell lymphoma. We also completed our Phase 3 program for elagolix in endometriosis, and we're on track for regulatory submission this quarter.","And finally, we are anticipating U.S. and European regulatory approvals for MAVIRET, our next-generation HCV offering. Our pan-genotypic once-daily ribavirin-free therapy has a highly competitive profile, with high efficacy rates across major genotypes and in difficult-to-treat patient populations.","In summary, we're encouraged by our strong commercial execution and our strong financial performance. And we're looking forward to the many pipeline milestones we expect in the back half of the year. We have a high degree of confidence in our strategy and in our execution. And we'll build upon the strong momentum we have to drive a high level of performance across our operations in the second half of the year.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?","Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.","Thank you, Rick. As Rick just noted, 2017 marks a milestone-filled year for AbbVie's pipeline, with a dozen pivotal trial readouts and several planned regulatory submissions or approvals. We've continued to make significant pipeline progress over the past quarter. This morning, I'll highlight recent pipeline updates and discuss key milestones we anticipate for the remainder of the year.","In the area of immunology, we continue to make good progress advancing our two very promising late-stage assets, upadacitinib and risankizumab. Both of these assets have the potential to significantly advance standard of care in a number of immune-mediated conditions. Upadacitinib, also known as ABT-494, has produced encouraging mid and late-stage data in rheumatology and gastroenterology.","We believe our once-daily oral highly-selective JAK1 inhibitor has the potential to provide best-in-class efficacy with a favorable safety profile in RA and provide strong activity in a very competitive profile in psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.","In the quarter, we reported top-line results from the first of our registrational trials for upadacitinib, the SELECT-NEXT study. In this study, which evaluated patients who did not respond adequately to conventional DMARDs, both doses of upadacitinib met all primary and key secondary endpoints.","Furthermore, upadacitinib drove very high responses at the ACR20 level, but, more importantly, it drove strong levels of response on more stringent endpoints, such as ACR50, ACR70, low disease activity and DAS remission. We're also very encouraged by the DAS responses we saw, where nearly half of the patients studied achieved low disease activity in both dose groups, and approximately 30% achieved DAS remission with just 12 weeks of treatment.","Upadacitinib's efficacy in this population compares favorably to other selective JAK inhibitors in Phase 3 development. And we think this drug has the potential to offer meaningful advantages over products on the market today or in development. Additionally, the safety profile in the SELECT-NEXT study was consistent with what was observed in the Phase 2 trials, and no new safety signals were detected. We plan to present detailed data from the SELECT-NEXT trial at the American College of Rheumatology meeting in November.","We expect to see results from two additional studies later this year, SELECT-BEYOND in biologic-inadequate responders and SELECT-MONOTHERAPY, with data from two more trials and our regulatory submissions expected in 2018 and commercialization in 2019.","Beyond its lead indication in RA, we're making good progress with upadacitinib in mid-stage studies for several other immune-mediated conditions, including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and atopic dermatitis. And we also recently began a Phase 3 study in psoriatic arthritis.","At the recent DDW meeting, we presented promising Phase 2 upadacitinib data in Crohn's disease. The results from the Phase 2 CELEST study demonstrated that significantly more patients treated with upadacitinib achieved clinical remission and endoscopic remission following induction therapy as compared to placebo. There was also a mandatory steroid taper during the induction phase of this study. And upadacitinib performed very well, with significantly more patients at the higher doses being steroid-free and in clinical remission after 16 weeks of treatment.","The patient population in this study was considered to be particularly difficult to treat, given that 96% of patients in the trial had failed or were intolerant to anti-TNFs, with more than two-thirds having been previously treated with more than two anti-TNFs. The Phase 3 program for Crohn's disease will begin later this year.","We also plan to begin Phase 3 studies in ankylosing spondylitis in the second half of 2017 and in ulcerative colitis in 2018. Finally, we'll see data from a mid-stage trial evaluating upadacitinib in atopic dermatitis, a prevalent chronic inflammatory skin disease, later this year.","Moving now to our anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody, risankizumab, where we are nearing completion of three registrational studies in psoriasis, risankizumab has the potential to provide best-in-class efficacy and increased dosing convenience, with quarterly administration. And we look forward to seeing results from the three pivotal trials in the fourth quarter. Additional data from the pivotal program will be available next year, leading to our regulatory submission in 2018, with commercialization anticipated in 2019.","At the DDW meeting, we also presented Phase 2 risankizumab data in Crohn's disease. The results from the 52-week maintenance portion of a Phase 2 study were very promising, demonstrating that the drug was effective in maintaining clinical and endoscopic remission and response in patients who were in clinical remission at week 26. Risankizumab was well-tolerated, with no new safety signals detected during maintenance treatment.","Phase 3 studies in Crohn's disease will be starting later this year. Later this year, we're also expecting to begin a Phase 3 study for risankizumab in ulcerative colitis. Additionally, we'll also see Phase 2 data in psoriatic arthritis, with Phase 3 studies expected to begin in the first half of 2018.","Moving now to oncology, where we continue to make good progress with our hem\/onc and solid tumor programs. Between now and the end of the year, we expect several important milestones. Earlier this week, VENCLEXTA received a Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA for combination treatment with low-dose ara-C in treatment-na\u00efve AML patients who are ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy. This is the second Breakthrough Therapy Designation in AML and the fourth overall for VENCLEXTA. The Phase 3 study for this indication is already ongoing.","In the coming months, we'll see data from the VENCLEXTA Phase 3 MURANO trial, which will support our regulatory application for broader use in the relapsed\/refractory CLL population.","We are also expecting additional IMBRUVICA data readouts later this year based on interim or final analyses from multiple studies. And we are anticipating regulatory approval soon for the use of IMBRUVICA in chronic graft-versus-host-disease after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy. If approved, this would be the first treatment specifically approved for chronic GVHD, a serious and potentially life-threatening condition with high unmet medical need.","In the area of solid tumors, we'll see results from the TRINITY study, where Rova-T is being evaluated in third-line or greater small cell lung cancer, with regulatory submissions following shortly thereafter.","At the recent ASCO meeting, we presented full data from the Phase 1 study of Depatux-M, also known as ABT-414, in glioblastoma multiforme, including encouraging overall survival and progression-free survival data. Later this quarter, we'll see data from a Phase 2 study of Depatux-M in second-line GBM that, if positive, would support regulatory submission.","And finally, in the area of women's health, we recently completed our Phase 3 program of elagolix in endometriosis. We plan to present additional data from the extension study at the ASRM Congress at the end of October, and we remain on track to submit our regulatory application later in the third quarter.","Our Phase 3 program in uterine fibroids is also well underway. We'll begin to see initial top-line results from the first pivotal study around the end of the year.","So in summary, we've continued to see significant evolution of our mid and late-stage programs. The first half of the year has been very productive. And we look forward to the second half of 2017 and the large number of clinical and regulatory milestones.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on our second quarter performance. Bill?","William J. Chase - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Mike. We are very pleased with our second quarter performance. Total net revenues were $6.9 billion, up 8.9% operationally, excluding a 90 basis point unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.42, up 12.7% compared to the second quarter of 2016 and exceeding our guidance for the quarter.","HUMIRA had another outstanding quarter, with global sales of $4.7 billion, up 14.9% operationally. This performance is reflective of continued strong demand, despite increasing competition from new classes of drugs as well as anti-TNF biosimilars. In the U.S., HUMIRA sales increased 18% compared to the prior year, driven by low double-digit prescription growth plus price. Wholesaler inventory levels were below half a month, as is our standard practice.","HUMIRA's growth continues to be fueled by robust demand across all three segments, rheum, gastro and derm, and market share remains stable despite competitive dynamics.","Internationally, HUMIRA had an exceptional quarter, with operational sales growth of 9.1%. This performance was driven by market growth as well as tender timing, which contributed nearly 2 percentage points to operational sales growth in the quarter.","Global IMBRUVICA net revenues in the second quarter were $626 million, up more than 42% over the second quarter of last year. Robust sales in the U.S., which totaled $528 million in the quarter, were driven by our strong market positions in CLL as well as other indications, including mantle cell lymphoma, Waldenstr\u00f6m's and relapsed\/refractory marginal zone lymphoma, which was approved earlier this year.","Global Viekira sales in the quarter were $225 million, down versus the prior year. In the coming weeks, we expect U.S. and European regulatory decisions for our next-generation HCV treatment, MAVIRET. Based on the timing of reimbursement decisions outside the U.S. and managed-care contracting cycles in the U.S., we expect to see meaningful sales contribution from MAVIRET starting in 2018.","Global sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease, grew 16% on an operational basis in the quarter. And we also saw strong growth from Creon, which was up over 9% in the quarter.","Reviewing the P&L profile for the quarter, adjusted gross margin was 82.3% of sales compared to 81.9% in the prior year. This was inclusive of 80 basis points of dilutive impact related to partnership accounting. Adjusted R&D was 17.5% of sales, up 200 basis points over the prior year, reflecting increased funding of the pipeline, including incremental spend associated with the Stemcentrx and risankizumab transactions. Adjusted SG&A was 20.2% of sales in the quarter, down 200 basis points versus the prior year, driven by sales leverage and operational efficiencies.","Operating margin was 44.6% of sales in the second quarter, an improvement of 70 basis points versus prior year. Net interest expense was $253 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 19.3% in the quarter. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share, excluding intangible amortization expense and other specified items, was $1.42, up 12.7% year-over-year.","Turning to full year guidance, we continue to forecast full year adjusted EPS of $5.44 to $5.54 per share, representing growth of 13.9% at the midpoint. This guidance comprehends full year top-line operational growth approaching 10%. For U.S. HUMIRA, we continue to expect mid to high teens sales growth for the full year. Internationally, we expect mid-single-digit operational growth for HUMIRA. Given recent foreign exchange dynamics, we would expect full year reported sales growth for international HUMIRA to approach mid-single digits.","For IMBRUVICA, we remain on track to achieve our full year expectation for global reported revenues of greater than $2.4 billion, with sales in the U.S. of more than $2 billion.","In the last several weeks, we have seen a weakening of the dollar versus key foreign currencies. If these rates were to remain constant at today's levels, we would forecast no material impact from foreign exchange to full year sales. This currency movement would, however, have an adverse impact on gross margin due to hedges in place on key currencies. If exchange were to hold at current rates, we would forecast full year gross margin as a percentage of sales at 80.5%.","We are forecasting full year R&D expense approaching 17.5% of sales, reflecting pipeline funding and the impacts of the Stemcentrx and risankizumab transactions. We expect SG&A of over 20.5% of sales, and this would result in an operating margin profile of approximately 42.5%, inclusive of the recent impact of currency movements.","We continue to expect a net interest expense of approximately $1 billion. And the adjusted tax rate for the full year should be modeled at above 19%.","For the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $1.36 and $1.38. This adjusted EPS guidance excludes roughly $0.22 of non-cash amortization and other specified items and represents year-over-year growth of 13.2% at the midpoint. We are forecasting operational revenue growth of approximately 9% through the third quarter. And if current exchange rates hold, no impact from exchange on sales in the quarter.","For U.S. HUMIRA, we expect sales growth in the third quarter in the high teens. Internationally, we expect mid-single-digit operational growth for HUMIRA.","For IMBRUVICA, we expect U.S. sales growth in the third quarter of approximately 30%. We expect gross margin in the third quarter to be approximately 80.5% of sales. This gross margin comprehends current exchange rates and is inclusive of the dilutive impact of partnered products.","In closing, we delivered outstanding performance in the quarter, driven by our focus on strong commercial and operational execution. We expect to continue this momentum in the second half of 2017, putting us in a great position to deliver top-tier revenue and EPS growth for the full year.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Bill. We'll now open the call for questions. Operator, let's take the first question, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. I just had a couple of pipeline-related questions. Michael, maybe for you, there seemed to be emerging questions about the safety of JAK inhibitors due to DVT and PE issues, which seem to have hobbled the baricitinib application at the FDA. In addition, we understand there is an upcoming panel meeting on XELJANZ on psoriatic arthritis, and maybe the issue relates to DVTs that were seen in post-marketing studies.","So I'm just wondering what you can tell us in terms of the safety profile of ABT-494 related to DVT and PE issues. I know in sort of searching through the clinical database and there's not a lot of data yet, but we didn't see any information related to platelets. I'm wondering if that means anything. And then secondly, we did see a drop in hemoglobin seen in Phase 2 and just wondering if that could be related to anemia or any suggestions of off-target JAK2 inhibitor side effects, so if you could kind of put that into perspective.","And then just lastly, on risankizumab and positioning of that relative to ABT-494, there are other IL-23 drugs, specifically guselkumab, that have just been launched. And I'm just wondering if you could talk about how you see the relative positioning of both risa (25:13) as well as ABT-494, particularly in GI, where both drugs seem to show very compelling profiles, and maybe if you could talk about those drugs, specifically risankizumab relative to other IL-23s that are also entering the market. Thanks very much.","Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.","Okay, Jami. Well, thanks very much for that question. I'll try to take these one at a time. So with respect to the safety profile of our agent, upadacitinib, and DVTs and PEs, the short answer is we've looked. And we don't see anything that we'd consider a signal or rates that exceed expected background. But maybe to fully answer your question, it would be helpful to take a step back from for a moment and think about what we know and what we don't know.","So based on Lilly's recent statements, we know that questions around DVT and PE appear to be the driver behind their CRL and that that concern seems to be driven by an imbalance during the placebo-controlled portion of their studies. We also know that RA patients are at increased risk of DVT and PE, and that these events are observed in virtually all Phase 3 programs in RA, regardless of the mechanism of action.","And as you point out, we also know that there have been a number, I think, it's something like 18, post-marketing reports of PE with XELJANZ. Since RA patients are at an increased risk and XELJANZ has been on the market for several years, I don't think that that is necessary surprising.","When you think about what we don't know, there are a number of things in that column. For starters, we don't know whether bari [baricitinib] does, in fact, increase risk. Here, the FDA has just asked for more data. We also don't know the detailed data that Lilly and the FDA are looking at. For example, what's the total number of cases, including not only the placebo-controlled portions but also the open-label periods? What are rates overall and are they increased? What's the nature of the cases? Is there evidence of a dose response or not?","So we still have a lot to learn about bari, but I can tell you about our program. We've been monitoring for DVT and PE right from the beginning because we know that RA patients are at an increased baseline risk, as I just said. Because of this background rate, which is generally between about 0.3 and 0.8 events per 100 patient years you'd expect to see some PEs in any RA clinical program. In fact, it would be surprising if you didn't.","So to evaluate them, you have to look at the other factors that I just talked about. Now, again, as I said, we've been monitoring for these events right from the start, but based on the recent history from bari we've gone back and we've taken another very careful look at all the data we've collected so far. And, as I said, based on that look, we don't see anything that we'd consider a signal or rates that exceed expected background, so our view of our program hasn't changed.","Now, you asked about platelets. We've looked at that. And what we see with our agent are a tendency towards modest decreases in platelets with treatment. Now, that's not necessarily surprising, because platelets can behave in some patients like an acute phase reactive. (28:25) They can go up when there's active inflammation. And when you treat that inflammation, they can return back towards normal. And all of the changes that we're seeing are very modest and they're all within the normal range. So I don't know that I would really make very much of that right now.","You asked about hemoglobin in Phase 2. And what I would say is in Phase 2, we studied a very wide range of doses, including doses that are much higher than the doses we're carrying forward in Phase 3. And we did that because we wanted to make sure that we fully explored the dose range and we got that dose selection right, because dose selection is critical in any Phase 3 program.","At the doses that we're studying in Phase 3, we're not seeing significant changes in hemoglobin and AEs (29:10) of anemia are very uncommon and seen in all dose groups, including placebo. So we're not seeing issues with hemoglobin in our program.","With respect to the positioning of these agents, maybe I'll let Rick make a few comments and then I may close it out.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Sure. Hi, Jami. I think if you step back and you think about what we're trying to accomplish in this particular area, obviously, we have a leadership position in immunology. We've been working on this strategy for a number of years now. Our goal was to bring forward a set of agents that we thought could restate standard of care in all the areas that we had a leadership position in.","From the very beginning, we didn't believe that there was one mechanism of action that was likely to be able to do that, so we pursued multiple mechanisms of action. And now we have two assets that we believe can give us coverage with a differentiated profile within those areas. So if you think about the three major areas, RA, psoriasis and IBD, certainly as we look at 494 [ABT-494] and the data that we've seen thus far, we believe it fundamentally will have a differentiated profile, in particular in the TNF-inadequate responder population.","We're excited and interested in what that data will look like and encouraged that we think that, that will be a profile that will be differentiated in the marketplace. And so, we think 494 is clearly the asset that will be our RA asset.","In psoriasis, certainly the IL-23 risankizumab is certainly demonstrated in the Phase 2 studies, a significant differentiation versus other agents that are out there. And I'll have Mike talk specifically about the data here in a moment. So that's certainly the asset that we're targeting there.","In IBD, these patients tend to rotate through therapies, because they do lose effect over time. And both of these agents, I think in our early data, it would suggest to us, we'll have good activity in IBD. And I think our strategy, although we have to see how the data plays out, will be that we will pursue both agents in this area. And that will give us the fullest level of coverage within this disease state and this is a disease state that still has a significant unmet need.","And then, obviously, we're going to look at a number of other areas. And many of these other areas can be very significant opportunities. If you think about HS with HUMIRA, that's tracking to be a $1 billion indication for us. So many of these other areas will be significant opportunities as well, but that covers the major areas.","Now from a go-to-market strategy and how we'll be positioning these products, it'll vary somewhat based on geography and based on other events, like the timing of biosimilar entries within those markets. But generally speaking, we view this portfolio of assets, HUMIRA and these two assets, as the way that we will compete in the marketplace.","Certainly, we have the gold standard product in HUMIRA in these areas. It's really the flagship product. It will play an important role over the long term, as we've said. Even when we see biosimilars in this market, it'll be our goal to maintain our leadership position within this market.","But HUMIRA doesn't work on every single patient. And I think the best way to think about it is this: despite how successful we have been with HUMIRA, we still have roughly a third of the market. When you add these other two agents into the mix of our portfolio, it should give us the opportunity to significantly grow our market share position, because we will then have a set of assets that should give us much broader coverage, from a clinical standpoint, across the patient groups in these areas to have agents that will be efficacious.","Some will be follow-on agents. Some will compete head-to-head for new patients. It will depend a lot on the geography and the circumstances within that market. But we think this portfolio of assets in immunology will clearly give us an opportunity to be able to significantly increase our market share position in this area. We view this as a very exciting opportunity and one that can drive significant growth for the company going forward.","Maybe, Mike, specifically talk a little bit about some of the data we've seen and the differentiation.","Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.","Certainly. So, as Rick mentioned, it's really the data that's going to drive the positioning. And we're very fortunate to have demonstrated very strong data from both of these programs. If you look at upadacitinib, we've seen get very good responses in Phase 2 and also in the first Phase 3 study, SELECT-NEXT, that we've top-lined.","What we're particularly encouraged is the ability to drive responses at higher levels. And so that's getting patients to DAS, low disease activity DAS remission, for example. And we've seen very good performance out of both of our dose levels at those more stringent measures.","We've also designed a very broad and very robust, very comprehensive Phase 3 program for upadacitinib in RA that will provide a lot of data and give a lot of time on drug so that we can very well characterize both the benefit and the risk profile of those agents. So I think the program that we've designed is going to be a real strength.","We've seen good response in upadacitinib in other indications, as Rick mentioned, like inflammatory bowel diseases, where there's a real unmet medical need and so the breadth of that program, I think, will be very beneficial.","If we move our attention to IL-23 and risankizumab, there are other agents in this class and it is a competitive space, but we were particularly struck with the Phase 2b data that we saw for risankizumab. We're driving very, very high levels of response and very high levels of response at a PASI 100 level, for example, that really are the best that have been seen in this field. And we did a head to head in Phase 2 and drove PASI 100 levels that were roughly double that of currently available agents.","So I think those data are very strong. And when you couple that with the fact that we're able to achieve quarterly dosing and very durable responses, which have been a problem with past agents in psoriasis, I think that all shapes up to be a very strong profile.","And, of course, risankizumab also provides strong data. We presented data in IBD at the DDW meeting, which showed very good responses in Phase 2. And we're moving forward with a very broad program for risankizumab as well.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Jami. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Holford of Jefferies. Your line's open.","Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC","Hi, thanks very much for taking my questions. Firstly, I wonder if you can give us an update on your thoughts as to the extent of excess cash generation over the next few years. I know we've been talking about that recently, and just how you're thinking about now prioritizing that between dividends, share repurchases, and M&A?","I wonder if then also, you might like to comment on Hep-C and how you're going to try and approach that from a commercial standpoint in the U.S. You've talked about wanting to look at more open formularies, I think, going forward, but what's the chance of you actually achieving this and do you think that price will have to be part of the implicit offering there? Thank you.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Okay. Jeff, this is Rick. You know, I think on cash generation, obviously, we have a business that generates significant cash flow and that cash flow is only going to grow over time. I think the distribution of that and the priorities are consistent with how we've operated in the past.","Certainly, our first priority is always reinvesting back in the business. And, obviously, we've done some significant acquisitions with Pharmacyclics, Stemcentrx and others. Risankizumab is a good example of other assets that we then license, so that's always a priority.","Having said that, I would say that over the course of the last four years or so, we have filled out a lot of the major gaps that we had in our therapeutic strategies and we're looking more now for individual assets, rather than larger platform kinds of plays, but that's always the first priority.","The second priority is we're committed to the dividend. We're committed to a growing dividend. I think we've demonstrated that with our actions going forward across the last four years. And then as far as repurchase, today, we obviously look at share repurchase, which we've done a significant amount even outside of that related to M&A, as a more opportunistic strategy. When we have excess U.S. cash, we tend to deploy it in that fashion.","You commented on there's been a lot of discussion around it. I think if there were tax reform and we had greater access to our offshore cash in a cost effective way, then that would open up different opportunities for us to be able to deploy further cash, because I think our cash generation would certainly exceed what we would view as our need to be able to redeploy it back in the business. But we'll have to see how that plays out. I think it's a little tough to handicap at this point where that will go.","As it relates to HCV, we're certainly excited about MAVIRET. I think it has a profile that is highly competitive in the marketplace. The markets are very different within the U.S. and outside the U.S. I'd say if you think about this product outside the U.S., it certainly gives us the ability to compete in the broader set of genotypes, which we haven't had in the past. And it certainly gives us the ability to be able to compete more effectively in markets that have a significant genotype 1a population, because the profile of MAVIRET is more highly competitive than Viekira was in those particular marketplaces.","And so, we view that opportunity as significant. We have to get pricing and reimbursement in those countries. And if you look at markets that were primarily 1b, where the profile of Viekira was more comparable to the competitive offerings, we typically get shares in the 30% range, the 30% to 40% range.","Now having said that, I will also tell you that we are seeing price come down outside the U.S. And so we're going to have to be able to \u2013 if we get share gains, which we probably will, some of that will obviously be used to offset price impact that we see in those markets.","Within the U.S. market, it's a different type of market. As you know, on the commercial side of the business, much of that is under contract with the market leader on exclusive contracts. So we don't see a significant opportunity for that in 2017 and probably certainly even halfway through 2018. So we don't view that as a short-term opportunity.","So a significant part of our strategy will focus early on in the U. S. in the public channels, because those will become available more rapidly. And so our go-to-market strategy will be one that's focused initially in that particular area where we think there is the greatest opportunity to be able to have an impact.","Now HCV is an unusual market, in that, within the U.S., if you look at the public channels versus the commercial channels and you look at currently those patients that are available for treatment that haven't been treated already, it's roughly 70%-30%. About 70% of the patients are in this public channel, Medicare, Medicaid, VA, et cetera, and 30% are in the commercial channels.","And so it's a significant opportunity. And it's the part of the market that's still growing, where the commercial channel tends to be flat to declining from a patient volume standpoint. So once we get approval, that will be the area of focus within the U.S. But as Bill said in his comments, we don't view this asset as having much of an impact in 2017. It will have a more material impact in 2018 and 2019.","Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC","And just last quick add-on, if I can, on the pricing of Rova-T, there's a lot of pushback from investors on the sort of prices you might be able to charge for the two doses, especially in third-line small cell lung. Can you just give us any updated thoughts there on what kind of ballpark we should be in for modeling purposes? Thank you.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Yeah. Well, I mean I think for our modeling purposes, during the acquisition we used pricing that was typical of a proprietary oncology agent. I don't believe there's anything in our data that has changed our mind around that. Certainly, what's going to be the most important thing is the data that we see come out of the trials and that will dictate I think the adoption of the agent to a much greater extent than the pricing.","This is a pretty devastating disease, where there really aren't many options for these patients. And if Rova-T shows what we think it will show, I think this will be an excellent opportunity to be able to provide those patients with a therapy that isn't available today that gives them an opportunity to have a significant clinical improvement. And I think that will drive the adoption more than the price point.","Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Schott of JPMorgan. Your line's open.","Christopher T. Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks very much for the questions; just two, both on HUMIRA. Maybe first EU biosimilar landscape, it seems like REMICADE is starting to get hit pretty hard. Can you maybe just compare and contrast how you see HUMIRA dynamics playing out as we look out to 2019 versus what we're seeing from Merck over the last few years and quarters here?","My second question is just interested if you could share any high level comments on HUMIRA as we kind of think out to 2018 formulary and maybe pricing outlook. I believe if I go back to the 3Q 2016 call, you had mentioned you'd completed some negotiations for 2017 as well as 2018 season. It was basically business as usual with regards to HUMIRA. I just wonder is that view changed at all at this point? Are you still kind of seeing business as usual as we think about formulary positioning, et cetera, going forward? Thank you.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Okay. So, Chris, this is Rick. On the formulary front, you are correct. We obviously negotiated a number of contracts that were both 2017 and 2018. We never disclose, nor would we disclose, what percentage of the contracting falls into that category. But we are now in active negotiations for the remaining contracts in 2018. And I would tell you nothing is fundamentally changed as it relates to the access that we have assumed or the pricing of the asset or any of the aspects from a standpoint of managed care contracting. So you shouldn't assume any significant difference in any of our activities as it relates to formulary access or the structure of that access as well.","As far as EU biosimilars, we obviously track it carefully. I wouldn't say it's my view that there's been a dramatic change in either REMICADE or ENBREL. The pricing has continued in the range that we've talked about in the past. If you look at their overall market share position, it obviously varies by country. And there are some countries where they have heavy penetration. But overall, the REMICADE biosimilar, the last data I looked at, a few weeks ago, would suggest that they have about 6% market share, and the ENBREL biosimilar, something less than 4%, 3.5%, 3.6%, something like that, was the last data I saw.","If you look at it versus the brand, they're still in an area that's relatively modest. And the price erosion is pretty consistent with what we've expected, where you see in these tender countries, obviously, very high discounting, and, obviously, in some cases, a significant conversion to the biosimilar. The Nordics are a good example of that.","But when you look at many of the major European countries, they have relatively modest up-take, and they have pricing in that 35% kind of range from a discounting standpoint. So I think it's relatively consistent with what we've seen and what we've been modeling for quite some time. And so it gives us continued confidence that our strategy, when that occurs, is one that should be highly effective.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Chris. Operator, we'll take the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Marc Goodman of UBS. Your line's open.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Yes, morning. Two questions first. Can you talk about the gross margin? It seemed to be pretty strong in the quarter. I know you mentioned for the full year, but just talk about the quarter specifically? And then second, can you give us an update on Stemcentrx non-Rova-T activity? What's going on there? Thanks.","William J. Chase - AbbVie, Inc.","So, Marc, yeah, it was a nice quarter for gross margin. We've gone back and looked. Historically, Q2 does run a little stronger than the rest of the year. That's a function of product mix, to a certain extent. But that said, we continue to make pretty nice progress on this line, even in the face of the partnership accounting. If you back out partnership accounting, we are probably up about 120 basis points. Yeah, I think the main drivers, about a third of that was a favorable impact of exchange. But that still left 80 basis points to the good, and that was really a mix of product mix as well as just cost efficiencies.","Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.","And this is Mike. With respect to the Stemcentrx pipeline beyond Rova-T, we continue to make very, very good progress. And one of the things that was really attractive about Stemcentrx was that it not only brought a lead asset, but it had a discovery platform that we thought we could capitalize and accelerate our presence in solid tumors. And we're seeing that play out. The scientific team there has been very productive. They've worked well with the broader scientific team at AbbVie. Our strengths really complement each other. We're driving that platform forward rapidly.","We have a number of programs in the clinic, and we have a number of programs in late preclinical development, poised to enter early clinical development. And we could introduce as many as three to four programs a year into the clinic over the next couple of years from that platform, as we said in other settings. We're still tracking very well against that goal, and we feel good about the progress we're making.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Marc. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Umer Raffat of Evercore. Your line's open.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had a couple, if I may. First, just to follow up on the ABT-494 question, can you just remind us exactly the number of cases of thromboembolic events you've seen either completed or in ongoing trials on a blinded basis, number one?","And then secondly, just wanted to focus on HUMIRA, the recent news on the judge for the District Court trial, could that have an impact on the actual trial date versus Amgen? And then, also, Rick, you mentioned there's no significant difference in Managed Care contracting for 2018 for HUMIRA, but would you continue to expect the same pricing tailwind? And the reason I ask is I just find the dynamic around your key competitors on fake TNFs (50:31) not getting much price tailwinds lately. Thank you very much.","Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.","Okay. This is Mike. With respect to 494, what we've reported so far is from Phase 2. And in Phase 2, there were two cases of PE that were in patients with a number of risk factors. One of those was a recurring case. Given the background rates that I talked about, it really isn't surprising to see a small number of cases like this, particularly in Phase 2, where the large majority of patients are on active drug.","With respect to our ongoing trials, what we've said is that we're monitoring our data closely. We have a good understanding of the background rate, which is between about 0.3 and 0.8 events per 100 patient years, and we're not seeing anything that's elevated above that rate.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Okay. This is Rick. Obviously, we haven't in the last year or so, talked much about the litigation strategy, for obvious reasons. We're in active litigation right now. I would tell you nothing has changed in the way of our assumptions around timing, but I probably won't comment much further than that, but I would tell you there's not any concern around a change in significant timing around the litigation timelines.","As far as contracting is concerned, it's consistent with what I said to you a few moments ago. We don't see any significant change in the contacting strategy. And that would include what is common in this industry around price protection, which has some impact around your pricing. Having said that, I would say, as we did this year, we're going to be careful and conservative as we think about price going forward. And certainly, as we've looked at our longer range plan, historically, that's how we operated, but I'd say even in this last cycle, we have been even a little more conservative than we have been in the past because this has become such a heated topic in the U.S.","But it's not a function of any things related to the contracting strategy. It's more a function of how we're trying to operate the business overall.","Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you very much.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Omar. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoff Porges of Leerink Partners. Your line's open.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you very much for taking the question. Two quick questions, one, you have the rights to the Galapagos cystic fibrosis program and you haven't talked about that much on this call, certainly, and recently. I'm wondering how you view the recent announcements from the Vertex program and whether that's changed your appetite for investing in the Galapagos program and your expectations and when you expect to start Phase 3 for that program.","And then a sort of left field question for you, Rick, you're the only CEO that AbbVie has had. Could you talk a little bit about your succession planning and timing and what the transition is likely to look like and when that might happen, because there's not a lot of history there, how AbbVie's handled that? Thanks.","Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.","Okay. This is Mike. I'll take CF first. You know, our CF program is a program that we feel very good about. It's still in early phase studies. And so for a company of our size, we don't always spend a lot of time talking about our very early phase work, but that doesn't mean that we're not excited about it. I think there's a real opportunity there. I think the target has a lot of the characteristics of things we're really good at doing, engineering very, very specific and high-quality small molecules together with our partner on this, Galapagos. I think there clearly is an unmet medical need. Obviously, there have been advancements in the field, and that's good for patients, but there's more room to go. And so we think that we can contribute there.","With respect to the Vertex data, and the Vertex data are strong, but we expected those data to come out and we expected them to be strong. We still believe that there is headroom above that that can benefit patients, and we can help meet that need. It's our mid-phase trials that are going to provide that answer. And we and Galapagos are working diligently to move into that phase of development. With respect to Phase 3, I think it's a bit early to predict timing on Phase 3 right now.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Okay. This is Rick. I'll answer your second question. Yes, I've been the only CEO of AbbVie, but AbbVie is only 4.5 years old. So, I guess, that's not too unusual. In fact, I'd say, if there were more than one, that probably would be a sign of something different, right?","But on a more serious note, I think as you look at succession planning, it's obviously a critical issue for a company of this size. We have a very good, high-quality board of seasoned executives at the board level. We take succession planning very seriously. I'd say we view it as an active process that we continue to work on.","But certainly once a year at a particular board meeting, we dedicate a significant amount of time to succession planning. We have a succession plan in place for the company, as most companies of our size would have, that's a planned structure of both internal candidates that we have and the development of those internal candidates. Obviously, there are always opportunities to go outside if the board were to choose that. We obviously also have an emergency succession plan, if something were to happen that would require that. And we have identified individuals that we fundamentally believe would be appropriate for that.","So I can tell you, the board takes it seriously. It is an active process that we use. And I think I won't speak for the board. But as Chairman of the Board, I would tell you it's a process that I feel very comfortable with. And I believe it's very appropriate for a company of our size.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Terrific. Thanks.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Geoffrey. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line's open.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. One for Mike, so elagolix, how meaningful is extension study data to the overall profile? Clearly, duration of therapy could be a big lever. Want to get your sense as to persistent compliance trends, pretty much throughout the program, and what you think that could mean to the real-world use.","And then, bigger picture question for Rick, you guys have made a lot of pipeline progress and have a number of launches for next year. So I want to get your sense as to how that has changed your strategy, if at all, in biz-dev. I think the hiring of Henry [Gosebruch] a few years ago signaled an emphasis on deals, but we haven't seen much activity of late. Thank you.","Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.","Okay. This is Mike. I'll start with the elagolix question and hand it over to Rick. We've designed a program for elagolix that is going to provide a very large and very comprehensive database to guide real-world use. We have the initial efficacy periods, and those results were very strong. We've reported them in other settings. We have extension periods, which, as you point out, could be very important for informing duration of use. And then we have off-treatment periods, so that we can look at a number of factors that we'd want to examine as patients roll off of this therapy.","And the results we've seen in each phase are very, very strong. What I would say is there's a real unmet medical need here. There hasn't been any innovation in this space in decades. And women's treatment options are very, very limited, so oral contraceptives are used upfront. They provide some women relief. And that's good, but we know that many, many women don't achieve necessary relief. Beyond that, there's no disease-specific intervention until you get all the way to the other end of the spectrum, either putting a woman in menopause with LUPRON or surgical interventions.","And in-between, the only thing that doctors can do is give pain medicines and basically treat this as a chronic pain condition. And we know that the pain is severe enough that a large number of women go on opioid pain medicines for this condition. And so we think that elagolix is really going to offer a compelling profile to these women. And what it offers is the ability to titrate suppression of the hormonal lapses. (59:21) Instead of just an on and off switch, we can achieve different levels of suppression. And we've seen that that translates into improvement in pain, improvement in symptoms on a number of measures and a very favorable safety profile.","So we're looking forward to moving forward with the regulatory submission, which will be later on this quarter. And we think it's going to be a real advance in this field. With that, I'll hand it over to Rick.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Well, as you pointed out, we have a number of launches, not just next year, but over the next several years. And it's really the evolution of our pipeline playing out. When we launched the company, we put major emphasis around building a pipeline that could sustain long-term top-tier growth and we've been working diligently to get that done. And I think you're starting to see now the evolution of that reach a point where we'll be launching a number of these products over time.","I'd say as I look at our commercial organization, I think we have an outstanding commercial organization. And they've been preparing for many of these launches now for several years. We obviously do it in phases. You'll start to see us increase investment in certain areas to prepare for those launches. And I feel good about how we'll enter the marketplace with a number of these new drugs and the impact that we can have.","As far as deals are concerned, what drives our deal decision-making is really built around the strategy for the business. Within each one of the verticals, we have a strategic set of objectives that we're trying to accomplish. And we basically apply our deal focus and our BD activity against that strategy. And so as I said earlier, we've obviously added a number of large platform plays to the business to build-out our oncology franchise, which was an important part of our strategy going forward for the business was to build another major growth platform in oncology. And I think as I look at IMBRUVICA and I look at the Pharmacyclics acquisition and I reflect on what we thought at the time we did it and I look at where we are now, I can tell you I'm very happy with how that has played out.","I mentioned some of the numbers that we talked about a moment ago about the kind of penetration rates that we're getting with IMBRUVICA. If you look at second-line-plus, so second, third-line and beyond, IMBRUVICA has achieved one of the objectives that we had was to get to 65% market share across the vast majority of those indications. And we're at or above in second-line-plus. In first-line, now, we're focusing a lot of attention in growing our position there. And you're seeing in CLL, we're ramping very rapidly in that area. We'll get some additional approvals, we believe, that will allow us to grow first-line across a number of other tumor types.","And then, as you see the NHL line of indication start to play out, we've dedicated a sales force to that, because we believe going forward, that will be another significant growth driver for us. As we track towards what the overall objective was, which was greater than $7 billion of revenue to AbbVie, we're right on that trajectory and $5 billion by 2020. So I think it played out the way we hoped and expected it should play out.","We constantly look at deals. Henry's team is doing a great job. I can't say that there's a lot out there that either fits what our strategic objectives are or has a value proposition at this point that is something that we are comfortable with from a return standpoint. And that really is what's been driving the lack of activity versus any strategic intent not to go forward on transactions.","But as I said, we're primarily focused now more on individual kinds of assets that can fill out our portfolio. But they have to be things that we're comfortable with, from the standpoint of the potential for the asset, the probability that the mechanism will work, and then obviously, the value proposition that we'd have to pay for. If it's something that we can't get the return, then it's not something we're going to pursue.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got you. Okay. Thanks a lot.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Geoff. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gregg Gilbert of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Rick, just to follow-up on those last thoughts there, you've been very clear about the types of things you're looking to do. But how open-minded are you, if at all, about the potential for the big M&A that could address concentration and also create meaningful cost efficiency, not something you've sort of led with in your discussions around BD, but gauging your open-mindedness. This industry seems to be ripe for some larger combinations.","Secondly, can you remind us what your commercial infrastructure is for women's health and how you might need to tweak that ahead of elagolix?","And lastly, with the recent sizable judgment on the Low-T case, can you comment on your thoughts on liability in that area for the company? Thanks.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Sure. Obviously, we look at all different kinds of things, but what I would tell you is if you look at our growth \u2013 certainly, if you look at our growth over the last several years, and if you look at our going forward projections for growth across our long-range plan, this is a company that has performed extremely well, and we expect it to continue to perform well.","Concentration was something that we had looked at as part of our overall pipeline strategy. We will fundamentally deconcentrate the business as we add more products, more pipeline assets and grow those assets to a sizable level. And you can start to see some of that with IMBRUVICA. IMBRUVICA is obviously contributing significant growth and will continue to contribute significant growth. As some of the additional oncology and other assets move into the phase where they're launched and starting to have a significant impact, you'll see further deconcentration.","Now, one of the challenges has obviously been \u2013 it's a good challenge to have. We continue to grow HUMIRA at a very robust rate. And we're certainly not going to do anything to slow the growth down to deconcentrate. But that's not a bad problem. That's a good problem. And I think as we look at our strategy going forward of how we'll defend HUMIRA in a biosimilar world, we feel very comfortable with what that looks like and our ability to be able to do that.","So I would tell you big M&A is not something that we are considering. And that's not to say it would never ever happen, because you never know in this world, but the reality is that is not fundamental to our strategy. Our strategy was always built around building out a strong pipeline around the verticals that we operate in and being able to drive to significant market share within those areas.","As it relates to infrastructure on women's health, as you probably know, we currently sell as one of the indications for LUPRON, it has an endometriosis claim. Now, LUPRON is certainly not the ideal agent for this particular disease, because, obviously, it shuts down that access (67:15) completely and has all of the side effects that are associated with doing that, like bone loss and hot flash.","So we have, I'd say, a modest-size sales organization, because it's really scaled to the opportunity that exists there. But, as I mentioned a moment ago, one of the things that I think we're very good at is planning out launches. So as we submit elagolix, there's a plan in place today to start to build-out the infrastructure that will be necessary to give the appropriate level of coverage.","I can tell you elagolix is an asset that we are very excited about in endometriosis. We think it has a very good profile. And this is a disease that ultimately has significant consequences for the patients who have this. Opioid use, as an example, is significant within this population, which gives you some idea of how severe the pain is and difficult the pain is to manage. And so I think this will be an important drug for women who have endometriosis. And we'll obviously scale the organization appropriately to be able to deal with that.","On the AndroGel case, yes, I would say it was a surprising verdict, from the standpoint that there was this punitive damages aspect to it, without really awarding any damages to the individual. From a legal standpoint, I think that's not only unusual, it's probably going to be a difficult situation to sustain over the longer term, but we need to work through that.","I think the important part is on the other claims, obviously, the jury found in our favor. And I think that bodes well. We have a number of these cases, so we need to see how the other ones play out, but I'd say there's no fundamental change in the way we view the liability of this based on this single case.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Gregg. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Risinger of Morgan Stanley. Your line's open.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes, hi. Thanks very much. I have two questions, one for Mike and one for Bill. So obviously, there have been a lot of questions about your JAK inhibitors PE and DVT rate, but when do you expect to publish percentages the way that we've seen for baricitinib? That was 0.47% and Galapagos was 0.16%.","And then second, with respect to the timing for HUMIRA's gross margin to step up due to royalty reductions, Bill, I was just hoping that you could provide a little bit more color on that time. Thank you.","Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.","Okay. So, this is Mike. I'll take the first question on upadacitinib and the rates of DVT and PE. So I think, as we've said, it's the overall rates that are really important. We continue to monitor those. We're well within that expected rate for the population. And, of course, one wouldn't expect to see something lower than the background rate for the population in any large clinical trials program.","So when we have the aggregate data, we'll present the whole picture. And we'll show what those rates are. And we'll also show, at an appropriate time, the distribution in the control period. But really right now, we're very early on in un-blinding and reporting out our Phase 3 RA studies.","With respect to those other rates, the rate that you quoted for Gilead, I think we'd have to really understand where that exposure comes from. Gilead is really just getting started in RA. Most of their data comes from Crohn's disease and other inflammatory bowel disease conditions, like UC, where the patient population's very different. They tend to be younger. The risk profile is different.","So I think, at this stage, it's hard to use those benchmarks that you quoted as ranges. I think you have to look at the literature. You have to look at other sources of information. And we see a very, very consistent background rate of 0.3 to 0.8. You see that in the literature. We've done our own work in payer databases and we see that same rate.","And we've seen that same rate across historical RA programs, regardless of mechanism of action. Some are ours. Some are other programs. So we think we have a really good handle on that rate. And what we're seeing right now is very, very consistent with nothing other than that background rate. When we have the data from our Phase 3 program, we'll present that whole picture.","William J. Chase - AbbVie, Inc.","Hi, David. The royalty burden really lifts in two different phases. The first third of it lifts at the very end of 2017, so you see a P&L impact in 2018. The other two-thirds lifts at the very end of 2018, so you see the P&L benefit in 2019. And then in terms of quantity to model, we have said that that burden is about 5% to 6% of global HUMIRA sales.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, David.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","The next question comes from Vamil Divan of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions, so just two, one, going back to the 494 and the anemia comment you talked about earlier. It tells me you're not too concerned based on the dosage you're using, but do you think the anemia could be an issue as you look at more the GI indications, where I think patients can have a little bit more underlying anemia?","And then second on HUMIRA in the U.S. side with biosimilars, my question is regarding the U.S. REMICADE biosimilar, which is the second entrant there. I don't expect it to have any impact on HUMIRA, but we were a little bit surprised by the degree of the discount that Merck took, presumably to get good traction with payers. So my question is just were you surprised by that, a 35% discount off the WAC price, a pertinent number two biosimilar into the market. And do you think that's what we should expect sort of going forward, as I think about direct competition to HUMIRA? Thanks.","Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.","Okay. So this is Mike. I'll take that first one with respect to 494 and anemia. You know, as I mentioned, in Phase 2, we explored a very broad dose range, including doses above what we would expect, to study in either RA or other indications like inflammatory bowel diseases.","At the doses we're studying, we're not seeing a problem with hemoglobin or anemia. And we, of course, have data, not only in RA, but we have mid-stage data in inflammatory bowel diseases, so we don't see anemia as being a problem across-the-board for that program.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Okay, and this is Rick. On the second question, the biosimilar question. Obviously, we are monitoring both the international activity here and the U.S. activity, not just in our particular categories, but in other categories as we look at biosimilars and how it plays out over time. I would tell you, frankly, I was a bit surprised, the market reaction about the 35%.","If you look at all of the metrics in Europe, this is well within the range of what you would expect. I think it would be odd to think that a biosimilar could get much uptake in the marketplace with discounts that were significantly below this, because, remember, obviously, there are discounts applied to these products as part of either rebate structures or other discounts associated with them.","So it's going to require a discount in this range to have any way to be able to compete. So I wouldn't say that discount is a surprise to me at all.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. All right. Thanks so much.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Vamil.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Well, that concludes today's conference call.

Welcome to the AbbVie third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question and answer portion of this call. [Operation Instructions] I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Elizabeth Shea","Good morning and thank you for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Severino, Executive Vice President of Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer; and Bill Chase, Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, I want to remind you that some statements made today are or may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.

These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website.","Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick.","Richard Gonzalez","Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning I'll discuss our third quarter performance, recent operational highlights, and I'll also share some high-level perspective regarding our growth profile for 2017. Mike will then provide updates on recent advancements across our R&D programs, and Bill will provide additional color on the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of this year.","2016 is shaping up to be another very strong year, with operational revenue growth year-to-date of nearly 16% and EPS growth through three quarters of 14.6%. This follows a very strong 2015, where we delivered operational revenue growth of 22% and EPS growth of 29%. Based on our confidence in the performance of the business going forward, today we'll provide a view of 2017 which will once again demonstrate strong underlying performance.","Our third quarter results were ahead of our expectations, including adjusted earnings per share of $1.21, representing growth of 7.1% versus the third quarter of 2015. Our results included global operational sales growth of 8%, reflecting continued strong performance from our on-market business, led by HUMIRA and IMBRUVICA, as well as other products in our portfolio.","HUMIRA continues to drive robust performance, delivering global operational growth of more than 12% in the quarter. Despite increasing competition from new classes of drugs and indirect biosimilar competition in international markets, HUMIRA continues to demonstrate exceptional performance and durability across the three major market segments. In rheumatology, HUMIRA continues to hold the number one market share position with year-over-year share gains. In dermatology, we're seeing mid-teens volume growth, and we're maintaining a very strong number one market share position with a 15-point lead over the number two competitor. And in GI, we continue to see strong double-digit volume growth. Internationally, HUMIRA continues to maintain its strong position, despite indirect biosimilar competition, which is tracking in line with our expectations.","We also continue to deliver on our oncology strategy. IMBRUVICA's performance in the quarter was outstanding, with third quarter global revenues to AbbVie of just over $500 million. We're continuing to drive strong uptake in CLL. In the second-line-plus-CLL market, we continue to hold the leadership position, with more than four of 10 patients starting treatment with IMBRUVICA. And in the front-line setting, our market share position is steadily increasing, with nearly one out of five patients now starting IMBRUVICA as first-line therapy. While we're pleased with this performance, we're still in the very early stages of our trajectory in the front-line setting. We're making progress in a number of important comparative and combination studies, evaluating IMBRUVICA monotherapy and combination therapy versus regimens such as BR and FCR, often considered the gold standards in the treatment of CLL. These studies are being run in different patient segments, including young and fit patients and the watch-and-wait population. And the results will add significantly to the breadth of data supporting IMBRUVICA and will provide physicians with more evidence of the compelling clinical benefit in the front-line setting.","Additionally, in other approved indications, including mantle cell lymphoma and Waldenstrom's, IMBRUVICA holds the market-leading position in the relapsed\/refractory segments. In geographies outside the U.S., IMBRUVICA continues to experience strong adoption in Europe and Canada and has recently been launched in several new markets, including Japan. While CLL clearly represents the largest revenue contributor to IMBRUVICA's growth over our long-range plan, new indications will also augment our performance.","To that end, there is potential for several IMBRUVICA regulatory submissions and approvals over the next few years, including relapsed\/refractory marginal zone lymphoma, which is currently under regulatory review; chronic graft-versus-host disease, which we expect to submit for approval in the first half of 2017; front-line mantle cell lymphoma, which will add to our existing indication in relapsed\/refractory MCL; as well as relapsed\/refractory follicular lymphoma and front line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. For several of these indications, IMBRUVICA will be the only approved treatment, underscoring the importance of this therapy for patients. Collectively, these new IMBRUVICA indications represent a significant incremental revenue opportunity for AbbVie. Mike will provide an update regarding some upcoming data flow for several of these potential new indications.","Earlier this year, we received approval for Venclexta monotherapy in patients with relapsed\/refractory CLL who harbor the 17p deletion, a relatively small subset of the refractory patient population. In partnership with Roche\/Genentech, we're continuing to make good progress with our launch within this indication, with Venclexta now added to the NCCN guidelines and continued progress with formulary access. Physicians are gaining experience with the therapy, and we look forward to additional data next year in the broader relapsed\/refractory setting. We also saw a strong performance from several other products in our on-market portfolio, including Duodopa, Creon, and international Viekira.","In addition to our strong financial results, we have continued to advance our late-stage pipeline. Last week, at the ASRM meeting, we presented positive data on Elagolix in endometriosis, including additional results from our two pivotal studies. Results from these trials will support our U.S. regulatory application, which is on track for submission in 2017. We're nearing the completion of our registrational program for our next-generation HCV combination, which is on track for commercialization next year. Based on the data we've shared to date, we believe our next-generation HCV therapy will address the remaining unmet medical needs within this market, with high SVR rates across genotypes with eight weeks of therapy.","We're making good progress with the risankizumab program, which is in development in partnership with BI. We recently completed, ahead of schedule, patient enrollment for the pivotal studies in psoriasis, with data from three of these trials expected in 2017. We recently launched ZINBRYTA, for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and are in the early stages of our rollout in collaboration with Biogen. And we've also continued to advance assets from the Stemcentrx pipeline. We recently started a basket study evaluating Rova-T in several neuroendocrine tumors where DLL3 is expressed. And we also initiated a regimen selection study for Rova-T in front-line small-cell lung cancer. Based on our performance year-to-date, we're raising our full-year 2016 guidance to $4.80 to $4.82 on an adjusted basis, reflecting growth of 12.1% at the midpoint.","Over the past several months, we've received a lot of interest regarding our expectations for 2017. While we're in the midst of our annual planning process, based on the continued strength of the business and especially HUMIRA and IMBRUVICA, we're now at a point where we can provide some high-level direction regarding our top and bottom line growth expectations for 2017. We expect low-double-digit operational growth in 2017. 2017 will be another important year of investment in R&D, as we expand our leadership position in immunology and hematological oncology and also build our position in solid tumors. As a result, we expect EPS growth of roughly 13% to 15% from the midpoint of our new 2016 guidance range. This level of performance positions AbbVie to be among the industry leaders for both revenue and EPS growth once again next year. We'll outline our detailed 2017 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in January.","Since our inception in 2013, we've delivered strong financial results, and we're well-positioned to deliver industry-leading growth again in 2017 for the third consecutive year. We continue to be proud of our strong execution, and we remain committed to our long-term strategic and financial objectives, which we outlined for you in October of 2015. AbbVie represents a unique investment opportunity, offering both compelling growth, along with a strong return of capital to investors, including a rapidly growing dividend. To that end, today we announced our board of directors declared an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $0.57 per share to $0.64 per share, an increase of over 12%, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2017. We view the dividend as an important aspect of our investment identity and as a sign of our confidence in the business going forward. Since the company's inception in 2013, AbbVie has increased its dividend by more than 60%.","In summary, the strategy we've put in place puts news a position to deliver strong top and bottom line performance. We've established growth platforms in some of the largest and most attractive segments, and we've built a compelling pipeline in these areas, which will contribute significantly to our performance in the years to come. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?","Michael Severino","Thank you, Rick. Once again, we had a very productive quarter in R&D, with significant progress across a number of programs. Today, I'll highlight key pipeline events that occurred during the quarter, as well as some of our upcoming milestones. I'll start with oncology, an area where we are advancing our pipeline in both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.","Turning our attention to solid tumors, we continue to make good progress with Rova-T. We recently began enrolling patients in two new studies, a Phase I, eight-arm basket study in a broad set of narrow endocrine tumors, and a Phase 1\/2 regimen-selection study in front-line small-cell lung cancer. We expect to start seeing data from both studies in the second half of next year. The Rova-T program in relapsed\/refractory small-cell lung cancer is progressing well. We continue to see good results from the ongoing Phase 1 study, with patients still alive more than two years after receiving just two doses of Rova-T. Enrollment in the TRINITY study, our confirmatory third-line registrational trial in small-cell lung cancer, is also going very well. And we expect the study to be fully enrolled within the next month. Data from TRINITY will be available next year, which will trigger the submission of our regulatory dossiers.","We are also on the cusp of starting two additional Rova-T studies, MARU, the Phase 3 registrational trial evaluating standard chemotherapy followed by Rova-T in the front-line setting, and the Phase 1\/2 combination study, evaluating Rova-T with Opdivo and with Opdivo and Yervoy in small-cell lung cancer. We expect both trials to be up and running by the end of the year.","We're also making good progress with other assets from the Stemcentrx pipeline. In addition to Rova-T, we have four assets in the clinic and are on track to transition up to five additional programs into the clinic over the next year. This will add to our growing oncology pipeline of more than 35 late preclinical or clinical stage assets.","I'll now turn to our hem\/onc programs. In the quarter, we announced our U.S. regulatory submission of a Supplemental New Drug Application for the use of IMBRUVICA in previously treated patients with marginal-zone lymphoma, a slow-growing form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma which accounts for roughly 12% of NHL cases. There are currently no approved treatments specifically indicated for patients with marginal-zone lymphoma, and we expect a regulatory decision in the first half of 2017. The data that supported this regulatory submission will also be presented at the upcoming ASH meeting in December. Additionally, at ASH, we'll present data from the registration-enabling trial in chronic graft-versus-host disease, as well as data from several other IMBRUVICA studies across multiple blood cancers, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma.","We've also made significant progress with the development of Venclexta, which was approved earlier this year in the U.S. under priority review for its first indication, as monotherapy in patients with relapsed\/refractory CLL with the 17p deletion mutation, a small but medically important segment of the CLL market and an important first step for this exciting new therapy. Earlier this month, we received Canadian approval for Venclexta in previously treated CLL patients with the 17p deletion mutation, as well as in patients with no other treatment options regardless of their mutational status.","We also received a positive opinion from the European CHMP for the treatment of relapsed\/refractory CLL patients with 17p deletion or TP53 mutations. The CHMP also recommended approval of Venclexta for patients who have failed both chemo immunotherapy and a B-cell inhibitor, regardless of mutational status. Venclexta has demonstrated strong efficacy, driving deep levels of response and durable disease control, both as monotherapy and in combination with Rituxan in patients with relapsed\/refractory CLL. Earlier this year, Venclexta received the FDA's breakthrough therapy designation for use in combination with rituximab for the treatment of patients with relapsed\/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","We're expecting data from the MURANO study in the first half of next year, which will support a broader label in relapsed\/refractory CLL. The breakthrough designation and the upcoming MURANO data are important milestones for Venclexta that will expand use to the broader relapsed\/refractory CLL population. We remain excited about the long-term potential for this molecule and believe that Venclexta will be effective across a range of blood cancers.","We're particularly encouraged by the opportunity in AML, as the data generated to date have demonstrated clear signs of efficacy. Earlier this year, Venclexta received its third breakthrough therapy designation for use in combination with hypomethylating agents for the treatment of patients with AML who are ineligible to receive standard induction with high-dose chemotherapy. We're moving quickly with Venclexta's development in AML and expect to begin our Phase 3 programs by the end of the year. At the upcoming ASH meeting, we'll also present Venclexta data in a range of tumor types, including Phase 1 safety and efficacy data in both AML and multiple myeloma, as well as results from the mid-stage CONTRALTO and CAVALLI studies in follicular lymphoma and B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, respectively.","As we look ahead to 2017, there will be several additional key data readouts from our hematologic\/oncology portfolio that could enable registration of both IMBRUVICA and Venclexta in new indications. For IMBRUVICA, there are a number of planned interim analyses that could potentially lead to regulatory filings, including data in relapsed\/refractory, follicular lymphoma, front-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and in front-line mantle cell lymphoma. And for Venclexta, as I mentioned, we'll see data from the MURANO study, which will support a broader Venclexta label in CLL.","Now we'll move on to our immunology programs, where we continue to make great progress with our two late-stage immunology assets, risankizumab and ABT-494. As Rick mentioned, we have fully enrolled the Phase 3 psoriasis program for risankizumab and will begin to see data from these pivotal studies toward of the end of the next year. Interest in the psoriasis program has been very strong, as evidenced by the fact that we fully enrolled the four Phase 3 studies in just seven and a half months, well ahead of our planning assumptions.","The registration trials in Crohn's disease are expected to begin next year, and we also intend to move risankizumab into late-stage studies in both ulcerative colitis and psoriatic arthritis by the end of 2017. The registration-enabling studies for ABT-494 in RA are also progressing very well, and we remain on track for data readouts from these Phase 3 studies during the first half of 2018. The development program for ABT-494 in gastrointestinal disorders is also progressing well, with a Phase 2 study in Crohn's disease ongoing and a Phase 2 study in ulcerative colitis getting underway in the third quarter. Data from the Crohn's study should be available in the first half of 2017, with Phase 3 Crohn's studies starting later in the year. We also recently began a Phase 2 study to evaluate our oral selective JAK1 inhibitor in atopic dermatitis.","I'll now move to virology, where we're nearing the completion of our registrational program for our next-generation HCV regimen. This program was designed to investigate a faster path to cure for all genotypes types of HCV and to address treatment areas of continued unmet need. Based on the data we've presented today, our once-daily pan-genotypic regimen is highly effective and has the potential to cure the majority of HCV patients in just eight weeks.","The FDA recently granted breakthrough therapy designation for our next-generation regimen, for the treatment of patients with chronic HCV who have failed previous therapy with directly acting antivirals in genotype 1. This designation is an important step in our efforts to bring our pan-genotypic regimen to market. At the AASLD meeting in November, we'll be presenting pivotal data from our next-generation regimen, including results from eight-week cohorts in non-psoriatics, as well as data in patients who have failed prior DAA-containing regimens. We expect to submit the NDA for our next-generation HCV regimen to the FDA by the end of this year and file the marketing authorization application with the EMA in the first quarter next year, and we remain on track for commercialization in the U.S. in 2017. We believe that AbbVie's pan-genotypic, once-daily, ribavirin-free HCV therapy will be competitively positioned and will be able to address the remaining unmet medical need within this market.","Finally, in the area of women's health, we are nearing completion of our Phase 3 endometriosis program, with regulatory submission planned for 2017. The Elagolix clinical development program includes the largest clinical trials conducted to date in endometriosis, with nearly 1,700 patients in two pivotal trials. At the ASRM Congress earlier this month, we presented detailed results from two pivotal studies, demonstrating that Elagolix reduced menstrual and non-menstrual pelvic pain associated with endometriosis compared to placebo. We also presented research on the economic and healthcare costs associated with endometriosis and endometriosis-related surgery in women in the United States. These data support AbbVie's continued efforts to pursue a regulatory filing of Elagolix as a potential new treatment option for the most prevalent symptoms of the disease. In addition to the endometriosis program, we have Phase 3 studies underway in uterine fibroids. This program is investigating the effect of Elagolix on heavy bleeding related to this highly prevalent condition. We anticipate beginning to see data from this Phase 3 program late next year.","So in summary we are very pleased with the progress of our pipeline and are on track for further advancements in the remainder of 2016 and into 2017. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on our third quarter performance. Bill?","William Chase","Thanks Mike. This morning I'll review our third quarter performance and provide an update on our outlook for 2016.","In the quarter, we delivered strong operational sales growth of 8%, excluding a little more than 0.5% of unfavorable impact from foreign currency. We exceeded our adjusted earnings per share guidance, delivering growth of more than 7% compared to the third quarter of 2015. HUMIRA delivered another quarter of strong sales growth, with global sales of more than $4 billion, up 12.1% operationally. Globally we continue to see strong volume growth across all therapeutic segments.","In the U.S., HUMIRA sales increased 16.7% compared to the prior year. The growth rate in the quarter was negatively impacted by 4 points due to higher customer ordering patterns in the prior year, a reversal of what we experienced with second quarter growth rates. Normalized for this, HUMIRA performance in the quarter exceeded 20%, comprised of low-teen prescription growth and single-digit price. Wholesaler inventory levels remained below half a month across all periods. On a year-to-date basis, HUMIRA U.S. sales growth exceeds 24%. For the fourth quarter, we forecast sales growth in excess of 20%, which will contribute to our full-year forecast of above 20%.","International HUMIRA sales were more than $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 4.5% on an operational basis. Biosimilar Remicade has not had a material impact on performance, and the Enbrel biosimilar continues to perform in line with our previously communicated assumptions. We continue to forecast HUMIRA international operational sales growth in the mid-single digits for the full year. HUMIRA's unique product profile and AbbVie's strong commercial execution has made HUMIRA the number one prescribed biologic, and we continue to see strong momentum for HUMIRA as market leader around the world.","Global IMBRUVICA net revenues in the third quarter were $501 million, up nearly 65% over prior year, driven by increased penetration in relapsed\/refractory CLL and other indications, as well as continued uptake in first-line CLL where we launched earlier this year.","Global Viekira sales in the third quarter were $378 million, down versus the prior year. Our international business delivered operational sales growth of nearly 31% in the quarter, driven by new launches and continued uptake. In the U.S., as we communicated earlier this year, we have seen market share loss and some price erosion due to the entrance of a new competitor in the market.","Global sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease, grew 21.4% on an operational basis in the quarter, reflecting robust international growth and a modest level of U.S. sales. We also saw strong operational sales growth in the quarter from Creon, which was up 16.6%.","We are in the early stages of our commercial launches of Venclexta and ZINBRYTA, which had modest sales impact in the third quarter. We have begun our commercial rollout of Venclexta with our first priority being to ensure adequate physician training and to give physicians an opportunity to gain experience with a dosing ramp. As we've outlined, our initial indication for Venclexta, relapsed\/refractory CLL patients with the 17p deletion, represents a fairly small market segment, estimated to be roughly $300 million. IMBRUVICA currently holds a strong market leadership position in this segment, with well over 50% share.","However, Venclexta is an asset that offers significant growth potential over the longer term. It in the next several years, we expect to augment our label to address the broader relapsed\/refractory CLL patient population, expand in earlier lines of therapy, and broaden into other hematologic malignancies. The next major milestone for Venclexta will be the submission of data from the MURANO trial to regulatory authorities, which will expand the addressable patient population from Venclexta to all relapsed\/refractory CLL patients, a much larger patient population. This will add meaningfully to Venclexta's growth, beginning in 2018. Additionally, we expect further augmentation of the Venclexta label beginning in 2019, with the potential for first-line data and expansion into additional blood cancers.","In August, we launched ZINBRYTA in the U.S. The ZINBRYTA label requires the establishment of an appropriate REMS program, and we are on track with the required physician certification and training. While we're very early in the launch, we're encouraged by the level of physician and patient interest. For example, in the U.S. more than 80% of our high-priority physicians have been certified through the REMS program, enabling them to begin prescribing. Based on the approved labeling, we expect ZINBRYTA to be used as a third-line agent, offering a unique mechanism of action, compelling efficacy, and convenient dosing.","Turning to the P&L profile for the quarter. The adjusted gross margin was 80.7% of sales. On a comparative year-over-year basis, this ratio reflects an adverse impact from foreign exchange of roughly 320 basis points. In addition, the adjusted gross margin reflects 110 basis points of unfavorable impact related to the Pharmacyclics acquisition, including the profit transfer for IMBRUVICA, which is booked as cost of goods sold. Adjusting for these impacts, the gross margin profile improved by approximately 170 basis points versus the prior year. Adjusted R&D was 16.5% of sales, supporting pipeline opportunities in oncology, immunology, HCV, and other areas.","Adjusted SG&A was 21.4% of sales in the third quarter, down 160 basis points from the prior year, as we drive operational deficiencies (sic) [efficiencies] (30:49) while maintaining our investments in our growth brands. Adjusted operating margin was 42.8% of sales, down 210 basis points relative to the third quarter of 2015. Excluding the negative impact of exchange, the operating margin profile improved 120 basis points versus the prior year. We remain committed to achieving an adjusted operating margin target of greater than 50% of sales by 2020. Net interest expense was $250 million in the quarter, and the adjusted tax rate was 19.9% in the quarter. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share, excluding noncash intangible amortization expense and other specified items, was $1.21, up 7.1% year over year.","Moving on to our outlook for the remainder of the year. Based on our strong business performance year-to-date and our confidence in our momentum going forward, we are raising our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance range to $4.80 to $4.82, reflecting adjusted EPS growth of 12.1% at the midpoint. We are also updating our 2016 GAAP EPS guidance range to $3.74 to $3.76, which includes $1.06 per share of noncash intangible amortization expense and other specified items. Regarding the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $1.18 to $1.20. This excludes roughly $0.22 of noncash amortization and other specified items. We expect high single-digit operational sales growth with minimal foreign exchange impacts in the quarter.","In closing, we delivered strong performance in the quarter. We've driven strong top and bottom line growth, while also advancing our strategic priorities and our pipeline. And, as Rick outlined, we're well-positioned for strong growth again in 2017, as we expect to deliver low double-digit operational revenue growth and EPS growth of 13% to 15% from the midpoint of our new 2016 guidance range. This level of performance should place us among the industry leaders for both revenue and EPS growth once again next year. And, underscoring our confidence in the business going forward, today we announced a 12.3% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2017.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.","Elizabeth Shea","Thanks, Bill. We'll now open the call for questions. Operator, we'll take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operation Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ms. Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Ma'am, your line is open.","Jami Rubin","Thank you. Rick, a couple questions. My first question is more sort of a broad industry question, and maybe you can talk about what you're seeing from your perspective. Obviously, there is tremendous concern in the marketplace about structural change to pricing. We saw McKesson highlight significant moderation in price increases next year, which caused them to lower their guidance. Novo significantly lowered their expectations. Amgen talked about TNF pricing basically going away. From your vantage point, what are you seeing, and maybe you can share with us changes that we should anticipate in our models with respect to net pricing for HUMIRA in the U.S. going forward?","Secondly, we appreciate the early commentary and color on 2017 guidance, 13% to 15% earnings growth. However, that is a little bit below consensus. Maybe if you could just step back \u2013 you gave us 2020 guidance a couple years ago; maybe you could just step back and help us think about the cadence of earnings growth. AbbVie's a different company from the industry average just given the looming competition to HUMIRA. Maybe if you could just help us think about the growth of this company over the next five years, how you're thinking about it? What you see relative to the plan that you put out a couple years ago? Thanks very much.","Richard Gonzalez","Sure, Jami. So this is Rick. Thank you for the questions.","I think as you look at price, certainly the rhetoric on price has been more intense than we've seen it in a number of years, and some of that is driven by the political environment, and some of its driven by more fundamentals. I think if you look at our business specifically, our business is primarily a volume-driven business. That's not to say we don't benefit at all from price. But clearly the vast majority of our growth comes from volume.","And the key, I think, for our entire industry is to continue to drive innovation and innovative products in general. And innovative pharmaceuticals, I think in general, tend to save the healthcare system money over time. And I don't know that we've done everything we should do to be able to make sure that, one, we get that message out and, two, maybe support that message a little bit better than we than we have in the past. And so I think that's the key for the industry going forward. And that's the thing that we need to focus our attention on. And if you look at the products that we've been successful with, I think they have a good economic value proposition. HUMIRA's a good example of that as well.","And so what I'd say as we look at our planning process, just as we have in previous years, we tend to plan conservatively when it comes to price and then evaluate the market environment at the time that we ultimately get close to that period of time and make a decision around what is the appropriate pricing strategy. And our guidance in 2017 and our long-range plan are both reflective of that philosophy. That philosophy hasn't changed.","I think if you look at the 2017 EPS forecast that we gave you, I'd say that there's two things in the consensus that are important to look at. One is, if you looked at consensus, I don't believe everyone has rolled into their model the full year R&D expectation for the BI and the Stemcentrx acquisition, and so obviously that was not reflected in the overall consensus numbers. The second thing is if you look at gross margin, the consensus number's gross margin profile is off. And we've communicated that a couple of times. And where it's off is trying to calculate what the partnered products' contribution will be.","And I think if you look at those two factors, if you look at the top line, what we're communicating is very close to what the top line is. If you look at our overall operating expenses, certainly SG&A, R&D's a little bit higher, SG&A, probably be a little bit lower, but net-net, probably a little bit higher. But the difference that you would see would be in the gross margin profile. The other thing I'd say is if you look at that level of performance based on everything that we see, it will rank us certainly in the top tier if not number one. Obviously, we have to see what others report, but based on consensus that's out there today. So we're delivering another year of truly outstanding performance.","As far as what we communicated to you from the long-range plan back in October, as I said in my formal comments, this is consistent with what we communicated. I'd say we're still on track to be able to deliver what we expected. And in fact, if anything, I'd say HUMIRA is probably ahead. I think there was a lot of surprise when we first communicated the $18 billion for HUMIRA. There's obviously less surprise now to that number based on our overall performance. And so I think we're tracking on what we had communicated. We're absolutely committed to delivering a 50% operating margin by 2020. And that's despite the negative impact that we will see from the partner products. And we're committed to be able to drive that average compounded growth rate of EPS that we communicated, as well as our top line.","And we continue to have a lot of confidence in the business going forward. As we look at the pipeline rolling out, the assets in our late-stage pipeline, I think, are continuing to advance in a way that is consistent with what we thought back then, and those assets are starting to roll out now, as Venclexta, as an example, gets a broader label. That's going to be a very meaningful contributor to our overall performance. And a number of other programs are continuing to advance. Risankizumab as an example, I think, is ahead of schedule by a significant amount of time. 494 continues to advance very well. And so generally what I'd say is we're very confident in what our outlook looks like, and it's consistent with what we communicated to you back in October of 2015.","Jami Rubin","Thank you.","Elizabeth Shea","Operator, we'll take the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Holford from Jefferies. Sir, your line is open.","Jeffrey Holford","Oh, good morning. Thanks very much for taking my question. Just want to ask you, Rick, just to comment on a couple of things said by Amgen yesterday. So they have an expectation for flat net pricing for their TNF in 2017. Do you have a similar expectation built into your guidance for 2017 for HUMIRA? I wonder if you can give us a bit more color on that. And then beyond 2017, do you already anticipate that that flat net pricing in the U.S., if that's what you consider for 2017, actually becomes negative maybe in 2018, 2019? Just wondering what you've considered in your midterm plan.","And then also, Amgen seemed to communicate yesterday evening that they won't launch at risk in 2017, and indeed whilst the legal process is going on. Is that your interpretation of what they were saying also? And how long you think do you think that that legal process going to go on for? I don't know if you have any court dates yet. Thanks very much.","Richard Gonzalez","Okay. Thanks, Jeff. So I'm not going to necessarily give you the absolute color on what our assumption is in 2017 as it relates to price. But I'd say we don't have a consistent view of the TNF market to the one that was described by Amgen. And I think every product obviously has a different perspective in the marketplace.","Maybe it's worthwhile to walk through HUMIRA in a little bit of detail, because I know there's always a lot of interest in it, and that'll give you, I think, a perspective of where we stand overall. I mean, if you step back and you look at where HUMIRA is, take the international market first, HUMIRA continues to perform as we've described it, despite the fact that we've seen the launch of Enbrel biosimilars in that market now for about seven or eight months, I would guess, maybe nine months, something like that, that they've actually been in the marketplace. They've had a very modest impact. We're delivering mid-single digit growth, as we've described to you. In fact, this quarter was about 4.5%.","Now, the interesting thing is, if you adjust for the impact of Venezuela, which will be a one-time impact in 2016, the underlying growth of our international business for HUMIRA is 7.6%. So good, strong growth. It's primarily volume growth because you typically have negative price in those international markets. So I'd say HUMIRA's performing exactly where we would have expected it to perform in the international markets.","If you look at the U.S., the U.S. has had just truly outstanding growth. If you looked at the past six quarters, on average, HUMIRA has averaged about 25% growth. The last two quarters, second and third quarter, if you average the two of them together, the growth was 21.7%. If you make the adjustment for the ordering patterns that Bill described, third quarter was just over 20% growth. And, as Bill indicated, we're forecasting 20% growth again in the fourth quarter. The October weeklies are consistent with that. We obviously pay a lot of attention to HUMIRA. And so this brand continues to grow extremely well. And the vast majority of that growth is volume.","If you look at market share in the U.S., we continue to perform well. Probably the best way to look at market share would be, if you track it at the beginning of 2016 and look at it through the latest data points that we have, which would be September data points, the overall market share for HUMIRA is about 31.8%. It's up 0.6% over that period of time from January through September. Rheumatology, our share is 26.8%; it's increased a full point over that period of time. Gastro and derm, our market share remains basically flat at 43% and 35% market share.","And so this brand continues to perform extremely well in the marketplace. And it's because of the attributes of this product and how well it is accepted by physicians and by patients. We're continuing to see good market growth. There's an anomaly in the IMS data because a large managed-care organization has blinded their data, but it's still in the base. But what I would tell you is that if you look at script growth on HUMIRA, it's above 13% when you make the appropriate adjustments. And the market's growing high single digits, around 9% or so. So prescription growth continues to be extremely robust.","And then if you look at our formulary position, we just finished our 2017-2018 negotiations. We're pleased with how those negotiations sorted themselves out. We basically had the same level of strong market access for HUMIRA that we had in 2016. Net price, which we don't talk about a lot, but what I can tell is you there was only a very minimal, almost no change in net price between the 2016 contracts and the 2017 and 2018 contracts. And all other attributes of the contracts, like price protection, are consistent \u2013 basically consistent with what we've had previously. And so we feel good about our access in the marketplace.","And so I think you can expect that HUMIRA's going to continue to perform well. I mean, every brand has its own set of issues that it has to deal with, and I'm certainly not in a position to be able to talk about their brand. But what I am in a position to talk about is how HUMIRA's performed and how we expect it to continue to perform going forward. Price is something that, as I said, we look at it very carefully every single year, and we make a determination as to what we think is appropriate. And we'll do the exact same thing this year. We typically build in a conservative level of price into our planning assumptions because we don't want to be exposed in any way, and in the information that we provided you thus far, it includes that level of conservative assumptions built into it.","As it relates to the comments on the litigation, that's not something I can talk about in a lot of detail. I would've interpreted their comments to be the same as the way you interpreted them. I don't think that's a big surprise. At the end of the day, when you look at the magnitude of our IP portfolio and you look at the risk of launching at risk against that portfolio, that would be a high-risk proposition for anyone, and we've made our intentions very clear about, we plan to enforce our IP against anyone who attempts to enter the marketplace, and that we would \u2013 if someone chose to make a decision to launch at risk, we would seek a PI. And I think the power of our IP, I think, is very clear in the marketplace. So hopefully that was responsive to your question.","Jeffrey Holford","Thanks very much.","Elizabeth Shea","Thanks, operator. We'll take the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Christopher Schott","Great. Thanks very much. Just two quick ones here. First, Rick, just to clarify that comment you made on HUMIRA net pricing for 2017. I know you don't talk a lot about price, but just to make sure I heard that right, did you say minimal to no change in net price? Is that basically implying you're not seeing net price up in 2017, or is that referring to the kind of realized price increase? I just wanted to make sure I heard that one right. The second one was just talking about formulary dynamics. I think some payers have talked about wanting to move to more indication-based pricing and have talked specifically about the TNF category. Just interested in your thoughts on that, and is that anything we should be seeing from you either in 2017 or 2018 as you're going through these formulary discussions? Thanks very much.","Richard Gonzalez","Well, as I described to you before, Chris \u2013 so we are through the 2017 and 2018 negotiations now. Now, that doesn't mean you can't open something up. But at the end of the day, we have completed all of our negotiations at this point for the 2017 and 2018 contract periods. My comment on net price was essentially, as you go in and you negotiate for your next contract, typically there is pressure to take your rebates up, right? So that's \u2013 if you put any price increase and the fall-through of price increase aside, it's what would you increase your rebates by over that period of time? That's what my comment was designed to address, that there was minimal to no change from that perspective. Any price will flow through based on the normal dynamics of how that would occur. And, as I said, it was consistent with what we had in place from any levels of price protection in 2016. So it's basically business as usual for us going forward in 2017 and 2018.","As far as indication-based pricing, I mean, I think that's a phenomenon that originally started in the area of oncology, where you could have an oncolytic agent that had very different activity or efficacy in one type of cancer versus another, and is the value proposition the same? If you look at HUMIRA typically across the areas that we compete, HUMIRA is typically the gold standard in most of the areas that we compete in. I'd say generally speaking we have seen some interest in indication-based pricing and potentially doing that. That's not something that, as I said, I think fits well for HUMIRA because of its broad applicability and its level of performance across the range of indications that it has. But it's certainly something that has been of interest. I don't see that as a fundamental issue in the contracting that we've seen go forward for 2017 and 2018, at least for HUMIRA.","Christopher Schott","Thank you.","Elizabeth Shea","Operator, we'll take the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi. Your line is open.","Andrew Baum","Hi. A couple of questions, please. Could you help me just further categorize the slowing HUMIRA growth, given the biosimilar impact is obviously going to be pretty limited given the geography and limited time that the other TNF biosimilars have been the market. How much is competition from the IL-17s in the psoriasis class? How much is saturation of indications? And how much is mandatory price reductions outside the U.S.? And I know you've given earnings guidance for next year. I wonder whether you'd like to give revenue guidance for HUMIRA.","Second, AbbVie's enjoyed a mutually positive relationship with the PBMs. In general, do you anticipate any change between the relationships between the PBMs and the pharma industry given the political focus on the PBMs on the lack of transparency, as well as the ongoing attorney general investigations?","And then finally, for Mike, could you tell us what percentage of patients on IMBRUVICA run into problems with atrial fibrillation or coagulopathy? I'm obviously thinking about future competition from Astra's acalabrutinib. Many thanks.","William Chase","So Andrew, in terms of HUMIRA, if you look at the overall growth rates outside the U.S., I can't give you a complete slice of what IL-17s are doing specifically, because it impacts market by market. But broadly, when you look at our assumptions that we had around biosimilars and the underlying growth of the markets, things have been progressing very, very well.","So you look at major markets across Europe, we've got market growing in the low teens, no changes there. And if you look at HUMIRA share, very, very minimal change year over year. Biosimilar Remicade has not had a major impact on the brand in any way whatsoever. And Enbrel, as we had told you at the beginning of the year, we anticipated a 2 to 3 percentage growth impact, but that was more or less based on the pricing that we expected the biosimilar to come in at. So the biosimilars have been performing very much in line with our expectations.","The new entrants to market \u2013 look, it's something we're watching very closely. But the reality is, those new entrants tend to get slotted as for patients that are ultimately anti-TNF failures. And so while they are ultimately gaining some traction in the market and they're picking up market share, I don't think you should read that through as a direct erosion to the market share of HUMIRA. Again, in fact, we've got a very, very strong market share position across those markets.","Richard Gonzalez","I think, Andrew \u2013 this is Rick. When you say the brand is slowing, I'm not sure whether you're referencing what Bill said in his comments about the prior-year inventory levels or you're just looking at, as in the U.S., as I said in my comments a moment ago, we've averaged over six quarters about 25%, and the last two quarters are more in the 21% range. There's obviously fluctuation from quarter to quarter. But if you look at the dollar contribution across those quarters of growth, it's fairly consistent. And there's always ins and outs, but at the end of the day, as the brand gets bigger, the percent growth is going to go down, and the brand has obviously grown significantly across that period of time.","If you look at the IL-17s of some of the other brands, as I mentioned in the market share, our market share in derm is roughly flat. We clearly have the leadership position in that segment. And I think as we look at the dynamics within that market, just to reinforce what Bill said, it's typically the number two player that's getting the bulk of any erosion in their market share with the entrance of a new mechanism like a 17, as an example, because it is usually the second-line failure that they tend to get their market share from. And so HUMIRA has not had as much as of a negative impact based on that because we're typically the first TNF that is used in those indications.","On the PBMs, obviously we try to have good relationships with all of our customers, whether they be managed care organizations or PBMs. They are professional relationships. I think PBMs serve a very important purpose. They obviously allow plans to be able to have formularies that they can help manage, and that's the role that they play, and we play an important role with them in being able to supply them with products that can go on those formularies, and so I think it's a typical business relationship.","And on IMBRUVICA, I mean, I don't know that we commented specifically about the rates. They're obviously relatively low rates. Mike, do you want to add anything?","Michael Severino","Well, I think we can comment on the clinical trial experience as probably the best ability to assess the rates. And there the AFib rates have been in large data sets, so big Phase 3 studies, on the order of about 6% to 7% on a number of \u2013 across the studies that make up our label. And there is a background rate, of course, for AFib in that population as well, which runs in the low single digits. And for bleeding events, we're seeing bleeding events in about that same range of patients. And, again, there's a background rate in the population. With bleeding, most of the episodes of major bleeding that we've seen in our clinical trial program have generally been associated with other precipitants, so trauma or other events that might be associated with bleeding. And, again, there's a background rate there as well.","Andrew Baum","Thank you.","Elizabeth Shea","Thanks, Andrew. Operator, we'll take the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Vamil Divan","Great. Great, thanks so much for taking my questions. So two questions I have. So one on HUMIRA. You've talked obviously kind of how you see things relative to the longer-term guidance you gave last year. I just had a question more on the longer term, because I think there's been a lot of expectation that once there is biosimilar HUMIRA available in the U.S., because of some of the relationships you have with the PBMs, that the erosion of HUMIRA may be relatively slow. I'm wondering if any of this sort of rhetoric and discussion around drug pricing and transparency around drug pricing, does that change your view on the tail for HUMIRA after we have biosimilar entry, whatever year that entry actually occurs in the U.S.?","And then my second question, a couple of your key pipeline products are also in the autoimmune [indiscernible] oral JAK and your IL-23. I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the dynamic there, because there's obviously competitors ahead of you in both of those spaces. You're going to be entering what appears to be pretty competitive and maybe price-sensitive markets as well. And you will not have the same sort of dominant position that you've enjoyed with HUMIRA. So how do you think about the opportunity to get into those markets coming behind competitors, with price again being a potential issue? Thanks.","Richard Gonzalez","Yeah, I mean, based on the long-term expectations, as we've communicated to the market before, we don't anticipate biosimilar competition in the U.S. market for quite some time. And so I think we have a strategy that we have developed that we will put in place at the point at which we see biosimilar competition in any market around the world. We'll obviously implement that strategy outside the U.S. potentially earlier, in an earlier timeframe. And that strategy is designed for us to be able to maintain our position going forward. I think it's far enough out in the U.S. that we will have to see how the dynamics play out. I don't anticipate anything significantly changing that strategy based on how we would employ the strategy, based on the debates that we see going on and the market dynamics going on.","I'll have Mike maybe talk a little bit about the JAKs and the IL-23s from a performance standpoint, but what I would say from a market standpoint is we have always tried to position that our follow-on products would be significantly differentiated versus others in the marketplace. And we've designed our clinical trials to be able to produce that level of differentiation. And I would expect that if anything we would be in a better position based on our experience and our position in this market to be able to launch these products successfully into the market as companion products behind what will be a workhouse product like HUMIRA. We still anticipate that HUMIRA will be the workhorse product that will handle the vast majority of the volume, particularly in the beginning, and these products will fit into different segments going forward in a complementary way, and I think that gives us an advantage, not a disadvantage, in the marketplace. Mike?","Michael Severino","Yes, this is Mike. What I would add is, as a leader in immunology, we have a very clear understanding of the profile that we believe will be competitive, not only today but in the future and in the timeframe that these products will launch. And when we look at, in the case of the two molecules you mentioned, the Phase 2b data to make a decision on either advancement or in-licensing, we kept that profile in mind.","And I think each of those assets stands up very well to that understanding of what we'll need to be competitive. With the JAK, for example, that's why we focused on differentiated efficacies, strong efficacy in very difficult-to-treat patient populations, and very, very strong data at the higher-levels response, endpoints like remission, low disease activity, durable ACR70s, and the like. And for risankizumab, it was it was really the same thought process. We looked at those data and we believed, based on a very substantial set of clinical trial results, that the efficacy there was truly differentiated. And we can point, for example, to the approximately 50% posi 100 response for risankizumab in Phase 2b with very favorable pharmaceutical properties of that agent, very favorable dosing that we believe is attainable in Phase 3 and in registration. So we're keeping that profile in mind, and we're advancing assets that we believe will be competitive in the future.","Elizabeth Shea","Thanks, Vamil. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Your line is open.","Geoff Meacham","I wanted to switch gears away from HUMIRA a little bit and talk a little bit about IMBRUVICA. And curious if you can give us any commentary post the first-line approval just with respect to durational therapy, dose interruptions. Clearly extended treatment is clearly one of the big value drivers here for IMBRUVICA. And then just for Elagolix, just wanted to get your perspective, updated perspective, just given a new competitor in the marketplace about the value of having add-back or not and what that means in terms of differentiation in the women's health market. Thanks.","Richard Gonzalez","This is Rick. I think on IMBRUVICA, if you look at our performance in first line, we're obviously pleased with the ramp that we've seen so far. I mean, we're ramping fairly rapidly to about 20% now of the overall market. The duration of therapy, I think we've communicated historically, has been in the area of about 75% of the clinical trial experience. I haven't seen the data in the last couple of months, but I think in first line it's consistent with that, and it has been increasing slightly in the relapsed\/refractory area. But it's certainly at a very respectable level and certainly isn't anything that we're concerned about at all. I mean, it's certainly at a level that we would expect it to be going forward.","And so I think the adoption of IMBRUVICA in that first line, I think the speed of adoption in that first line is an indication of the power of the data that we've seen in RESONATE-2 and physicians' receptivity to that data, both from a PFS and an overall survival standpoint. That's really what's driving a lot of the usage of this product. And I think as we expand and provide even more data, we should continue to see the ability to be able to penetrate that first-line market to an even greater extent. Elagolix?","Michael Severino","With respect to Elagolix, we're obviously aware of the competition and keep a close eye on competition across all of our franchises. But we feel very good about the position we have with Elagolix. We have a substantial lead, having completed two Phase 3 studies, and competition is considerably behind that in terms of timing. And we're going to continue to drive that program forward. The efficacy and the safety results that we see, we view very favorably. We think they support the value proposition that we had in mind when we entered into Phase 3. And we're going to continue in subsequent studies, in post-registration studies, Phase 4 work, if you will, to continue to define that profile.","Add-back could be an important part of that profile, and we are pursuing that. And there may be other strategies to continue to enhance the value proposition for Elagolix. Then we're going to be driving forward with that aggressively.","Elizabeth Shea","Thanks, Geoff. Operator, we'll take the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman from UBS. Your line is open.","Ami Fadia","Hi. This is Ami Fadia; I'm on for Marc. Most of our questions have been answered, but I'll ask three quick follow-up questions. Firstly, on HUMIRA for the quarter, if you look at the sequential sales in 3Q versus 2Q, there was weakness sequentially, but if you could help us understand what might have driven that, that would be helpful. Secondly, just with respect to your long-range guidance for EPS growth, how should we think about the 15% growth over the longer term? Right now it's sort of ranging in the lower double-digit range. When do you expect to see the spike more closer to the mid double-digit range? And then thirdly, on Rova-T, could you elaborate a little bit on the basket study? What are you looking to see there? That would be helpful. Thanks.","William Chase","Ami, it's Bill Chase. HUMIRA's kind of a difficult brand to look at on a sequential quarter basis. First of all, it's a very well-established brand \u2013 growing rapidly, but well-established. If you go back and look over the years, it is not unusual in the U.S. or abroad to see a general flattening out over the summer and then an acceleration back in the back half of the year. And that is the pattern that we're seeing this year.","Now, could there be some degree of inventory between Q2 and Q3 that's impacting that sequential growth? Yeah. I mean, look, minor moves flow \u2013 impact that sequential. But really at the end of the day when we look at the brand, and we look at the dynamics around the brand, and we look at the prior year destock that we saw in the second quarter, and the subsequent restock in the third quarter, there is nothing that is alarming us about this third quarter. You have you to remember that our second quarter results had 26.7% growth. That was largely related \u2013 that difference from the 20% was largely related to a destocking event in the second quarter of 2015, and we're just seeing the impact of the restock in the third quarter of 2015. So we actually feel very, very good about it. We're guiding fourth quarter above 20%. We feel very, very good about our full-year forecast.","Richard Gonzalez","On the EPS, so 2015 we delivered EPS growth of 29%. And this year, the midpoint is about 12%, right?","Elizabeth Shea","Yeah.","Richard Gonzalez","Now, you got to remember, that 12% has the dilution associated with the Stemcentrx transaction and the dilution associated with the BI transaction. So that's certainly weighing on this year. We're guiding next year to be 13% to 15%, so that's certainly in the range of the 15% area. And then nothing has changed that gives me any concern that we won't achieve the number that we talked to you about on average across that period of 2015 to 2020, that we can average that kind of a compounded growth rate. But I'd say, thus far, if you look through 2017, you'd say we're at or above that range, across the average, including the dilution of those two transactions.","And then Rova-T?","Michael Severino","Yeah, this is Mike. With respect to the basket study for Rova-T, so this is a study that has eight arms, and each arm looks at a different type of the tumors that have neuroendocrine features and share the same underlying biology as small-cell lung cancer. Examples of these tumor types might be the large-cell component of non-small-cell lung cancer, a form of pancreatic cancer that has neuroendocrine features, subsets of colorectal cancer and metastatic melanoma, for example. So each of these eight arms is going to look for response rate in refractory patients with those tumors. And when we see a response rate that we view as indicative of good activity, we would then have the ability to expand out both those cohorts and start additional studies that could be registration-enabling, following the same conceptual strategy that we did with Rova-T and small-cell. Of course the nature of what each registrational program would look like would be tailored to the individual tumor type. But this is a study that could rapidly trigger additional registrational work in those other tumors as we see signs of activity.","Ami Fadia","Thank you.","Elizabeth Shea","Thanks, Ami. Operator, we'll take the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Scotti of Evercore LSI (sic) [ISI] (1:11:32). Your line is open.","John Scotti","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I have a couple, please. So I apologize for touching on this I think the third time, but I just want to make sure I'm absolutely clear. So when you say minimal to no change in net price from 2017 to \u2013 2016, 2017, 2018, just to be clear, so what you mean is that the gross-to-net spread on HUMIRA you don't anticipate widening, but you will still continue to capture at least some net price growth? Or is it that you do not anticipate on capturing any net price growth because gross-to-net spreads are widening?","And then also, I was also curious on the P&L management this quarter, particularly on the SG&A side, which came in a little bit better than expectations. So where are those cost savings coming from, and are they coming from HUMIRA? Are you reducing your global footprint on HUMIRA ahead of the biosimilar entry? If not, just curious where they're coming from. Thank you.","William Chase","Okay, so, John, just to clarify on the price, the net price comment refers to what happened to net price before any future price actions. Okay? Now, what we're not saying is that there will be no net price increase next year. We still have within our contracts the ability to raise price and see a positive impact on the P&L from those actions. The net price actually has to do with, without any future price increases \u2013 which, by the way, that isn't how we're modeling the year, what we would expect \u2013 price would be an a constant basis without price increases. The contracts allow us to take net price. And any net price increases, any price increase that we took, would have a positive impact on our bottom line. That's the way you need to think about it. That said, in 2017, we are planning conservatively, as we always do. We're approaching the 2017 guidance with the exact same philosophy on how we plan for price increases that we have in the past. So hopefully that helps out.","And then from a P&L management standpoint \u2013 look, the SG&A ratio, we're very pleased with. It's really a couple different things. There is a leverage impact from the rapidly growing top line that obviously we've been delivering over the last few quarters. That said, we look at our spend. We're looking at admin very, very closely. We're looking at the productivity of all of our SG&A investments, as you would expect us to. And we fund projects based on an ROI and a return. And if they have positive ROI, we find a way to get the money in the right places to deliver the return.","In terms of HUMIRA, we are not backing off our spend on HUMIRA. The spend on HUMIRA has been the driver of the spectacular growth that the brand has put up. And all of those programs are very, very high ROI, which as you can see \u2013 as you can imagine based on the sales growth.","John Scotti","Thank you.","Elizabeth Shea","Thanks, John. Operator, we'll take the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Alex Arfaei","Good morning, folks. Thank you for taking the questions. Most of my HUMIRA and price questions have been asked and answered. Just looking out at pipeline and business development opportunities, what are your thoughts about either developing or pursuing CAR-T products to augment your hematology pipeline and maintain your leadership? That seems to be where we're going with a lot of hematologic malignancies. Thank you.","Michael Severino","So this is Mike. With respect to CAR-Ts, obviously there's been a lot of activity. It's still early days for the use of those agents in later-stage trials and obviously not yet being registered agents. And there's also a lot of work that is going on to try to figure out what is the right functionality that one would want to build into a CAR-T to optimize its applicability across a range of both hematologic and other tumors. And so we're keeping a close eye on the space. As a leader in immunology with our very strong presence in oncology, obviously there are a lot of skills that we bring to the table that we think we could apply to CAR-Ts. And we'll continue to monitor that area closely, both with our internal work and keeping an eye on the external environment.","Elizabeth Shea","Thanks, Alex. Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Steve Scala from Cowen.","Steve Scala","Thank you very much. I believe HUMIRA's IP estate has increased by 30 or so patents from this point last year. Last year you gave us a very nice chart of the nature of the patents and the expiration dates. It was page 14 of your slide deck. In general terms, can you detail the nature of the additional 30 in terms of the type of patent they are and the expiration dates?","And then, secondly, AstraZeneca has saying they could file acalabrutinib for an indication by the end of this year, but I'm not aware that they have identified that indication. Does AbbVie have any competitive intelligence on what AstraZeneca might be up to? Thank you.","Richard Gonzalez","Yeah, Steve. This is Rick. On the IP, off the top of my head, I can't give you all of the dates of the incremental 30 patents. We continue to work on our patent estate. So I think maybe off-line we'll try to get back to you with whatever we are able to provide you.","And then, Mike, do you want to talk about AZ?","Michael Severino","Sure. This is Mike. And we've certainly heard the comments that you're referring to by AZ, but we agree that they've not been very specific. I don't think we can really speculate on what they have in mind. What I can tell you is with ibrutinib, we're moving forward very aggressively, very rapidly across a number of fronts, moving to front line in CLL, advancing our programs in other areas like non-Hodgkin lymphoma. So we're really focused on raising the bar there and making sure that we're driving IMBRUVICA as rapidly and aggressively as we possibly can.","Elizabeth Shea","Thanks, Steve.

Welcome to the AbbVie Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Liz Shea","Good morning and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Severino, Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer; and Bill Chase, Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you that some statements we make today are or may be considered forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.

AbbVie undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law.","On today\u2019s conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie\u2019s ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll take your questions.","So with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Rick.","Rick Gonzalez","Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I\u2019ll briefly discuss our second quarter performance and highlights as well as our full year guidance which we\u2019re increasing again this quarter. Mike will then provide an update on recent advancements across our R&D pipeline, and Bill will discuss the quarter in more detail. As always, following our remarks, we\u2019ll take your questions.","AbbVie once again delivered an outstanding quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $2. Representing growth of more than 40% versus last year and exceeding expectations. We also delivered strong top line results in the quarter with global adjusted operational sales growth of 17.1%. This outstanding performance was driven by growth from several assets across our portfolio including significant contributions from HUMIRA, IMBRUVICA, and MAVYRET.","We\u2019re extremely pleased with our performance in the quarter and the progress year-to-date. We\u2019ve driven outstanding commercial, operational and R&D execution resulting in strong top and bottom line results. Based on our performance in the first half of the year and the tremendous confidence we have in our business we\u2019re raising our full year 2018 EPS guidance by $0.10 we\u2019re now expecting adjusted earnings per share of $7.76 to $7.86 reflecting growth of 39.5% to midpoint. It\u2019s important to recognize this is the third increase to our earning\u2019s guidance for 2018. A testament to the momentum and confidence we have in our ongoing business fundamentals and underlying performance and we\u2019re raising our guidance despite the anticipated introduction of direct biosimilar competition in certain markets outside the United States in the fourth quarter. So clearly, we expect our performance in the second half of the year to continue to be robust.","As I mentioned a moment ago several products within our portfolio are driving strong growth. Starting with HUMIRA which delivered global operational sales growth of 8.2% in the quarter. In the US HUMIRA sales grew 10% driven by strong prescription volume growth across all three categories. Internationally, HUMIRA sales grew 4.4% operationally. We continue to be pleased with the underlying market trends across geographies and therapeutic segments.","Global sales of IMBRUVICA were $850 million in the quarter, an increase of more than 35% over the prior year. Globally we\u2019re seeing very strong patient uptake including higher market share and growth across multiple indications. This includes CLL where IMBRUVICA continues to be the clear market leader. We expect this momentum to continue based on the growing evidence illustrating IMBRUVICA\u2019s strong efficacy across the wide range of indications.","Global HCV sales were $973 million in the second quarter, again exceeding expectations with continued momentum from the MAVYRET launch. Based on its compelling clinical profile and our commercial execution. MAVYRET has achieved the market leading position in the US as well as strong leadership positions in a number of other major markets including Japan, Germany, Spain, Italy among others. As evident in our results, the overall business continues to deliver robust revenue and EPS growth. Driven by our highly differentiated assets and our outstanding execution. Our business performance is underpinned by strong volume driven growth. Of the more than 17% global operational revenue growth in the quarter roughly 16% was volume driven growth with the remainder approximately 1% driven by price.","In addition to the strong financial results, we continue to make excellent progress with our late stage R&D programs. Mike will cover the pipeline in more detail here in just a few moments. So I\u2019ll mention just a few of the highlights. Earlier this week, we received FDA approval for elagolix now known as ORILISSA. For the management of moderate-to-severe pain associated with Endometriosis. A chronic disease which effects approximately three million women in the US. With very few treatments approved over the last 20 years ORILISSA will be an important new therapeutic option for the many women who suffer with this painful condition. We\u2019re extremely pleased with the approved label, which provides physicians flexibility of dosing and duration of therapy. Given the compelling product profile, the disease prevalence and the patient need ORILISSA represents a significant long-term opportunity for AbbVie with multi-billion dollar peak sales potential.","We\u2019ve also made two major advancements with VENCLEXTA further strengthening our leadership position in Hematological Oncology. We received US Regulatory Approval for VENCLEXTA in the broader Relapsed\/Refractory CLL patient population representing a significant expansion beyond the narrow indication where VENCLEXTA was previously approved. We also submitted our US Regulatory application for VENCLEXTA in AML representing a significant acceleration of the timeline for the sizable follow-on indication.","We\u2019ve also made significant progress with our two next generation immunology assets. Upadacitinib and Risankizumab. We recently reported results from the fifth and final pivotal trial evaluating Upadacitinib as a treatment for RA. We\u2019ve been very encouraged by the level of efficacy and the benefit risk profile observed across the entire clinical program. Upadacitinib has the potential to be best in class therapy in RA offering meaningful advantages over products on the market today or those we see in development. We remain on track to submit our regulatory application later this year. Following the completion of our four pivotal studies in psoriasis, we\u2019ve submitted our regulatory applications for Risankizumab both in the US and Europe. Based on the data generated from our registrational [ph] programs, we believe Risankizumab represents a potential best in category therapeutic option.","We also believe that with Upadacitinib and Risankizumab along with HUMIRA we have the most competitive and best portfolio in immunology, which should enable us to maintain our therapeutic leadership and drive continued growth. When we launched AbbVie in 2013, we had an important objective to create a robust pipeline for differentiated assets enabling us to drive industry leading growth to the long-term. I can tell you that I\u2019m extremely pleased with the progress that we\u2019ve made towards that objective. As demonstrated this quarter as well as last quarter, IMBRUVICA and MAVYRET are both playing important roles in diversifying our sources of growth. Each driving strong performance along with HUMIRA.","With our recent and near-term approvals, we expect even further diversification of growth going forward. This year, we\u2019re seeing VENCLEXTA\u2019s expansion into the broader Relapsed\/Refractory CLL population and the launch of ORILISAA for Endometriosis. These are both significant opportunities. In 2019 we anticipate the approval of VENCLEXTA in AML and the launch of Risankizumab in psoriasis and Upadacitinib in RA. Each of these assets has demonstrated best in class clinical results allowing us to significantly enhance our leadership position in these very sizable markets.","By 2020 AbbVie will be extremely well positioned with multiple new assets in our portfolio, driving growth. Enabling us to continue to achieve our mission of delivering top tier industry performance. All told now in between now and the expected entry of direct biosimilars in the US. We were poised to launch more than 20 new products or major inductions from our late stage pipeline. Each of these opportunities will contribute significantly to our overall growth. Diversifying our sources of revenue and offsetting the impact of biosimilar competition.","So in summary, we\u2019re pleased with our progress and we\u2019re confident in our ability to continue to drive strong growth. We remain committed to achieving our long-term strategic vision for the company, delivering industry leading performance and outstanding shareholder value.","With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments in our R&D program. Mike?","Mike Severino","Thank you Rick. When we launched AbbVie our strategy was to build an industry leading pipeline and a robust R&D engine capable of driving significant and sustainable growth. We\u2019ve made tremendous progress over the past few years and we\u2019re now entering a period where a large number of assets have either already transitioned to commercialization or are preparing to do so. Our R&D engine has been very productive over the past two years. Specifically we\u2019ve received a number of major regulatory approvals including VENCLEXTA and Relapsed\/Refractory CLL. IMBRUVICA in Marginal Zone Lymphoma and graft versus host disease. MAVYRET and HVC and ORILISSA and Endometriosis.","We\u2019ve reported positive data from nearly a dozen key registration enabling clinical programs including Upadacitinib in RA. Risankizumab in psoriasis. VENCLEXTA in Relapsed\/Refractory CLL and AML. IMBRUVICA in frontline CLL and elagolix in Endometriosis and uterine fibroids to name a few. We\u2019ve been very pleased with the data generated across these programs. As each asset has proven to be differentiated relative to the current standard of care. We\u2019ve also seen promising proof of concept data from numerous mid stage programs which we\u2019ve advanced into registrational studies. These includes Upadacitinib in Crohn\u2019s Disease, psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis. Risankizumab in Crohn\u2019s Disease and VENCLEXTA in multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma.","The data we\u2019ve produced and the regulatory success we\u2019ve to-date, reinforce our view that the assets we\u2019re developing will achieve strong competitive positions within their respective markets. And we\u2019ve also continued the significant progress in the recent quarter, which I\u2019ll now spend a few moments highlighting. In immunology, we\u2019ve made significant progress with Upadacitinib and Risankizumab, our two late stage assets with best in class potential across a broad range of indications. In the quarter, we reported top line results from the select early study which evaluated Upadacitinib, our JAK1 selective inhibitor as a monotherapy treatment compared to methotrexate in methotrexate-naive patients.","Similar to the efficacy observed in the previous four SELECT studies in its fifth and final registration trial. Upadacitinib drove very high levels of response on all clinical endpoints and importantly, on the more stringent endpoint such as ACR50, ACR70 low disease activity and DAS remission. In the study both the lower and higher doses of Upadacitinib met the primary and all ranked secondary endpoints at weeks 12 and 24. Both doses also significantly inhibited radiographic progression at week 24 compared to methotrexate. These results support the potential of Upadacitinib as first line monotherapy in methotrexate-na\u00efve RA patients.","We\u2019ve evaluated Upadacitinib in a comprehensive set of studies in patients with moderate-to-severe RA. This includes head-to-head study against HUMIRA, the currents standard of care and additional studies conducted in a broad range of clinical settings including patients who are na\u00efve to methotrexate therapy at one end of the spectrum and very difficult to treat patients who have failed one or more biologic therapies at the other end. Based on the data generated in our program, we remain very confident in the benefit risk profile of Upadacitinib and believe that it will offer meaningful advantages over products on the market today or in development. Following the successful completion of our fifth and final study, we remain on track to submit our regulatory application in the fourth quarter of this year.","Moving now to our other late stage immunology asset; Risankizumab. We recently submitted our US and European regulatory applications in psoriasis. Based on the very high and durable rates of skin clearance we saw in the registrational studies. We believe Risankizumab has the potential to significantly improve upon current treatment options for both bio-na\u00efve and TNF inadequate responder patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, while offering the convenience of quarterly dosing.","Moving now to oncology, where we continue to advance our programs for VENCLEXTA and IMBRUVICA. We\u2019ve seen very strong activity across a broad range of hematologic malignancies with these two therapies. Demonstrating their potential to transform treatment by driving better long-term disease control and better outcomes for patients.","In June, we received FDA approval for VENCLEXTA in combination with rituximab in patients with Relapsed\/Refractory CLL. Substantially expanding the patient population for which VENCLEXTA is approved. This approval is based on the Phase 3 MURANO study, where combination treatment with VENCLEXTA and rituximab showed a profound improvement in progression free survival. This combination also showed high and durable rates of MRD negative response compared to BR. A measure that is predictive of improved clinical outcomes in patients with CLL.","VENCLEXTA plus rituximab combination therapy has the potential to be a new standard chemotherapy free treatment option and we\u2019re excited to bring this new therapy to the broader Relapsed\/Refractory CLL population. In the quarter, we also submitted our US regulatory application for VENCLEXTA as a treatment for first line AML patients who can\u2019t receive high dose induction chemotherapy. AML is one of the most aggressive hematologic malignancies with a very low survival rate and few options available for patients who can\u2019t receive intensive chemotherapy.","VENCLEXTA has demonstrated rapid, deep and durable responses in these patients. Based on the Phase 2 data recently presented at EHA, we\u2019re seeing response rates in excess of 70% with VENCLEXTA in combination with hypomethylating agents which represents a meaningful improvement relative to the current standard of care, where response rates range from 10% to 30%. We believe this could be an important new treatment option for the substantial group of patients which represents roughly 50% of the frontline AML market. We expect to see data from several other important VENCLEXTA studies over the next 12 months, this includes data from the Phase 3 CLL 14 study and frontline CLL later this year and the Phase 3 BELLINI study and multiple myeloma in the first half of 2019.","Turning now to IMBRUVICA, during the quarter we reported data from two important trials that expand and strengthen our data set in CLL. The iLLUMINATE and CAPTIVATE studies. Results from the Phase 3 iLLUMINATE study which evaluated IMBRUVICA in combination with Gazyva in frontline CLL showed a significant improvement in progression free survival in patients treated with IMBRUVICA plus Gazyva compared to patients treated with the combination of Gazyva and Chlorambucil. A regimen which is currently recommended as a Category 1 treatment within the NCCN guidelines.","We also recently presented data from the Phase 2 CAPTIVATE study evaluating IMBRUVICA in combination with VENCLEXTA in frontline CLL. We are very encouraged by the early results of this study where approximately 90% of patients achieved responses with no detectable minimal residual disease following 12 cycles of therapy. Illustrating the potential benefit of combining these two agents to deliver deep responses in CLL. iLLUMINATE and CAPTIVATE are just two of several ongoing studies evaluating IMBRUVICA alone and as a combination therapy versus regimen such as GC, BR and FCR often considered the standards of care in the treatment of CLL.","Over the course of the next few years, there will be additional data readouts for IMBRUVICA in the frontline CLL setting that we believe will help drive further penetration. Finally, in the area of women\u2019s health as previously noted we recently announced the FDA approval of ORILISSA for the management of moderate-to-severe pain associated with Endometriosis. ORILISSA is the first and only oral GnRH antagonists approved for women with this condition and the first oral treatment for these patients in over a decade.","We also continue to make good progress with our pivotal program evaluating elagolix in combination with low dose hormone add-back therapy in women with uterine fibroids. Detailed data from our pivotal trials in this indication will be presented at a medical meeting later this year and will support our regulatory submission in 2019. So in summary, we\u2019ve had several important data readouts, regulatory submissions and approvals in the first half of the year and we look forward to updating you on our pipeline as it continues to progress.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on our second quarter performance.","Bill Chase","Thanks Mike. As Rick mentioned we\u2019re very pleased with our outstanding second quarter performance. Our year-to-date underlying business fundamentals remain strong and we\u2019ve entered the second half of significant momentum. Total adjusted net revenues for the second quarter were $8.3 billion up 17.1% operationally excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2 up 40.8% compared to the second quarter of 2017 and exceeding our guidance range for the quarter.","HUMIRA global sales were $5.2 billion up 8.2% operationally. In the US, HUMIRA sales increased 10% compared to the prior year with high single-digit prescription volume growth and roughly 3% favorable price. Wholesaler inventory levels remains below half month in the quarter. International HUMIRA sales were more than $1.6 billion up 4.4% on an operational basis. We continue to see very good growth through the first half of 2018 despite increasing competition.","With its unique product profile years of physician experience and broad set of indications HUMIRA remains the leading global frontline therapy across all approved indications. Global IMBRUVICA net revenues were $850 million up 35.6% year-over-year with continued strong uptake in CLL as well as other approved indications. Global HCV sales were $973 million with MAVYRET sales of $932 million. The pace of MAVYRET\u2019s uptake continues to exceed expectations driven by strong market share performance globally as well as higher treatment volumes from warehoused DAA failure patients in certain markets.","Global sales of Duodopa, a therapy for advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease, grew 25.1% on an operational basis in the quarter, and we also saw strong operational sales growth from Creon which was up 11.4%. Turning now to the P&L profile for the second quarter, adjusted gross margin was 80.5% of sales compared to 82.3% in the prior year. The decrease versus prior year reflects the year-over-year dilutive impact of partnership accounting as well as exchanged impacts of hedged currencies.","Adjusted R&D was 15.3% of sales in the quarter, supporting pipeline programs in oncology, immunology as well as other areas. Adjusted SG&A was 19.9% of sales in the quarter, a decrease of 40 basis points versus the prior year, reflecting sales leverage and operational efficiencies. The adjusted operating margin was 45.3% in the second quarter an improvement of 90 basis points versus the prior year.","Net interest expense was $272 million in the quarter and the adjusted tax rate was 9%. As Rick mentioned based on our performance year-to-date and our outlook for the remaining two quarters. We\u2019re raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $7.76 to $7.86 representing growth of 39.5% at the midpoint. This guidance assumes revenue approaching $32.5 billion inclusive of recent negative currency dynamics. This forecast comprehends full year operational performance approaching 14.5% up 1% from prior guidance. At current rates we now expect a foreign currency benefit of less than 1% for the full year sales.","This forecast includes the following updated assumptions for our key products. Despite less favorable exchange at current rates we continue to expect international HUMIRA sales to approach $6.4 billion this year. For IMBRUVICA, we now expect global revenues to AbbVie approaching $3.4 billion with US sales approaching $2.8 billion. Given the momentum and performance in HCV, we\u2019re raising our forecast and now expect global sales above $3.5 billion. For ORILISSA, due to the timing of the launch we expect full year sales of less than $50 million in 2018 as we continue to create awareness and build the market for this important new treatment option.","Turning to the P&L for 2018, we now expecting adjusted gross margin ratio of above 80.5% which includes exchange impacts from weaker hedged currencies. We are now forecasting SG&A of approximately 20.5% of sales reflecting investments to maximize the potential of assets launching in both 2018 and 2019. We expect full year R&D expense approaching 16%. And we\u2019re now expecting adjusted operating margin above 44% roughly 150 basis points above prior year. All other full year guidance assumptions remains unchanged.","As we look ahead into the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $2 and $2.02. Our third quarter adjusted EPS guidance excludes roughly $0.23 of non-cash amortization and other specified items. We\u2019re forecasting operational revenue growth in the third quarter of approximately 17%. Holding exchange rates constant at current levels, we would expect foreign exchange to have an unfavorable impact on sales growth of approximately 1% in the third quarter.","For US HUMIRA, we expect sales growth in the third quarter of approximately 11%. We expect international HUMIRA sales approaching $1.6 billion assuming current exchange rates. For IMBRUVICA we expect US sales approaching $725 million and for HCV, we expect global sales of approximately $850 million. Lastly, we expect the adjusted tax rate to be approximately 9%.","In summary, we are very pleased with our performance this quarter as we\u2019ve driven strong revenue and EPS growth again while continuing to advance our strategic priorities. We expect this momentum to continue in the second half of 2018 putting us in a strong position to deliver top tier industry growth once again this year and with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Liz.","Liz Shea","Thanks Bill. We\u2019ll now open the call for questions. Operator, we\u2019ll take the first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] our first question today is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin","I know there are whole bunch of questions on this call regarding rebates. Let me just ask you Rick, sort of bigger picture question. The gap between AbbVie\u2019s industry leading performance would you continue to execute on time and time again and the stocks below evaluation and lower valuation this year and investor lack of confidence has never been wider. What do you do to close that gap? Is it deal activity? Do you feel that\u2019s what needs to happen, is it share buyback, is it committing to 50% dividend yield or dividend payout ratio, are there other structures that you\u2019re considering such as spin outs?","In addition Rick, can you clarify your comments that you made during our conference last month about doing $20 billion to $30 billion deal. I think investors took that as a signal that something is going to happen sooner, rather than later. Maybe if you could just address those please, thanks very much.","A \u2013 Rick Gonzalez","Thanks Jami. This is Rick. Appreciate the question. Maybe let me answer is first by framing, how I view AbbVie. There\u2019s a lot of scepticisms, concern about rebates about biosimilars. Frankly some of that is reasonable, some of it is driven by people who want to illicit for their own personal gain, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s quite as reasonable but its reality. And so I think If you step back and look at AbbVie and what I would say [indiscernible] objective way. The way I would evaluate AbbVie is the following. Look I\u2019d start with how we perform. We\u2019ve been in existence now 5.25 years, 22 or 23 quarters we\u2019ve had. We\u2019re clearly a company and management team that lives up to the commitments that we make to investors. We take that extremely seriously, we never once disappointed investors and back in most of those quarters, much like this year we have exceeded the expectations that we have set from investors.","Every year since I can remember there is been [indiscernible] about HUMIRA. Biosimilars coming in 2018, new mechanisms of action, etc. you\u2019re never going to make $18 billion etc. we have beat every single one of those expectations along the way. We have built two assets in additions to HUMIRA now that are both approaching $4 billion, IMBRUVICA and MAVYRET. Two major mega assets that are part of our portfolio and our business going forward. If you look at VENCLEXTA, it\u2019s on the verge of becoming a major asset for us with the MURANO approval and the approval of AML next year. We\u2019ve a tremendous amount of confidence in what we think VENCLEXTA can do.","If you look at ORILISSA. It was approved just recently. It has an excellent label and that is clearly a multi-billion asset for us. If you look at the clinical trial from Risa and Upa, it clearly supports these two are best in class assets and are going play a very important role when biosimilars enter the marketplace in the US and we have a lot of confidence in what that portfolio is going to be to do and how it\u2019s going to be able to perform.","If you look at 2019 and 2020, so out in sort of the near future here. And you look at AbbVie we\u2019re going to have seven assets. HUMIRA, IMBRUVICA, MAVYRET, VENCLEXTA, Upa and Risa, which will all either be multi-billion assets or on their way to being multi-billion assets. For a company that started five an half years ago, with one asset HUMIRA, the HUMIRA company. It will tell you we have made impressive progress and I think the future is even brighter than what the past is been going forward. So I\u2019ve tremendous confidence in the growth trajectory of the company going forward and frankly the strategy we put in place back in 2013 is playing out pretty much exactly as we had planned.","It doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t changes and things that you have to do along the way to adjust to different environmental factors. Over the long haul, investors will reward long-term performance and there is not a company that I\u2019m aware of that\u2019s performing better than us and there\u2019s not a company that has performed better over the past five years. If you talk about it, we\u2019re delivering 40% EPS growth this year and people will say, but you\u2019ve gotten benefit of tax. Okay, so back the benefit of the tax out. We\u2019re delivering 25% EPS growth this year on an operating basis. There aren\u2019t many companies that\u2019s delivering 25% EPS growth. In fact I can\u2019t think of another one our size, that\u2019s delivering that level of growth.","I\u2019d also say that we have delivered a tremendous amount of cash back to shareholders to our dividend increase kind of our buyback programs. And certainly we have shown that we are not shy about doing M&A, when we think we need it and we find the appropriate kinds of assets. As it relates to the $20 billion to $30 billion comment that certainly took on a life of its own. Far greater than why we would have anticipated. I mean my objective there was to frame how we viewed large bolt-ons like a pharmacyclics like asset. As we look at, at how we\u2019re going to build this business going forward. We obviously have a commitment that we\u2019ve said over and over again and that is, a commitment that we\u2019re going to deliver top tier performance and we\u2019re going to do it over the long-term and we\u2019re going to grow through the biosimilar impact that we knew we were to phase from day one and I think, how we\u2019ve executed around the biosimilar issue has been excellent, outstanding in fact I would say.","And so we\u2019ve built a pipeline that for the most part with one exception [indiscernible] which was a relatively small asset in small indication, we have delivered on every single one of the assets in our late stage pipeline that we\u2019ve talked about. And now you\u2019re starting to see the benefit of that, you\u2019re going to see the benefit of it in 2019 and again in 2020 as these products start to build. And so we look at going out and building the business around the premise of we want to continue to be able to drive top tier growth. When we find the right kind of opportunity, that we think fits strategically that we believe we can get a good return for our investors, fits into what we\u2019re good at, then we\u2019ve shown, we\u2019re not shy, we\u2019ll act on those.","Having said that, I would say the majority of what we\u2019re looking at and we will do will be smaller kinds of products assets that fit into our portfolio. I\u2019d tell you today there aren\u2019t a lot of assets in our opinion that either from a valuation standpoint we can get the right return or they fit strategically on what we\u2019re doing. Now if the right thing comes along I\u2019m certainly not saying to you, we wouldn\u2019t act. We certainly have the cash flow to be able to react and if it [indiscernible] enhance our long-term ability to be able to deliver on our mission, we would certainly do that. But as far as $20 billion to $30 billion I can tell you there\u2019s nothing in the horizon right now. What I was trying to do was frame for you, how we viewed it. But we found the right thing, we would but we haven\u2019t found anything that looks like that right now.","And fundamentally if I look at our pipeline, I look at everything that\u2019s going on in the marketplace. I still have a high level of confidence this pipeline will drive us through where we need to go.","Liz Shea","Thanks Jami. Operator we\u2019ll take the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Scala from Cowen.","Q \u2013 Steve Scala","As we approach the launch of HUMIRA biosimilars in the EU, is anything shaping up differently then you would have expected either positively or negatively? In the past you\u2019ve spoken to that the fact that you\u2019re implementing defense strategies and I\u2019m not aware that you\u2019ve amplified on them, perhaps you could now. Secondly has the Risankizumab filing been accepted and is there a PDUFA date and then thirdly can you give us VENCLEXTA sales in the second quarter? Thank you.","A \u2013 Rick Gonzalez","Steve, this is Rick. Let me take the first one, Mike take the second and Bill can take the third and maybe I can add some color onto the third. So as far as biosimilar assumptions in the EU. I\u2019d say there is nothing different from what we had anticipated. I recently had a review I\u2019m going to have another review in a month or so with the team. I\u2019d say everything is tracking as we had assumed it would track, so and we certainly wouldn\u2019t, if we had concerns we certainly wouldn\u2019t be raising guidance at this point because we\u2019re already delivering tremendous levels of performance if we had any level of uncertainty and based on what I said a few moments ago, we take extremely seriously that we\u2019re never going to miss. We wouldn\u2019t be raising guidance at this point, unless we had a lot of confidence in what that fourth quarter was going to look like.","Now am I going to go through the defense strategies, I apologize on that because unfortunately it\u2019s not my objective to telegraph to all of our competitors, what our defense strategies are? But what I can tell you is, thus far it is playing out exactly as we had planned it to play out and certainly as we go through the fourth quarter all of our are going to get a lot of clarity, on with that quarter looks like. I think buyer actions you can probably tell, we feel about it. But we\u2019re all going to know here soon. And I have confidence in how we\u2019re going to execute against that.","Mike Severino","Okay, so this is Mike. With respect to the Risa file, the file was submitted in April. It was accepted on scheduled, so it would be June. We don\u2019t typically give exact PDUFA dates, but you can do the math from there. It\u2019s a standard 10 plus 2 review, so I call it \u2013 and although it\u2019s very early what I would say is the file is going very smoothly and matching our very high expectations.","Bill Chase","VENCLEXTA sales in the quarter were $65 million.","A \u2013 Rick Gonzalez","Thanks for that, that\u2019s accurate. I will say that since the MURANO approval, we have seen an inflection point in patient starts. We track patient starts on VENCLEXTA like we do on other drugs. And so we have seen a fairly significant uptick in patient starts and so we are I think we\u2019re encouraged based on what we\u2019re seeing here now. It\u2019s obviously very early since but I think if you look at that data, you look at the position, you look at the feedback that we\u2019re getting from KOLs [ph] about their excitement about this asset and most importantly if you look at the benefit they can provide patients in this Relapsed\/Refractory setting particularly patients who have failed BTK inhibitor. I think it\u2019s a tremendous opportunity going forward for us. And I think another big opportunity for VENCLEXTA is AML. This is a very serious disease has bad outcomes for patients, particularly patients that can\u2019t tolerate intensive chemotherapy and this is an excellent new therapy for those patients and it provides significant benefit for those patients and so I think our ability to have a big impact in AML is a high probability.","Liz Shea","Thanks Steve. Operator next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Gerberry from Bank of America.","Q \u2013 Jason Gerberry","I appreciate the guidance on elagolix launch for this. Could you talk a little bit more about how that launch progresses what I mean by that is, is the slow early launch is it more to do it educating the docs around the monitoring requirements are in the label or is it just difficult revenue recognition early on just because of presumably early access barriers? My second question, I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re going to be able to answer this, but can you just talk a little bit about the differential gross margin profile for HUMIRA US versus ex-US? Just wondering because the price point is so different on those and just kind of curios, do you guys still kind of standby the 50% operating margin target by 2020? Thanks.","A \u2013 Rick Gonzalez","First on ORILISSA there isn\u2019t any monitoring requirements in the label, but maybe let me back up a little bit and talk about what are the key attributes of this product in order for it to be successful and then I\u2019ll talk about the ramp. So if you think about this area, what you would want to get the maximum value out of an asset in this area is, one you want a drug that gives high levels of efficacy, has a relatively clean safety profile, fast on, fast off because many of these women are reproductive age and they want to, if they choose to become pregnant or try to become pregnant, you want a drug they can stop taking and therefore they can move forward from a pregnancy standpoint. You want a label that allows for clinical diagnosis not diagnosis by lab, which is what we have. We wanted two doses because you have different levels of pain among these women and so you want to be able to titrate the dose depending upon their level of pain and your ability to be able to control that pain overtime. We\u2019ve obviously gotten that in the label. You want the ability to be able to maintain therapy for a relatively long period of time and we were extremely pleased with the duration of the low dose being two years and you don\u2019t want monitoring or any kind of black box for a drug of this size or of this nature rather. So we\u2019ve gotten everything that we hope for in the label.","We priced it in a way that it\u2019s design to get relatively rapid uptake, it\u2019s price at roughly 30% lower than Lupron which is one of the competitive alternatives, that\u2019s available and so I think we have priced it in a way that should enhance the length. Now having said that, there hasn\u2019t been a therapy new therapy in this area now, 15 or 20 years and because of that physicians aren\u2019t used to prescribing medical therapy for it. So and patients aren\u2019t necessarily used to seeking therapies other than paying management kinds of therapies for it. And so there is an education element that has to occur. Now we start at disease awareness campaign already, we started it a couple of months ago and we\u2019re going to continue to run that disease awareness campaign. I think the early returns would suggest it\u2019s working well. six months post the approval we\u2019ve launched then a branded DTC campaign for the drug and so it\u2019s more a function of just getting the patients engaged in a way that they go to their physicians and seek therapy for this condition and number two, then educating physicians what are the attributes of this product and how should it be used?","And so that drives a different ramp then and HCV is an example or you get a very rapid update. So it has a softer ramp on the front end because of that. but I\u2019d say, if I look at every attribute of the product from a label standpoint all the attributes of the product and we\u2019ll repriced it or designed to ultimately give you maximum value and we believe this is a multi-billion opportunity for us.","Bill Chase","So Jason its Bill Chase on your two questions regarding gross margin and operating margin. We\u2019ve never been specific around gross margin of HUMIRA in certain geographies but you\u2019ve obviously noted the fact that the price point outside of the US is lower and therefore there is less profit. That said, if you look at on a percentage basis whether it\u2019s in the US or outside of the US HUMIRA is still a profile and profit generator and I don\u2019t think you want to be necessarily of the opinion that it would be massively lower based on pricing. So but I can\u2019t give you a whole more guidance from that. And then with operating margin, yes I mean our intent is still to aim for that 50%. If you look at the progress year-to-date, we\u2019re going to be up about 1.5 points versus last year, but what people don\u2019t actually realize is that is inclusive of a lot of dilution related to both partnership accounting and the stem and the idle. If you squared those away and did apples-to-apples, we\u2019d probably about 350 basis points higher still yet.","Now of course those investments are exactly the type of the investments you want to make, we\u2019ve been happy taking that near term dilution on operating margin in order to have product like Risa or the ability to have the optionality of Stem. So we\u2019re pleased with our progress. I think what you need to watch from here is two things. First of all the roll off of the rest of the HUMIRA royalties that really kicks in the back half of this year and then again in 2019. As well as the contribution of a more rapidly growing top line and as products like Risa launch for example and Upa and ORILISSA. You should definitely see some real positive [indiscernible] in P&L.","Liz Shea","Thanks Jason. Operator next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Josh Schimmer from Evercore.","Q \u2013 Josh Schimmer","For ORILISSA do you expect hormone add-back will ultimately lift the limited duration of use recommendation on the late month, if so when do you expect that would happen? And then is the week stage pipeline program maturing to commercial assets. What do you see is the key early and mid stage programs you\u2019d emphasize is best positioned to take replaces? Thanks.","Mike Severino","This is Mike, I\u2019ll take that. We\u2019re pursuing Phase 3B program for ORILISSA looking at the ability of low dose hormonal add-back to mitigate some of the anti-estrogenic effects are intrinsic to this mechanism of action. We would expect that would allow for longer duration of therapy and we already feel pretty good about the tiers we have, but then maybe some women who knew even more than that and add-back maybe a route, to allow that to happen. We\u2019ve not given specific timing on that study or on subsequent label changes because we\u2019re still in the execution phase, but it\u2019s something that we are progressing very nicely.","With respect to the pipeline, as you point out we have a number of assets that are transitioning into commercialization. These are the assets for which we\u2019ve been delivering positive Phase 3 data pretty consistently over the course of the last couple of years and we\u2019ve paid a lot of attention to making sure that the pipeline is full behind that. What I would point to is a number of assets in our early oncology pipeline. We\u2019ve invested a lot to make sure that pipeline is robust. We have on the order of about 18 programs in the clinic in early oncology and that number changes day-to-day as we advance programs, but that\u2019s very robust across a number of areas. We have our stem [ph] [indiscernible] pipeline we have our early immune-oncology programs and some of those are producing very interesting early data, late preclinical and early clinical data and we have other programs aimed at our areas of expertise like apoptosis as one example. So we have a very robust pipeline there that will drive future growth we\u2019re quite confident and outside of oncology we\u2019ve also invested a lot in our pipeline.","We\u2019ve invested in our early immunology pipeline with a number of assets now either in Phase 2 or post enter Phase 2. These include things like our TNF steroid, immunology ABC platform which uses a steroid [indiscernible] non-acidic toxic [indiscernible] with the goal of driving very differentiated response in patients with RA and other TNF mediated diseases and if successful that could be a platform that we could apply to other disease states as well, with other targeting antibodies. We have a number of small molecule programs like our BTK and BTK JAK inhibitor combo programs and we have a number of very interesting programs in inflammatory bowel diseases like our CD40 program that is moving forward therein and many earlier than that. so it\u2019s a overall, we put a lot of focus, a lot of attention into making sure that early pipeline is robust and will drive the next generation of product launches and next generation of growth.","A \u2013 Rick Gonzalez","I mean only thing I\u2019d add Josh, this is Rick. Is if you think about the strategy we had with HUMIRA, it was a strategy where we tried to maximize the value of the asset by identifying other disease states where that mechanism could be successful and provide a good clinical benefit. As you look at things like Risa and especially Upadacitinib. The breadth of that mechanism I think we\u2019re equally as excited as we were with HUMIRA that it will allow us to be able to expand the indications fairly significantly overtime and remember those are going to come out more in a 2021, 2022, 2023 timeframe. So going in areas like Crohn\u2019s Disease like atopic dermatitis which we\u2019ve seen impressive data. Those are big opportunities, they\u2019re big markets that too is going to add to our ability to be able to continue to grow and add on significant opportunities in the pipeline overtime, in addition to our earlier stage or mid stage pipeline as Mike mentioned in oncology and immunology as an example.","Liz Shea","Thanks Josh. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.","Q \u2013 Chris Schott","First, can you just talk about the President\u2019s blueprint for reducing drug cost and potential changes to rebate structures? I know there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty here, but we want your perspective on A; how likely you think that we\u2019ll see changes to the current industry pricing structure and B; how you think about that and prepare for any potential changes from an AbbVie perspective? My second question was on the outlook firm for HCV from here, you\u2019ve always have a ton of success in this business this year. You\u2019re talking about north of $3.5 billion of revenue, but we\u2019re seeing step down 3Q versus 2Q. how [indiscernible] how do you think about the trajectory for HCV as we think about the second half of the year, then we start looking out in the future, is this the business that you can maintain at this level or do we start to think about this stepping down in the next few years? Thanks so much.","A \u2013 Rick Gonzalez","Okay, Chris. This is Rick. I\u2019ll take those two. So I think as we think about the blueprint that has come out from the administration. I\u2019m saying in our view we believe it\u2019s an important step to address probably one of the biggest challenges that we face both as a nation as well as an industry and that is the significant burden out of pocket cost for seniors in Medicare around co-pay and the donut hole. I mean that\u2019s a significant challenge and I think it\u2019s something that we have to be able to wrestle to the ground. I would say we\u2019re very supportive of the idea, of changing a structure where the net price how the co-pay where paid against. I think that\u2019s a fair and very reasonable thing to ultimately implement. And I\u2019d also say, that if you look at the blueprint it\u2019s probably the most comprehensive look that we\u2019ve seen in a very, very long time at the system and looking at ways to ultimately improve the system overall. So we\u2019re encouraged to continue to work with industry to provide feedback and to provide feedback directly around the blueprint, we\u2019d be interested in making sure that we come forward with solutions that will work.","Now it\u2019s little early in the process, so there\u2019s not a lot of specificity yet on what some of those changes are, so it\u2019s a little difficult to look at it yet and determine in tax on the business or any of those kind of things, but I\u2019d say generally speaking when we look to the framework. At least for AbbVie\u2019s business it was, there were probably more positives than there were negatives based on the kinds of products that we have. As it relates to rebates, I know there is a lot of debate on rebates and I think it is important for people to understand. I think some of the facts around rebates. When we do rebates the same as you view a discount. Okay, so from our perspective they are one and the same. Essentially we provide a rebate to a managed care group or a PBM as part of a position to be able to get a formula in position.","And in fact, if you look at Medicare. Medicare typically has a higher rebate in fact I\u2019d say it does have a higher rebate on average across the Part D plans for something like HUMIRA then the commercial plans get. Even though it only represents about 15% of our overall business for HUMIRA. So we take it very seriously how we negotiate for Medicare business, but I think there is also a lot of misconception, as it comes to rebating and the importance of rebating and what really drives HUMIRA\u2019s success on these managed care contracts. Certainly getting access in the US is an important issue for any product in any category and we \u2013 role in that, but if you look at HUMIRA I think there is four, five important points that investors need to keep in mind. One is, if you look at our percent rebate as it relates to the competitors rebates I would tell you that, we\u2019re certainly nowhere near the highest and in fact, we\u2019re probably in the middle or slightly below the middle from a percent rebate standpoint.","The second thing I would say is, if you look at the cost of therapy for HUMIRA for those assets that are on contract again we\u2019re not the highest price product on contract and we\u2019re not the lowest price product on contract. We\u2019re pretty much in the middle of the pack. The third thing, I think this is a very important issue, over the course in the last couple of years most covered lives in the United States have moved to this open formula race [ph]. And those [indiscernible] typically have between five and seven products on contract, with HUMIRA. And HUMIRA does extremely well in an environment where there is full choice. Physicians have total choice to prescribe any one of those drugs and HUMIRA has maintained it\u2019s positioned as the number one product for capturing na\u00efve patients. And so it\u2019s not like we had this position where we have exclusive contracts where physicians have to prescribe HUMIRA. They prescribe HUMIRA because of the attribute to the product, the experience they\u2019ve had, the comfort they\u2019ve had with the safety profile of it and the rest of the attribute to the product.","And I think what further illustrates that is, look we compete in every socialized health care system in the world, none of those systems have US Dollar rebates. Physicians have the choice to prescribe any drug is reimbursed in that country and if you look at our market share, if you look at our volume growth, if you look at the percent of na\u00efve patients that we capture it\u2019s very similar in let\u2019s say Europe, to what it is in United States and so that tells you, it\u2019s not rebates that are driving this. It is the attributes of the product and our ability to be able to execute. And so if, I think it would be disruptive to do dramatic things to the rebate but I\u2019d also tell you, I don\u2019t know that there is a way to make those changes any less disruptive way, but what I can tell you it was [indiscernible] is whether we had a rebate based system or we had a discount base system. It doesn\u2019t change our business model. One way or another. I think we could operate under either one of those and I don\u2019t think anybody is contemplating getting rid of discounting altogether.","So we\u2019ll have to see how it plays out overtime, but I can tell you we\u2019re confident in what are fundamentals that drives HUMIRA and what\u2019s our ability to be able to continue to drive that level of performance. HCV. So right now we\u2019re forecasting a step down in the third quarter. It\u2019s primarily driven by two sets of assumptions, one is Japan. And in Japan, I think we indicated in the call last quarter, we had a number of patients that were DA failure patients that were in the system getting retreated. I can\u2019t tell you that there is perfect data in Japan on how many of those patients there are, but we had forecasted that would go down somewhat and the second quarter and we continue to go down in third and fourth quarter. It didn\u2019t go down as much as we had assumed in the second quarter, it did go down some, but it didn\u2019t go down as much as we had assume. We\u2019re assuming another step function down of those patients in third and fourth quarter. It\u2019s hard to tell whether that\u2019s going to happen or not, we\u2019re going to have to see, how it plays out, but we normally will operate in a conservative mode and area where we don\u2019t have good data to be able to predict it.","The second area is the US and again it\u2019s a similar phenomenon, as we were seeing patient volumes higher than we would have expected. Again we had projected that they would come down somewhat. In second quarter we didn\u2019t see that come down, we\u2019re projecting some reduction in patient volumes in the third and the fourth quarter. We\u2019d love to see how that plays out, but that\u2019s the basic difference. Bill, anything you would add?","Bill Chase","No, I mean market share is phenomenal, it\u2019s really just the market call.","Liz Shea","Thanks Chris. Operator next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Boris from SunTrust.","Q \u2013 John Boris","Rick, if we look at the word interchange ability FDA withdrew some guidelines there but there continues to be a lot of saber rattling around that such as having proprietary manufactures tightness specification on there, manufacturing biologics to make it easier for companies to get into the market. There\u2019s also some saber rattling around settlements most notably having the FDA [ph] look at settlements on a prospective versus a retrospective basis. Just your thoughts on those two potential risks on HUMIRA. And then last question just has to do with, the phases that you laid out at a competitors conference. Obviously Phase 1 since the spin in early 2013 operational execution has been superb. Phase 2 pipeline delivery and really where investor has been focused is Phase 3 your build out in solid tumors and potentially other areas such as neurosciences. Just your thoughts over the long-term on Phase 3 and the build out in that phase. Thanks.","A \u2013 Rick Gonzalez","All right, thank you John. So I\u2019ll cover maybe the first two questions and will have Mike cover question number three. If you look at interchange ability. I would say FDA certainly the discussion around this has ramped over the last several months I would say, but if you actually go back year and half or so ago, the FDA had come out with some guidance around interchange ability, what we needed to do to be able to have an interchangeable biosimilar. And we\u2019re switching studies, I\u2019m sure most investors are familiar what the requirements were. And so at that point, when we were doing our LRP, we made the decision the conscious decision that we would dial in interchangeable biosimilar, [indiscernible] mean interchangeable biosimilar, but I think the prudent approach would be to dial again. So in all of our long range plans we had assumed that there would be one at the point of entry in the US, there would be US at least one interchangeable biosimilar in year one and multiple interchangeable biosimilars in year two and beyond. So I would say we\u2019d dial that into our assumptions because we believe that was the intent of the FDA was to move in that direction. And I\u2019d say that I think that became a prudent assumption because that clearly is, I think the direction that they\u2019re ultimately going in. and so I mean it certainly changes some of the dynamics around how we think about it, but I don\u2019t think it fundamentally the most significant dynamic and that is, we have always said when biosimilars enter the market, when they\u2019re available to be able to enter the market, that we will compete on price in that competitive environment to maintain the vast majority of the line. And that\u2019s certainly good for the healthcare system and I think if you look at the free market system that exist today and you look at examples where that competition has played out like HCV and example, the system gets a huge benefit from it.","And so I\u2019d say based on our long range plan, there is nothing in the feedback we\u2019ve seen so far around the biosimilar plan that is significantly different than what we already assume. As it relates to settlements, I think that is unfortunately an area where over the last few weeks or few months, there has been a lot of discussion about the HUMIRA patent state [ph] and our licensing agreements whether that was direct or indirect, that\u2019s not accurate and certainly isn\u2019t complete and so I think it is important sort of set the record straight as it relates to that because we have been very thoughtful about how we did this. So I\u2019m going to cover a couple of points that I think are important, but what I would say on the front end of the system or the front end of my comments rather, is there\u2019s nothing about our intellectual property around HUMIRA or the licensing agreements that we done that we\u2019ve entered into so far, that\u2019s anything close to gaining the system or operating around some set of loopholes.","Let\u2019s start with the patents first, we obviously have a robust patent portfolio that protects our investment HUMIRA\u2019s innovation, manufacturing, formulations and methods of use, those are the major areas that we have [indiscernible]. We\u2019ve invested heavily in HUMIRA over the course of the life of HUMIRA. It\u2019s important to recognize it was the first FDA approved human monoclone antibody and we invested a tremendous amount and research and development to expand the approved indications to the 10 different distinct disease states that HUMIRA operates in now. And we\u2019ve improved in the applying to manufacturing and the formulation of HUMIRA overtime and there\u2019s nothing inappropriate about protecting that investment and innovation. In fact I\u2019d say it\u2019s a hallmark, that our society here in the US being able to protect through the IP system your innovation.","Secondly I\u2019d say is, if you look at \u2013 there\u2019s a mechanism by which people can challenge patents in the US. And if you look at our US patents they\u2019ve been challenged now 20 times in IPR\u2019s at the USPTO. And despite the fact that, in IPR process there is a lower burden approved for invalidity and generally, you get a fairly high invalidation rate in IPR proceedings. The HUMIRA patents have done extremely well. Off the 12 HUMIRA patents that have reached banality in the IPR process, nine have been found to be valid. Further, the PTO has rejected eight challenges the formulation patents and those patents expire between August of 2022 and November of 2028. And this year the PTO rejected challenges to patents covering psoriasis, UC and Crohn\u2019s indications all of which expire April, 2025.","So that brings me to our settlements, if you look at that robust patent portfolio our settlement agreement actually facilitate biosimilar entry in the United States, Europe and the rest of the world. In the US we have patents with exploration dates well beyond 2030 and our earliest to expire IP is June, 2022. The first license that we grant to biosimilar was the Amgen license. If you look at the entry date of that in US. It\u2019s approximately six months later than our first two expired patent. Given the breadth of the IP that we have and the overwhelming strength of the patents that we have, the license entry date represents what I would describe as a fairly negotiated license agreements that expedites biosimilar entry into the United States.","The other thing I would say is, that\u2019s very important to recognize under none of our settlements are there any payments or any other kind of inducement from AbbVie to the biosimilar player. Instead what there are, there are royalties paid to AbbVie for specified amounts for a defined period of time, by the biosimilar player to be able to enter the market and use those patents and that\u2019s exactly the kind of arrangements that promote competition in markets around the world. So I can tell you we feel confident with our position.","Mike Severino","Okay, this is Mike. I\u2019ll take the third part of your question around the phases of our strategy. And Phase 1 as you point out is operational execution, Phase 2 is the phase that we\u2019re in right now, delivering on our late stage pipeline to create the next generation of marketed products that can drive our growth and then the third phase looks beyond that. It is sustainable growth out into the 2020\u2019s and beyond and what I would say about that is a couple of things. One when you look at pipeline execution there is long-term growth out of our existing pipeline assets as Rick pointed out and with assets like Upadacitinib and Risankizumab we\u2019re really just at the starting gates and there\u2019s a lot of work to be done and there\u2019s like Crohn\u2019s Disease and atopic dermatitis, [indiscernible] inflammatory bowel diseases for Risankizumab that will drive growth. So there is more to that longer term growth story than just aren\u2019t really pipeline.","What we have as I mentioned a little while earlier, invested considerably in our early pipeline. We\u2019ve invested in immunology because we\u2019re fully determined to remain a long-term leader in immunology and we have a robust set of pipeline assets behind both Upadacitinib and Risankizumab and those are in the areas that I mentioned already and we\u2019re investing in our pipeline and other areas as well. In oncology, we\u2019ve built a very robust early pipeline. As I mentioned we have a large number of early clinical assets in oncology as well as we late preclinical assets, they\u2019re poised to move into the clinical. These are across wide range of areas. There\u2019s our Stemcentrx pipeline, our next generation immune-oncology efforts which are going very well and other efforts aimed at our core capabilities as a company, expanding on the work that we\u2019ve done in apoptosis with VENCLEXTA for example, with mechanisms that can take us into solid tumors there.","So what I would say is, there is large number programs very importantly they\u2019re high quality programs all supported by very strong, preclinical data and for the most advanced promising early clinical data as well. We\u2019re not dependent on any one mechanism or any technology, so we\u2019re very diversified in early set, we\u2019re not dependent on ADC\u2019s per se or in any one technology. Although we have very good ADC programs, we have very good immune-oncology programs and we have very strong pipeline across the board there and that\u2019s going to start reveal itself over the course of the next say 12 to 24 months. We\u2019ve invested considerably in our neuro pipeline both in terms of capabilities in Cambridge Massachusetts Research Center and in our pipeline. Our lead asset AE12 is an Tau Antibody that\u2019s in Phase 2 and two indications, in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but we\u2019ve built a robust pipeline behind that in neuroinflammation in [indiscernible], in disease modifying agent scenarios like Parkinson\u2019s disease and others.","So we really have invested in that early pipeline and we\u2019re starting to see the fruits of those labours. Those programs are now moving to the clinic. They\u2019re entering Phase 2 and over the course of the coming years, we\u2019re poised and delivered, a lot of exciting there.","Liz Shea","Thanks John. Operator, we have time for one final question please.","Operator","And our final question today is from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank.","Q \u2013 Gregg Gilbert","Two quick ones. First, Rick going back to Jami\u2019s question. I\u2019m not sure you addressed sort of whether you\u2019re considering anything that\u2019s different from all that you described to position AbbVie operationally and from a pipeline standpoint. So are you considering anything, doing anything differently than you have already done going forward? And then for Bill, I believe your model for HUMIRA erosion outside the US, due to biosimilar competition it\u2019s based on some other examples that have come before. Do you think that\u2019s sufficiently conservative in light of the growing sort of experience with biosimilars in Europe and the fact that HUMIRA is larger as the starting point then some of those other examples, thanks. Bye.","A \u2013 Rick Gonzalez","Gregg, it\u2019s Rick. When you say do anything different I mean clearly we\u2019re still committed to be able to return significant capital to shareholders. So it\u2019s clearly our intent and we have the ability to continue to grow the dividend and we\u2019ve obviously just finished a fairly significant share repurchase. We have $2.5 billion left on the existing buyback program that we have and at the point, where that gets lower. We\u2019ll obviously go back to our board and gain authorization for another share repurchase and so we continue to be committed in those areas from BDC endpoint as I said, we continue to look for various opportunities and if we were to find the right kind of opportunity, we obviously add to that. I think the other question that Jami mentioned was some kind of a spin and I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019re evaluating anything in that area.","Bill Chase","And from O-US HUMIRA perspective, it\u2019s the best forecast we have right now, we\u2019re going to be dealing with live ammo obviously pretty quick, but when we look at the way we\u2019re forecasting it relative to the analogs, there are a couple of differences, first and foremost you need to recognize that unlike the analog the people typically compare us to, HUMIRA is growing at a nice pace and so that will make the decrease relative to peak. Look a little less severe than one would think, that have been just a status quo market place where there was no growth. The other thing is, keep in mind that not all of the markets are going biosimilar at the same time that gives us a little bit maybe a little bit of different circumstance given certain geographies that will be going to biosimilars later. So when we back up, when we look at it and we forecast this every year and we forecast it from the bottom up, this is the best number we have at this point in time, but it\u2019s all going to largely be around with them because we\u2019re going to see the real data fairly soon in the fourth quarter and then, we will adjust as we see fit.","Q \u2013 Gregg Gilbert","Thank you.","Liz Shea","Thanks Gregg.

All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer portion of this call.","I would now like to introduce Liz Shea, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may now begin.","Liz Shea - Head-Investor Relations","Good morning and thank you for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Severino, Executive Vice President of Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer; and Bill Chase, Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, I want to remind you that some statements made today are or may be considered forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We delivered another strong quarter with results well ahead of our expectations including adjusted earnings per share of $1.26, representing growth of 16.7% versus the second quarter of 2015.","Our results in the quarter included strong top-line performance with global operational sales growth of 18%, reflecting robust growth from several products in our portfolio, including HUMIRA and IMBRUVICA among others. We're pleased with our outperformance in the quarter and progress year-to-date. We've driven outstanding commercial, operational and R&D execution resulting in strong top and bottom line results.","Based on our performance in the first half of the year, we're raising our full-year 2016 EPS guidance to $4.73 to $4.83 on an adjusted basis reflecting growth of 11.4% at the midpoint. As I mentioned, several products within our portfolio are driving robust growth. HUMIRA continues to drive strong performance delivering global operational growth of more than 17% in the quarter. Despite increasing competition from new classes of drugs and indirect biosimilar competition in international markets, HUMIRA continues to demonstrate exceptional performance and durability across all three market segments.","In rheumatology, HUMIRA is the number one prescribed biologic and we continue to grow our share position in the face of new competition. And in dermatology and gastro, HUMIRA continues to hold a strong market leadership position demonstrating double-digit growth year-over-year.","We also continue to be pleased with the strong IMBRUVICA performance, which is tracking in line to slightly ahead of our expectations following our approval for first line use in CLL. IMBRUVICA has achieved the number one market share position in all approved disease indications in second line and second line plus treatment.","And since we received the FDA approval of IMBRUVICA as a first line treatment for CLL late in the first quarter, IMBRUVICA has already gained a market share position in first line in the mid-teens and the third position in the market. And the share, continues to steadily increase with approximately one of every six patients now receiving IMBRUVICA as a front line therapy surpassing FCR which is generally considered the gold standard for young and fit CLL patients.","This market share and the strong momentum underlying its performance further reinforces our confidence in our long-term expectations for IMBRUVICA. That supported our decision to acquire Pharmacyclics last year.","We also saw a strong performance from several other products in our portfolio including Duodopa, Creon and Lupron. Each of these therapies within our marketed product portfolio continue to deliver durable performance. Global VIEKERA sales in the second quarter were $419 million, up 8.2% on an operational basis.","Growth in the quarter was driven by our international business. In the U.S. as we described on our first quarter call, we have seen market share loss and some price erosion due to the entry of a new competitor into the HCV market.","We are nearing the completion of our registrational studies for our next generation pan-genotypic HCV combination. Based on the mid-stage data, we've disclosed to-date, we believe that our new HCV combination will be highly competitive. The data illustrates that this therapy can deliver cure rates approaching 100% across genotypes. And we believe the majority of patients will be well served with an eight-week treatment option.","We expect to see results from the pivotal studies in the second half and we remain on track for commercialization next year. In addition to our strong financial results, we continue to advance our strategic priorities and have made excellent progress with our R&D pipeline. Mike will cover the pipeline in more detail in just a few moments, so I'll only mention a few highlights.","Importantly, we successfully completed the acquisition of Stemcentrx. We've been impressed by the caliber of talent we've welcomed from Stemcentrx, and the transition has been seamless. The addition of Stemcentrx is a strategically and financially compelling opportunity for our company, giving AbbVie a highly attractive platform for solid tumors and an extremely exciting late stage asset in Rova-T. The transaction enables AbbVie to further expand and accelerate our presence in oncology, building upon our growing position in hematological oncology.","We are moving rapidly to advance Rova-T in its lead indication, third-line small cell lung cancer. And we continue to feel confident about our 2017 BLA filing strategy and launch in 2018. We're also rapidly advancing studies to evaluate Rova-T in earlier lines of therapy for small cell lung cancer including combination studies with both chemotherapy and immuno-oncology agents.","Earlier this week, we jointly announced a clinical collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb to evaluate the combination of Rova-T with BMS's immuno-oncology agents in small cell lung cancer with trials beginning this year. We're pleased to be partnering with BMS to bring innovative new therapies forward that have the potential to significantly improve the survival of patients with small cell lung cancer, a disease with devastating outcomes.","We've also continued to make significant progress with our hematological oncology portfolio. We're building upon our strong position with IMBRUVICA in treating blood cancers with VENCLEXTA.","During the quarter, we received the first FDA approval for VENCLEXTA for patients with relapsed\/refractory CLL who harbor the 17p deletion, a difficult-to-treat form of the disease, typically associated with poor prognosis. The approval for this transformative therapy was granted under breakthrough therapy and priority review designations, and the launch is still in its early stages. Although this first indication is a relatively small patient population, it is important to provide patients with this difficult-to-treat disease a new therapy with strong clinical results, and it's also important to give positions an opportunity to gain experience with a particular initial dosing regimen of VENCLEXTA to ensure patients receive the benefit of this therapy.","We expect data from the Phase III study evaluating VENCLEXTA in a broader set of relapsed\/refractory CLL patients to read out next year supporting our regulatory submission for an expanded label covering all relapsed\/refractory CLL patients, a much larger population.","Like IMBRUVICA, we believe that VENCLEXTA will be effective across a range of hematological malignancies with high unmet need, and we're actively evaluation additional indications including acute myeloid leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and multiple myeloma among others.","We also continue to make progress across other important areas of our pipeline. During the quarter, we presented positive results from mid-stage study of our anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody, risankizumab, in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease. The pivotal program for risankizumab is in psoriasis and it's underway and enrolling very well. And in partnership with Biogen, we recently received FDA and EC approval for ZINBRYTA, for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. We plan to launch ZINBRYTA in the U.S. in August.","In summary, we continue to be pleased with our strong execution and the significant advancements in our pipeline. As we outlined at our recent R&D day, we have eight late-stage assets which have been significantly de-risked, and have the potential to drive meaningful revenue growth in the years to come. We continue to demonstrate an exceptional track record of success, with positive clinical data and regulatory outcomes and strong commercial performance.","We intend to build on this momentum to drive a high level of performance across our operations in the second half of the year.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for some additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?","Michael E. Severino - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Thank you, Rick. We had another very productive quarter from an R&D perspective. With significant progress on several programs, including the FDA approval of VENCLEXTA for its first indication in patients with relapsed relapsed\/refractory CLL with a 17p deletion mutation, as well as the FDA and EMA approvals of ZINBRYTA for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis.","Today, I'll highlight additional updates and discuss some of the milestones we anticipate in the second half of 2016. I'll start with our oncology portfolio, an area where we are growing our already strong position in hematologic malignancies, as well as establishing a strong foundation in solid tumors, which was significantly accelerated by our recent acquisition of Stemcentrx, and its lead asset, Rova-T.","At the ASCO meeting in early June, we presented data from a Phase II trial in small cell lung cancer that demonstrated that Rova-T monotherapy drove a one-year survival rate of 32% in DLL3 positive patients. Almost triple that of historical third line standard of care at 12%.","In addition to the impressive one-year survival, Rova-T showed the most compelling single-agent activity in terms of overall response rate, clinical benefit rate and progression-free survival in third-line small cell lung cancer. The patient population where our first pivotal trial for registration is rapidly enrolling. The confirmatory third-line registrational trial which is called Trinity began in January and is expected to complete enrollment by the end of 2016 with commercialization expected in 2018.","We are also quickly advancing Rova-T in the studies to support front-line treatment in small cell lung cancer in combination with chemotherapy. The first-line development program includes a Phase I\/II regimen selection study that will be used to inform future Phase III pivotal trials evaluating various combinations of Rova-T and chemotherapy. The regimen selection study is expected to begin next quarter.","The first line program also includes the (13:10) study, a Phase III registrational trial evaluating standard chemotherapy followed by Rova-T in the front line setting. We expect to have this study up and running by the end of the year.","We are also advancing an 8-arm basket study evaluating Rova-T in a range of neuroendocrine tumors where DLL3 plays an important role. This study is on track to begin this quarter with data expected next year. Given that many of these tumor types have low survival rates and limited treatment options available, there may be an opportunity to explore single-arm studies to support accelerated approval.","As Rick mentioned earlier this week, we announced a clinical collaboration with BMS to evaluate the investigational combination of Rova-T with OPDIVO and with OPDIVO and YERVOY in small cell lung cancer. We believe that combining Rova-T with these checkpoint inhibitors could drive enhanced and sustained efficacy above what that which either approach could offer individually.","Preclinical evidence and biological rationale supports our prioritization of efforts to combine Rova-T with IO agents, and we believe these combinations have the potential to establish a new standard of care. We expect to begin the Rova-T\/IO combination study by the end of the year.","In addition to Rova-T, we've also continued to make progress with our pipeline assets targeting solid tumors. In particular, our PARP inhibitor Veliparib and ABT-414 an antibody drug conjugate for glioblastoma multiform. We presented Phase I data for both of these assets at the recent ASCO meeting and anticipate data readouts from registration enabling studies for both programs over the next 12 months.","We also continue to make good progress with our hematologic oncology portfolio. In the second quarter, the FDA updated the IMBRUVICA label to include new data from two Phase III trials supporting expanded use in patients with CLL and SLL, including overall survival data from both the RESONATE-2 and HELIOS trials. IMBRUVICA is also being evaluated in mid to late stage trials for several additional indications. With timing of data readouts and potential regulatory submissions dependent on event driven analysis of ongoing studies.","In June, IMBRUVICA received breakthrough therapy designation as a potential treatment of chronic graft-versus-host-disease after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy marking the drugs fourth breakthrough therapy designation. The FDA also granted IMBRUVICA Orphan Drug Designation for the same condition.","The breakthrough designation was based on clinical data from a Phase II study evaluating the safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICA for the treatment of patients with steroid dependent or refractory chronic GVHD. Our registrational study in graft versus host disease is underway with data expected late this year or early 2017.","We've made significant progress with the development of another important strategic asset, our novel BCL-2 inhibitor VENCLEXTA, which is being developed in collaboration with Roche. VENCLEXTA was recently approved under priority review for its first indication in patients with relapsed\/refractory CLL with 17p deletion.","Earlier this year, VENCLEXTA also received the FDA's breakthrough therapy designation for use in combination with rituximab for the treatment of patients with relapsed\/refractory CLL. The Phase III MURANO trial which will support a broader label in relapsed\/refractory CLL is fully enrolled with data readout and regulatory submission anticipated in 2017. Additionally, we have an active Phase III program evaluating VENCLEXTA in treatment-naive CLL patients with studies underway and progressing well.","Like IMBRUVICA, we believe VENCLEXTA will be effective across a range of blood cancers including AML and multiple myeloma. We recently started a Phase III program evaluating VENCLEXTA in combination with standard of care in multiple myeloma and we anticipate moving forward with Phase III development in AML by the end of the year.","In addition to the elements of the program I've described, we continue to be excited about the ongoing clinical evaluation of combinations of IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA, which we believe have the potential to drive profound responses and minimal residual disease negativity in a number of clinical settings.","Now, I'd like to turn our attention to the immunology portfolio where we have two late stage assets, our anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody risankizumab, and our selective JAK1 inhibitor, ABT-494. Each of these assets has the potential to significantly advance standard of care in immune-mediated conditions such as RA, psoriasis and Crohn's disease, covering the major market segments where we currently have a leadership position. ABT-494 is currently in Phase 3 development for rheumatoid arthritis, where we are studying the asset in six pivotal trials. Our JAK inhibitor has the potential to be best-in-class with what we believe will be an optimized benefit risk profile.","Our development strategy is aimed at delivering a comprehensive label to cover multiple lines of therapy from first line use in methotrexate-naive patients to use in patients with inadequate response to biologics, where the highest unmet need remains in this market. Data from the ABT-494 Phase 3 RA program is expected in the first half of 2018, with commercialization targeted in 2019.","We have also accelerated the development of this important asset in gastrointestinal disorders. Our Phase 2 study in Crohn's disease is well underway and data should be available internally later this year. This will enable a decision to advance to Phase 3 development by the first quarter of next year. You can expect to see the data from this Phase 2 Crohn's study at DDW next year. In addition, we recently initiated a Phase 2 study in ulcerative colitis with data expected in 2018.","Risankizumab is another strategically important late-stage immunology asset. This anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody, which we licensed from Boehringer Ingelheim earlier this year, has the potential to be a transformative therapy by providing best-in-class efficacy with increased dosing convenience. Risankizumab is currently in Phase III psoriasis trials, and in mid-stage development for both Crohn's disease and psoriatic arthritis. Interest in the Phase III psoriasis program has been strong, and enrollment is progressing very well. We continue to expect data from the registrational program in 2018.","At the Digestive Disease Week meeting in May, we reported encouraging results from a Phase II study of risankizumab in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease, a particularly difficult-to-treat population given that the majority of these patients had previously failed treatment with one or more TNF antagonists. Based on these strong results, we intend to move rapidly into Phase III studies in Crohn's disease with registration trials commencing later this year or early next year.","Another technology that we believe holds great promise is our proprietary bispecific antibody platform. We've introduced a number of these assets into the clinic in both our immunology and oncology therapeutic areas. Based on our early-stage studies, we've established proof of concept across several programs, demonstrating that these antibodies possess good drug-like properties, and delivered the desired pharmacodynamic effects. And we've learned how to successfully and consistently manufacture them.","We recently evaluated data from one of our bispecific programs in development, ABT-122, our combination anti-TNF and anti-IL-17, in Phase II trials for RA and psoriatic arthritis. The data demonstrated that ABT-122 was well tolerated with a safety profile that was comparable to HUMIRA. In the mid-stage psoriatic arthritis and RA studies, ABT-122 showed ACR20 response rates as high as 75% and 82% respectively, demonstrating that the platform worked well with clear evidence of biologic activity.","However, the simultaneous inhibition of IL-17 and TNF\u03b1 do not produce the strong synergistic effect necessary to differentiate ABT-122 from other candidates in our pipeline, such as ABT-494 and risankizumab.","As a result, we have made the decision not to pursue further development of this asset. While in this particular setting, we didn't see the high level of differentiation we were seeking, the validation of the bispecific platform gives us confidence to continue to advance other programs with different mechanisms of action.","Also in our immunology portfolio, we continue to make progress with vobarilizumab, an anti-IL-6 receptor nanobody being developed in collaboration with Ablynx for patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. Earlier this month, Ablynx announced positive top-line results from a Phase II monotherapy study demonstrating that this asset improved symptoms of RA.","We expect results from a second Phase II study evaluating use with methotrexate in the third quarter which will allow us to determine next steps for development of this asset. In the quarter we also made significant progress in other key therapeutic areas and are on track to advance several programs in the second half of the year.","In virology, our next-generation HCV program is progressing well. Early in the quarter, at the International Liver Congress, we presented new data on our pan-genotypic, once-daily, ribavirin-free combination of ABT-493 and ABT-530 in patients with genotypes one through six, including data on treatment durations as short as eight weeks. The data illustrate that with eight weeks of treatment, 97% and 98% of genotype one through three patients without cirrhosis treated with AbbVie's next-generation regimen, achieved sustained virologic response at 12 weeks.","Additionally, 100% of genotype four through six patients without cirrhosis achieved SVR 12 with 12 weeks of treatment. Overall, we believe that AbbVie's next-generation HCV therapy will be able to address the remaining unmet medical need within this market. We continue to expect to see results from the Phase III trials in the coming months. And we remain on track for commercialization next year.","And in the area of women's health, we are nearing completion of our Phase III endometriosis program with regulatory submission planned for 2017. Earlier this year, we announced positive top line results from the second of two replicate pivotal Phase III clinical trials evaluating Elagolix in premenopausal women who suffer pain from endometriosis.","The results show that after six months of continuous treatment, both doses of Elagolix met the studies co-primary endpoints with Elagolix reducing scores of menstrual pain and non-menstrual pelvic pain at month three and month six. We plan to present detailed results from both Phase III studies including extension study data up to 12 months at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine in October. And our Phase III studies in uterine fibroids are underway and progressing well. This program is investigating the effect of Elagolix on heavy bleeding related to this highly prevalent condition.","So, in summary, we continue to make significant progress with our pipeline and are on track for further advancements in the remainder of 2016. We have a broad pipeline that includes more than 50 active clinical development programs including more than 20 new products or indications in late-stage development or under regulatory review.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on our second quarter performance.","William J. Chase - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Mike. This morning, I will review our second quarter performance and provide an update on our outlook for 2016 inclusive of the recently completed Stemcentrx transaction and the BI collaboration. We're very pleased with our strong second quarter results. In addition to delivering strong operational sales growth of 18%, we exceeded the midpoint of our adjusted earnings per share guidance range by $0.06 and delivered growth of nearly 17% over the second quarter of 2015.","As Rick mentioned, we continue to see strong momentum from HUMIRA with global sales of more than $4.1 billion, up 17.7% operationally. In the U.S., HUMIRA sales increased nearly 27%. We continue to see mid-teens prescription volume growth across the brand fueled by robust demand in the rheum, derm, and gastro market segments.","In the quarter, we also saw a low-single-digit benefit on the growth rate as a result of customer buying patterns versus the prior year quarter. Channel inventory levels in both the second quarter of 2015 and 2016 were below half a month. International HUMIRA sales were more than $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 4% on an operational basis and exceeding our prior guidance of 3% operational growth for the quarter.","Internationally, HUMIRA continues to maintain its market leadership position. We continue to see only modest overall market share gains for biosimilar REMICADE in major markets in line with our planning assumptions. And while still early in the launch, the ENBREL biosimilar continues to perform in line with our assumptions.","Global IMBRUVICA net revenues were $439 million in the quarter. U.S. sales were $384 million and our international profit sharing was $55 million. Global Viekira sales in the second quarter were $419 million. This reflects weaker quarter-over-quarter sales in the U.S. due to competitive dynamics offset by our performance in international markets.","Global sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease grew nearly 29% on an operational basis in the quarter continuing to grow by double digits internationally with a modest level of U.S. sales as expected. We also saw strong operational sales growth in the quarter from both Creon and Lupron, which were up 13% and 11% respectively.","As Rick noted in the quarter, we received approval for two new products, VENCLEXTA and ZINBRYTA. We launched VENCLEXTA early in the quarter in its initial indication for relapsed\/refractory CLL patients with the 17p deletion, which represents a smaller addressable patient population in the U.S. We have begun a measured commercial rollout to ensure adequate physician training and we expect a modest level of VENCLEXTA sales for 2016. For ZINBRYTA, we plan to launch in the U.S. in August.","Adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 81.9% of sales. On a comparative year-over-year basis, this ratio reflects an adverse impact from foreign exchange of roughly 320 basis points. In addition, the adjusted gross margin reflects 160 basis points of unfavorable impact related to the Pharmacyclics acquisition including the profit transfer for IMBRUVICA. Adjusting for these impacts, gross margin profile performance improved by approximately 140 basis points versus the prior year.","Adjusted R&D was 15.5% of sales, reflecting funding action supporting the pipeline, as well as the impact of both Stemcentrx transaction and the BI collaboration. Adjusted SG&A was 22.2% of the sales in the second quarter, down 290 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 43.9% sales, down 30 basis points relative to the second quarter of 2015.","Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange and the Pharmacyclics acquisition, operating margin profile performance improved 370 basis points versus the prior year. Net interest expense was $225 million and the adjusted tax rate was 20.1% in the quarter. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share excluding noncash intangible amortization expense and specified items were $1.26 up 16.7% year-over-year.","Moving on to our outlook for the remainder of the year. Based on our strong business performance year-to-date, we are raising our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance range to $4.73 to $4.83, reflecting adjusted EPS growth of 11.4% at the midpoint. This includes the previously communicated $0.28 of dilution related to the Stemcentrx acquisition and the BI collaboration.","We are also updating our 2016 GAAP diluted EPS guidance range to $3.82 to $3.92, which includes $0.91 per share of noncash intangible asset amortization expense and other specified items including acquisition costs and accounting impacts associated with Stemcentrx and the BI collaboration.","On the top-line, we expect full year sales approaching $26 billion. Foreign exchange dynamics have run favorable relative to our initial projections and we are now forecasting approximately 1% of negative top-line impact from currency for the full year.","Based on our strong performance year-to-date, we now expect U.S. HUMIRA operational sales growth of more than 20%. And we remain on track with our previously communicated full year guidance for international HUMIRA with operational growth in the mid-single digits.","We now forecast an adjusted gross margin profile approaching 81% impacted by stronger performance of hedged currencies in 2016. The gross margin profile also reflects 130 basis points of impact related to the Pharmacyclics acquisition. Excluding this and the year-over-year exchange impacts, the gross margin profile is expected to improve relative to 2015 by roughly 190 basis points.","We are now forecasting R&D expense of more than 16% of sales reflecting our increased R&D investments related to the Stemcentrx acquisition, and the BI collaboration. And we expect SG&A to run at approximately 23% of sales.","We now forecast an adjusted operating margin profile approaching 42% on a full year basis. We remain committed to delivering on our 2020 targeted operating margin forecast of above 50% of sales. We are now forecasting net interest expense of approximately $925 million for the full year, above our original guidance of approximately $800 million, as a result of the debt we issued for the Stemcentrx acquisition. And we expect an adjusted tax rate in the 20% to 21% range in 2016.","Regarding the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $1.18 to $1.20. This excludes roughly $0.16 of specified items and noncash amortization, and includes the dilutive impact of Stemcentrx and the BI collaboration. We are expecting high single digit operational sales growth, excluding a modest negative foreign exchange impact in the quarter.","So, in conclusion, we are very pleased with our performance in the quarter as we've driven strong top and bottom line growth while also advancing on our strategic priorities and our pipeline. This puts us in a strong position to continue delivering industry-leading growth this year.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.","Liz Shea - Head-Investor Relations","Thanks, Bill. We'll now open the call for questions. Operator, we'll take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The first question comes from the line of Jeff Holford of Jefferies. Sir, Your line now is open.","Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC","Thanks for that. I'll start with a question for Rick, please. So, Rick, there's clearly substantial trapped value in the company because of the uncertainty for investors around HUMIRA. And you've made positive steps to deal with this through building new growth drivers through R&D, aggressive business development as well as making clear your long-term expectations regarding HUMIRA.","Even so, despite great quarters like today, we're still seeing the shares trade at a substantial discount to peers. So, is there anything else that's up for discussion in terms of how you can unlock the trapped value in the company whether it's through different capital allocation, separation of your oncology platform given the valuations they can carry these days or anything else?","Second, then for Mike, I wonder what does your collaboration with Bristol on Rova-T tell you about what they are thinking regarding their positioning of their OPDIVO-YERVOY combination in small cell lung cancer? And then last, maybe for Rick again, we're expecting that you'll be in place by Q4 to initiate patent litigation against Amgen. And it will be beyond just the dosing and formulation patents that have been more widely discussed today. Are those still reasonable expectations? And do you think investors will be reassured when we see what other patents Amgen has agreed that they are potentially infringing out of the patent bounds? Thank you.","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. So, Jeff, this is Rick. I'll cover the first and third one and then I'll have Mike cover the other one. So, on the untrapped value, what I would tell you is that if you look at our PE, I think what you've seen and if you look at the range of companies in our peer group, there are obviously companies that have a much lower PE for a variety set of reasons and there are companies where the, have higher PEs and the median PE is certainly above where we are. So, there's certainly a level of overhang that's associated with the biosimilar uncertainty around HUMIRA. And I think what we have laid out for investors is a clear strategy that we put in place starting back in 2013 of how we were going to deal with that.","Ultimately, we have a large portfolio of IP around HUMIRA and we certainly expect that to be able to protect the asset as we described back in October. We have now added to the portfolio two fundamentally differentiated new assets in 494 and risankizumab. And you're seeing some of that data play out, and so, that we fundamentally believe that those will allow us to ultimately be able to grow through what will obviously be at some point a biosimilar impact both internationally, as well as in the U.S.","And then, we've spent a considerable amount of time building a robust pipeline that we've shown at our R&D Day and in other events that had the ability to be able to ultimately generate a very significant revenue opportunity that would allow us to grow through even the most bearish impact that's out there from an analyst standpoint around biosimilars.","So, I think, we've done the things that we think are important to be able to communicate and then ultimately, build a strategy to be able to drive the business from a growth perspective because that was the charter that we set for the company when we launched. And, I think we've demonstrated that were capable of doing that. I think it will take some time for the litigation strategies to play out and for investors to continue to gain confidence.","Having said that, we constantly look at different kinds of alternatives that we think truly are value-enhancing to shareholders but also value-enhancing to the business itself. And we'll explore all of those in time to determine whether or not they make sense. I mean, I think, if anything, we've probably been on the proactive side of going out and building new growth platforms and other kinds of things to be able to sustain the business going forward.","And we have seen the PE improve, and we would certainly expect that it will continue to improve. I mean, if you look at our performance, both currently as well as going forward as we projected it in our LRP, we will perform in the top tier of our peer groups and we would expect that we'll start to see the PE reflect that to a greater extent going forward as the litigation strategy plays out more.","On the third question, and I'm sure there will be other questions around the litigation and I'll apologize in advance that this won't be a very satisfying answer for you but it certainly I think you'll understand why. We're now in the very active phase of litigation around HUMIRA biosimilars. And therefore, we're not in a position where we're going to be able to provide a lot of color. And we're certainly not in a position where we can do this play-by-play strategy of how we're going to deal with every aspect of it. That just wouldn't be a smart thing for us to do.","What I can reiterate is this. Back in October, we outlined in detail the extensive portfolio of IP that we have for HUMIRA and our confidence in that IP and it goes beyond any one single patent. And I can tell you we remain confident in that IP portfolio and we've made it very clear that we intend to vigorously defend all of our IP against anyone that potentially infringes it. And, so that process will play out. So, as I said, it's just not prudent for us now in this space to ultimately lay out in detail the play-by-play. And, so we're just not in a position to be able to do that.","Michael E. Severino - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Okay. So, this is Mike. I'll take the question about the BMS collaboration. So, I think that, first of all, we're very fortunate that after many years, without much progress in the treatment of small cell lung cancer, there are very promising mechanisms coming forward, our own Rova-T, as well as the data that have been presented recently in immuno-oncology. And I think that offers real benefit for patients downstream.","What I would say about the way the two companies are thinking about these assets, I think that the speed which the deal came together really speaks for itself. And that collaboration would not have been possible in this short period of time if we were thinking about the assets very differently. As we've said, in other settings, when one is thinking about the treatment of patients with small cell lung cancer, there are a couple of treatment goals.","The first is that one needs to get disease control because these patients present very ill with very rapidly progressing disease. And Rova-T has shown in its Phase II studies that it can do that and it can do that with a defined course of therapy. We also believe that the data strongly supports that the responses with Rova-T will be durable.","Now, when one thinks about other treatment goals, it would be desirable to have a long-term surveillance on board after one achieves that initial strong and durable disease control and we believe that IO agents can play a real role there. And so, the collaboration with Bristol will test this. And we believe will provide very exciting data for patients with small cell lung cancer in the future.","Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Liz Shea - Head-Investor Relations","Thanks, Jeff. Operator, next question please?","Operator","Next question is from Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs. Your line now is open.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Can you hear me?","Liz Shea - Head-Investor Relations","Yes.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I assume you can hear me. Anyway, I have a couple of questions. First on the outlook for hep C. Rick, I think you had said earlier obviously VIEKIRA underperformed in the U.S., outperformed internationally. But how are you thinking about the opportunity for next generation hep C given what clearly has been a more challenging pricing environment? And I'm just wondering if you still stand by your $3 billion forecast?","And secondly, on Stemcentrx. When do the next two assets for Stemcentrx enter the clinic? Now, is that this year and for which indications? And wondering what we will see potentially at ESMO? And Michael, just maybe if you can explain. I'm still getting a lot of pushback from investors who are unclear about the value of Rova-T just given that the response rate that we saw at ASCO was a bit lower than what we saw at World Lung, I think creating question marks around the durability of response. Thanks very much.","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, Jami. This is Rick. I'll take the hep C question that you had. Certainly, as we said in the first quarter call, we have seen an impact of the new entrant into the marketplace. I'd say we've seen it primarily in the public channels, particularly I'd say the VA, and it really boiled down to a pricing strategy and ultimately we decided that we were not going to match the lowest price, the eight-week price, that was out into the marketplace. And therefore, we lost a significant amount of share. I mean, at our peak, we probably had close to 40% share, and now we have share that's more down in the single-digit range.","So, I'd say that's the vast majority of the impact that we've seen. There has been some price impact also that played through but the greater impact is clearly share loss in that public channel primarily.","And so, as we look forward to next generation, I think as we look at the profile of that asset, obviously from a clinical performance standpoint, it is everything we would have hoped it would be. Based on the data that we've seen so far, I think it will be a highly competitive asset. It will also provide, because it is pan-genotypic, an opportunity to be able to bridge across all of the genotypes, and in particular in the United States, genotype 2 and genotype 3, where Sovaldi essentially had a strong position in the marketplace, and so this will even that playing field.","So, we fundamentally believe that next generation will allow us an opportunity to be able to grow our share. If you look outside the United States, as an example, and you look in countries where there is predominantly a 1B population, but even in some countries where there's a significant 1A population, our market shares in most of those countries are in, I'd say, on the low end, 30%; on the high end, sometimes as high as 70%. So, we compete very well, and the profile of 1B is certainly much more of a competitive profile to the alternatives that are available outside the United States.","And so I think it gives you an idea of our ability to be able to perform in those markets. So, we would hope, and I think expect, that next generation will allow us to be able to gain share in those marketplaces.","Your $3 billion, you are probably going back to the first prediction and I think we anticipate that we would get back into that range. But I'm going out of the business of predicting HCV at this point. I think what I would say is despite the impact that we've seen in the U.S. from a share standpoint, I think it shows you how fundamentally strong the overall business is because we've taken a fairly substantial hit in the U.S. on HCD (sic) [HCV]. But, yet, we continue to perform at a very high level and offset all of that impact and are now raising guidance on top of that.","So, the balance of our entire business and in particular I'd say HUMIRA and IMBRUVICA right now gives us the ability to be able to do that. And so, we're not dependent upon that single asset performing at a certain level.","Mike?","Michael E. Severino - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Okay. So, with respect to the Stemcentrx questions. Rova-T, the objective response data for Rova-T have been very consistent in our view across the various reports over the last several months. And they've ranged from about 39% into the mid 40% range. And that really just relates to the cut of the data, whether one is using initial investigator reports or subsequent adjudicated assessments of objective response and doesn't bear on durability of those responses in any way. And the objective response rate and, importantly, the clinical benefit rate have both remained very high.","The one-year survival has also been very consistent in the 30%-plus range across the data cuts, which gives us a very good feel for the durability of those responses. And in this heavily pre-treated patient population, the best estimate \u2013 the most rigorous but also the highest estimate of one year survival is about 12% and in many cases it may actually be lower than that. And so, that 30% number we view as very important. So, we don't see anything concerning with respect to the durability of the responses with Rova-T.","So, with respect to the remainder of the Stemcentrx pipeline, there are actually five programs in the clinic now, one of those is Rova-T, two are the Pfizer-partnered programs, PTK7 and Ephrin-A4. And then, there are two other programs in the clinic for solid tumor indications, but we haven't disclosed those targets or the particular tumors of interest at this point in time.","In addition to those five, there are five additional assets that will enter the clinic over the next 12 months to 18 months, so by the end of 2017. In the areas of initial interest when one looks at the tumors that we're treating today, will obviously be small cell. There's also a focus on ovarian cancer and triple-negative breast cancer among others.","Liz Shea - Head-Investor Relations","Thanks, Jami. Operator, we'll take the next question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Chris Schott of JPMorgan. Your line now is open.","Chris Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much for the questions. First one is just can you elaborate a little bit more on biosimilar dynamics in Europe? Now that we've had some additional experience with both Remicade and early with Enbrel. Just how are volume and price dynamics shaping up there and the impact to HUMIRA?","Second was on HUMIRA and maybe the derm business. It sounds like very strong performance in the quarter. But the environment overall seems to be getting more competitive here with the IL-17 seeing some nice uptake. Are you seeing any impact to the business from these competitors? And just how do you think about the outlook for that part of the franchise over time? Thanks very much.","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Great. Chris, this is Rick. So, I'll cover those. So, let me start with the biosimilar impact because, as you said, we've seen biosimilars certainly with the Remicade biosimilar in the market for quite some time and now we're in the early phases of the launch of Enbrel biosimilars, particularly in the European areas.","So, if you look at Remicade, there are Remicade biosimilars now in roughly 60-plus countries, like 62 countries. About 50 of those, a little more than 50 of those, have pricing and reimbursement. So, they are actively involved in marketing the product in those countries.","If, we've studied it very carefully, if you look at the overall share of biosimilars it's less than 5%, it's about 4.5%. If you look at their share of Remicade, it's about 20%, 22% something like that. It varies a lot. So, I'd say it's very high in tender based countries like a Norway, Denmark, Poland is an example. Very high market share in those. If you go more into the traditional Western European markets, more like in the 20% to 25% share of the Remicade market.","And, the discounting has played out to basically range in the tender countries fairly high, I'd say that 50% to 70% kind of range from a discounting standpoint and then the rest of the market probably in that 30% to 40% kind of range. It hasn't had any impact on us at all. Remicade because it's an infusion product in most of those countries doesn't compete in the same space that we compete in.","So, then, you move over to Enbrel. So, Enbrel is approved now. The Enbrel biosimilar is approved in about 32 countries. There's pricing and reimbursement in about a third of those countries right now. We've seen much lower discounting than what we've expected, I'd say. It ranges from as little as low-single digit discounting to maybe up in the 30% to 35% range in non-tender countries, and kind of the high 30%s to high 50%s in the tender countries. Again, it's playing out similar to the way we saw the Remicade biosimilar.","So in the tender countries, they are having higher share like the Norways and the Denmarks, Germany, Sweden, single digit kind of share. So, really no substantial market share impact but it's too early in the process for us to see that. I'd say the strategy that we anticipated and the one we put in place seems to be working well but it's the early rounds and you can see it in the performance of the business. You can see HUMIRA's continuing to grow in the international markets.","And as you back out the Venezuela impact, you can see that it's actually growing in the 6% or so range, 6.2% range. And so, we're continuing to see good, strong growth in those markets. And so, I'd say the early rounds are working like we had anticipated they would. But we need to give it some more time and see how it plays out. But it's a good opportunity for us to see how our strategy is working and be able to modify that strategy. So, that's essentially the biosimilar impact that we see. Nothing different than what we had expected.","Now, let me move over to derm and the impact on 2017. I'd say, overall, we're very happy with our performance in the derm space. So, if you look at the U.S., I'll talk specifically about the U.S., we've seen TRx's grow. In fact, accelerate over the course of time. I mean, if you go back to the early part of 2015 or even look at the average across 2015, we had kind of low double-digit TRx growth. In first quarter and second quarter that's accelerated to like 17% or 18% TRx growth in derm.","And so, we're seeing nice strong growth in that segment of the market. If you look at our revenue, a very similar kind of profile, we had strong double-digit growth and now it's accelerated fairly dramatically probably about 10 points to 15 points above what it had been running at.","If you look at market share, our overall market share is pretty stable to maybe slight down, 1.5% or so. As we analyze it, it is really driven extensively by the Otezla experience where we're seeing a lot more patients, particularly moderate and sometimes mild patients coming into the category. And so, therefore, the category is growing faster and so that dilutes our market share position. We when pull Otezla out, and we looked at our market share, our market share looks relatively stable.","In particular, if you look at PsA, our overall share has been stable in the U.S. at about 32%. If you look at Rheum PsA, it's actually increased about three points, which is the larger part of the PsA market, it's about 75% of the overall PsA market. And even the AS PsA has increased about two points.","Psoriasis as I said, it's down about one-and-a-half points to two points in total, but it's more driven by Otezla. So, overall, we feel very good about how the business is performing across all the indications but certainly in derm as well.","Liz Shea - Head-Investor Relations","Thanks, Chris. Operator, we'll take the next question.","Operator","Next question is from Marc Goodman of UBS. Your line now is open.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. I was hoping you could give us a flavor for managed care coverage for the key products for 2017, I mean, it's obviously, specifically HUMIRA. And then, could you just give us an update on how you're thinking about AndroGel this days? Thanks.","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, managed care, I mean, we're in really the thick of the negotiations for the 2017 and 2018 timeframe. So, I'm not necessarily going to talk about a lot of specifics because we're in active negotiations on a number of those contracts. But what I would say is HUMIRA has typically had a very, very strong position on managed care and we're not anticipating anything different going forward. But it would be premature to basically talk about a lot of specifics around the contracting, but, I'd say, we feel good about how it is sorting out.","On AndroGel, I guess I'm trying to better understand your question. Are you thinking more about follow-on products or are you thinking about the durability of it?","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Both. Thank you.","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, we don't necessarily have a follow-on product. We had some programs that we had been working on and that we ultimately decided to stop. And so, it will be running this franchise out. We're treating it as a typical LOE kind of an asset. And it's performing better than what we had expected but ultimately there will come a time where it will suffer more impact from generic competition. And so, we're basically dealing with it as we would deal with most assets, smaller molecule kind of asset LOEs where we take a large part of the cost out of the product. And manage it for maximum profitability.","William J. Chase - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And Marc, we do continue to see market shrinkage. We've been very pleased with the way that the share has hung in there. And obviously, it's been a nice story this year but we got to watch how this thing plays out as the LOE dynamics proceed.","Liz Shea - Head-Investor Relations","Thanks, Marc. Operator, we'll take the next question.","Operator","Next question is Andrew Baum of Citi. Your line now is open.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thank you. You've obviously done few very substantial deals within the oncology segment with Pharmacyclics and Stemcentrx. Could you just outline what your appetite is and how you see your oncology franchise broadening out over the next few years? Is it now pausing to integrate the two transactions and set up the trial programs that you need? Or is the appetite still there and you see additional opportunities to address other facets of oncology?","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, Andrew. This is Rick. So, I'll cover that. And maybe Mike can jump in on some specifics. When we went into \u2013 when we made the decision that the core future growth franchise on top of immunology was going to be oncology, we made a decision that we would invest in a way to try to build leadership positions in certain areas where we thought we had core competencies that were complementary to being able to perform in those areas.","So, specifically, we started with hematological oncology based on the assets that we had internally as well as the opportunity that existed with Pharmacyclics. And our goal was to be basically build a position where we thought we could drive to a leadership position within that category.","So, if you look at the assets we have today including IMBRUVICA and where we think VENCLEXTA will be able to expand to, it would tell us that we should have an opportunity to be able to bring forward innovative therapies in roughly 65% of the overall market in hematological malignancies. And I'd say that's an area where we feel comfortable with what we have.","Now, having said that, if we found unique opportunities, I'd say particularly in the acute leukemia side, assets or technologies or a drug that we thought was particularly attractive in an area where we didn't think we had a strong asset already, certainly we would pursue that kind of an asset. But I'd say from a platform standpoint, we feel very good about what we have in hematological malignancies, both internally as well as the addition of Pharmacyclics that we did a year or so ago.","On the solid tumor side, as we've said before about Stemcentrx, one of the things that was attractive to us is we have a number of efforts internally to be able to identify new targets, and so we have an effort internally to be able to do that. We obviously have a collaboration with Calico, and part of the work that their doing is to identify new oncology targets, but we wanted a more fundamental base platform for solid tumors, and one of the things that attracted us to Stemcentrx is we believe they have that.","And we're excited about that opportunity and Mike talked earlier about the number of candidates that will be moving out of that platform; and I think it's impressive what they've accomplished. And, so, that has built what we fundamentally believe will be the core platform for us in solid tumors, in addition to what we already have. We certainly continue to look for, again, now, more individual kinds of technology plays or assets that might be complementary to that, but we're not looking for another big platform. I don't know. Mike, would you want to add anything?","Michael E. Severino - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","I agree with that certainly. When we look at what we've built in terms of the hematological malignancies platform, I think we have the assets we need to drive standard of care not only in the short term, but also, in the longer term. And then when one considers what we've built on the solid tumor side both internally through Stemcentrx and through our partnership with Calico, we feel good about the pipeline opportunities that we'll be able to bring forward over the course of the next several years. We'll always keep our eyes open particularly for earlier technologies, earlier programs things that can add to those efforts, but we feel good about the engine we've built.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thank you.","Liz Shea - Head-Investor Relations","Thanks, Andrew. Operator, we'll take the next question please.","Operator","Next question is from Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore. Your line now is open.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore Group LLC","Sorry about that guys. I always have trouble picking up my phone this week. I had a couple of questions. The first is related to Elagolix. There are competitors on the horizon; you're well ahead. There is a drug out there I think from Takeda that's been licensed to be developed in the U.S. and the owners of that drug say it's better than Elagolix because it's QD, once a day, and you can \u2013 it's more potent. And most importantly, you can co-formulate it with Add-back. So, I'd love for you to give us your view on Add-back. Is it attractive to have co-formulation or are you guys at a disadvantage or not?","And the other question I had was kind of an off the rails question, but I know Henry joined you guys a while back and a lot of people on the Street say great things about him. I'm just wondering will he ever be investor facing? Thank you.","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. So, Mark, this is Rick. And I'd say we feel very good about Henry. Specifically, I'll talk myself. Specifically, I feel very good about having Henry as part of the leadership team. And certainly, yeah. I mean, over time I think we will bring Henry in. It will be most relevant when we're talking about those kind of areas where we has direct responsibility for. But Henry has already become an integral part of the leadership team and has contributed significantly.","So, Mike, do you want to cover Elagolix?","Michael E. Severino - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Certainly. So, with respect to Elagolix, as you pointed out, Mark, we have a substantial lead, having completed our two pivotal Phase III studies and already being in the process of collecting longer-term data that are necessary to define benefit risk. And we think that is a real advantage for our program, and one that we're going to continue to drive as we drive forward for example with the Add-back program to further enhance the understanding of how we can use Elagolix to treat endometriosis and uterine fibroids.","With respect to some of the issues you brought up on competitive programs, we don't really view potency as a primary driver here. In fact, the most potent agent in this access is Lupron and the problem is in fact the degree to which that shuts down the access. We're trying to achieve a fine titration of dose. And we believe Elagolix has the properties to allow us to do that. With respect to co-formulation, with Add-back, there is nothing that would prevent us from co-formulating with Add-back as well and we believe over time, there may be a number of strategies that could be used to protect bone and so we'll have flexibility to employ many, many different strategies. So, we feel very good about the position of Elagolix. We think it's an important treatment option and we think that it's going to make a real impact on endometriosis.","With respect to relative advantages of a Q day formulation, I think that again depends on the dose one ultimately selects. And I think, when we look at the overall profile of Elagolix, we remain convinced that it's very strong.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore Group LLC","Can I say one more thing?","Liz Shea - Head-Investor Relations","Sure.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore Group LLC","Oh, sorry. Yeah. I wasn't sure if I was muted. Hey \u2013 and one shout out to Liz, congrats on getting the IR seat. Thanks for all the help. She's doing great.","Liz Shea - Head-Investor Relations","Thanks, Mark. Operator, we'll take the next question.","Operator","The next question is from Vamil Divan of Credit Suisse. Your line now is open.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. So, maybe two. You touched on this a little bit at your R&D day, but just around multiple myeloma and some of the work you guys are doing there and you touched a little bit on VENCLEXTA and moving that one in there. A little bit more just thoughts around that given such a competitive space and what you see as the advantages of moving into there.","And then, the other one which you didn't touch much on at the R&D day and I think it's overlooked a little bit is veliparib and there's been a lot of discussions around the PARPs recently. Just curious if you can kind of maybe refresh us on sort of what you feel is the competitive advantages that you may hold or where that's going to sort of fit in relative to the other PARPs that are either on the market or in development? Thanks.","Michael E. Severino - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Okay. So, the first part of the question related to multiple myeloma and we have the potential to pursue myeloma with a number of assets in our portfolio. VENCLEXTA has clear potential there and we're advancing that program rapidly as we mentioned during our opening remarks. IMBRUVICA also has potential, as do a number of the molecules in our pipeline.","It is a competitive space. One can prolong survival to a much greater extent today than was possible a decade ago. But we still don't have curative therapies. Patients ultimately fail therapy and progress which means that we need new mechanisms that aren't cross-reactive that provide durable disease control. And we think we have a number of those in our pipeline. So, we're aware of the competition certainly. But we think we have therapies that will further the standard of care in that disease and we'll be driving clinical programs forward to demonstrate that.","With respect to veliparib, so veliparib is a molecule that is an important part of our overall oncology efforts. It's in Phase III studies across a range of tumor indications. We have a bit of a different hypothesis around the way veliparib should be used than perhaps some of the others who are developing PARPs. We are not focused solely on the use in patients with germline BRCA mutations or other HRD deficient tumors.","We are exploring the hypothesis in our Phase III program that PARP can augment DNA damage in chemotherapy; essentially that the first hit doesn't have to come from a genetic hit. It can come from a therapeutic hit that is DNA damaging which would increase the importance of DNA repair mechanisms. That hypothesis is being tested in a range of Phase III programs in non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer and in ovarian cancer.","And those studies will start to read out in 2017. We'll have a number of important data readouts which will tell us the role that PARP can play there. So, we haven't focused on it as much in recent investor days and that's largely because it is in a quiet period where the studies are up and running. We're generating the results but you'll hear a lot more about PARP in 2017.","Liz Shea - Head-Investor Relations","Thanks, Vamil. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.","Operator","Next question is from the David Risinger, Morgan Stanley. Your line now is open.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. I have two questions. First, with respect to payers, they are starting to talk about trying to contract for individual indications. And obviously, one area they might be thinking about is alternatives to HUMIRA for certain indications from new drugs that have potentially better profiles than HUMIRA in certain indications. Could you just comment on your perspective on contracting for individual indications in autoimmune disease?","And then, second, Rick, I was hoping that you could provide a little bit more detail on the sort of timing and specifics surrounding the patent litigation steps? So, obviously, you're not going to comment on individual patents or individual patent strategies. But as I understand it, there will be immediately after Amgen gets approval of its biosimilar, immediately after that occurs, there will be a wave of patent litigation that kicks in and I was just hoping that you could provide a little bit more perspective on how investors should think about that, and what they should be expecting? Thank you.","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, this is Rick. So, let me start with the payer question that you had. Indication-based pricing, I think, first evolved primarily in the oncology space. And it was driven, I think, by certain efforts to say, you'll have an oncology agent that has very strong efficacy in a certain disease, and might have significantly lower efficacy in another disease, and why would I pay the same for this strong efficacy as I would for relatively modest efficacy? I think that was how the concept originally evolved.","As we look at HUMIRA, and we look across all of the major indications at least, with every single indication, there's obviously some variation between the competitive profiles. But I'd say, in general, HUMIRA tends to perform across those broad set of indications in the top tier. And so that is how we view it. So, indication-based pricing wouldn't be something that we think is very applicable for this specific asset in this particular class. And we haven't seen it take off much prior to this, and we'll have to see how it plays out over time.","There are a lot, it may sound to you like it's a fairly innocent issue around timing and the steps and what should play out, but I would tell you, it's not that from a litigation standpoint. And so I'm just going to need to take the same position I did before. We're not in a position to be able to give you a lot more color. Certainly, we've made it clear what our position is going to be. And I think that will become clearer as the steps play out. But I can't give you a whole lot of color on the timing or what the alternatives would be.","Liz Shea - Head-Investor Relations","Thanks, David.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you very much.","Liz Shea - Head-Investor Relations","Operator, we have time for one last question.","Operator","Okay. The last question is from Gregg Gilbert of Deutsche Bank. Your line now is open.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. I want to go back to Bill's comments on HUMIRA growth in the beginning. Clearly, prescription growth has been very robust. But you're also enjoying a really nice pricing tailwind. And I think the net price benefit you saw in the U.S. was about 10% which required, I think, a 20%-plus lift price increase over the year-ago period.","So, I'm curious how you would expect that dynamic to play out, both list price increased magnitude and frequency going forward, the ability to realize net price and how you're thinking about that? Seems like a very robust high set of numbers for such a big product. And lastly, Bill, since we don't have a 10-Q, perhaps you could provide cash flow from ops and receivables if you have those handy, would appreciate that. Thank you.","William J. Chase - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Gregg, I think probably the best thing to do is dissect the U.S. number on the quarter for you. And I think that will give you a good sense of the overall dynamics of the brand. And then I'll back up and talk a little bit about the business in general.","Obviously, the brand is performing very, very well in the U.S. We grew at 26.7% in the Q. Script trends, the way we see them, we're in the mid-teens for the quarter. Our price was up \u2013 it was actually up in the single digits. And then, as I said in my comments, we did see a modest impact from differences in customer order patterns.","Again, we run this business at less than half-a-month inventory. But it gets a little tough to call at various times and we did see a little bit of demand differences between the Q. We had a little bit lower inventories in the second quarter of 2015 relative to 2016. So, I think the way you got to think about this is mid-teens growth from script and single-digit price. And when you add those up, you can pretty much get to the 20% number that we've guided to.","From a overall price standpoint, look, I would say if you back up and look at our growth on the quarter of 18%, the majority was volume. Across the total book of business, we had a price impact of less than 4%. So, the strategy that we've actually employed for the business and certainly with our new products launching is this is going to be a product, company that's fueled by volume and not price. Obviously price, we do have an opportunity in certain markets to take it, but I would not say this is a company that is heavily dependent on price. And then, as we look out over the LRP, we tend to scale down our price expectations in the U.S. because we think that's the prudent way to model.","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And the only thing I'd add is \u2013 on the inventory discussion that Bill had, it's important to keep in perspective both periods were under a half-a-month, but even relatively small variations in a day here or a day there can have some impact on the growth rate. So, what Bill was describing is that the prior period had a inventory level that was below 0.5, right, but it was lower than what the inventory level was this period, which was also below 0.5.","William J. Chase - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","From a cash flow and receivable standpoint, again, we're still working on the Q, so I'm not going to specifics there other than to say that cash flow remains very robust and frankly from a receivable standpoint we're collecting fine. So, but I can't give you specifics at this point in time.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Liz Shea - Head-Investor Relations","Thanks, Gregg.

Welcome to the AbbVie Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer portion. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Liz Shea","Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Also, on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Severino, Vice Chairman and President; and Rob Michael, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, I'll remind you that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website","Please note that, we have also posted a set of slides to our website to supplement some of the content, we'll be covering this morning. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions.","So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick.","Rick Gonzalez","Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2019 performance, as well as our 2020 expectations for AbbVie on a stand-alone basis. We will provide combined AbbVie and Allergan guidance after the close of the planned transaction. Mike will then provide an update on recent advancements across our R&D programs. And Rob will discuss last year's performance and our 2020 guidance in more detail. Following our remarks, we will take your questions.","We delivered another strong quarter with adjusted earnings per share exceeding the midpoint of our guidance. Our adjusted EPS of $2.21 represents growth of more than 16% versus the fourth quarter of 2018. Total adjusted operational sales growth of 5.3% was also ahead of our expectations for the quarter driven by continued strong performance in both immunology and hematological oncology. Our performance this quarter tops off another strong year for AbbVie.","For the full year 2019, we delivered adjusted earnings per share growth of 13%. We have driven strong commercial, operational and R&D execution, which has allowed us to substantially grow through the impact of international biosimilar competition. We saw excellent performance in our hematological oncology business, which drove operational growth of more than 39% in the year.","We have built a substantial franchise with IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA, which combined nearly $5.5 billion in combined revenue with strong double-digit growth expected once again in 2020. IMBRUVICA remains the clear market share leader across all lines of therapy in CLL. With the largest body of clinical evidence, a robust survival benefit, and the highest category rating in treatment guidelines today, we remain confident that IMBRUVICA will be a significant growth contributor for many years to come.","VENCLEXTA will also contribute substantially to our growth in 2020 with continued share expansion expected in both the broad relapsed\/refractory and frontline CLL segments, as well as continued penetration in frontline AML.","In our immunology business, the launches of SKYRIZI and RINVOQ are going exceptionally well. Both SKYRIZI and RINVOQ have demonstrated strong differentiated efficacy in their initial indications and we are making considerable progress to expand their uses in several additional immune-mediated diseases.","SKYRIZI is already having an impact on AbbVie's growth with sales of approximately $215 million in the fourth quarter, which already equates to an annualized run rate approaching $900 million. And we expect robust growth in 2020. The launch execution has been nothing short of exceptional. In a very short timeframe SKYRIZI has established the leading in-play psoriasis patient share, which includes both new and switching patients at roughly 25%.","SKYRIZI is redefining the standard for efficacy and safety in the psoriasis market, where it has not only demonstrated superiority to HUMIRA, the gold standard of care, but also outperformed other novel agents, including COSENTYX. SKYRIZI's commercial access is now at parity to HUMIRA and above 95%.","While still early in the launch, we're also seeing robust demand trends for RINVOQ which is performing well ahead of comparable analogs in the RA segment. In the first full quarter, RINVOQ was on the market, we estimate more than 7,600 prescriptions were filled, including both paid prescriptions and those who received RINVOQ through our bridge access program. Based on this level of prescription volume, RINVOQ is currently capturing approximately 9% of in-play RA patients and has surpassed the in-play share for several other established brands. The cannibalization of HUMIRA market share in this segment remains very low thus far.","Feedback from prescribing physicians has been very positive. And the strong benefit\/risk profile RINVOQ has demonstrated across our registrational trials has supported very rapid and broad formulary coverage for RINVOQ. Commercial access for RINVOQ is now at more than 95% and we expect paid prescription volume to increase significantly throughout 2020 as a result.","HUMIRA in the U.S. continues to generate strong revenue driving more than $1 billion of growth in 2019 and will remain a significant contributor to growth again in 2020. The international HUMIRA dynamics remain consistent with our expectations with 2019 revenues, down roughly 28% on an operational basis. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with the performance and the outlook for our immunology franchise.","We had previously commented that SKYRIZI and RINVOQ would deliver more than $1 billion of revenue combined in 2020. Our 2020 guidance now contemplates that these two products will contribute approximately $1.7 billion in revenue together this year. Since our inception, we have focused on building a robust pipeline and added growth platforms that will allow AbbVie to absorb the eventual impact of biosimilar competition in the U.S. and maintain a strong and growing business. We continue to make excellent progress against that objective.","As I just highlighted, the better-than-expected launch trajectories of SKYRIZI and RINVOQ and the continued strong performance of our hematological oncology franchise has further increased our level of confidence that these platforms will drive significant growth over the long-term. Our R&D productivity over the past seven years has resulted in numerous new products, which collectively contributed approximately $9 billion in revenue in 2019.","And our R&D pipeline continues to develop nicely with multiple programs well underway to expand the breadth of indications for SKYRIZI and RINVOQ as well as the advancement of a significant number of early- and mid-stage programs six of which will have proof-of-concept data readouts in 2020. AbbVie's R&D pipeline has been phase-gated from the time we launched as an independent company back in 2013.","Our initial priority was to develop next-generation assets that would be superior to HUMIRA and other competitive alternatives within our key immunology disease areas. And as you have seen SKYRIZI and RINVOQ have demonstrated that type of performance across multiple clinical trials. Their successful launch, trajectories demonstrate the value of these assets in two very large segments of immunology, which combined represent approximately 40% of U.S. HUMIRA revenues today. We continue to rapidly progress the development of these assets in the remaining key HUMIRA disease areas as well as new indications such as atopic dermatitis.","Our second priority was to build our hematological oncology franchise into a major growth engine for the company. IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA have become roughly a $5.5 billion franchise and growing rapidly. And we continue to expand these medicines into important new disease areas such as multiple myeloma with VENCLEXTA in the t(11;14) biomarker-defined patient population; and combination therapy with IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA which have the potential to provide even deeper and more durable responses.","The third priority was the development of a robust early- and mid-stage pipeline, which now has nearly 40 clinical programs ongoing including novel new mechanisms developed by AbbVie scientists as well as assets we are advancing across our many collaborations such as Calico. The most advanced programs in our mid- to late-stage pipeline which we expect to be approved by 2022 include navitoclax for myelofibrosis, ABBV-951 for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease and veliparib for the treatment of ovarian cancer and BRCA breast cancer. These approvals are on top of the numerous new opportunities expected for RINVOQ, SKYRIZI and VENCLEXTA.","Over the same period of time, we anticipate approximately 30 proof-of-concept readouts from novel programs in our early-stage pipeline, which Mike will discuss momentarily. It is truly an exciting time for AbbVie science. Another exciting aspect of our business is the planned acquisition of Allergan, which has significant strategic and financial merit. Allergan will provide AbbVie with highly valuable on-market assets with leadership positions across additional attractive growth segments including new growth platforms in aesthetics and CNS\/neuroscience.","The acquisition will further diversify AbbVie's revenue and payer mix and immediately accelerates the stand-alone scale of our non-HUMIRA business the AbbVie growth platform, which is expected to drive high single-digit annual growth revenue over the next decade and beyond. The proposed acquisition is proceeding well. We recently received conditional approval from the European Commission.","The FTC review continues to advance following the divestiture announcements of both Zenpep and Allergan's IL-23. And we have completed the integration planning process including confirmation of our synergy objectives. We remain on track for closing the Allergan transaction as expected in the first quarter of 2020.","We've entered 2020 with very strong momentum and we're committed to delivering strong results which is reflected in our guidance. We expect full year 2020 adjusted earnings per share of $9.61 to $9.71 representing growth of 8.1% at the midpoint. As I mentioned earlier, this guidance reflects AbbVie on a stand-alone basis. We will provide pro forma guidance for 2020 following the close of the Allergan transaction.","So in summary, as you can see from our 2019 results and our 2020 guidance, the performance of AbbVie's business remains very strong. Net performance combined with a late-stage pipeline which includes more than 20 new medicines in major new disease indications as well as a robust early-stage pipeline gives us significant confidence in the future outlook of our company.","The AbbVie business will be even stronger and more diverse with the Allergan transaction. We look forward to another successful year and to welcoming our Allergan colleagues to the new AbbVie in the near future.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?","Michael Severino","Thank you, Rick. When we set out as an independent company, we knew that building a productive R&D engine was an essential part of our success. And we're proud of the progress we've made over the past seven years.","We've built one of the strongest late-stage pipelines in our industry and brought to market six new assets; RINVOQ, SKYRIZI, IMBRUVICA, VENCLEXTA, MAVYRET and ORILISSA, which collectively delivered approximately $9 billion in sales in 2019. These assets are performing very well in their lead indications and will drive significant growth for AbbVie over the long-term as we continue to build the body of evidence supporting their differentiated clinical profiles.","In immunology, both RINVOQ and SKYRIZI are off to a very strong start in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis respectively. And we continue to generate clinical data sets that set them apart from competitive offerings.","For example we recently announced positive topline results from a Phase 3 head-to-head trial comparing SKYRIZI to COSENTYX in psoriasis. In this study, SKYRIZI demonstrated superiority to COSENTYX at week 52 with 87% of SKYRIZI patients achieving PASI 90 compared to 57% for COSENTYX.","SKYRIZI also demonstrated superiority to COSENTYX on all ranked secondary end points including PASI 100, PASI 75, and sPGA clear or almost clear at week 52. These results underscore two critical components of SKYRIZI's profile; the ability to drive high levels of response and the durability of that response at long-term end points.","In oncology, we will also continue to support our hem\/onc franchise with important regulatory milestones and additional Phase 3 data readouts for our approved indications in 2020.","We recently received a positive CHMP opinion for VENCLEXTA in previously untreated CLL. And we expect to receive an important label update for IMBRUVICA in the first half of this year based on results from ECOG study which demonstrated the superiority of IMBRUVICA to FCR in frontline fit patients with CLL.","When we think about sources of growth beyond the current indications for our recently approved assets, it's important to consider two components of our late-stage pipeline. The first is a large number of programs that will allow us to drive our core assets into important new disease areas that represent large and attractive markets. And the second is a set of new assets that will help support additional growth in the future.","If we look first at our opportunity to move into new disease areas with our existing therapies, we see a number of commercially attractive programs that have been de-risked based on strong data.","For example we recently announced topline results from the second Phase 3 study for RINVOQ in psoriatic arthritis which compared RINVOQ to both placebo and HUMIRA in patients who had an inadequate response to at least one non-biologic DMARD.","In this study, both doses of RINVOQ met all primary and key secondary end points, demonstrating a significant impact on both joint and skin end points as well as radiographic inhibition of damage to joint structure.","RINVOQ also demonstrated superiority to HUMIRA on ACR20 response at week 12 with the high dose and non-inferiority with the low dose. These data followed the positive results from our first registrational trial reported late last year. Detailed data from both pivotal studies will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and we expect to submit our regulatory applications for RINVOQ in psoriatic arthritis in the second quarter with commercialization expected in 2021.","Following discussions with global regulators, our approval submissions in ankylosing spondylitis are planned for the second half of 2020 based on positive data already presented at ACR last November.","In this study, RINVOQ demonstrated significantly greater improvements in signs and symptoms as well as physical function and imaging end points compared to placebo. Together, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis make up an important segment of the rheumatology market with global market sales of approximately $14 billion.","The dermatology segment will also be an important area of growth for RINVOQ. Moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis is a large market that we do not participate in today. And in the middle of this year, we expect to see Phase 3 data for RINVOQ in this indication.","In our Phase 2b study, RINVOQ demonstrated a very strong effect on the easy composite end point and had a prominent impact on itch which is one of the most troublesome symptoms of this disease. Following the pivotal data readouts, we plan to submit global regulatory submissions later this year.","We are also nearing completion of the registrational programs for SKYRIZI in several new disease areas. In the second half of this year, we expect to see data from Phase 3 studies in both psoriatic arthritis and Crohn's disease with regulatory submissions for both indications expected in 2021.","The IBD segment, including both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, represents a significant opportunity with global market sales of approximately $18 billion. IBD is a growing segment where there continues to be significant unmet need. And based on the efficacy demonstrated in our mid-stage studies, we believe both SKYRIZI and RINVOQ have the potential to drive higher levels of performance than other therapeutic alternatives.","Together we expect SKYRIZI and RINVOQ to have full coverage across the major disease areas for which HUMIRA is currently approved plus new areas such as atopic dermatitis. With these two new medicines, AbbVie is well positioned to maintain its strong leadership in the $70 billion global immunology market.","Another growth asset that we expect to expand into important new areas is VENCLEXTA. CANOVA our Phase 3 study in relapsed\/refractory multiple myeloma patients with the t(11;14) genetic mutation is now well underway. And towards the end of this year, we plan to initiate a second Phase 3 study in the relapsed\/refractory t(11;14) population.","VENCLEXTA has the potential to become an important biomarker-driven treatment option in multiple myeloma. The transformed cells in t(11;14) patients have a B-Cell 21:49 like phenotype and express high levels of Bcl-2. We've seen very promising results in this population in early and mid-stage trials with VENCLEXTA showing high overall response rates and prolonged progression-free survival.","The level of efficacy that we've seen suggests that t(11;14) patients may be particularly responsive to VENCLEXTA. This biomarker-defined population makes up approximately 20% of the $18 billion multiple myeloma market representing an important new opportunity for VENCLEXTA. In addition to multiple myeloma, we will begin Phase 3 studies in two additional Bcl-2-driven diseases in 2020.","The first is AML. Building on our experience in the transplant-ineligible population, we are initiating a study in fit patients with AML who have received stem cell transplant, but remain at high risk for recurrence. The second is higher-risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome or MDS.","MDS is a malignant disease of bone marrow stem cells that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality due to the risk of bleeding, infection and transformation to acute leukemia. Some patients with MDS undergo stem cell transplant, but many cannot. And these patients have very few treatment options. Preclinical and early clinical studies support a role for Bcl-2 inhibition in these patients and our Phase 3 studies with VENCLEXTA will begin later this year.","The second component of value in our late-stage pipeline includes important new therapies that we expect to launch in 2021 and 2022 including; navitoclax, veliparib and ABBV-951. Navitoclax will be entering Phase 3 studies in the first half of this year in frontline and second-line myelofibrosis.","Myelofibrosis is a malignant disease in which the bone marrow is replaced with fibrotic tissue leading to bone marrow failure. Currently, JAK2 inhibition is the only approved therapeutic option, but despite treatment many patients progress and experience significant morbidity and mortality.","Navitoclax is a first-in-class Bcl-xL inhibitor with the potential to transform the treatment of myelofibrosis by deleting the clone that causes the disease. At ASH last year, we presented encouraging data from a Phase II study which demonstrated that up to 43% of patients who had failed JAK2 inhibition responded to navitoclax based on a 35% reduction in spleen volume. In addition, responses deepened over time and we continue to follow these patients.","Navitoclax treated patients also showed reductions in the number of malignant cells and decreases in bone marrow fibrosis supporting the potential for disease modification. In the area of solid tumors, we've previously presented positive Phase 3 data from two veliparib studies in frontline ovarian cancer and BRCA breast cancer.","Data from these two studies demonstrated significant prolongation of progression-free survival and support the use of PARP inhibition in combination with chemotherapy earlier in the course of treatment. In ovarian cancer, veliparib will be the only PARP inhibitor to combine with frontline chemotherapy and treat a broader population that is not restricted to biomarker status or chemo responsiveness.","In BRCA-positive breast cancer veliparib will also be the only PARP inhibitor to combine with platinum-based chemotherapy giving these patients a valuable new treatment option. Based on feedback from global regulatory authorities, we plan to submit our applications for veliparib in the first half of this year. Veliparib will be an important new treatment option for women with ovarian cancer and BRCA breast cancer offering the potential to provide better outcomes.","And in our late-stage neuroscience pipeline, we are making good progress with the Phase 3 program for ABBV-951, our innovative approach to delivering DUOPA like efficacy through a subcutaneous delivery system for advanced Parkinson's disease. This approach is enabled by novel levodopa and carbidopa prodrugs and would be a transformative improvement to current treatment options.","With a less invasive non-surgical delivery system 951 has the potential to significantly expand the patient population currently addressed by DUOPA or other more invasive therapies for advanced Parkinson's such as deep brain stimulation. We'll see data from the pivotal program in 2021 with commercialization anticipated in 2022. In addition to advancing, our late-stage programs we've also made tremendous progress building our early-stage pipeline.","Following several years of investment, we're beginning to see these efforts pay-off. And over the next three years, we're planning for proof-of-concept data readouts in approximately 30 programs. Our early pipeline is designed to include a mix of highly novel targets supported by strong underlying science and clinically validated targets where we think an opportunity exists to improve on current agents.","In the area of immunology, I'll highlight our TNF steroid conjugate ABBV-3373, which is novel technology that delivers a proprietary high-potency steroid directly to activated immune cells by TNF-mediated uptake. We've shown in model systems that this approach has the potential to drive transformational efficacy. And our early clinical work has demonstrated that we can deliver 3373 at its anticipated therapeutic dose without systemic steroid effects.","We will see efficacy data from this study later this year. If our clinical data reproduce what we have seen pre-clinically, our steroid conjugate technology has the potential to serve as a platform across a wide range of diseases including RA, IBD and lupus.","We will also see proof-of-concept data this year from several other early-stage assets in our immunology portfolio including data for ABBV-599 our JAK-BTK program; and ABBV-323 our CD40 antagonist program, which are both targeting multiple pathogenic nodes that are thought to play important roles in diseases such as RA, IBD, lupus and scleroderma, allowing us to restate standard of care in our core disease areas and move into new ones where no effective therapy exists today.","In oncology, we are building on what we have learned with venetoclax and navitoclax to advance a number of promising apoptosis programs. The most advanced of these are ABBV-155, which uses a B7-H3-targeting antibody to deliver a novel high-potency Bcl-xL warhead to solid tumors; and ABBV-621, which is designed to induce apoptosis by clustering TRAIL, an apoptosis-inducing ligand on the surface of cancer cells.","We will see monotherapy data for ABBV-155 in 2020 and combination data in 2021. We expect to see proof-of-concept data for ABBV-621 in 2021 as well. In immuno-oncology, we have a number of very promising T cell-redirecting bispecifics in the clinic and several more in preclinical development.","The most advanced of these are BCMA bispecifics in multiple myeloma TNB-338B [ph] and HPN-217. These programs allow us to explore different epitope specificities and binding affinities to optimize benefit\/risk of our candidates in this very promising area.","We are also pursuing several novel approaches designed to modify the tumor immunosuppressive environment. Here I would highlight ABBV-151, our monoclonal antibody targeting GARP. Through its effect on GARP ABBV-151 reduces TGF-beta-mediated signaling within tumors. TGF-beta is thought to be an important driver of tumor immune evasion and TGF-beta signaling is correlated with a lack of tumor immune infiltrate and PD-1 unresponsiveness.","In addition, I would highlight our CD39 inhibitor, TTX-030. Recently emerging data suggest that CD39 plays an important role in tumor immune evasion by converting pro-inflammatory ATP to anti-inflammatory ADP and adenosine in the extracellular environment. TTX-030 is designed to restore this important pro-inflammatory signal and reduce tumor immunosuppression.","Lastly in our early neuroscience pipeline we have several promising disease-modifying candidates in the clinic for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. In addition to our tau-directed programs we have programs aimed at important regulators of the neuroinflammatory response TREM2 and CD33; as well as a core driver of pathology in Parkinson's disease alpha-synuclein.","So in summary, we've continued to see significant evolution of our early- and late-stage development programs. We have a late-stage pipeline that includes more than 20 programs in registrational studies and have nearly 40 programs in early- to mid-stage development that will mature over the next few years.","With that I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our 2019 performance and our 2020 guidance. Rob?","Rob Michael","Thank you, Mike. Today I'll review our performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2019 and then walk through our 2020 outlook. We had another year of strong execution. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $8.94 reflecting growth of 13% compared to prior year and beating our initial guidance midpoint by $0.24.","For the full year, net revenues were $33.3 billion, up 2.7% on an operational basis excluding a 1.1% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Strong growth from several key products and newly launched assets more than offset the impact of international biosimilar competition.","For the fourth quarter, net revenues were $8.7 billion, up 5.3% on an operational basis excluding a 0.5% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. U.S. HUMIRA sales were $4 billion, up 9.8% compared to prior year, reflecting high single-digit volume growth plus price. Wholesaler inventory levels remained below 0.5 month in the quarter.","Full year sales of HUMIRA in U.S. were $14.9 billion, up 8.6% versus prior year. International HUMIRA sales were approximately $950 million in the quarter, down 25.4% operationally reflecting biosimilar competition across Europe and other international markets and in line with our expectations.","SKYRIZI continues to perform extremely well with global sales of $216 million in the quarter. RINVOQ is also demonstrating strong uptake with sales of $33 million in the first full quarter following the U.S. launch in late August. For the full year, the combined revenues of SKYRIZI and RINVOQ were $402 million and above our initial expectations.","Hematologic oncology global sales were more than $1.5 billion in the quarter, up 37.2% on an operational basis, driven by the continued strong performance of both IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA. IMBRUVICA global net revenues were approximately $1.3 billion in the quarter, up 28.9%, driven by strong share in all lines of therapy in CLL.","VENCLEXTA revenues were $251 million in the quarter, driven by continued share gains across all approved indications. For the full year, our hem\/onc global revenues were $5.5 billion, up 39.3% on an operational basis.","Global HCV sales were $632 million in the quarter. For the full year, HCV sales were $2.9 billion, down 17.7% on an operational basis, driven by lower treated patient volumes in select international markets and increased competition within the U.S. managed Medicaid segment. We also saw continued strong operational sales growth for Creon and Duodopa.","Turning now to the P&L profile for the fourth quarter. Adjusted gross margin was 81.6% of sales, up 180 basis points compared to the prior year including the year-over-year benefit related to the expiration of HUMIRA royalties.","Adjusted R&D investment was 15.3% of sales supporting our pipeline programs in oncology, immunology, and other areas. Adjusted SG&A expense was 21.6% of sales, reflecting continued investment in our on-market products and newly launched assets.","The adjusted operating margin ratio was 44.6% of sales, an improvement of 290 basis points versus the prior year. Adjusted net interest expense was $282 million and the adjusted tax rate was 8.8%. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share excluding specified items was $2.21, up 16.3% versus prior year.","As we look ahead to 2020, our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance is between $9.61 to $9.71, reflecting growth of 8.1% at the midpoint. Excluded from this guidance is $1.95 of known intangible amortization and specified items.","On the topline in 2020, we expect revenue growth approaching 8% on an operational basis. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a minimal impact on reported sales growth. This forecast comprehends the following assumptions for our key products.","In 2020, we expect U.S. HUMIRA to deliver revenue growth of approximately 9%. We expect international HUMIRA to approach $3.4 billion at current exchange rates. As Rick noted, we expect global sales of our newly launched immunology products to reach approximately $1.7 billion in 2020. This includes SKYRIZI global revenues of approximately $1.2 billion and RINVOQ global revenues of approximately $500 million.","We expect our hem\/onc franchise to grow 24% on an operational basis, with IMBRUVICA global revenues of approximately $5.5 billion and VENCLEXTA global sales of approximately $1.3 billion. We expect HCV global sales of approximately $2.5 billion.","For Creon, we expect revenue growth of approximately 10%. For Duodopa, we expect sales of approximately $500 million. For Lupron, Synthroid, and Synagis, we expect sales to be roughly flat year-over-year. And we expect approximately $200 million in combined revenue from ORILISSA in endometriosis and Elagolix in uterine fibroids.","Looking at the P&L for 2020, we are forecasting adjusted gross margin of approximately 81.5% of sales. We are forecasting adjusted R&D expense just above 14% of sales, reflecting continued investment across all stages of our pipeline. We are forecasting adjusted SG&A expense to be just above 19% of sales including funding to maximize the sales potential of new products. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 48% of sales, an improvement of roughly 70 basis points versus 2019. We expect adjusted net interest expense of approximately $1.2 billion and we model a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 10%. Finally, our share count for 2020 will be roughly flat.","Regarding our first quarter outlook, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.28 and $2.30 excluding approximately $0.53 of known intangible amortization and specified items. We anticipate first quarter operational sales growth of approximately 7%. At current rates, we expect a modest unfavorable foreign exchange impact.","For U.S. HUMIRA, we expect sales of approximately $3.5 billion. We expect international HUMIRA sales of approximately $900 million assuming current exchange rates. For SKYRIZI, we expect global sales of approximately $250 million. And for IMBRUVICA, we expect global sales approaching $1.2 billion.","Moving now to the P&L for the first quarter, we are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 48.5% of sales. As a reminder, the 2020 guidance provided today reflects AbbVie on a standalone basis. We will provide combined AbbVie and Allergan guidance after the close of the transaction.","In closing, AbbVie has once again delivered outstanding results. And with our strong track record combined with the momentum of our business we are well positioned for strong growth in 2020.","With that I'll turn the call back over to Liz.","Liz Shea","Thanks Rob. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Geoffrey Porges from SVB Leerink.","Geoffrey Porges","Thank you very much for the question and congratulations on the quarter. Rick I just wanted to ask you it's been a while since you gave the kind of initial overview of the basis for the Allergan transaction. Could you talk about how the business performance of AbbVie and frankly also Allergan has been trending compared to the assumptions that you had going into the transaction?","And then as you get close to closing how confident are you about the $2 billion in synergies? And how soon might they be realized? Thanks.","Rick Gonzalez","Hey Geoff. I think you've obviously seen the standalone AbbVie performance and we're coming off of another very good year. And our projection and our guidance obviously is projected from a standalone basis another strong year for the company.","And I think, in particular, we're very impressed with what we're seeing out of our immunology franchise and what we're seeing out of our hem\/onc franchise. And so we feel good.","We've been watching the Allergan performance. They have reported two quarters that we've seen. They'll be reporting another quarter here soon, probably sometime early next week. And I would say, at least for the two that have been reported, overall the business is tracking, I'd say slightly ahead of what our deal model had projected. As I mentioned, I think a number of times the deal model that we put together was a fairly conservative deal model. So that's not too surprising. But I think as you look at key products that are \u2013 critical products for their business, they're all performing in line or ahead of what our projections were.","As it relates to the synergies, as I mentioned in my formal comments, we have gone through all of the integration planning process with Allergan. Part of that process is to validate the synergies. And so we're comfortable that, the synergy target that we had communicated, which was $2 billion or greater than $2 billion is an achievable number. Obviously, anytime you do a transaction like this you're trying to maximize the synergies and obviously maintain the business to perform at the level that you would expect it to perform.","So I feel good about the synergy projections. We'll provide final gating for those projections, when we do the combined pro forma guidance and \u2013 but I feel good about the overall target over the first three years meeting or exceeding what we had projected. The timing close everything is progressing as we had planned. And we still anticipate that we will see closure by the end of the first quarter.","The other thing I'd say is, as we step back and we look at what were we trying to accomplish with the Allergan transaction, it was basically to try to build a business that ultimately would be even stronger than the AbbVie business over the long-term. And I think one of the things \u2013 as investors start to think about the business, it's important to sort of put that in perspective. We want a business that's more diversified, both from a revenue standpoint, as well as a payer mix standpoint. We want a business that has durable positions. This business the combined business will have durable growth positions in eight different franchises and be able to drive strong growth. There'll be four franchises for the new company that will be the major growth franchises for us.","Obviously, immunology, hematological, oncology, medical aesthetics and CNS\/neuro will be the four franchises. This is a business that will have excellent payer diversity and payer mix. If you look at it as a percent of the global revenues Medicare Part B will be about 2%, Medicare Part D will be about 16%, Medicaid will be about 3% and cash pay will be about 10%. So nice balance and security along the payer base, it will be a business that's driven by volume not by price. And so that's important. It will be a company that has a strong growing dividend that's underpinned by tremendous cash flow, which provides security to deliver a growing dividend over the long-term and through the loss of exclusivity in 2023 in the U.S.","It will also have a number of recently launched products and growth products. In fact, there'll be six of them if you think about it. You look at SKYRIZI, RINVOQ, VENCLEXTA, IMBRUVICA those all have significant growth opportunities ahead of them on the AbbVie side. And then you look at the Allergan side, you have VRAYLAR. This is a product that has a \u2013 it's about an $850 million product. I think the last numbers, I saw showed it was growing about 70%. And you have their recently launched oral CGRP that, we haven't seen any data on yet as far as their revenue performance, because they just launched it, but I think that will be an important product over the long term.","So \u2013 and then that's underpinned by our late-stage pipeline that has 20 new drugs in new major indications and an early-stage pipeline that Mike outlined in his remarks. That's a pretty impressive profile of a company in our industry and that's the kind of company we were trying to build by combining these two companies together. So I think that's how we think about it.","Geoffrey Porges","Great. Thanks very much Rick.","Liz Shea","Thanks, Geoffrey. Operator next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Scala from Cowen.","Steve Scala","Thank you. And let me add my congratulations on another well-executed quarter. I have two questions. First SKYRIZI and RINVOQ are obviously off to great starts and the raised guidance for them in 2020 is impressive. Previously, AbbVie had provided 2025 guidance of $10 billion for these two products. And I'm just wondering, how you are thinking about that number now. And then secondly, the company had given 2020 revenue guidance in 2015 of $37 billion and then in 2017 said that that would be exceeded. I realized that in complicated businesses there are always pushes and pulls. But it appears today's 2020 revenue guidance implies a $36 billion revenue number in 2020. So I'm just curious for the reason for the delta. Thank you very much,","Rick Gonzalez","Well, I mean, if you look at SKYRIZI and RINVOQ obviously they're off to a very strong start, when you look at the $10 billion guidance that we had that still had some level of risk adjustment for the follow-on indications associated with it. And obviously, as we move along then those risk adjustments will come down. Probability of success will go up. So by definition by the way, we look at things you would expect SKYRIZI and RINVOQ to be able to exceed that level of performance assuming all those follow-on indications perform at the level that we would expect. And everything that we know would clearly indicate that that is the case.","We're not in a position where we're going to up the guidance. Now in any complicated business like ours on the $37 billion, obviously, there are things like SKYRIZI and RINVOQ that are ultimately performing better. Certainly, when you look at our hematological oncology business that's performing at a level that we would expect to deliver at least what we had expected back in that point in time probably a little bit higher. Now you also have puts and takes, right?","International biosimilars were more aggressive than we had anticipated. But net-net, I think we're comfortable with that level of performance and more importantly, we're comfortable with being able to deliver the kind of earnings that we would expect. And so I think we feel very good about how the company is performing and our ability to deliver on those long-term expectations.","The other thing I'd say is as you look at the biosim, obviously biosimilars are an important aspect of our particular business. And we're now at a point where we're basically lapping the first year of biosimilar experience in the international markets. And it gives us the ability to be able to look back and say did our strategy work that we had put in place? And I think we've obviously been able to learn from what that strategy has been able to do.","In general, I would tell you that I'm feeling pretty good about how the strategy played out. On the aggressive side, obviously the biosimilar competitors before they entered the market priced more aggressively than we had seen with the analogs. And so the shape of the curve was different which we've talked about a number of different times. Having said that, our strategy was to make sure that we could maintain as much share as possible of HUMIRA and maintain it as profitable as possible and we can now step back and look at what does that look like. Well what it basically looks like is we have maintained about two-thirds of the volume.","If you look specifically at the countries that went biosimilar and you look at what the erosion level is in those countries, it's about 44%, 45% within those countries. So what that means is we've obviously maintained a tail of about 55% of the HUMIRA volume, which is a pretty -- the HUMIRA revenue which is a pretty significant tail when you think about a product of the size of HUMIRA. So I think overall, we feel good about how our strategy played out despite the fact that the biosimilar players were more aggressive.","I think as we look at the U.S., there are some things that we can translate out of that experience. And it gives us some feel for how the U.S. will evolve as we enter that biosimilar phase in 2023. Obviously, we have products like RINVOQ and SKYRIZI that are growing rapidly. We have a number of years to be able to drive that. And we're making very good progress on the follow-on indications. And therefore, we should have a broad set of indications -- approved indications for those assets, which should drive very significant growth leading into that LOE event.","The strategy that we'll put in place is the exact same strategy that we did in the international markets. Our goal is to maintain as much share as we can in as profitable of a way as we can. There is no market exactly like the U.S. market outside the U.S. But what I would say is we would expect it to be competitive like the international markets. We'll have more competitors entering the U.S. market. So I think the shape of the curve will be similar to what we saw in the international markets.","But I'd say as far as our ability to maintain share, we certainly in the U.S. have at least the same competitive position that we have in the international markets and in all likelihood we have a stronger competitive position in the U.S. market. So I would say we would expect to fare at least as well or better from the standpoint of maintaining that tail over time. And so, we're feeling better about where we stand, both the progress that we're making against the assets that will allow us to be able to drive growth over the long-term and the experience we're getting with dealing with biosimilar competition in these markets.","Liz Shea","Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Navin Jacob from UBS.","Navin Jacob","Hello. Thanks for taking my question. A couple on RINVOQ and SKYRIZI. Number one on SKYRIZI wondering what the feedback from physicians and patients are regarding -- I realize it's very early, but regarding average duration of therapy. How should we be thinking about that relative to your experience with HUMIRA? And then on RINVOQ, wondering about the Q4 sales number which came in a little bit lighter relative to how we were thinking about it based on the scripts. Wondering what the dynamic is from a dollar per prescription standpoint, how the couponing and sampling is affecting that.","There's been commentary from Pfizer on Xeljanz pricing that's brought up some questions about pricing in this space. Obviously very early on, but would love any color there. And as a corollary to that, with regards to the differences in the channel mix for RINVOQ versus SKYRIZI, any kind of color there would be appreciated. Particularly as you said that you have very good access in the commercial setting for RINVOQ wondering about the access in the other parts of the channel as well? Thank you so much.","Rick Gonzalez","Okay. So on the first question, this is Rick average duration of therapy. Obviously, SKYRIZI is a quarterly dose product as a loading dose that occurs in the first phase. So we don't have a tremendous amount of experience yet. But I'd say the experience that we have thus far is consistent with what our original launch assumptions would be and that is that the duration of therapy would be very high at HUMIRA levels or above. Obviously, it's more convenient to have quarterly dosing. And so, we're not seeing anything there that is different than what we would have anticipated, albeit it's early on, right?","As far as RINVOQ in the fourth quarter, I'd say RINVOQ is tracking well. It's continuing to gain in-play share. Now it didn't get its significant uptick in market access until January. There was a fairly significant jump from December to January. So there was still a fair amount of prescriptions that were being driven through the -- our access program where we provide patients -- if they don't have access, we provide them with free product through our bridge program.","But now as I mentioned we're over 95%. And our policy is once we've achieved access in an account, we no longer allow bridge access for those products in other words from a compliance standpoint. And so you should start to see those paid prescriptions ramping in line with what we would expect the access to be. SKYRIZI has very similar kinds of access.","As far as the channel mix is concerned, I'm going to have Rob cover that.","Rob Michael","Hi, Navin, it's Rob. So if you think about the difference in the patient profile with RA versus psoriasis, you obviously have an older patient population. So you'd expect RINVOQ to be higher in terms of Medicare Part D. To give you just a range, it's around 20% of the RINVOQ channel mix is Part D whereas at SKYRIZI it's closer to 10%.","Rick Gonzalez","The only other thing I'd mention is the one thing that is very encouraging to us is, if you take SKYRIZI, about half 49% of the patients are na\u00efve patients and the other 51% are obviously second-line and beyond.","If we look at RINVOQ, it's about 40%, 38%, 39% are na\u00efve patients, which at this phase of the launch is higher than what we had originally modeled and the remaining are second-line and beyond.","The other thing I'd say is we, obviously, track how we're doing against various competitors. It's now -- RINVOQ now has an in-play share that's the equivalent of about 70% of XELJANZ and obviously growing at a pretty rapid pace. And so I think that's an encouraging sign as well.","Liz Shea","Thank you, Navin. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn","Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Congrats on the quarter from me as well. One more on the guidance front, when you do give the pro forma guidance post-deal close, I was just wondering if we should expect a new longer term guidance on that front as well?","And then again appreciate all the detail on the pipeline. On the slides you had six proof-of-concept readouts this year. Just wondering of those assets, which do you view as most transformational? Thank you.","Rick Gonzalez","On the pro forma guidance, we haven't made a final decision. Obviously we'll be providing for calendar year 2020. We haven't made a decision whether we'll go out any further than that. So I'd say that's a decision that we'll make as we get closer to the close and ultimately announcing what the combined guidance is.","Mike, do you want to cover number two?","Michael Severino","Sure. So as you mentioned, we have six proof-of-concept readouts this year in our early to mid-stage pipeline. And if I wanted to pick some examples of the most transformational, I think I would point to ABBV-3373 our TNF steroid conjugate.","If you look at the basic biology, the ability to drive -- to deliver this very, very high-potency steroid directly to the activated immune cells that are doing the damage in these diseases really has tremendous potential.","In our pre-clinical work in our model systems, we see results that are really unlike anything we've ever seen with other sorts of agents. And we can deliver that impact in those systems without systemic steroid effects. So if that plays out in the clinic in the same way it has in those model systems that would really be transformational across a wide range of diseases across a range of TNF-mediated diseases like RA, other rheumatologic conditions, inflammatory bowel diseases and many others.","And you could also use that same technology with different targeting warheads to get into areas where there really aren't effective therapies today like lupus for example. So that really has transformational potential.","Maybe I would point to one other program on the onc side. If you look at our work in apoptosis there really is a tremendous opportunity I believe in the future to get into solid tumors with our apoptosis programs. And one program that'll have a readout at least from the mono-therapy component this year is ABBV-155 our B7-H3-targeted xL delivery.","Liz Shea","Thank you, Terence. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Vamil Divan from Mizuho.","Vamil Divan","Hi, great. Thanks for taking my question. I just want a few follow-up on the comments Rick made regarding HUMIRA U.S. erosion and Phase 1 biosimilars that arrive. And I think you said the overall shape of the curve you think will be similar to what we've seen outside the U.S. And I think you also previously mentioned that part of the reason for the Allergan deal was to give you the ability to address the various scenarios of HUMIRA erosion. So I'm just trying to get a sense as you think about the scenarios and how this might evolve in 2023, 2024, do you expect that you'll be continuing to grow sales and earnings right through those years? Or do you think that if it is a somewhat rapid erosion that there might still be a little bit of a decline during that time period?","And then my second question is just around pricing. And it sounds like you've got maybe one or two percentage points of pricing growth for HUMIRA this year. Just wondering is that a reasonable expectation for 2020 for HUMIRA? And also maybe just for the next couple of years, do you think you'll still be able to get a low single-digit amount of price? Thanks.","Rick Gonzalez","Okay, Vamil this is Rick. So I'll take the first question and then Rob will cover the second question for you. We're, obviously, not in a position where we're going to give 2023 guidance at this point. What I was referring to is if you look at consensus today what it shows for HUMIRA is that it basically is a stair-step down over the course of three or four years.","I would say our experience in the international markets by the way multiple biosimilar competitors coming into the market simultaneously created a sharper decline, a deeper decline in year one and then it's pretty much stabilized at that level. Might be some slight erosion after that, but relatively minor or moderate after that.","That when I describe the shape of the curve, I think that's a more reasonable shape of a curve that we would expect in the U.S. market based on the fact that, there'll be probably seven competitors that enter the marketplace in 2023. So as far as growth, it is our obvious objective to make sure that we're in a position that we can grow over the long-term. That's an important objective for us. It's certainly an objective that we have been able to deliver on throughout our history as a company and it's an important objective for us.","Now, that doesn't mean that in 2023, there couldn't be some step-down in 2023 and then return quickly to growth thereafter. But ultimately, as we get closer, I think we can provide more accurate guidance. But I have a high level of confidence that we are building an engine that will allow us to be able to grow through it over a long period of time \u2013 over the longer period of time. Allergan plays an important part of making sure that we can maintain the investment profile that we want to maintain in R&D and SG&A to make sure we have the levels of cash flow to continue to support the dividend and grow the dividend. It plays a very important role in a number of aspects of how we manage the business over the long term. Mike \u2013 or I'm sorry, Rob?","Rob Michael","So, Vamil, it's Rob. So I'll take your question on U.S. HUMIRA. So of the approximate 9% growth we've guided, volume is going to be mid-single digits and price will be low single digits. I think for modeling purposes it's fair to model low single digits going forward. We'll obviously provide that guidance at the appropriate time, but that's the best way to think about it.","Liz Shea","Thank you, Vamil. Operator next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Randall Stanicky from RBC Capital Markets.","Randall Stanicky ","Great. Thanks. Rick, there's been a trend in large biopharma towards divesting legacy products. AbbVie has legacy products you're getting more from Allergan. How are you thinking about potential divestitures from the combined entity? And then just secondly, on ORILISSA, you've talked about the need to build awareness activation. Is that still a $2 billion opportunity? And how are you thinking about the potential to inflect that backup? Thanks.","Rick Gonzalez","Yeah. I mean, every company in our industry for the most part has some level of legacy products. We do as well as others. I think many people want to divest those products, typically, not because those products aren't profitable and provide significant earnings, but because they depress their overall growth, if they're too large, as it relates to their overall base of business.","I would say, as we look at our profile and our ability to be able to grow, we don't believe that that's a significant issue for us. That doesn't mean that at some point in the future, we might not reevaluate, if we thought that was in the best interest of the company overall. But I'd say that's not something that we have any plans for at this point in time.","ORILISSA the point you raised is an accurate point. The challenge that we've had with ORILISSA in endometriosis has been activation of those patients at the rate that we would have expected. We have made some changes in the fourth quarter to our go-to-market strategy. We'll have to see how those play out. And also, we'll have the launch of the uterine fibroid indication in 2020. That's a different patient population. And so I think it will have a different activation profile. And \u2013 but I think we have to see how endometriosis \u2013 whether or not we get an inflection point here that's different than what we've seen thus far before we make any predictions about how we would change the long-term projections. We fundamentally believe this is a good drug. Everything we know about it says, it's a good drug and it ultimately fits an important need. But we're obviously going to have to change that activation curve to get to the level of expectation that we have had for that \u2013 for the drug.","Liz Shea","Thanks, Randall. Operator next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research.","Tim Anderson","Thank you. A couple of questions please. Just to round out the discussion on prior 2025 guidance for certain products and asked about three of them so far. VENCLEXTA and IMBRUVICA maybe you can just talk about how those are trending today relative to those projections. IMBRUVICA seems like it's doing great. But you set really high 2025 guidance, I think of $11.5 billion. And then VENCLEXTA I think you guided for $6 billion. And I think it finished out the year here at $800 million. So, any comments on those two products?","And then a second question just on in the context of FTC being more unpredictable with the brazikumab divestiture, a person could argue for different reasons the FTC might raise an eyebrow about Astra taking back an asset that they got rid of originally. I think back then it wasn't core to their business. And frankly, when you look at Astra and what they concentrate in now it's hard to see where it fits. So FTC could potentially question whether Astra is really a committed competitive developer of that asset. Just wondering, if you can share your thoughts on that? Thank you.","Rick Gonzalez","Sure. As far as VENCLEXTA and IMBRUVICA are concerned in the long-term guidance, we feel very comfortable with our long-term guidance for those two assets. If you look at this year for VENCLEXTA, it will be an important inflection year for VENCLEXTA. And we would expect it to continue to grow quite nicely over time. Obviously, the multiple myeloma and t(11;14) is a significant opportunity for VENCLEXTA. I think that represents roughly 20% of the myeloma patients and myeloma is obviously a very big market. So we feel good about that.","As far as the FTC is concerned, the way this process normally works is you bring in the players that you're considering to acquire a product which we and Allergan did. And so the FTC has had an opportunity to interact with both of the players and give us feedback around those players. So I think you can conclude from that that, we wouldn't move forward with a player that the FTC told us they were uncomfortable with.","Tim Anderson","Thank you.","Liz Shea","Thanks, Tim. Operator next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Baum from Citi.","Andrew Baum","Thank you. Just in the psoriasis segment, you run a very impressive trial versus the leading IL-17, seemingly taking away all their key selling points, both in terms of depth as well as speed of onset of response. To what extent do you think you're going to accelerate eating into the IL-17 segment by leveraging that trial in the psoriasis setting?","And then secondly, back on CLL, could you just talk to how you see the near-term competitive risk from the introduction of Calquence among patients who are struggling with IMBRUVICA tolerance. I realize, it's only a minority of those patients as they tolerate the first year of therapy, but whether we're going to see any patient shift across as it comes to market. And then second, longer term, now that you have the covalent -- the non-covalent inhibitors coming on to the scene with ArQule Lilly and others. Thank you.","Rick Gonzalez","So, Mike, why don't you cover one and three and then I'll come back and cover the Calquence question?","Michael Severino","Sure. This is Mike. With respect to the head-to-head data we just released in the last several weeks against COSENTYX, really was a very strong result. And what I would say is, it highlights a number of the things that we said. One, we drive very, very high levels of response. That response is very durable over time.","Although, all the data haven't been presented, they will be at an upcoming medical meeting. We said that we hit across all of the ranked secondary end points, so there's very sort of broad-based results. And we had very good data at 16 weeks, as you said. So we think that that's going to continue to drive the momentum of SKYRIZI into this space.","Now, having said that, SKYRIZI is already performing extremely well and we would expect that to continue. So with the -- for your third question on the competitive space for BTK inhibitors, we feel very, very good about the package of data that we have delivered around IMBRUVICA.","It's very broad. We have five large-scale randomized readouts. We have a robust survival benefit. And that's a data advantage that's very hard to overcome. If you look at the launch of some of the follow-on covalent BTK inhibitors, our data package still is the broadest and we believe is the strongest in terms of showing the overall benefits.","And the points of differentiation that folks had talked about in the past haven't really materialized. So we feel good about our competitive position there. They'll take some share, as you've seen in MCL, but it's nothing that would change our ability to grow IMBRUVICA.","With respect to the non-covalent inhibitors, I think, the place for those is less clear. As I've said, we have many large-scale Phase 3 data readouts, including survival benefits. So until those molecules really have an equivalent data set, it's going to be very, very difficult for them to compete in the space where IMBRUVICA plays.","Now there are a small number of patients who have cysteine mutations that lose response to covalent BTK inhibitors because of that. One might expect a non-covalent inhibitor to work there. But that's really a much smaller opportunity and that follows the use of the covalent inhibitors. And we would say, in that space, that VENCLEXTA-based regimens are probably the best option and certainly have the most data today.","Rick Gonzalez","And then, to your second question, as it relates to whether or not we'll see patients being moved off of IMBRUVICA and on to Calquence based on side-effect profiles. We don't believe that will be the case. I mean, I think, as Mike pointed out, when you look at the body of data around IMBRUVICA and particularly the survival benefit that we see with IMBRUVICA, physicians are reluctant to move a patient off of a drug that gives them the opportunity to be able to have that level of survival benefit to something that has less data to be able to support that. The guidelines reflect that as well.","And most physicians know that when they have a side-effect profile that they're having difficulty managing through, that they routinely -- prior to Calquence being on the market, what they would typically do is, take the patient off of therapy for a short period of time until it resolves and then put them back on therapy. And many patients would ultimately be fine when they were put back on therapy.","So moving to another non-differentiated products, we don't think will have a fundamental impact. We're obviously watching the share data. It's early on because the latest share data that we have is still November. And as you know they were approved in November. Now they were on guidelines for most of 2019 in CLL but the share is very low. They have about 1% share in first-line, 2% share in second-line, about 6% share in third-line but most of those patients in third-line about half of them are BTK failures IMBRUVICA failures. So thus far, we don't see anything that would suggest that it's having a significant negative impact on our performance.","Liz Shea","Thank you, Andrew. Operator, we have time for one final question.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today is from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger","Thanks very much and I wanted to add my congrats as well. I have two questions for you Rick and the team. So with respect to looking at analogs, branded ex U.S. REMICADE has stairstepped down 30% annually over the past five years since biosimilars first launched and the 2019 sales were less than 20% of the 2014 sales. So could you discuss the considerations for AbbVie when your team has evaluated it as a potential analog for HUMIRA-declined prospects? And then second with respect to ORILISSA, could you discuss efforts to change the mindset of younger women who may be hesitant to take hormonal therapies? Thank you.","Rick Gonzalez","Yes. So David this is Rick for your first question. Yes I think the difference between REMICADE and Enbrel as well actually and the experience that we had with HUMIRA was in most of those cases only one or two competitors came in at a time. And so what you're seeing is essentially the way we had originally modeled, HUMIRA was that at year three, we would get to the levels that we're at now because it would stairstep down, but I think what we learned in that process is when four competitors entered the market at one time that the competitive dynamics between them to try to get share, created an environment where they became far more aggressive early on.","So I don't think the curve will look as \u2013 it won't look as if the same as REMICADE. Now that doesn't mean that over time, we won't see some moderate continued erosion. But it's \u2013 for a business of our size and with the growth prospects of our business that's not something that would inhibit our ability to be able to grow.","I think you can see we grew through \u2013 we ultimately had positive revenue growth in 2019 despite the fact that we had a very significant portion of our international business go biosimilar in 2019.","The second question is part of the activity that we're working on now to try to drive activation at a faster rate in women on ORILISSA that is one component. I wouldn't say it's the most significant component but it is one component: to better educate women on what this therapy is all about, what the side-effect profile of this therapy really looks like, the safety profile of it; and make sure that we do that in a way that it's easily accessible for women in that age group, meaning it has a social media aspect to it that allows them to be able to access accurate information about ORILISSA and the benefits of it and the appropriate use of it. And so that is part of the changes that we made in the fourth quarter. And we're just going to have to see how those changes \u2013 the impact those changes have over time.","Liz Shea","Thank you, David. That concludes today's conference call.

All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer portion of this call.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Larry Peepo, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Severino, Executive Vice President of Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer; and Bill Chase, Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Henry Gosebruch, our Chief Strategy Officer, will be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call.","In addition to our earnings release this morning, we have also issued a press release announcing our acquisition of Stemcentrx. You can find a set of slides on our website that provide an overview of the transaction.","Before we get started, I remind you that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions.","So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick.","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, I'll discuss our first quarter performance and provide an overview of the Stemcentrx acquisition, which we announced earlier today. Mike will provide updates on recent advancements across our R&D programs, and Bill will discuss the quarter and our 2016 guidance in more detail, including the financial aspects of Stemcentrx' transaction. And as always, following our remarks, we'll take your questions.","We delivered another strong quarterly performance, including adjusted earnings per share of $1.15, representing growth of more than 22% versus the first quarter of 2015. Our results included strong operational sales growth of 22.4% driven by a number of products across our portfolio. This includes HUMIRA global operational growth of more than 19%, strong growth from IMBRUVICA, continued global uptake of VIEKIRA, and strong performance from several other products in our portfolio, including CREON and DUODOPA.","We also continued to deliver improvements in our operating margin profile. In addition to our strong financial results, we also advanced several of our key strategic priorities. Late in the quarter, we secured FDA approval for IMBRUVICA as a first-line treatment for patients with CLL. We're roughly one month into our first-line launch, and we're pleased with our progress to-date. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network, or NCCN, recently published an updated view of its guidelines, granting IMBRUVICA a category 1 recommendation for certain CLL patients, the highest recommendation assigned by the organization.","We are also approaching the one-year mark for Pharmacyclics, and we continue to be very pleased with the progress we've made to-date. The Pharmacyclics team continues to rapidly advance trial activity, exploring IMBRUVICA across a broad range of tumor types. IMBRUVICA offers significant growth potential through its expanding list of indications and lines of therapy, and we remain excited about the vast potential for this unique asset.","Earlier this month, we received FDA approval for another transformative therapy for the treatment of CLL. Venclexta, our novel BCL-2 inhibitor, was approved for patients with relapsed\/refractory CLL who harbor the 17p deletion, a difficult to treat form of the disease typically associated with poor prognosis. Based on the level of efficacy in this patient population, the FDA granted the approval under its Breakthrough Therapy and Priority Review designations.","Since the beginning of the year, we've also reported compelling data from several development programs, including positive top-line results from our second pivotal Elagolix trial in endometriosis and strong data from our next-generation HCV program. Mike will provide updates on both programs during his remarks in just a few moments.","We also augmented our pipeline with a late-stage asset with a global collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim to develop and commercialize an anti-IL-23 currently in Phase 3 development for psoriasis and mid-stage development for several additional indications. The agreement provides AbbVie with another potential best-in-class late-stage asset adding to our immunology pipeline, which includes our selective JAK1 inhibitor, ABT-494, currently in Phase 3 development for RA as well as several other biologics that are in mid-stage trials. Based on its potential for best-in-class efficacy, we believe the BI asset could generate multibillion dollars in peak year revenues across several immune-mediated diseases.","Clearly, the most notable and exciting news today is our planned acquisition of Stemcentrx. We could not be more pleased to have this talented group of individuals join our organization. We have been tremendously impressed with their accomplishments to-date, and their innovation and expertise will drive strong benefits for AbbVie going forward.","The addition of Stemcentrx is a strategically compelling opportunity for our company, our shareholders and the patients which we serve. Over the past several years, we've taken a number of steps to build and strengthen our position in oncology research and development with the objective of becoming a leading oncology company. We've advanced numerous promising pipeline assets, including our BCL-2 inhibitor for blood cancers and our PARP inhibitor, an anti-EGFR antibody drug conjugate in development for solid tumors.","We've strengthened our discovery efforts through collaborations with leading academic and other institutions around the world. We've added top talent to our R&D organization. Last year, through the acquisition of Pharmacyclics, we obtained IMBRUVICA, a first in class BTK inhibitor which has already achieved blockbuster status and is on a trajectory to achieve multibillion dollar peak-year sales. And as I mentioned earlier, we just launched our internally developed Venclexta, which adds another transformational therapy to our hematological oncology franchise.","We view oncology as a significant pillar of growth for AbbVie going forward. And as we evaluate all opportunities, we do so with the desire to balance near-term performance while continuing to build a portfolio of assets that will generate strong growth in 2020 and beyond, supporting our commitment to drive top-tier performance over the long term.","So that brings me to our announcement today, the acquisition of Stemcentrx, which gives AbbVie a highly attractive platform for solid tumors and an extremely exciting late-stage asset in Rova-T. The transaction enables AbbVie to further expand and accelerate our presence in oncology, building upon our growing position in hematological oncology.","Stemcentrx' proprietary solid tumor platform leverages cancer stem cell biology to identify and validate novel therapeutic targets. The company has demonstrated a track record of successfully engineering and manufacturing antibodies and antibody drug conjugates for those targets.","Stemcentrx' lead asset is Rova-T, a DLL3 targeted antibody drug conjugate. DLL3 is a novel target expressed in several tumor types, including small cell lung cancer, an aggressive and difficult to treat disease. Small cell lung cancer accounts for roughly 15% of all lung cancers, and more than 60,000 patients are diagnosed annually in the major developed markets.","DLL3 is the first predictive biomarker associated with drug efficacy in small cell lung cancer. It is highly expressed in a majority of small cell lung cancer tumors as well as cancer stem cells, and is not expressed in normal tissue. Predictive biomarkers help identify which patients have the potential to benefit from a therapy.","Rova-T is currently in registrational trials for third-line small cell lung cancer. There's a significant unmet need for this patient population as the treatment landscape has not changed for several decades. In fact, there is currently only one approved treatment for second-line small cell lung cancer and no approved agents for third-line use. The five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with this type of cancer is unfortunately very low at approximately 6%.","Last year at the European Society of (sic) [for] (10:49) Medical Oncology Meeting, Stemcentrx presented exciting Phase 2 results in small cell lung cancer, including data that illustrated an overall response rate of 44% in a DLL3 biomarker-defined population. Rova-T also demonstrated a clinical benefit rate of 78% in this refractory and difficult-to-treat set of patients. Response rates were similar in third-line and second-line patients with a manageable safety profile. These landmark data represent the first time a biomarker targeted therapy has shown significant efficacy in small cell lung cancer.","Additional data from a broader set of patients and longer-term follow-up, including compelling overall survival results, will be disclosed during an oral session at the upcoming ASCO meeting in June where the abstract has been selected as a Best of ASCO presentation, a distinction only 1% of abstracts receive.","Given the very promising efficacy in third-line small cell lung cancer, Stemcentrx recently filed for FDA Breakthrough designation for this setting. Based on the compelling data and the significant unmet need in this patient population, we're certainly hopeful that we will be successful in obtaining this status.","Stemcentrx has moved rapidly through clinical development in third-line small cell lung cancer, from the initiation of the first in-human trials to the recent start of the registration-enabling study. Based on the expected completion of the ongoing registrational trial, commercialization of this indication is expected in 2018. Stemcentrx is also moving to rapidly advance into front-line small cell lung cancer. Mike will provide more detail on the planned first-line program in just a few moments.","Like HUMIRA and IMBRUVICA, we believe Rova-T has the potential applicability across a broad range of indications and tumors. In addition to small cell lung cancer, expression of DLL3 indicates Rova-T may be useful across multiple solid tumor types, including metastatic melanoma, glioblastoma multiforme, as well as some prostate, pancreatic and colorectal cancers, among others. There is a significant subset of patients whose tumors are positive for DLL3 expression within this broader set of tumors, representing more than 65,000 patients treated annually. We plan to evaluate Rova-T across numerous indications, leveraging our R&D infrastructure and global clinical trial organization to move rapidly and efficiently.","The acquisition of Stemcentrx also broadens AbbVie's oncology pipeline with a portfolio of earlier-stage candidates focused on novel oncology targets. In addition to Rova-T, the Stemcentrx pipeline includes four clinical candidates being evaluated in trials across a range of solid tumors, as well as two additional INDs for new targets planned for 2016 and a broad portfolio of validated pre-clinical targets.","Stemcentrx also enhances AbbVie's oncology discovery capabilities. The technology platform that identified Rova-T and the other assets in the Stemcentrx pipeline has strong potential for continued asset generation and will strengthen AbbVie's discovery and development efforts in solid tumors going forward.","So as we summarize the transaction, the addition of Stemcentrx is strategically compelling. The acquisition is highly complementary with our growing hematologic oncology franchise and existing portfolio of solid tumor assets. The lead asset, Rova-T, represents a multibillion-dollar peak revenue opportunity with revenue potentially approaching $5 billion as we advance into first-line small cell lung cancer and other indications. Rova-T has the potential to have a dramatic impact on our growth over the long term.","Additionally, Stemcentrx' existing pipeline of additional assets in their R&D engine will augment our future development efforts in solid tumors. Stemcentrx adds to AbbVie's long-term growth prospects, providing another compelling growth platform that will further diversify our revenue base beginning in 2018 and will enhance our EPS growth starting in 2020 and beyond.","Stemcentrx fits well within our overall strategy. We have now assembled a significant number of late-stage assets which have been significantly de-risked, have multibillion dollar potential and the potential to drive sustainable growth in 2020 and beyond. Assets including IMBRUVICA, Venclexta, ABT-494, ZINBRYTA, Elagolix, the next-generation HCV combination, our recently in-licensed anti-IL-23, and now Rova-T. All of these assets have a high probability of regulatory and commercial success.","In closing, we continue to be pleased with our strong execution and strategic advancement. We continue to demonstrate an exceptional track record of success with positive clinical data and regulatory outcomes, and we look forward to additional important pipeline milestones in the year ahead. We're off to a strong start this year, and we intend to build upon our momentum to drive a high level of performance across our operations and deliver strong growth in 2016. And we remain committed to delivering on the long-term objectives that we outlined last year.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?","Michael E. Severino - Executive Vice President, Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer","Thank you, Rick. We had a very productive first quarter from an R&D perspective, with a number of important data readouts, Phase transitions and regulatory approvals, as well as licensing activity. This morning, I'll provide color on some of the key highlights.","I'll start by saying that I certainly share Rick's enthusiasm for Stemcentrx, which brings us a promising late-stage program with Rova-T, a pipeline of earlier-stage candidates and a platform technology that will enhance our future solid tumor discovery and development efforts.","We very much enjoyed our dialogue with the Stemcentrx team as we've gotten to know them over the past several months, and we've been impressed with the individuals and the innovative platform they've built. Stemcentrx has established an impressive track record. The company's first three clinical stage drugs each represent novel targets with single agent activity demonstrated in the early phase trials in small cell lung cancer, triple negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer, all difficult-to-treat solid tumor indications.","Stemcentrx's highly productive discovery effort is driven by the company's core technology, which utilizes a library of more than 700 patient-derived tumor xenograft models and leverages cancer stem cell biology to identify and validate therapeutic targets that would be overlooked by other methods. This platform has yielded impressive results to-date, and we are excited about the potential for continued asset generation, which will aid AbbVie in our R&D efforts going forward.","The company's lead asset, Rova-T, represents a significant opportunity not only through its lead indication third-line small cell lung cancer, but also through the potential for expansion into the front-line setting, as well as other types of cancer where DLL3 plays an important role.","Stemcentrx has a broad development program for Rova-T currently underway. We've been impressed with the speed with which Stemcentrx has moved through the clinic. It's been roughly four-and-a-half years since target identification and less than three years between filing the Rova-T IND to the initiation of the registration study in third-line small cell lung cancer.","The confirmatory third-line trial, which is called TRINITY, began in January and is expected to complete enrollment by the end of 2016, with commercialization expected in 2018. We view the Rova-T small cell lung cancer program as significantly de-risked with a high profitability of success. In addition to the overall response data presented at ESMO last year, which showed an overall response rate of 44% in DLL3 positive patients, the profile of Rova-T is supported by longer-term data, some of which will be presented at the upcoming ASCO meeting. These updated data include promising overall survival findings that compare favorably to historical controls. We believe the full body of data generated to-date are highly compelling and strongly support the value proposition of Rova-T.","Stemcentrx is also moving rapidly into front-line small cell lung cancer with Rova-T. The company is on the cusp of initiating a study designed to select the optimal regimen for the front-line registrational program. This four-arm trial will evaluate several permutations of Rova-T and standard-of-care chemotherapy, including both monotherapy and combination arms. Given the compelling data we've seen in small cell lung cancer to-date, we believe there is a high likelihood of successfully moving into earlier lines of therapy.","Stemcentrx is also evaluating an eight-arm 400 patient basket study, which will look at Rova-T as monotherapy in patients with a range of tumor types that share neuroendocrine features, including malignant melanoma, medullary thyroid cancer, glioblastoma, large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, and forms of prostate cancer and other solid tumors. This study is on track to start enrolling patients this quarter. Additional first-line studies are planned, including a Phase 1 study to assess the safety of Rova-T in combination with antibody therapy targeting the PD-1\/PD-L1 axis, which is on track to be initiated during the second half of 2016.","Clearly, prior to the Stemcentrx acquisition, AbbVie was already focused on establishing a strong position in oncology. Since the company was established in 2013, we've added 10 new oncology assets through internal advancement or partnership efforts. The Stemcentrx acquisition accelerates our objective of becoming a leading oncology company. We look forward to spending more time discussing Stemcentrx, including their pipeline, at our upcoming R&D Day in June.","In addition to the Stemcentrx acquisition, last week we also announced two early-stage oncology collaborations, including an agreement with argenx for a novel immuno-oncology target, GARP, and an agreement with CytomX to develop Probody drug conjugates, a platform which provides another differentiated opportunity to combine with our strength in antibody drug conjugates.","Beyond oncology, as Rick noted, we also recently entered into a global agreement with BI to develop and commercialize risankizumab, an anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody in Phase 3 development for psoriasis, and mid-stage development for several additional indications. The collaboration positions this promising asset as AbbVie's lead investigational compound in psoriasis, and complements our robust immunology pipeline.","Recent Phase 2 study results for risankizumab in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis showed improved efficacy over STELARA, a commonly used treatment for this life-impacting skin condition that was included in the study as an active comparator. Specifically, the strong head-to-head results showed that at 12 weeks 81% of patients treated with 180mg of the BI compound achieved PASI 90, more than double the rate achieved by patients treated with STELARA. And 50% of the patients treated with the BI compound achieved complete skin clearance, or PASI 100, versus just 17.5% of the STELARA-treated patients. We're pleased with this level of efficacy as our immunology development strategy is centered upon identifying treatments that offer differentiated profiles relative to currently available therapies with the goal of continuing to raise the standard of care. Beyond the impressive efficacy, this asset also has the potential to offer a favorable dosing profile with subcutaneous quarterly administration.","The BI compound is also currently in Phase 2 development for psoriatic arthritis in Crohn's disease, with plans to initiate a Phase 2b study in psoriatic arthritis in mid-2016 and the potential to transition into Phase 3 development in Crohn's disease next year. We will present mid-stage Crohn's disease induction data at the upcoming Digestive Disease Week, or DDW, meeting next month.","We've also disclosed positive results for several late-stage programs, including, most recently, additional data on our next-generation HCV regimen. Earlier this month at The International Liver Congress in Barcelona, we presented data on our pan-genotypic, once-daily, ribavirin-free combination of ABT-493 and ABT-530 in patients with genotypes 1 through 6, including data on treatment durations as short as eight weeks. The data illustrate that with eight weeks of treatment, 97% to 98% of genotype 1 through 3 patients without cirrhosis achieve sustained virologic response at 12 weeks post-treatment. Additionally, 100% of genotype 4 through 6 patients without cirrhosis achieved SVR12 with 12 weeks of treatment. We also presented late-breaking data showing our next generation combination drove 100% SVR12 with 12 weeks of treatment without ribavirin in treatment na\u00efve genotype 3 patients with compensated cirrhosis.","While recent advancements in HCV treatment have resulted in high cure rates for many patients, there remain distinct areas of unmet need, including patients with genotype 3. These new data illustrate the potential of our next-generation combination to address this need.","Another area of unmet need is patients who have failed previous therapy with direct-acting antivirals, or DAAs, as retreatment options for these patients are limited. We presented data showing that 95% of genotype 1 patients who failed previous therapy with DAAs achieved SVR12 with 12 weeks of therapy without the need for ribavirin.","The mid-stage data we've disclosed to-date indicates that our new HCV combination can deliver cure rates approaching 100%, and we believe the majority of patients will be well served with an eight-week treatment option. We expect to see results from the pivotal studies in the second half of this year and we remain on track for commercialization next year.","We also announced positive top-line results from the second of two replicate pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of Elagolix in pre-menopausal women who suffer pain from endometriosis. Trial results showed that after six months of continuous treatment, both doses of Elagolix met the study's co-primary endpoints with Elagolix reducing scores of menstrual pain and non-menstrual pelvic pain at month 3 and month 6. We intend to present detailed results from both Phase 3 trials at a medical conference later this year, and we will complete the clinical database in anticipation of a New Drug Application submission for endometriosis in 2017.","We also continue to advance the Elagolix development program in uterine fibroids. During the quarter, we initiated a Phase 3 program investigating the effect of Elagolix on heavy bleeding related to this highly prevalent condition.","As Rick noted, we received two important approvals within our hematologic oncology portfolio as well. The expansion of the IMBRUVICA label into first-line use for CLL and the initial approval of our novel BCL-2 inhibitor, Venclexta. With IMBRUVICA and Venclexta, we now have two therapies on the market for the treatment of CLL addressing a range of patient types.","We continue to advance our development efforts for IMBRUVICA, Venclexta and several other assets in our oncology pipeline. We'll present data across a wide range of studies at the upcoming ASCO meeting. We've built a strategic portfolio of oncology assets, including multiple mechanisms of action, that have significant potential alone and in combination.","So in summary, we continue to make significant progress with our pipeline and are on track for further advancements in 2016. We have a broad pipeline that includes more than 50 active clinical assets, including more than 20 new products or indications in late stage development or under regulatory review. We look forward to covering our full pipeline in more detail at our R&D Pipeline Review to be held in Chicago on June 3. We hope you will join us.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on our first quarter performance. Bill?","William J. Chase - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Mike. As Rick said, we are very pleased with the strong quarter we delivered. Net revenues were up 22.4%, operationally, and we expanded our adjusted operating margin profile by 300 basis points to 43.1% of sales. We reported adjusted earnings per share results of $1.15, up 22.3% over the first quarter of 2015. Strong operational revenue growth in the quarter was in line with our guidance for growth of just above 20%. Foreign exchange had a negative 4.2% impact on revenue in the quarter, also in line with our guidance of roughly 4% negative exchange.","We continue to see strong momentum from HUMIRA, which delivered global sales of more than $3.5 billion, up 19.2%, operationally, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. In the U.S., HUMIRA sales were nearly $2.2 billion, reflecting exceptional growth across all three major categories: rheumatology, gastro, and derm. Internationally, HUMIRA sales were nearly $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 4.6% on an operational basis, excluding an unfavorable impact from exchange. This exceeded our previous forecast of 3% operational growth. Currency reduced reported international HUMIRA sales by 9.2%. While early in the launch, the Enbrel biosimilar is tracking in line or favorable to what we had modeled.","Global IMBRUVICA net revenues were $381 million in the quarter. U.S. sales were $325 million, and our international profit sharing was $56 million.","Global VIEKIRA sales in the quarter were $414 million. The launch of Viekirax, our two-drug, once-daily, ribavirin-free combination for patients with HCV genotype 1b is underway in Japan leading to a continued higher mix of international sales on the quarter.","Global sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease, grew 36.7% on an operational basis in the quarter. We saw continued double-digit growth internationally for Duodopa with a modest level of U.S. sales, as expected.","Global Creon sales were $150 million, up 18.2% operationally. Creon continues to maintain its leadership position in the pancreatic enzyme market with the majority of the market share.","The adjusted gross margin ratio was 81.3% of sales in the first quarter, which was impacted by the Pharmacyclics transaction and year-over-year impacts of foreign exchange. Excluding these impacts, the ratio was up over 200 basis points.","As I mentioned earlier, we continue to show improvement in our adjusted operating margin profile, which increased to 43.1% of sales, up 300 basis points. Excluding the impacts of Pharmacyclics and foreign exchange, operating margin improved over 600 basis points versus the prior-year quarter. The majority of this improvement was driven by efficiencies and our rapidly growing top line.","Adjusted R&D was 15.6% of sales, reflecting funding actions in support of our pipeline assets. Adjusted SG&A was 22.6% of sales in the first quarter, down significantly from the prior year on a profile basis, contributing to continued improvement in operating margin leverage.","Adjusted net interest expense was $200 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 20.7% in the quarter. First quarter adjusted earnings per share, excluding non-cash and tangible amortization expense and specified items, were $1.15, up 22.3% year-over-year.","During the quarter, as a result of the economic conditions in Venezuela and the lack of availability of U.S. dollars at the government's official exchange rate, we changed the exchange rate we use in Venezuela to the floating DICOM rate. This resulted in a charge of $298 million related to a devaluation of our net monetary assets in Venezuela. This will also impact revenue booked for products sold in Venezuela.","I would like to now walk you through the financial aspects of the Stemcentrx transaction. We are acquiring Stemcentrx for $5.8 billion, with the consideration to be paid out as $3.8 billion in equity and $2 billion in cash. The use of equity in this transaction reflects Stemcentrx' management and board of directors' desire to retain a stake in the asset, as well as achieve a tax-deferred structure. Upon closing, we plan to execute an accelerated share repurchase program to reacquire all of the newly-issued equity.","We anticipate the transaction to close late in the second quarter. We are forecasting $0.20 of dilution in 2016 as a result of the transaction, which represents a half year of R&D operating and interest expense. We plan to provide specifics on Stemcentrx's impact on our P&L profile during the second quarter earnings call in July. We expect the transaction to generate positive operating margin beginning in 2019 and EPS accretion starting in 2020.","Given these facts, we are updating our 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $4.62 to $4.82 to reflect the Stemcentrx transaction. This range reflects EPS growth of 10% at the midpoint and includes the previously-communicated $0.08 dilutive impact of the BI collaboration announced last month. It excludes $0.75 of intangible amortization and specified costs. Specified items related to the Stemcentrx acquisition will be quantified and included on our second quarter call.","Regarding the second quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $1.19 to $1.21. This excludes roughly $0.18 of specified items and noncash amortization and includes the BI and Stemcentrx dilution impacts.","We are expecting mid-teens operational sales growth, excluding a roughly 2% negative foreign exchange impact on the quarter. As a result, we are expecting low-teens sales growth on a reported basis. We are forecasting 3% operational growth for International HUMIRA in the second quarter. Excluding Venezuela, this growth would have exceeded 5%.","We currently expect a negative 4% currency impact on International HUMIRA in the second quarter, resulting in a modest decline year-over-year on a reported basis. However, we remain on track with our previously communicated full-year guidance for HUMIRA outside the U.S., including the mid-single-digit operational growth expected internationally.","So in conclusion, we are very pleased with our performance in the quarter as we've driven strong top and bottom line growth and delivered operating margin expansion, while also advancing on our strategic priorities. This puts us in a strong position to continue delivering industry-leading growth this year.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry.","Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Bill, and we'll open the call for questions, now. Jay, we'll take our first question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now being the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Jeff Holford from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC","Good morning, everybody, and thanks very much for taking my questions. So, just for Stemcentrx, just because it's a company we all don't know so well, can you just help us a little bit more on the valuation? Was it primary driven by the last financing round that you cite or other things in terms of peak sales expectations of visible assets that's driving that? Secondly, also, just on that transaction, how much data beyond what's been publicly disclosed, i.e. some of the data perhaps that's coming to ASCO, was management able to see before agreeing to this deal?","And then, my last question is just around the upcoming IPR decisions. Can you just confirm timing and expectations there, 18th of May, and do you expect these decisions to be consolidated? And then, just secondly to that, there's a patent adjustment out there that potentially takes the 135 patent out to 2028. If and when that's granted, which seems to be procedural, will you extend your HUMIRA exclusivity guidance on the back of that? Thank you very much.","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Hi, Jeff, it's Rick. So, I'll take, I guess, all of those questions. So, as it relates to the valuation, I would say it had nothing to do with what their prior round valuation was. That's not how we do acquisitions. Essentially, how we do acquisitions, and you probably recall this from the Pharmacyclics discussion that we had, and I think it's typical within our industry how it's done, is you build a model that ultimately projects out what you think the company and assets can do.","And then, off of that model you determine what the return would look like at various price points, what the NPV would look like and, ultimately, you have a threshold at which \u2013 the way we do it is we have a threshold at which we say we won't go above. And then, we get into the process and ultimately try to validate those assumptions and make a decision as to whether or not we want to go forward. And if we want to go forward, then we'll obviously negotiate as hard as we can to try to get it at the lowest possible price, but most of these are a competitive kind of situation.","So what I would tell you about this transaction is that I believe it is at a very good valuation for us. It has a good NPV based on the base case, which was essentially on second- and third-line small cell lung cancer and a couple of other indications, and it has significant upside if we move to first-line or more broadly across those cancers that are DLL3 positive. Now, those trials are ongoing, so we don't have that data; so we didn't necessarily build all of those in. If that were to occur, you probably saw there's a CDR for first-line that the investors would receive. But I would tell you first-line will have a very, very strong NPV above and beyond what we factored in here. But with the base case, this has a very good NPV and a very good IRR. So I can just tell you I feel good about the valuation.","As far as the data is concerned, we have seen a significant amount of data above and beyond what is public now. We obviously need to be careful about what we talk about, because some of that data will be presented at the ASCO meeting. I think we've given you a pretty good idea of what you're likely to see at the ASCO meeting, but I can tell you that we have seen all the data that was available to the management team and we're impressed with that data.","So I can tell you I'm very, very excited. We've looked for quite some time, now, for a solid tumor platform play, and they're hard to find in this market. And I think if you look at the productivity of this group and the novel therapeutic targets that they have been able to come up with, and their hit rate on those targets is significantly above industry average, and the way they approach it is pretty impressive, and the fact that this is focusing to a great extent on cancer stem cell. And I think there's a strong belief that if you can knock out in certain cancer stem cells, you can dramatically impact the course of that disease for those patients. And I think the data will speak for itself when it's available, and you can take a look at it.","So we're impressed with this. I think \u2013 we think Rova-T is a very good asset and gives us a good strong position in solid tumors going forward.","On the IPRs, as we've said before, we're not going to talk a lot about the process now that we're in litigation. I can answer maybe one or two of these questions. We don't have the ability to predict the timing. You have the date correct, that you described. So it should occur sometime no later than that date. We don't know whether they'll be consolidated or not. And we're not going to comment on the issuance of the patent and what we would do in that scenario. Okay?","Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC","Thanks very much, and congratulations on the deal.","Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations","Yeah. Thanks, Jeff. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much. Just a couple on the deal today. Maybe first, can you just talk about the competitive landscape for the DLL3 target or just other companies working on cancer or stem cells as an ADC target? Second question was on the $0.20 of dilution this year. I'm just trying to get a sense of what this is going to look like out in 2017. Should we be thinking about something larger than $0.40 as we get the full year impact and as you ramp R&D associated with these assets?","And then, the final one was just, post this deal, can you just give us some sense of the position the company is to pursue larger transactions if the right opportunity were out there? Should we think about Stemcentrx is the type of size and profile you're looking for? Or could you look to get more aggressive as the year kind of \u2013 or as we go to 2017 if the right deal is out there? Thanks so much.","Michael E. Severino - Executive Vice President, Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer","So, this is Mike. I'll take the first question with respect to the competitive environment for Rova-T and some of the other programs that Stemcentrx has been working on. And what I'll say is that one of the things that really impressed us with Stemcentrx is the novelty of their platform. They've invested early in this technology. They have developed great expertise. And they are out in the lead in all of the areas that they're pursuing.","So DLL3 is out in the lead. It's demonstrated very compelling results, and we think it's an asset that has tremendous promise and will really change the standard of care. And I think if you look at all of the programs that Stemcentrx is advancing, there's a high degree of novelty and very strong signs of activity from the first three clinical programs. So, we vary \u2013 we feel very good about their position in the competitive environment.","William J. Chase - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So on the dilution, as we've said, the $0.20 this year represents roughly a half year of the current burn rate that Stemcentrx is showing as well as the additional financing costs. I think 2017, we need to get in and look at the clinical programs, but obviously we are going to invest appropriately on Rova-T and the other assets in order to maximize the value of the asset.","What's nice about this transaction, though, is in 2018 we're going to be bringing a product to market. And we think, given the clinical data that has been shown so far, we're going to have a fairly impressive uptake on Rova-T. And that will offset that dilution pretty quickly. And in 2020, we see the deal being accretive.","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Chris, this is Rick. The only thing I'd add on the \u2013 I know what you're trying to do. You're obviously trying to model \u2013 or incorporate into your model what the R&D impact will be on 2017. I think that's what you're trying to do, based on your question. And I'd say, as we factored in this number and as we look at 2017, it certainly incorporates the assumptions that we've made around the expansion into other tumors that are DLL3 positive. It incorporates what Mike described as the first-line trials that ultimately they're pursuing with Rova-T.","The one part that it probably does not include at this point, and we just need to work on it some more, would be we also believe that this could be a synergistic strategy in first-line with immunotherapy. And they have walked us through a plan where, potentially, as an example, Rova-T could be a highly specific debulking agent on the front end for DLL3 positive patients in small cell; and knocking out the stem cells in the process, which traditional chemotherapy does not do today. And then, you would get the disease under control and debulked and you would follow it with immunotherapy for longer-term maintenance. And so, they've laid out some plans around that, and that has not been incorporated to this point. So that would be the only thing.","Now, we obviously have a significant R&D budget and we would look at how we normally do R&D \u2013 is we add everything up, and then we make a decision where we draw the line, and we're going to be conscious of that. So I'm not telling you that would be incremental, but what I'm telling you is that's the one thing that's outside the scope of what's in the current R&D planning assumptions. So, hopefully that gives you some clarity around that.","On the M&A front, similar to the comments that I made earlier, we have been looking for a solid tumor platform. I think we made that somewhat clear that that was something we were interested in doing. I would say this came in at a valuation that was significantly below the numbers that we had flagged before. But we are looking to balance near-term performance against making sure that we build a significant portfolio of assets out in that 2020 and beyond period that can contribute to delivering strong EPS growth and strong revenue growth.","But I'd say where we are right now is we have a lot of things going right now and we've filled a lot of the needs that we have. And so, I would not expect that we will go out and do another significant transaction. And \u2013 obviously, Pharmacyclics was a significant transaction, but I'm talking about even a transaction of this size.","So I think for the next, certainly, 18 months or so, if we were to do anything, it would probably be more of a BI kind of transaction, more of a single asset; might be an in-licensing kind of a transaction. And I think, based on the fact that we have delivered some level of dilution here, we would have to be in position we would absorb the dilution going forward. So, hopefully, that answers your question.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's great. Thanks so much for the color.","Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations","All right, thanks. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jami Rubin, Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. I just want to follow up on some of the Stemcentrx questions; and congratulations. But clearly the whole, sort of, stem cell based focus has been fraught with challenges, and I'm just wondering maybe if you could reply to the specific questions. What gives you confidence that findings from mouse models translate to human cancers? And also, what gives you confidence that small cell lung cancer data will translate to other tumor types? And was also curious to know how Stemcentrx's ADC technology differs from other ADC players.","And then, a follow-up question, and sorry about this, but just to follow-up on an earlier question, if you could kind of play out the scenario of the upcoming IPR, which investors are obviously highly focused on, what is the right analytical framework, Rick, that we should think about this in the event that, A, the IPR is heard, or it is dismissed, just in relation to the overall IP picture and duration of HUMIRA? Thanks very much.","Michael E. Severino - Executive Vice President, Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer","All right. So, I will \u2013 this is Mike. I will take the first of those, and then Rick may want to add some follow up. So with respect to cancer stem cells, what I would say is we've had a fair amount of time to get very comfortable with the platform that Stemcentrx has developed. And we believe that they are doing something really novel here.","In terms of understanding how mouse models might translate into human clinical trials or, ultimately, clinical benefit, we certainly recognize that that translational leap is often fraught with peril, but in this case we don't have to wonder. We've seen the first three assets move into the clinic showing strong activity. And so, they have demonstrated with their first three clinical assets activity in small cell lung cancer, triple-negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer. So there are human data to back up their hypothesis, not only one time, but three times in a row; and, obviously, being right three times in a row in this business doesn't happen by chance very often.","So with respect to our confidence that small cell lung cancer will transfer to other cancers, the set of cancers that we're talking about all share neuroendocrine features, as does small cell. And Stemcentrx has done a large amount of work to understand the role that DLL3 plays biologically in these tumors. And we know, based on the work that they have done, that DLL3 is playing the same role across these tumors. And so, that's why we have much greater than average confidence that what we're seeing in those preclinical studies in other tumors will translate into the basket study that they are running. So, as Rick said, we've seen a lot of data here and we feel very good about this opportunity.","With respect to the ADC landscape, Stemcentrx has shown that they are very good at generating highly selective monoclonal antibodies that make good reagents for ADCs, and they also have the linker technology and the toxin technology all fully integrated within their company to rapidly produce these ADCs. And, again, I would say that their clinical track record speaks for itself.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Rick for the other questions.","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean, I guess the only thing I'd add on that first set of questions, Jami, is the reality is human data trumps everything else in our business, right? So I think you can interpret from that we had to get comfortable with the human data that we saw and the impact that it had to make the decisions that we made. And as that comes out, I think you'll draw your own conclusions, obviously, but I think that will be informative as it comes out for you, okay?","I want to make sure I understand your IPR question, so I'm going to ask you to ask it one more time.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. So I just want you to kind of frame the landscape for us, because investors are hyper-focused on this upcoming Coherus IPR. If the IPR is thrown out, I think that's pretty clear. But if it is heard, help us to understand the significance of that in the context of your overall IP surrounding HUMIRA.","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thank you. If you think about this process, the process we will go through is that the Patent Office makes a decision whether or not there is enough evidence to even review the patent. That's the process that's going to occur here in the May-June timeframe with the IPRs. And so, all it is is, is there enough in the claim of the company challenging the IP to even make a decision to review it? If the Patent Office decides that is the case, then they will review it; and there'll be a process that we go through that's well documented of how we defend the patent, and the process that the challenger would go through as well. That takes about 12 months. So at the end of 12 months there would be a decision on the patent. And depending upon which way that decision went, if it went for us, then obviously the patent would be upheld and would be, obviously, strengthened dramatically. If not, then we have the right to appeal. So that's the process. And I think that essentially defines sort of the implications of the process. If it gets turned down on the front end similar to what the formulation patent with Amgen did, then obviously that creates a very significant hurdle for the company that's challenging it. So those are the implications of it.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it.","Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Jami. Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Risinger, Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much, and congrats on the news this morning. I have three questions. First, with respect to Stemcentrx, could you just talk about how you plan to integrate and retain the employees now that they're going to be part of a much larger pharmaceutical company. Second, could you explain the Stemcentrx-Pfizer partnership and how you expect that to evolve? And then, as an aside, AbbVie doesn't talk much about your 50-50 funding along with Google of Calico, but obviously you have made a significant investment there and Calico is quite an interesting company given its leadership. Could you just update us on the pipeline at Calico as well, please? Thank you.","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. So, David, this is Rick. I'll take probably the first of those and maybe some part of the second. I may ask Henry to chime in on the second part. And I'll take the Calico one for you.","So, I mean, obviously, an important part of these kinds of companies is retaining the people. And \u2013 particularly, when you think about this kind of a company where a lot of the intellectual property of the company is that, right? It's the intellectual horsepower of the people. And I would say we have been interacting with Stemcentrx, now, for a number of months, well before this process started. And so, we've had a chance to get to know the team and get to know the leadership within the team. And they had a decision to make, right? They could have gone down the IPO route. They could have collaborated with somebody and gone down the IPO route, if they wanted to.","And I think, based on the kind of asset they have in Rova-T, they certainly would have had \u2013 even in a tough IPO market as it is today, I think they would have had the ability to be able to do that; or they could do a transaction like the transaction we ended up doing with them. And I think one of the deciding factors for them was what they're really good at and what they love doing is essentially going in and discovering novel markers and creating drugs; so, going through the discovery and early development process. And they demonstrated they can do that in a highly efficient and effective way, and they can do that very, very rapidly.","If they went down the IPO route, they had to basically build all the other infrastructure that a fully-integrated business would need to have, including all the commercial and medical affairs and global clinical development groups in order to be able to execute a fully-integrated strategy. And I think as they looked at that, I think they had confidence that they could do it, but it would be a tremendous amount of effort on their part and their leadership team to be able to do that.","When they looked at coming together with us, they ultimately said, look, we can do the part that we think we're great at and we can plug in to what you already have for all those other things, the global clinical development group that we have, the medical affairs group that we have all around the world, the commercial organization that we have all around the world. And so, I think they perceived it to be a win-win. So I think that's the first thing. Winning their hearts and their minds through that process, I think, was an important aspect of it.","Second aspect of it was that, obviously, the CVRs \u2013 all of the leadership team and many of the employees have either ownership in the company or they have \u2013 and they have stock options, right? So these CVRs are pretty important to them. They can extract a tremendous amount of value through that process if they deliver against those CVRs, and I can tell you that's a pretty healthy financial incentive for them to stay and execute against those. And I can tell you, in the interactions that I had with them \u2013 we had with them, I should say, I can tell you that's an important point to them.","Third thing is they wanted this stock transaction. Now, they wanted it somewhat for tax purposes, but they also wanted it because they wanted to believe that they could share in the upside. And some of what they agreed to do with their options only reinforced that, meaning their Stemcentrx options and what they we will become and how that value will be derived.","And so, I think there's a very high likelihood that we will retain the key people in this, and I think they like our culture and they like the environment that we're operating in. And so, I'd tell you I have a fairly high level of confidence. And I think Pharmacyclics demonstrates \u2013 we have retained all of the key clinical development people. And I've spent time, Mike has spent time with that team. I think they're very happy being part of AbbVie and they get to execute their strategy that they wanted as an independent company as well or better than they could have as an independent company. So I feel pretty good about that, but it's an important point.","On the Pfizer transaction, it's something we want to be careful with because I'm not sure what their confidentiality agreement is. Henry, you want to comment anything on it?","Henry O. Gosebruch - Chief Strategy Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Just to be clear, Pfizer does not have any rights to Rova-T at all. We did put out some slides this morning and you see that there's four additional assets in Phase 1. And obviously, there's a number of late pre-clinical assets behind there. Two of these assets Pfizer has some rights to, but we really can't go into further details on how those deals are structured; but again, to be clear, that is the extent of the Pfizer relationship.","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And of the two assets, they can opt-in.","Henry O. Gosebruch - Chief Strategy Officer & Executive Vice President","Correct. They can opt-in back in one of them.","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, therefore, we can opt-in back on one of those if we choose to. So I think that probably gives you as much as we can give you around the Pfizer compounds.","On Calico, I'm going to have Mike talk a little bit about the pipeline, but that is a transaction that we did about a year or so ago, now. And when you look at the individuals that Calico first started-up with, Art and Hal and others, they've assembled a very talented team. And that's \u2013 that was the big reason that we ultimately decided to do something with them. But essentially what we have is we co-fund a discovery effort to find new innovative targets in a number of different areas. Oncology is one of them; diseases of the aging is another. Neurodegenerative diseases is another area that ultimately we have a lot of interest in.","And the way it works is, essentially, we can opt-in on anything that's discovered there, and there's a point at which we take it over. We have commercial rights to it, and then there's basically a 50\/50 profit sharing arrangement between us and Calico. So, essentially, we have rights to anything over a certain period of time that is discovered within Calico. Mike works closely with the team, so I'm going to ask him to talk a little bit more about progress that they're making.","Michael E. Severino - Executive Vice President, Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer","Sure. So one of the things that I think is very important to note in the Calico collaboration is that there's a very strong scientific and cultural fit between our teams. And that was one of the real drivers behind doing that deal. The Calico team is obviously very talented. They have a long and very successful track record. Our teams are working together very well. We're advancing a number of programs. But, of course, we do need to keep in mind that these are early discovery programs that have been initiated in the last 12 months to 18 months. So we intend to move very quickly, but it takes a bit of time before programs are ready for clinical introduction and the sort of news flow that would \u2013 you'd expect to hear in this sort of setting.","So what I would say is the cultural fit is great. We've made great progress building up a set of programs in the areas that Rick mentioned that I think are a very good fit for our overall strategy, and we remain very optimistic about the Calico partnership.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations","All right. Thanks, David. Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Marc Goodman, UBS. Your line is now open.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Yes, morning. Maybe we can talk a little bit about just the business for a sec. VIEKIRA was a little bit weak. Maybe you can talk about the U.S. versus international, how Japan is doing. U.S. seems to be falling off quite a bit; I mean, we're just losing share. Give us a sense of what's going on there.","Second, HUMIRA in the U.S., I was just curious \u2013 obviously, we've seen quite a few price increases if you look out over the past 12 months, and I was curious whether you are still being able to get the same amount of price dropping to the bottom line as you have been in the past, if there was more pressure on that?","And then, third, can you give us an update on what we're going to see at ASCO for the broader portfolio? Thanks.","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Marc. Okay. So, this is Rick. I'll take VIEKIRA , and Bill can take the HUMIRA question, and we'll have Mike cover the ASCO question. So, VIEKIRA, let me start with Japan. I mean, Japan is continuing to track consistent with our expectations, so I think there's nothing all that remarkable from Japan. It's a good market, and our profile within that market is a good profile.","The U.S. has certainly been more challenging. I would say that it's a combination of several factors, some volume loss as well as some price loss. As Merck has entered the market, we know that they set the list price lower than the other products in the marketplace. That strategy, initially, I think we interpreted as a strategy that would go after medical exceptions, because medical exceptions historically are in at more of a list price point. And so, they have the lowest price, essentially, on a medical exception basis. And they have been somewhat successful in gaining some of those medical exceptions. So that's part of the issue.","The second part of the issue, though, is they have been more aggressive than we anticipated from a pricing standpoint, particularly in the public segments, the VA in particular. And as we looked at that, we ultimately made the decision that we were not going to compete with the lowest overall price in the VA. We did adjust our price down, but we didn't adjust it down to the very lowest price. And that has caused us to obviously lose price, but also lose volume. And we had a fairly significant share of VA.","So I think it is those factors playing out. And I would say that, based on where the U.S. is going, it is unlikely that we will achieve the $2 billion number that we described earlier. I think a number that you should be thinking about now is more in the $1.6 billion range; globally, I'm talking about.","And you can look at this quarter as an example. Even though VIEKIRA was weaker than we expected, we obviously beat our EPS number and achieved our revenue numbers. So I talked to strength of the rest of the business; and that's the nice thing about our business is we have good balanced performance across a number of different assets. And so, when one thing doesn't go as well as we had hoped, then others can pick up the slack.","So we will not be changing our guidance based on this. We've factored that into our going-forward guidance in 2016 and we're comfortable with the guidance that we've provided you, but those are the facts around VIEKIRA.","William J. Chase - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Marc, on HUMIRA pricing in the U.S., look, obviously, we continue to put up pretty impressive numbers in the U.S. If you look at Script trends, it was up over 16%. So there's a \u2013 the majority of the increase in Q1 is related to volume, but price is a component. Now, the category has taken some price in the last four months or five months; we did as well. And we don't see any major shift relative to what we've been experiencing over the last few years, but obviously we're keeping our eye on it.","Michael E. Severino - Executive Vice President, Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer","So with respect to ASCO, we'll obviously be seeing the Rova-T data that we've talked about in small cell lung cancer, which is a Best of ASCO presentation. Venclexta also has a Best of ASCO presentation, which comes from the program in AML in combination with hypomethylating agents.","There are nine additional abstracts for Venclexta that'll be presented, updating across the range of studies that are being conducted with that molecule in non-Hodgkin lymphoma and other settings as well. You'll start to see additional data from ADCs that we're introducing into the clinic. There'll be updated data on ABT-414. You'll start to see data on some of our newer ADCs and we continue to have a number of programs that will be moving into clinical development in oncology. So, overall, we're going to be active at ASCO and, of course, we're also having our R&D Day to coincide with the timing of ASCO. So you'll see a broad update on our pipeline there.","Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Marc. Appreciate it. Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Baum, Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Hi. Three questions, please. First, on the Stemcentrx transaction, could you provide a little bit more detail on the earn-outs? The press release references milestones, and you mentioned in passing the first-line indication, but if you could provide some more granularity that would be great.","Second, I would imagine this was a competitive auction just given \u2013 well, especially as Stemcentrx just got a finance professional as their CEO and there's several high-profile tech investors involved. Perhaps, you could just give us some sense of the competitive dynamics as you think about valuation.","Second, in reference to your comment on your IL-23, you highlighted it as your priority compound in psoriatic arthritis. What's the future of ABT-122? Do you intend to proceed in either psoriatic arthritis, or is psoriasis or in RA for that compound?","And then, finally, more broadly, now that you've got a lung candidate in your oncology pipeline, how you think about augmenting that compound going forward.","Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Andrew.","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, Andrew \u2013 Henry, why don't you cover the milestones, and then we can talk a little bit about first-line.","Henry O. Gosebruch - Chief Strategy Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Hey, Andrew. So there are in total $4 billion of milestones. $2 billion relate to the first-line approval that Rick talked about. So that approval is $2 billion and is qualified by a favorable position in the guidelines at the time. And as Rick talked about, we believe that would create significantly more value than that $2 billion.","In addition, there is a second $2 billion, and that relates to four individual $500 million milestones, so totaling $4 billion, and those are for the commencement of registration trials for additional assets in indications that would be at least $1 billion in revenue potential. So that is $500 million each for a total of $2 billion, and then with the first-line, $4 billion in total.","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, on those second set of milestones, just to be clear, they're individually earned, right? So if they take one asset and they move it through and we take it to a registration study and we determine that that asset in that indication would generate a commercial asset that had greater than $1 billion worth of revenue, then we would pay them $500 million. And then, if they do a second one or a third one and a fourth one, they can get up to four $500 million milestones. So that's how the contingent \u2013 or the contingent payments are laid out.","On the competitive dynamics, it was a competitive process. It was relatively blind to us, so we don't know who the other competitors were; but we do know there were other players that were involved. And I'd say it ended up being us and one other player at the very end who were competing for the asset through that process. And ultimately, as I told you on the valuation, it's consistent with what I described to you before. If you look at what we are paying in the base case for this asset and you look at the base case forecast without first-line in it, it has a significantly positive NPV and well above the threshold at which we look at the cutoff for IRRs. And so, this is a transaction that we feel very comfortable with from a financial standpoint.","And we've obviously built-in the upside for first-line because we don't have data on first-line right now. And we're not going to \u2013 we didn't want to be in a position where we're paying for something that we didn't know what it was going to look like. We were very comfortable with second- and third-line because we saw data that supported that \u2013 human data that supported that.","I do believe, based on everything I've seen, and I think Mike and others believe that there is a high probability this asset will move into first-line; but we're going to pursue it aggressively. And if they do, they will get the incremental reward and we will, obviously, get the incremental award of being able to move into that. And we have specified where \u2013 how the guidelines have to characterize the asset: that it would be a broad-based first-line agent in order for that milestone to be paid.","On the BI and ABT-122, Mike, why don't you cover that?","Michael E. Severino - Executive Vice President, Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer","Certainly. So the BI compound, which is now called risankizumab, the IL-23 antibody, is our lead asset in psoriasis, and I think the data clearly bear that out. And I think, based on what we know about the pathway, it makes sense to make that same statement about psoriatic arthritis. We're very pleased with the data we've seen today. We think there's really tremendous potential for that asset.","With respect to ABT-122, which is our IL-17 TNF DVD, we are going to be seeing mid-stage data internally the middle of this year; so, shortly. We'll probably be in a position to present that externally around the ACR timeframe.","And so, we'll make a decision when we have those data. But what I can say is, to move forward with those molecules, it would have to fit our strategy with that molecule, with ABT-122. It would have to fit our strategy to raise the bar in the standard of care. So we would be looking through differentiated efficacy compared to not only what we have in our own portfolio, but what's available externally. And so, we'll be making that decision later on this year.","With respect to your question about our presence in lung cancer, we've said for quite some time that we want to build our presence in solid tumors. I think the Stemcentrx acquisition clearly does that. It gives us a broad platform as well as a very promising lead asset and other clinical assets behind that. And so, we're going to continue to build on that presence, not only with the development engine that comes from Stemcentrx, but with our internal pipeline. And I think you'll see that we have a number of programs that could be applicable to lung cancer and other solid tumors that will be moving through the clinic, shortly.","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. And then on the M&A, it's consistent with what I described earlier. We'd be looking for those kinds of assets. We continue to evaluate things that are in the marketplace. We've built a fairly extensive pipeline internally and \u2013 but obviously we continue to look on the outside for those assets that look interesting. And \u2013 but it will be of a profile \u2013 an investment profile of what I described to you a moment ago.","Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Andrew.","Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.","Thank you.","Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations","Jay, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum, Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","John Scotti - Evercore ISI","Good morning. This is John Scotti in for Mark. I just have a few questions, if I may.","Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations","Hey, John.","John Scotti - Evercore ISI","First \u2013 hey, Larry. The first on Stemcentrx. So I recall last year when you purchased Pharmacyclics with IMBRUVICA, you gave a lot of helpful color on how you built up in your model to the peak sales \u2013 your end-user peak sales estimate for IMBRUVICA. You sort of broke out by indication, line of therapy, and gave some color on risk adjustment. Do you think you could do the same thing here for Rova-T and the $5 billion number you've put out there in terms of what year do you model peak, are you talking small cell alone, other indications and sort of give some more granular color on how you built up to that number?","And then the second question, now that you have purchased Stemcentrx and you've in-licensed the IL-23 from BI, can you give a little bit more color on how you see the R&D line evolving over the next few years? So, specifically, with regard to 2020 guidance, are you going to be able to keep \u2013 hold, essentially, the greater than 50% non-GAAP operating margin guidance that you've given previously or should we expect that to have to come down a bit below what you've given? Thank you so much.","Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, John.","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. As far as the model, obviously, we went through the model in some level of detail around Pharmacyclics, one, because of the magnitude of the investment that we were making, and we described what supported that investment and how we built up the model.","What I characterized for you already basically tells you how we built this model, right? It's built primarily around second- and third-line small cell, which we believe has a very high probability of success. So you can imagine we've risk-adjusted it, accordingly, at a high probability of success. It does have a couple of other smaller indications where we believe there is a very high probability of being able to extend it into some of these other cancers that we described. I wouldn't say that has a significant impact on it, and those are risk-adjusted, accordingly. It doesn't have first-line in it, and the milestone, or the CVR, is basically driven off of what we think the value would be and the return would be appropriate for first-line; and it doesn't have any other of these other milestone-driven POCs that would come forward.","So I think that's roughly the same kind of guidance. We gave share and some other kinds of things, and we've obviously built the model around those same kinds of assumptions. But I think, in this case, we'll wait to provide that at a later date once we get closer to a launch of the asset in 2018.","On the R&D line \u2013 or I think really what you're asking is are we still committed to delivering 50% or greater in 2020? And the short answer to that is, yes. We've looked at it. We've carefully looked at the commitments we've made around the compounded growth rate and the revenue projections as well as the operating margin profile that we communicated last year, and we're still absolutely committed to delivering against that.","Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks a lot, John. Operator, we have time for one final question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Alex Arfaei, BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, folks, and thank you for taking the questions. Rick, just following up on some of the earlier questions, the Street has obviously taken a significantly more cautious view relative to your long-term guidance, particularly for HUMIRA. Do you see anything changing in the near future that would allow investors to have more confidence in your long-term guidance? And I guess what I'm asking is, basically, are we going to go through this long drawn out process where we're going from one HUMIRA hearing to another? Or do you see a point where it becomes clear that you can hold off HUMIRA biosimilars in the U.S. for as long as you believe you can? Thank you.","Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think there's two ways to look at it. I mean, first of all, if you look at the guidance that we provided back in, I think it was October 29 of last year, and you look at what happened to the consensus numbers, what you'll see is they shifted out roughly a year. I think the mean now is probably \u2013 if you look at where people are assuming biosimilar impact in the United States, it's probably in that 2019 \u2013 Larry, correct me if I'm wrong here, that 2019 timeframe; so, it moved out from about 2017 to 2019.","And I'd say one of the things we track to try to understand how the market is perceiving that guidance is we track what our stock performance has been versus our peers over that period of time. And I saw it just the other day. It may have changed in the last couple of days a little bit, but we're the number one performing stock since that point in time. So I think it was around 14% appreciation, or something like that; 15% appreciation. So I think it did have a positive impact.","Having said that, I would agree with your point that there's still this overhang and this overhang is built around different catalysts. As we've said before, we've given a lot of clarity in that review of what our IP strategy is and the confidence that we have in our IP strategy. How the market will relate to that, that's a little harder for me to describe or predict, I'd say. But certainly, I think, as it plays out, I think the market will basically start to better understand what our position is. And certainly, as you have more confidence around that, I think you will see the sentiment change.","I think the bigger issue \u2013 and I think Rova-T and the IL-23 are two good examples. Look, we obviously have a point of view of what we think is going to happen. We've communicated what that point of view looks like, I think, in very clear terms. That doesn't mean that everybody believes that point of view. But what I'd say is, if you look at even the bear case on HUMIRA, which we certainly don't agree with, and you look at this pipeline that we've now assembled of assets that have a very high profitability of success, I think even in the most bear case possible, most people would look at that pipeline and say, they should be able to grow through whatever happens.","Now, obviously, we have a different view of what we think is going to happen, but even if you look at \u2013 at least the models I've looked at that have the worst case built into them, when I look at our pipeline and the probability of success of those assets I described in my formal remarks, and you just add them up and risk-adjust them based on the data you've seen and the commercial success you would expect from those assets, I think a reasonable person would draw the conclusion that you can grow through that. And I think that ultimately will be the calculus that investors are going to have to make.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you.","Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Alex.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Elizabeth Shea","Good morning and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Severino, Executive Vice President of Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer; and Bill Chase, Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that some statements we make today are or may be considered forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This morning, I'll briefly discuss our fourth quarter performance and 2017 highlights. Mike will then provide an update on recent advancements across our R&D pipeline, and Bill will discuss the quarter and our 2018 guidance in more detail. As always, following our remarks, we will take your questions.","We delivered another impressive quarter and year with results ahead of our expectations. Our adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $1.48 representing growth of more than 23% versus the fourth quarter of 2016. Our quarterly results also included strong topline performance with global operational sales growth of more than 12%. We continue to see strong momentum from our business with three major drivers contributing to our growth; HUMIRA, IMBRUVICA, and MAVYRET.","Since our inception as a public company five years ago, AbbVie has demonstrated an exceptional track record of consistently delivering top-tier financial performance. In 2017 was another clear example of that performance. We continue to drive strong commercial and operational execution resulting in full-year 2017 global operational sales growth of 10% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 16%.","We have also made tremendous progress advancing our pipeline with impressive data from several assets that are poised to fuel our growth in the years to come. HUMIRA continues to deliver outstanding performance with global operational growth of more than 14% for the full-year 2017. This performance was driven by continued robust market demand despite the introduction of new mechanisms of action and competition from indirect biosimilars.","We continued to see strong momentum with HUMIRA in the fourth quarter. U.S. growth was more than 15% versus the prior year. IMBRUVICA also delivered strong momentum and growth with full-year 2017 sales approaching $2.6 billion, an increase of 41% over the prior year. In the quarter, IMBRUVICA delivered strong growth of approximately 39% versus the prior year. We are continuing to see strong uptake in CLL where IMBRUVICA is now the clear market share leader across all lines of therapy.","Global HCV sales were nearly $1.3 billion in 2017 including global sales of MAVYRET which approached $500 million. In the fourth quarter, total HCV sales grew more than 62% versus the prior year. While are still at the early stages of our commercialization. We have been very pleased with average strong uptake in both the U.S. and international markets.","We have achieved market leadership in most of the markets where we have launched. In the U.S., MAVYRET exited 2017 with a market share of 32%, conforming our expectations that the product will be our highly competitively positioned product within the HCV market.","Based on our current managed care contracting status, we have parity access across 65% of the covered lives in the U.S., with much of that access coming in the last 60 days. We continue to work with payers towards parity contracts and are pleased with the progress that we are making on that front.","We also saw a strong performance from several other products in our base business. Product such as LUPRON, Creon, and Duodopa continue to perform well in their categories, and we expect and continue to be very stable profitable products for many years to come.","Turning now to 2018. Based on the strong fundamentals of our business, we are projecting both strong top and bottom line growth again this year. As you know, on our third quarter call, we provided 2018 EPS guidance reflecting 17% growth at the midpoint. There are been several positive developments since we outlined our initial outlook.","We have seen very strong uptake from MAVYRET both in the U.S. and internationally, and continued robust underlying performance from other products and our portfolio, driving our expectations for 2018 higher than we previously projected. This outperformance is reflected in our updated 2018 guidance.","Additionally, we saw a passage of U.S. tax reform which will lower our tax rate going forward. Factoring in both items, we now expect full-year 2018 adjusted earnings per share of $7.33 to $7.43. The midpoint of this revised guidance reflects year-over-year growth of 32%, with the majority of the projected growth being driven by strong underlying operating performance. This guidance positions AbbVie to be in the top-tier for earnings per share growth once again in 2018. Bill will provide more details regarding our 2018 guidance later on in this call.","For AbbVie, the recent passage of U.S. tax reform enables more efficient access to our foreign cash and the ability to deploy it in the United States. Over the next five years, we plan to invest roughly $2.5 billion in capital within the U.S. and are currently evaluating additional expansion of our U.S. facilities.","In 2018, we also plan to accelerate our pension funding by $750 million as well as enhancing our non-executive employee compensation. We are also planning a one-time shareable contribution of approximately $350 million to select not-for-profit organizations, supporting initiatives such as the Puerto Rico rebuilding efforts, children's healthcare access programs, and charities that support our local communities needs. Based on our strong cash flow generation, we also anticipate an increase in our return of capital to our shareholders and we will be announcing those specific details in the near future.","Moving on to R&D, where we have built a compelling pipeline of innovative late-stage products with differentiated clinical profiles into sustained and compelling patient benefits. In 2017, we saw a significant evolution of our pipeline with a number of important clinical development and regulatory milestones, which I'll briefly highlight.","We saw strong results from several pivotal trials, including data from three Phase III studies for upadacitinib in RA, four Phase III studies for risankizumab in psoriasis, and the MURANO study for VENCLEXTA in relapsed\/refractory CLL among others.","We also began registrational trials for several pipeline assets including Phase III studies in Crohn's disease for both upadacitinib and risankizumab, upadacitinib and psoriatic arthritis, VENCLEXTA in front-line AML, and Rova-T in front and second-line small-cell lung cancer.","We submitted regulatory applications for VENCLEXTA in relapsed\/refractory CLL, and for elagolix in endometriosis, which is currently under priority review. And we received several regulatory approvals including MAVYRET in HCV, and two approvals for IMBRUVICA, marginal zone lymphoma and chronic graft-versus-host disease. And while we made significant advancements across our pipeline in 2017, 2018 will mark another milestone-filled year for AbbVie, which Mike will discuss in detail during his remarks in just a few moments.","As we reflect on AbbVie\u2019s performance as a Company and we evaluate our future prospects, we see a very strong company, well positioned for the future. Looking at our P&L in 2017 and across the first five years, we see a company with impressive topline growth, strong and improving operating margins, robust investment in R&D and SG&A to drive long-term performance.","Strategically, we see an industry leading pipeline of late-stage de-risked assets and a productive R&D engine that has generated a pipeline of early-stage assets with transformational potential. In short, we see a high performing innovative company that is well positioned for the future.","This is an exciting time for AbbVie. The productivity of our pipeline is becoming increasingly evident and we have a significant number of upcoming product launches that are poised to drive significant growth. Our growth story has only just begun. In 2017, we launched MAVYRET, which has become a major growth driver for us. This year, we will launch a major label expansion for VENCLEXTA in relapsed\/refractory CLL as well as elagolix in endometriosis.","In late 2018 to 2019, Rova-T will begin to contribute. And in 2019, we will launch our next-generation immunology assets, risankizumab and upadacitinib. Each of these assets will add significantly to AbbVie's already strong growth.","So in summary, we are extremely pleased with our strong performance in 2017 and we are certainly proud of the strong foundation that we have built. We have a high level of confidence in the momentum of our business, which is reflected in our 2018 guidance. We are committed to delivering on our long-term strategic vision for the Company and we are poised to deliver sustainable industry-leading performance and outstanding shareholder value.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike.","Michael Severino","Thank you, Rick. Today, I'll highlight recent pipeline updates and discuss some of the milestones we anticipate for the year ahead. 2017 was a very productive year with a dozen pivotal trial readouts, several regulatory submissions and approvals, and several important phase transitions across our key programs. And we expect 2018 to be another catalyst rich year.","In immunology, we continue to make great progress with our late-stage assets, risankizumab and upadacitinib, as well as with our early immunology pipeline. We are nearing completion of the registrational program for risankizumab and for upadacitinib and their lead indications psoriasis and RA respectively.","Last month, we reported the topline results from the fourth and final Phase III study in the pivotal program evaluating risankizumab in psoriasis. In this study, the enhanced trial 73% of risankizumab patients achieved PASI 90 and nearly half achieved PASI 100 compared to just 2% and 1% of patients on placebo at the PASI 90 and PASI 100 levels respectively. And consistent with the previous Phase III results, we saw very durable rates of skin clearance.","We are pleased with the strong Phase III results we have reported across all four pivotal trials and we look forward to submitting our regulatory application in the first half of this year. Based on the data we've generated to date, we believe risankizumab has the potential to significantly improve upon current treatment options for both bio-naive and TNF and adequate responder patients with moderate to severe psoriasis by offering unmatched levels of efficacy and durable effect with the convenience of quarterly dosing.","Beyond psoriasis, risankizumab is also in mid to late stage development for several other indications, including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and psoriatic arthritis. We recently initiated, Phase III studies in Crohn's disease and expect to begin registrational studies later this year in ulcerative colitis. We remain extremely excited about this assets potential and believe risankizumab could be an important new treatment option across a broad range of indications.","Moving now to our other late stage immunology asset, upadacitinib and oral selective JAK1 inhibitor currently in clinical development for six indications across the rheum, derm, and GI segments. Last month, we reported topline results from the third Phase III study from a registrational program and RA.","In the SELECT-MONOTHERAPY study, which evaluated upadacitinib as a monotherapy treatment for patients who did not adequately respond to methotrexate. Both doses of upadacitinib met all primary and key secondary endpoints versus continued methotrexate therapy.","Consistent with the results from the SELECT-NEXT and SELECT-BEYOND Phase III studies, upadacitinib drove very strong levels of response on all clinical end points. And importantly, on the more stringent end points, such as ACR50, ACR70, low disease activity, and DAS remission. Additionally, the safety profile in the SELECT-MONOTHERAPY study was consistent with previously reported Phase III SELECT trials and the Phase II studies with no new safety signals detected.","Given its strong profile, upadacitinib has the potential to be a best-in-class therapy in RA and could offer meaningful advantages of our products on the market today or in development. We expect to see data from two additional pivotal trials in the RA program in the first half of this year with our regulatory submission following in the second half of the year.","In addition to RA, Phase III studies with upadacitinib are ongoing in psoriatic arthritis and Crohn's disease and upadacitinib is also being evaluated as a potential treatment for ankylosing spondylitis. We plan to begin registration enabling studies this year in atopic dermatitis, ulcerative colitis, and giant cell arteritis. Earlier this month, upadacitinib received a Breakthrough Therapy Designation in atopic dermatitis, based on the strong Phase II data we have previously reported. We plan to present detailed results from the Phase II study at the AAD Meeting next month.","There is also continued movement with our early-stage immunology programs, where we are developing assets with the potential to significantly raise the efficacy bar in areas such as disease remission and durability of response, compared to products currently on the market and in late-stage development.","We expect to begin proof-of-concept studies this year for several key early-stage assets, including our CD40 antagonist ABBV-323, which will begin Phase II studies in ulcerative colitis, and our JAK-BTK inhibitor combination, ABBV-599, which will start Phase II in RA patients.","We also have clinical programs recently initiated or expected to begin very soon for other key early-stage assets, including our RORgamma t inverse agonist, and our anti-TNF steroid ADC.","Moving now to oncology, where we continue to advance our programs for IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA. These two therapies alone and in combination with other medicines are demonstrating extremely strong activity in a broad range of cancers such as CLL, AML, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which should enable us to expand our already strong position in hematologic malignancies.","Through novel combinations of IMBRUVICA, VENCLEXTA and other therapies, our goal is to drive better long-term goal and outcomes for patients. With IMBRUVICA, we continue to build the body of evidence in CLL, as well as in other blood cancers. IMBRUVICA has already changed the treatment paradigm in second-line or greater CLL and following the strong RESONATE-2 data is gaining momentum in the front-line setting.","At the recent ASH Meeting, we reported new three-year follow-up from the RESONATE-2 study demonstrating that in treatment-na\u00efve CLL patients, long-term treatment with IMBRUVICA is leading to sustained improvements in patient reported outcomes and quality of life, as well as significant decreases in disease related symptoms.","We also had several studies ongoing to evaluate IMBRUVICA alone or in combination in different patient segments, including young and fit patients and the watch-and-wait population. These studies will add to the breadth of data supporting IMBRUVICA, providing physicians more evidence of the compelling clinical benefits in the front-line setting. We expect to begin seeing data from these Phase III trials towards the end of 2019.","More near-term, we expect to see data from several IMBRUVICA combination studies this year, including Phase III data in front-line CLL in combination with GAZYVA and front-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in combination with our CHOP.","Moving now to VENCLEXTA, at the recent ASH Meeting, we reported detailed results from the Phase III MURANO study in relapsed\/refractory CLL, which showed a profound improvement in progression free survival and strong rates of MRD negativity with combination treatment of VENCLEXTA and RITUXAN compared to BR.","Based on these results, we believe that VENCLEXTA in combination with RITUXAN has the potential to be a new standard chemotherapy free treatment option for patients with relapsed\/refractory CLL.","We recently submitted our regulatory applications for VENCLEXTA plus RITUXAN in relapsed\/refractory CLL based on the MURANO data. We expect an approval for this indication later this year and look forward to bringing this new treatment to market in the broader relapsed\/refractory CLL population.","Beyond our core strategy in CLL, we are making great progress with our development programs to expand VENCLEXTA across multiple hematological malignancies. We have Phase III studies ongoing in multiple myeloma as well as AML, where we have received two Breakthrough Therapy Designations.","These studies are progressing well with key data becoming available in the 2019 time frame. Given the significant and durable activity we've already seen in AML and following recent regulatory feedback, we now plan to submit our U.S. regulatory application for VENCLEXTA in AML later this year.","This represents a significant acceleration of our program as approval in AML later this year or in early 2019 would be approximately two years ahead of our initial expectations. We look forward to bringing this new treatment option to the substantial group of AML patients who can't receive high-dose induction chemotherapy.","I will now turn to our solid tumor programs where we continue to make good progress with our late-stage program for Rova-T as well as with our early-stage oncology pipeline. Starting with Rova-T, our registrational trial in third-line or greater small-cell lung cancer, the TRINITY study continues to progress and we expect data in the second quarter with our regulatory submission following soon thereafter.","Our ongoing Phase III studies in small-cell lung cancer also continue to advance, with the TAHOE study in the second-line setting and the MERU trial in front-line patients both now well underway. We are also evaluating Rova-T with Opdivo and with Opdivo and Yervoy in mid-stage combination study with potential to start seeing data from this trial later in the year.","Beyond small-cell lung cancer, the neuroendocrine tumor BASKET study continues to progress. And we will be sharing more results from this study as the data mature possibly later this year. In our early-stage oncology pipeline, we continue to build capabilities and explore new technologies that will extend our reach in the solid tumor market.","We've prioritized areas of biology that we believe play an integral role in the tumor immune environment or in tumor growth, areas where we believe we can target with new therapies to have broader applicability than existing immuno-oncology agents or chemotherapy.","These include the tumor microenvironment, innate immune cell activation, tumor cell intrinsic resistance, cancer stem cells, epigenetic regulation, and therapies based on engineered T-cell receptors. We have more than 20 solid tumor assets currently in the clinic and expect to move several more into Phase I studies over the course of the year. We look forward to sharing the data from these programs as they mature.","And finally, in the area of women's health, our regulatory application for elagolix in endometriosis is currently under priority review and we anticipate an approval decision in the second quarter. In addition to the endometriosis program, we have Phase III studies ongoing in uterine fibroids and we will see data from this program later this quarter.","So in summary, we've continued to make significant progress advancing and accelerating our pipeline and we look forward to many more important data readouts based transitions, regulatory submissions, and approvals in 2018.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on our fourth quarter and full-year performance. Bill?","William Chase","Thanks, Mike. Today, I'll review the highlights of our performance for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017 and provide an overview of our 2018 outlook. I will also walk through the impact of U.S. tax reform on our results as well as our expectations for the tax rate going forward.","As Rick mentioned, we had another year of outstanding performance in 2017, generating top and bottom line growth that ranks AbbVie among the very top of our industry peers. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $5.60, up more than 16% compared to 2016 and ahead of our expectations for the year.","For the full-year, net revenues were $28.2 billion, up 10.1% on an operational basis, excluding a modest favorable impact from foreign exchange. For the fourth quarter, total adjusted net revenues were $7.7 billion, an increase of 12.6% on an operational basis, excluding a 1.5% favorable impact from foreign exchange.","Fourth quarter global sales of HUMIRA were $4.9 billion, up 12.3% operationally driven by strong demand. HUMIRA sales in the U.S. were up 15.1% year-over-year reflecting volume of approximately 10% plus price. International HUMIRA sales were $1.6 billion in the quarter, an increase of 6.5% operationally or 11.7% on a reported basis.","Sales growth in the quarter benefited from the timing of tenders in select markets which contributed approximately 2.5% to the growth rate. Global HUMIRA sales for the full-year 2017 were $18.4 billion reflecting operational sales growth of 14.4%. HUMIRA remains the undisputed market leader across the broadest range of therapeutic indications, reflecting its strong position with physicians, unique product profile, and strong commercial execution.","Global IMBRUVICA net revenues were $708 million in the quarter, up 39% compared with the same period a year ago. Full-year IMBRUVICA sales were $2.6 billion, driven by continued uptake in the front-line CLL market and steady gains across other indications.","Global HCV sales for the fourth quarter were $510 million, increasing more than 62% operationally over the prior year. As Rick mentioned, we've been very pleased with the launch of MAVYRET in the U.S. and international markets and I'll outline our expectations for 2018 in just a few moments.","Global fourth quarter sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease increased 20.3% on an operational basis. Finally, we saw strong sales growth in the quarter on an operational basis for Creon, up almost 11%, and Synagis, up more that 4%.","Now turning to the P&L profile for the fourth quarter, adjusted gross margin was 79% of sales, down versus the prior year primarily due to the dilutive impacts of partnership accounting and exchange on hedged currencies.","In the quarter, adjusted R&D was 17.1% of sales, reflecting our ongoing support of pipeline programs. Adjusted SG&A was 21.2% of sales lower than the prior year as a result of sales leverage and our continuing focus on operational efficiencies.","The adjusted operating margin profile improved by more than 90 basis points compared with the prior year, inclusive of almost 100 basis points of incremental spending related to the risankizumab and Stemcentrx transactions.","Adjusted net interest expense was $252 million and the adjusted tax rate was 18.9% in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share excluding specified items were $1.48, up 23.3% year-over-year.","In the quarter, we recorded a charge of $0.77 per share in specified items related to the 2017 enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Included in this charge is an estimated $4.5 billion tax payable, related to previously unrepatriated earnings partially offset by related valuation adjustments to tax related balance sheet items. This one-time net charge has been excluded from our adjusted EPS results.","As I mentioned earlier, today we have raised our guidance range to $7.33 to $7.43, an increase at the midpoint of $0.91 over the 2018 adjusted EPS guidance we provided during our third quarter call.","At the midpoint, this new guidance range is $1.78 higher than our 2017 results, comprised of $0.95 of operating performance growth and $0.83 of contribution from tax rate reductions as a result of the recently passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Relative to our prior guidance for 2018, stronger operating performance accounted for an increase of $0.08.","In addition to the previously mentioned one-time tax on historical unrepatriated earnings, the legislation will allow for a more efficient future repatriation of foreign earnings and as a result a lower adjusted tax rate.","We now modeled a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 9% in 2018, increasing gradually to 13% within the next five years as a result of increased domestic income and investment. We anticipate a lower GAAP tax rate in 2018 due to the one-time benefit of the timing of the phase-in of provisions of the new law on certain foreign subsidiaries. This benefit will be excluded from our non-GAAP EPS in 2018.","On the topline in 2018, we expect revenue approaching $32 billion, which reflects a favorable impact from foreign currency of roughly 1.5%. Included in this guidance are the following assumptions for our key products. HUMIRA will maintain its strong position as the leading front-line therapy across therapeutic segments and continue to be an important growth driver.","In the U.S. in 2018, we expect sales growth of approximately 13% to 14%. Internationally, we expect sales to peak at approximately $6.2 billion this year. This guidance assumes current exchange rates and includes the impact of direct biosimilar entrants in the fourth quarter of 2018 as well as proactive actions taken in earlier quarters.","For IMBRUVICA, we expect global revenues to AbbVie of greater than $3.3 billion with U.S. sales just above $2.7 billion. Based on MAVYRET successful launch, we expect the global HCV sales in 2018 will exceed $2.5 billion with a roughly equal split between U.S. and OUS markets.","For VENCLEXTA, we expect sales above $300 million in 2018. As Mike mentioned, based on the MURANO data, we recently submitted our regulatory applications for VENCLEXTA plus RITUXAN in relapsed\/refractory CLL and we look forward to expanding VENCLEXTA into this broader setting in the second half of the year. For Creon, we expect sales growth of 10% in 2018.","We are forecasting 2018 AndroGel sales of approximately $475 million. For Duodopa, we expect sales in 2018 of approximately [$458 million]. We are forecasting ZINBRYTA sales of less than $100 million reflecting recent labeling changes and the introduction of competitive alternatives. Based on this level of projected performance, in the fourth quarter we recorded a non-cash charge of $354 million reflecting an impairment of ZINBRYTA related assets. And for Synagis, Lupron and Synthroid, we expect sales to be roughly flat year-over-year.","Finally, we are expecting a regulatory decision for elagolix in the second quarter. We will provide specific guidance for this asset following approval when the duration of therapy and pricing have been established.","Turning now to the P&L for 2018, we are forecasting an adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 80%. This is inclusive of partnership accounting impacts and current exchange dynamics on hedged currencies. We are forecasting R&D expense of roughly 16% of sales, which reflects an increase in funding to support our late-stage pipeline and continued progress across numerous mid-stage programs.","We expect SG&A to be just over 20% of sales. In 2018, we will be investing in order to maximize the sales potential of assets launching in 2018 and 2019. This includes incremental spend related to the launch activities for elagolix and endometriosis, and VENCLEXTA in the broader relapsed\/refractory CLL market as well as AML. In addition, we will be making investments and anticipation of immunology and oncology launches in 2019. Despite these investments, we expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to decline due to our rapidly growing topline.","For 2018, we are forecasting an operating margin of approximately 44%, roughly 150 basis points above 2017 inclusive of the incremental investments for our upcoming product launches. We expect 2018 net interest of approximately $1 billion.","Now our first quarter outlook. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $1.77 and $1.79 excluding approximately $0.31 as specified items. We anticipate first quarter operational revenue growth approaching the mid-teens. Holding exchange rates constant at current levels, we would expect foreign exchange to have a favorable impact on reported sales growth of 3% in the first quarter.","For U.S. HUMIRA, we expect first quarter sales growth over the prior year in the low-teens. Internationally, we expect operational sales growth in the mid single-digits. Holding exchange rates constant at current levels, we would expect a favorable impact from foreign currency resulting in reported global sales growth in the mid-teens. For IMBRUVICA, we expect U.S. sales in the first quarter to grow in the mid single-digits sequentially over the fourth quarter.","Our guidance for the quarter reflects an adjusted effective tax rate approaching 8% lower than our full-year expectation reflecting the fact that the tax benefit on equity compensation is most pronounced in the first quarter of each year.","In closing, we delivered outstanding performance in the fourth quarter and for the full-year and our guidance for 2018 puts us among the top of our industry peers once again with the midpoint of our EPS guidance range representing growth of 32%. We continue to build on our strong momentum and we are well positioned to advance our strategic priorities.","And with that, I will turn the call back over to Liz.","Elizabeth Shea","Thanks Bill. We will now open the call for question. Operator, well take the first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin","Thank you. And I do normally say, congratulations Rick and team on spectacular performance. I want to talk about \u2013 ask about you're sitting on a pile of cash that's just going to continue to grow and even more or so with your lower tax rate, you talked about wanting to return that cash to shareholders, and one of those forms is through an increased dividend.","Going back it seems that your current dividend payout is about 42% has come down as your earnings has grown, it has been as high as 50%. Would you be comfortable returning to a 50% dividend payout range over time? I know you said that the announcement will be forthcoming, but if you could give us some color as to how you're thinking about that?","And then secondly at the same time, given that your stock has completely related that gives you additional strategic options that maybe you didn't have before when you were trading at a significant discount. Can you talk about your desire to use cash to acquire assets that might give you best-in-class growth post 2022? How are you thinking about M&A? I think that you have said thus far that you don't need it by anything big now, you've got a lot of growth obviously, but beyond 2022, 2023 when biosimilar has entered the U.S. market that that sort of changes? So anyway those are my questions. Thanks.","Richard Gonzalez","Jami, this is Rick. So first thank you for the complement, we're certainly pleased with how the business has been performing as well. But I think if you look at our business, we're on fortunate position on two perspectives, and I\u2019ll talk specifically about cash and how we think about capital deployment as well. But we have a business to generate a tremendous amount of cash flow as you have highlighted and we have a business that is performing at a very high level and is capable of driving strong organic growth for the foreseeable future.","So as we look at capital deployment, I can tell you our philosophy is always that the first priority for us is continuing to invest back in the business in order to make sure that we can drive long-term sustainable top-tier growth. That's the commitment that we\u2019ve made to investors, the commitment that we've made to the organization. And so we are always looking at what we can do to be able to do that.","Now if you look at our late-stage pipeline, we clearly have confidence that we can do that, but we are constantly looking at what is out there that fits our strategy both within the franchises that we operate in as well as we have a program internally, we call new horizons, where we look at other verticals that might fit what we\u2019re good at. I would say our primary focus is looking for opportunities that can drive strong growth in that 2023, 2024, 2025 time frame that's we feel confident that we can drive growth with our late-stage pipeline ahead of that.","So we're constantly looking for assets in that time frame that could help further accelerate our growth in that window. And we're looking at both early-stage assets and in fact this year, we've done a number of early-stage assets in oncology and in neuroscience. I would say those are the areas that we have focused a tremendous amount of attention on. It\u2019s not the only places that we're looking, but it certainly is an area that's a high priority and we'll obviously look at other kinds of transactions as well, and certainly your points are valid one as our P\/E has risen, it does give more flexibility to do other things.","Now having said that, I would also tell you that we always look at the return that we can get out of a transaction and it has to meet our internal financial criteria or we're not willing to go down a path to acquire something that doesn't give us the kind of accretion that we're looking for and the kind of return that we're looking for. And so those are always important factors that we look at.","For cash flow though, if we look at our cash generation across the next 10 years, this is a business that generates a tremendous amount of cash. And now with tax reform, we have access to that cash in a much more efficient way than we did previously. So it gives us more flexibility to be able to deal with that cash appropriately. So if we look at that cash flow and we look at what we believe our needs to be able to sustain the level of performance that we want to be able to sustain in the business, I can tell you that cash flow grows faster than what we believe those needs are.","So as we've said now several times, pretax reform, if there was tax reform then we would look for a way to be able to return additional capital to shareholders. And we've been evaluating that for \u2013 actually last 45 days or so, when it became clear to us that tax reform is likely to occur. We have a proposal that we have worked up in order for us to make changes in this area. It does require board approval. I\u2019ll come back to that here in a second.","But I think you can assume we've always demonstrated a strong commitment to our dividend and growing that dividend. I think we've grown our dividend to 77% so far since we launched this new company. And so I think you can assume that what I'm describing to you would be a combination of acceleration of the dividend growth and more share buybacks. Now it obviously has been through our board. We have a board meeting scheduled in February. It is our intent, my intent to review the proposal with the board at that point. And we will make an announcement post that board meeting.","So I don't want to preempt what the payout ratio would be. I would say to you that you're certainly not. What you describe here is not an illogical way of thinking about it, but beyond that I wouldn\u2019t want to comment much, but I would say investors are going to have clarity on it in the month of February. So it's not too far off before you'll have a good idea of what we're describing.","Jami Rubin","Thanks very much.","Elizabeth Shea","Thanks Jami. Operator, we will take the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.","Jeffrey Holford","Thanks very much. And just first recounting it, while congratulations as well deserved and really nice move on the [indiscernible], particularly into Puerto Rico. So just thanks for that. First question for you, on 2018 outlook, I mean obviously this does not as I understand include any impact from share repurchases, you got tremendous momentum on your earnings I think that needs to be pushed through here. So your thoughts around accelerated share repurchase. This is something more of a progressive program, I wonder if you can comment around that because it would just seem that timing would be in your favor to do something on accelerated basis?","Second, really any thoughts here on the long-term guide, it's clear it's not just tax, the underlying fundamentals keep improving as well. Is it fair to say that there's potential headroom particularly on margins and revenue for your longer term guidance when you recently put out. And then just that \u2013 just because I still get a lot of pushback on it, I wonder if you might let \u2013 care to express a level of confidence around ability to file and launch Rova-T this year, any reason why it shouldn't be 100%? Thank you.","Richard Gonzalez","Okay. So I'll take most of those and may have Mike chime in on that, on the third one, the Rova-T one, but I will give you some color on that as well. So if I look at 2018, what we have built in is a typical level of share repurchase that we normally have, so we have not built in the incremental share repurchase that we would do.","And I would say, we're not at a point right now were we will make a decision as to whether or not it would be an accelerated kind of an approach or would be more typical of how we buyback shares on more of a ratable consistent basis. And that's something I'd prefer to wait until after our board meeting is done to describe to you, but we will have some commentary after that.","On the long-term guidance fundamentals, I mean clearly when you look at our business, our business added space fundamentals excluding the positive impact that we've seen from tax reform is very strong. And what we have projected on our long-term guidance, I think is certainly in the top tier of our peer group. I would say our fundamentals continue to improve.","The point I made in my comments, I mean we are on the front end of what would be tremendous growth for AbbVie. I think MAVYRET is a good example of the kinds of products that we're bringing to the marketplace and the impact that they can have on patients most importantly, but the impact that they can have financially on the business. And those two in our business, the nice thing about it is they tend to go hand in hand when you bring products that truly make an impact on patients lives, the financial rewards tend to follow.","So we feel good about the fundamentals and I'm not going to give you a new numbers, but I would tell you, I sleep well at night knowing how we're performing and where we're going in the future. So I think that probably gives us some feel for it.","Our confidence on Rova-T has not changed. I mean we went into the Stemcentrx acquisition with a level of enthusiasm around the Stemcentrx platform. But we have to see what the data looks like and we have to have interactions with the regulatory authorities, and so I would say nothing has changed. But I don't know that we can predict more than that. Mike, is there anything you want to add?","Michael Severino","No, I think you covered it, Rick. Certainly there's a huge unmet medical need and the data that we've shown publicly with Rova-T from the early-stage studies show clear activity. So our plans remain unchanged for making good progress with the TRINITY study in third-line or greater. We'll see those data in the second quarter and we will progression there, and our plan remains to file following those data, and the remainder of the program continues to progress as well. Phase III randomized studies in earlier lines of therapy, the I-O combo studies we're doing in partnership with BMS and the BASKET study in particular.","Jeffrey Holford","Thanks very much guys.","Elizabeth Shea","Thanks, Jeff. Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Scala from Cowen.","Steve Scala","Thank you so much. I have two questions. First Bill, you said the tax rate post 2018 would increase gradually to 13%. Can you provide some perspective as to the pace of the increase from the 9% that you're guiding to in 2018? And then on ABT-494, the SELECT-COMPARE trial had a primary completion in October of 2017. It's an important trial given that it's the largest of the SELECT trials. Can you say anything on the safety profile that you've seen in SELECT-COMPARE? Thank you very much.","William Chase","Steve, this is Bill. I think you should just model that pretty much a straight line linear. It really does not impact any one-year more than others. So for modeling purposes, I just pretty much straight line it linearly.","Steve Scala","Thank you.","Michael Severino","And so with respect to SELECT-COMPARE, that study remains blinded. I think what might be causing some confusion about an October 2017 data is that study has two components, traditional response based on ACR and DAS measures, and then a longer term structural component of that program, looking for innovation of structural progression, and the study remains blinded until that structural component is complete. And so those data will be coming in the first half of this year and that's when we would unblind the study and that's when we would talk about the safety profile of that study in individual.","Overall across the program, we continue to feel good about the safety profile we've observed. We see a profile that's very consistent with our expectations both for this molecule and for a molecule that we treat, the sorts of diseases where upadacitinib is being developed.","Steve Scala","Thank you.","Elizabeth Shea","Thanks Steve. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.","Christopher Schott","Great, thanks very much. Just two questions on HUMIRA, maybe the first, a U.S. specific question, help us understand a little bit of the volume versus price components as we think about your 2018 outlook. I guess specifically we're hearing from some your competitors it seems like the dermatology market might be an area that's a bit more competitive on the pricing front in 2018. Actually, just any comments on dynamics there?","My second question was HUMIRA on the international side. I think you mentioned in the comments you are making some proactive actions ahead of biosimilars competition. I wish you could say a little bit what you're doing there and more broadly just updated thoughts about how you see managing the HUMIRA franchise as we think about biosimilars entering the market later this year? Thanks so much.","Richard Gonzalez","Okay, thanks Chris. This is Rick. I think I'll answer the HUMIRA question maybe a bit more broadly because I think every single quarter, as some competitor has a hiccup or claims some level of victory, we have nervousness investors as it relates to HUMIRA. And look I can understand why it's obviously a flagship product of our Company.","But I think it would be helpful to maybe more broadly layout for you how we see HUMIRA in the U.S., and then Bill can answer the specifics around volume and price. Certainly it\u2019s a volume driven business primarily, but Bill can give you more specifics around that. So if you step back and if you look at what are the key parameters that you want to understand of the performance of HUMIRA and the longer-term performance of the brand and its ability to be able to continue to grow.","This is a brand, if you look at the last three or four years, it has grown dramatically. The percent growth rate has come down somewhat as the brand has grown, but if you look at the absolute dollar growth, it's been fairly consistent and extremely healthy. So it starts with what is your position in managed care. And I would say we're now done with all of our negotiations in 2018. Our position is the same. We maintain a very, very strong managed care position in the United States.","The pricing hasn't fundamentally changed for the brand, so there's not any dramatic moves one way or another from that perspective. You look at the overall growth we're projecting. What Bill had described and you can see 2017, 15% growth, and then what we're describing for 2018. The markets themselves \u2013 these are big markets, but they're very attractive markets from a growth standpoint.","So if you look at the overall market growth rate, you should be thinking of it as high single-digits to low double-digits just in the United States. Let\u2019s say 9%, 10%. Fundamental growth, RA more in the mid single-digit market. Rheum, more in the mid single-digit market. Derm, growing about 15%, so the big market growing rapidly. GI growing about 16% overall, so again a big market growing very rapidly.","The next thing you want to look at is what is your first-line share, and what I'm going to quote you is IMS date, which we consider to be the most reliable source of data. And this is data from January through October which is the latest data points that we have. And the reason why first-line is important is that\u2019s the brand that gets the opportunity to put the patient into the highest level of control if that brand does not do that then obviously the patient rotates to something else.","So it's a leading indicator of where your share will go in the future for patients that are well maintained, they stay on the brand. For patients that aren\u2019t well maintained, whatever that brand is they move to an alternative. So if you look at RA, our first-line share is 40%. If you look at PsA, it's 47%.","If you look at AS, it\u2019s 62%, if you look at psoriasis, if you include Otezla, it's 40%. If you exclude Otezla because Otezla really competes in a slightly different segment, it's 54%. If you look at Crohn's and UC, it's 52%. So we have very strong positions as the first-line agent across every single category.","Then the next thing that you want to look at carefully is you want to look at what we describe as first brand, which is essential the naive patient population and switchers. And so if you look at each of the segments and I'm going to do the sub-segments here in a minute. So if you look at RA, SpA, PsA, AS, psoriasis, Crohn's, and UC, we are number one in every single one of those categories.","Our position varies from 25% to well over 50%. You've heard commentary from some of our competitors about where they are, so I\u2019ll give you a little bit color around that, but based on the same data if you take SpA, COSENTYX is number four. If you take PsA, COSENTYX is number four. If you take AS, COSENTYX is number three. If you take psoriasis, COSENTYX is number five. If you take Crohn's, STELARA is number three. If you take UC, STELARA is number five. So as I look at that position, I feel very confident about where HUMIRA sits in our execution.","And then the final thing is when you look at volume, what's happening with our volume? And in every single category, derm, rheum and GI, we're growing our volume significantly. And so I look at the health of HUMIRA and the health of the U.S. business, and I can just have a tremendous amount of confidence in where we're going. On OUS, we have said all along that we expect the brand to peak this year and then start to gradually decline over time.","We've also said that we will compete for volume within certain parameters to try to maintain the volume and ultimately maximize profitability of the brand. So we will be taking proactive actions in countries where that is feasible to do. That's primarily in Southern Europe, so places like Spain, Italy, Portugal. Those markets are controlled primarily by hospitals and so it is our intent to negotiate with those hospitals to be able to put us in a position to be able to maintain our position effectively.","Going forward, we've done some of that when indirect biosimilars entered the marketplace and we were successful in doing that and we have already started that action now in those European markets. So you will see some impact on price, it should be offset in most cases by volume, and that's what we have described as a proactive actions that we will take.","William Chase","Chris, on price volume, as I said in my comments for the quarter, the 15% growth, I think you just think of 10% volume, the remainder being priced. As you look at 2018, where we got a projection of 13% to 14% growth in the U.S. year-over-year that we still expect that mid single-digit price range to stick, which would then imply a volume of high single-digits.","Christopher Schott","Thank you so much for all the color.","Elizabeth Shea","Thanks, Chris. Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Geoff Meacham from Barclays.","Geoffrey Meacham","Good morning, guys, and thanks for the question. Just had a few products specific ones. On the hep C front, outside the U.S., I may have missed it, but was there stocking for MAVYRET? And are there any getting factors for getting full reimbursement across Europe and Japan, and then how do you guys think about price U.S. versus OUS? Is it different today versus how you think initially with VIEKIRA?","And then for Mike, on upadacitinib and atopic dermatitis, I want to just get a sense from you about the scope of the Phase III. I'm curious whether the breakthrough designation really alters at all your thinking in terms of design like for example our shorter duration study things like that? Thanks guys.","Richard Gonzalez","Yes, so I'll take the HCV question. There was no stocking for MAVYRET inside the U.S. or outside the U.S. As far as price OUS, price outside the United States is basically negotiated country-by-country. It's done usually against some benchmark. And how you compare against that benchmark and so each country is different.","We have gotten reimbursement in many of the larger European countries and we've done quite well. So Germany is an example. We have the number one position in Germany. We have the number one position in Spain. We won the tender in the UK. We have the number one position now in Italy. We have launched in Japan. So Japan has approval and we are ramping rapidly in Japan.","The one large country that we have not gotten reimbursement yet is France. That is forthcoming. But I'd say the bulk of the countries were in the process or either have reimbursement and have launched or in the process of getting reimbursement and we'll launch once we have that reimbursement.","Michael Severino","Okay, this is Mike. With respect to upadacitinib and atopic dermatitis, we feel very good about those data. And we think that the Breakthrough Therapy Designation reflects clearly the degree of activity that we've shown today and so we are currently actively designing that Phase III program.","The Breakthrough Therapy Designation program has in our mind has been very successful and is very helpful because what it gives you is a lot of direct interaction with the FDA, including very senior members of the FDA that you wouldn't typically have access to at the current stage of development program.","So we're having those conversations now. I think it is very reasonable to assume that those conversations are going to inform, the Phase III program for upadacitinib in atopic dermatitis. That is very helpful to us in designing the program that will lead to registration in the U.S. Of course, we are also going to design a program that leads to registration in other jurisdictions around the world and all that work is currently underway.","So we'll start those studies as we said in the first half of this year and as we get a little bit closer to study start, we'll be able to talk to you a bit more about what that program is going to look like.","Geoffrey Meacham","Okay, thanks.","Elizabeth Shea","Thanks Geoff. Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Geoff Porges from Leerink.","Geoffrey Porges","Thank you very much, and again, congratulations on the results. So a few quick questions, first on HCV, your competitors suggested that they expect the U.S. market to stabilize sometime in the middle of the year both in terms of volume and also in terms of the price or the treatment cost for patient, wondering if that\u2019s your expectation and what you're seeing.","Secondly on VENCLEXTA, could you give us any indication of what the path might be to first-line, is obviously is very encouraging data for VENCLEXTA in combination with IMBRUVICA in CLL and wondering if it's feasible that you might do a first-line study.","And then lastly, Bill if you just talk a little bit about leverage and that\u2019s naturally de-levering the company, and of course, you\u2019ve got all of this cash flow. So how are you thinking about how you might alter the leverage of the company in the future and does that affect your appetite for M&A? Thanks.","Richard Gonzalez","Okay. So I\u2019ll take HCV, and then Mike can take the second, and Bill can take the third. So HCV, if we look at the market in the U.S., looking at the two parameters we are describing, one is treatment volumes. We continue to see treatment volumes ebb and flow a bit, but I'd say generally we are assuming treatment volumes tail off a bit. We saw some of that over the holidays. It's a little difficult to predict whether or not it was more holiday driven, but I\u2019d say it's down 5% to 8% from where it was prior.","And this has been something that has moved around a little bit over time. I would agree that it is our expectation that the volume should stabilize going forward. But I'd also say that there could be some single-digit kind of pressure, downward pressure. We obviously priced the product where we described it in the public channel market at the level that the current pricing was and we have maintained that pricing going forward. We have been seeking parity contracts \u2013 non-exclusive contracts with the payers. And therefore, pricing has not been a big issue for us. So I would expect and hope price stability going forward.","Geoffrey Porges","Great.","Michael Severino","Regarding the question with respect to VENCLEXTA and past to front-line. So we have actually two studies already underway in the front-line setting. One in the younger, more fit patient population, one in an older patient population with more comorbid illnesses on average. Those studies all look at combinations, combinations with CD20s like GAZYVA or RITUXAN. And there are, in some of those studies, VENCLEXTA and IMBRUVICA combination arms as well. So we're exploring multiple combinations in the front-line already.","William Chase","And Geoff on the balance sheet, look we are pretty comfortable with our balance sheet, right now we've got as Rick said robust cash flow. We're blessed with a LRP that has very, very robust growth on the topline and obviously the bottom line. So we will have a natural deleveraging just by virtue of the fact that the business is growing very rapidly. Therefore, our number one priority would not be to take down the absolute amount of leverage we have.","You may see us as we have a maturity, take that maturity out obviously to the extent that it's wise to do, but our number one priority would not be to take the overall leverage down. We think we have adequate capacity to pursue any M&A of the magnitude that we'd be looking at in the near-term. And as Rick said, our cash balances are going to grow pretty fast on top of that, so I think we're in pretty good shape from a balance sheet standpoint.","Elizabeth Shea","All right. Operator, we will take the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Gerberry from Bank of America.","Jason Gerberry","Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking my question. First question just on the tax guidance out the five years, just curious is it sort of \u2013 the only reason you gave out the five years, it\u2019s hard to know what will happen in five years time or should we read into anything with regards to your portfolio composition changing in HUMIRA in five years time, potentially changing as a proportion of your profit mix?","And then my second question on VENCLEXTA, can you just give us a little color on how you'd envision in the relapsed\/refractory setting the pace of reaching peak market share. I know I think in the last quarterly update, I think IMBRUVICA had about 70% of the second-line setting, so just sort of can you walk through the mechanics and the timeframe you anticipate getting the peak penetration in the relapsed\/refractory setting? Thanks.","William Chase","Sure. So the purpose of giving some long range guidance on that tax rate. Look, I think it was important for us to put out the right rate for you guys to model from a non-GAAP perspective on tax. That for 2018 is that approximately the 9% number we gave. That said, our business mix will change over the coming years most notably with products driving increased U.S. revenue and income. I think you should look at products like IMBRUVICA, VENCLEXTA et cetera. And that will have the impact of taking the rate up. And that's why I say gradually as those businesses grow, it will have an impact of lifting the tax rate?","Richard Gonzalez","Okay. On VENCLEXTA, I think what you\u2019re describing is an important phenomenon. So IMBRUVICA does have roughly about 70% of the treated population in relapsed\/refractory today. We would not expect the patients will be \u2013 well maintained patients will be taken off of IMBRUVICA.","So as those patients were to fail or progress then they would be given other treatment options and we would expect based on the data that VENCLEXTA will get a significant piece of that business and of that patient population. So by definition it means that it will be a bit more gradual as it grows because there'll be this trade-off between IMBRUVICA's current position.","Obviously, roughly 30% of those patients that are on some other kind of treatment today. There are some of those patients that are on treatment at all, which aren\u2019t represented in that number. Some of those will progress. So it's a mix of all those things. But I would expect VENCLEXTA will ramp based on the available population within that population will ramp within that fairly quickly, but then over time it will be the progression of those patients going forward that become available.","Jason Gerberry","Got it. Thank you.","Elizabeth Shea","Thanks, Jason. Operator, we have time for one more question. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today is from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert","Thanks. Bill, back on tax this year, the non-GAAP rate for this year and up through the 13% rate, will the cash rate approximate those levels as well? And secondly, Rick I know you're not changing long-term guidance, but conceptually would it be fair to assume that the tax benefits that you now know about sort of flow through fully or would you reassess sort of reinvestment rates, and Mike lastly anything new on what's next for 414? Thanks.","William Chase","Yes. So I think from a business perspective over that five-year period you should think of the cash rate looking very similar to that rate. Obviously, the one discrepancy or exception to that would be the fact that we will be paying off our $4.5 billion payable over eight years and some of that\u2019s backend loaded and given that we've taken that charge at 2017. The cash flow will be hitting in the next five years, so that\u2019s one area that would be a little different. But other than that over the five-year period [indiscernible] pretty close.","Richard Gonzalez","Yes. On the long-term guidance and the tax benefit, obviously we would expect the tax benefit to be able to flow through over time. Now there's an interrelationship between what you would do from an M&A standpoint. So if you were to acquire something, that had a significant R&D burn going forward just like we did as an example with Stemcentrx and risankizumab, obviously you would dial in those R&D expenses. But I would say generally speaking, you should view the tax benefit as an incremental benefit that we flow through.","Michael Severino","And with respect to 414, that's our antibody drug conjugate in glioblastoma multiforme, so primary brain cancer. That's in our front-line study right now. That study has overall survival as a primary endpoint. So we would be sufficient to support approval, obviously based on the results. That study is an event driven trial. So we can't predict the exact time when that would read out, but we'd expect to have more information from that front-line study sometime next year.","End of Q&A","Elizabeth Shea","Thanks, Gregg. That concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.","Operator","Thank you.

Welcome to the AbbVie First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operation Instructions] I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Severino, Executive Vice President of Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer; and Bill Chase, Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, I wanted to remind you that some statements made today are or may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.

AbbVie undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.","On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website.","Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2017 earnings call. AbbVie delivered strong performance with double-digit top- and bottom-line growth exceeding our guidance for the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.28 were up more than 11% versus the first quarter of 2016, and global operational sales growth was 10.1%, demonstrating the continued strength of our business. Humira continues to deliver exceptional performance with 15.8% global operational growth in the quarter. In the U.S. Humira grew 22.8%, driven by robust underlying demand, including prescription volume growth of 12%. Humira holds the number-one market share position across all three categories.","Internationally, operational sales growth was 4.6%, driven by market growth across, again, all three categories. We continue to expect mid-single-digit operational sales growth for the full year internationally, despite the impact from new competitive entrants and indirect biosimilar competition which has been in the European markets now for several years.","We continue to see strong momentum and growth from Imbruvica with global sales in the first quarter of $551 million, an increase of nearly 45% over the prior year. This performance was driven by continued uptake in first-line CLL, where we continue to see strong performance since our approval. In fact, the most recent market share data indicates that we now hold the leading position in new patient starts in the front-line segment, with more than 21% of patients starting Imbruvica as frontline CLL therapy. And given Imbruvica's duration of therapy, more than 30% of total treated front-line patients now use Imbruvica. We're also seeing continued strong market leadership in the second-line-plus setting across all indications. In addition to our commercial progress, we've advanced our efforts to expand the list of Imbruvica approved indications. This includes recent approval in relapsed\/refractory marginal zone lymphoma and our recent regulatory submission for chronic graft-versus-host-disease.","We also continue to see good progress with the launch of Venclexta in our narrow initial indication of relapsed\/refractory CLL patients with the 17p deletion. Our second-line-plus market share is now approximately 20% in the U.S. Internationally, Venclexta is off to a good start, and as we've now launched into the two of the larger markets, Germany and France. We also saw a continued strong performance from several other products, including Creon and Duodopa. So overall, we're extremely pleased with our commercial performance and financial results for the quarter, and we're off to another strong start in 2017.","Now moving on to our pipeline. As we disclosed last week, the Phase 3 studies evaluating veliparib in squamous non-small cell lung cancer and early stage triple-negative breast cancer did not achieve their primary endpoints, and therefore we won't be moving forward with these indications. This program carried a higher degree of risk, because we were testing a new hypothesis, that hypothesis being whether PARP inhibition enhances chemotherapy-induced DNA damage. While the outcome was not what we hoped for, we have not considered veliparib one of our nearer-term growth drivers.","We have a number of late-stage de-risked assets in our pipeline. As we look forward to the remainder of 2017, we're exciting about the forthcoming clinical development and regulatory milestones. Mike will discuss our R&D pipeline in a more detail in just a few moments, but I'll briefly give you some highlights of the noteworthy events.","Before the end of the year, you will see data from a dozen pivotal trials, including data readouts for our two late-stage immunology programs. Specifically, you'll see data from the first three of six registrational studies for our selective JAK1 inhibitor, ABT-494, with results from two of these studies coming in the next few months, and we'll see data from our three pivotal studies in risankizumab in psoriasis later this year.","In Oncology, we'll see data from Venclexta Phase 3 MURANO trial, which will support our regulatory application for broader use in the relapsed\/refractory CLL population. We'll also see potential registrational data from a study of ABT-414 in second-line glioblastoma multiforme. We're also expecting several additional Imbruvica data readouts based on interim or final analysis across the number of studies. And we'll see results from the TRINITY study, where Rova-T is being evaluated as third-line treatment in small cell lung cancer.","In the area of women's health, we'll begin to see late-stage data from our Elagolix program in uterine fibroids, with results from the pivotal study expected late in the year. We also expect regulatory action on several programs, including U.S., EU and Japan approvals for our next-generation HCV offering, and we are nearing the completion of our Phase 3 program for Elagolix in endometriosis and are on track for regulatory submission next quarter.","There are so many significant pipeline advancements expected this year, 2017 is shaping up to be an important year for AbbVie, and one that will further reinforce the strength of our pipeline. So as I said a moment ago, we are encouraged with our strong commercial execution and financial performance. We've built a compelling de-risked pipeline, which continues to progress well and is poised to fuel growth over the long term, and we're off to an exceptional start this year and are well-positioned to continue to deliver top-tier financial performance in 2017 and well beyond.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?","Michael E. Severino - AbbVie, Inc.","Thank you, Rick. Today I'll highlight recent pipeline updates and discuss some of the key milestones we anticipate for the remainder of 2017.","I'll start with our hem-onc programs, where we continue to make significant progress with both Imbruvica and Venclexta. Starting with Imbruvica, as we've outlined, expanding into new indications is an important driver of future growth. Earlier this year we added relapsed\/refractory marginal zone lymphoma to our growing list of approved uses, and we continue to make progress with other indications as well.","During the quarter, we submitted a supplemental new drug application for the use of Imbruvica in patients with chronic graft-versus-host-disease who failed prior systemic therapy. GVHD is a severe and potentially life-threatening complication that can occur in patients who have undergone an allogeneic stem cell or bone marrow transplant. There are currently limited treatment options for this disease, and if approved, Imbruvica would be the first and only therapy specifically indicated for chronic GVHD. In Phase 2 data presented at the end of last year, 67% of patients who failed steroid therapy responded to treatment with Imbruvica, with one-third of the responders achieving a complete response and almost two-thirds substantially reducing steroid use. Based on these data, we expect a regulatory decision in the second half of the year.","Later this year, we anticipate several key data readouts for Imbruvica, including data from an interim analysis in front-line mantle cell lymphoma, as well as additional potential interim analyses in other forms of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.","Moving now to Venclexta. We're expecting data from the MURANO study evaluating the combination of Venclexta and Rituxan later this year, which we believe will support a broader label in relapsed\/refractory CLL and help establish Venclexta as a foundational therapy in this patient population. The Phase 3 program evaluating Venclexta in front-line CLL is also ongoing, with studies been run in younger, more fit patients as well as older patients with comorbidities. These studies, as well as other combination studies with Imbruvica, are important parts of the Venclexta strategy to drive toward chemo-free regimens in CLL. We anticipate key data from the CLL14 study in older patients with comorbid medical conditions to be available in 2018.","Beyond our core strategy in CLL, we are making great progress with our development programs to expand Venclexta across multiple hematologic malignancies. We have Phase 3 studies ongoing in multiple myeloma as well as AML, where we have received Breakthrough Therapy Designation. And these studies are progressing well, with key data becoming available in the 2019 timeframe. Later this year, we are also expecting additional data readouts from Phase 2 studies in indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, which will inform decisions regarding advancement in these indications.","I'll now turn to our solid tumor programs, where we continue to make good progress with our late-stage programs, Rova-T and ABT-414, as well as with our early-stage oncology pipeline. Starting with Rova-T, our registrational trial in third-line-plus small cell lung cancer, the TRINITY study, continues to progress nicely, and we expect data later this year. Our submission will follow soon thereafter, enabling a commercial launch in 2018.","In addition to TRINITY, we have a comprehensive development program in place for Rova-T to evaluate this promising therapy in earlier lines of treatment in small cell lung cancer, as well as in other tumor types that express DLL3. The Rova-T program includes additional studies currently underway in small cell lung cancer, including MARU, a Phase 3 study evaluating standard chemotherapy followed by Rova-T in the front-line setting, and a mid-stage combination study evaluating Rova-T with Opdivo and \u2013 with Opdivo and Yervoy in small cell lung cancer. And this quarter, we will also start the TAHOE study, a Phase 3 trial in second-line small cell lung cancer.","Beyond small cell lung cancer, the neuroendocrine tumor basket study is progressing nicely, and we anticipate beginning to see early data from this study towards the end of this year.","As we've discussed, the acquisition of Stemcentrx not only provided AbbVie a late-stage asset in Rova-T, but brought a highly attractive discovery and early development platform as well. In addition to Rova-T, we have four Stemcentrx assets in the clinic, and we are on track to transition several additional programs into human trials this year, adding to our growing oncology pipeline, which includes more than 35 late preclinical or early clinical stage assets.","Beyond Rova-T and our other Stemcentrx assets, we're continuing to make progress with our solid tumor programs, including our antibody drug conjugate for glioblastoma multiforme, ABT-414, which was granted Fast Track Designation earlier this month. At the upcoming ASCO meeting, we plan to present full data from the Phase 1 study of ABT-414 in glioblastoma, including overall survival and progression-free survival data. And later this year, we'll see data from the Phase 2 study in second line GBM that, if positive, would support regulatory submission.","In our early-stage oncology pipeline, we continue to build capabilities and explore new technologies that will extend our reach in the solid tumor market. We're making good progress with our next-generation immuno-oncology programs and other novel approaches such as our bispecific technology, with a number of assets having recently entered the clinic and more study starts expected through the remainder of 2017.","Moving now to our HCV program, where we recently received priority review from the FDA for our pan-genotypic next-generation HCV therapy. In the quarter we also received EMA accelerated assessment and priority review in Japan. Last week at the International Liver Congress we presented new results from our Phase 3 program, including data from the EXPEDITION-1 and ENDURANCE-3 studies, which together with previously reported data reinforce our next-generation therapies' potential to provide high cure rates and a shorter treatment duration for the majority of patients across all genotypes, including patients with compensated cirrhosis and those with genotype 3 infection.","Results from EXPEDITION-1 demonstrated that 99% of patients with compensated cirrhosis achieved SVR12 with 12 weeks of treatment across genotypes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6. We also presented data from ENDURANCE-3 in patients with genotype 3, the second most common (16:22-16:33) genotype globally and the most challenging to treat. These results showed that with just eight weeks of treatment, 95% of genotype 3 patients without cirrhosis and who are new to treatment achieved SVR12 with our next-generation therapy.","We're excited about the high cure rates across all major genotypes and the results in difficult-to-treat patients that we've seen in our Phase 3 program, and remain confident that our pan-genotypic once-daily ribavirin-free HCV therapy will be competitively positioned within this market. We remain on track for regulatory approval in the U.S., EU, and Japan later this year.","Moving now to our immunology programs, where we have two very promising late-stage assets, risankizumab and ABT-494, each with the potential to significantly advance standard of care in a number of immune-mediated conditions. Risankizumab, our anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody licensed from Boehringer Ingelheim, has the potential to provide best-in-class efficacy and increased dosing convenience with quarterly administration.","Results from the Phase 2 study of risankizumab in psoriasis were recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine. These data show that selective blockade of IL-23 with risankizumab was associated with a superior clinical response compared to Stelara. In this study, approximately 2.5 times as many patients achieved PASI 100 with risankizumab compared with those receiving Stelara. The Phase 3 program in psoriasis is well underway, and we look forward to seeing data from three of the pivotal studies later this year, with commercialization expected in 2019.","Earlier this month, we also published results from a proof-of-concept Phase 2 study of risankizumab in Crohn's disease. Results from this study show that patients receiving risankizumab achieved higher clinical and endoscopic remission rates than placebo, suggesting that blocking IL-23 could be a very promising therapeutic approach in Crohn's disease. 52-week data from the open-label maintenance portion of this trial will be shared in a late-breaking oral presentation at the upcoming DDW meeting in May. Phase 3 studies in Crohn's disease will be starting soon.","This year we'll also see Phase 2 data in psoriatic arthritis, with Phase 3 studies expected to begin in the first half of 2018. Additionally, we are expecting to begin a Phase 2 for risankizumab in ulcerative colitis in the second half of the year.","Moving now to our selective JAK1 inhibitor, ABT-494, where we continue to make significant progress with our development programs in RA and inflammatory bowel diseases. At the upcoming DDW meeting, we'll be presenting data from the Phase 2 CELEST study in Crohn's disease, showing that treatment with ABT-494 demonstrated endoscopic improvement and clinical benefit as induction therapy in patients with moderate to severe refractory Crohn's disease. Based on these strong Phase 2 results, we'll be initiating a Phase 3 program later this year. We have two additional mid-stage programs for ABT-494, including an ongoing Phase 2 study in atopic dermatitis and a soon-to-begin Phase 2 study in ulcerative colitis.","Turning our attention to rheumatoid arthritis, we expect to begin seeing data from the first of six Phase 3 RA studies in the coming months, with top-line data from the SELECT-NEXT trial in patients who have failed conventional DMARDs expected in June, and data from the SELECT-BEYOND study in biologic inadequate responders expected later in the summer. We plan to present full data from both of these studies at a medical meeting later this year.","We believe ABT-494 has the potential to be best-in-class with an optimized benefit risk profile, and we are particularly excited about this asset's potential in the difficult-to-treat anti-TNF inadequate responder population, a growing segment of the RA market representing roughly 35% of the biologic treated population.","And finally, in the area of women's health, we are nearing completion of the Phase 3 program for elagolix in endometriosis and are on track for regulatory submission next quarter. In addition to the endometriosis program, we have Phase 3 studies underway in uterine fibroids. This program is investigating the effect of elagolix on heavy bleeding related to this highly prevalent condition. We anticipate beginning to see data from this Phase 3 program late in the year.","Earlier this month we presented detailed results from the Phase 2 study in uterine fibroids at the meeting of the Society of Endometriosis and Uterine Disorders. These data demonstrated that treatment with elagolix provided superior efficacy and rapid control of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids compared to placebo, as well as improved quality of life. Treatment with elagolix was well tolerated, with hormonal add-back therapy substantially attenuating the side effects of elagolix on bone mineral density and hot flashes. Importantly, there were no abnormal endometrial findings, demonstrating that elagolix has potential as a chronic, uninterrupted treatment for this condition. We remain excited about this potential new medicine for women with both of these highly prevalent conditions, where there are few effective treatment options.","So in summary, we've continued to see significant evolution of our mid- and late-stage pipelines, and we look forward to many important data readouts, phase transitions, regulatory submissions, and approvals later this year.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on our first quarter performance. Bill?","William J. Chase - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Mike. As Rick said, we had another quarter of outstanding performance, delivering strong top- and bottom-line growth. Total net revenues for the first quarter were $6.5 billion, up 10.1% operationally, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.28, up 11.3% compared to the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted EPS came in $0.02 favorable to our previously communicated guidance range for the quarter, the result of higher than forecasted sales and timing of spending.","Humira delivered another quarter of strong sales growth with global sales of $4.1 billion, up 15.8% operationally. In the U.S., Humira sales increased 22.8% compared to the prior year, driven by volume growth in excess of 12% plus price. Wholesaler inventory levels were consistent between the quarters at less than half a month.","Humira's growth has been fueled by robust demand across all three segments: rheum, gastro, and derm. In rheumatology, Humira remains the number one prescribed biologic. In the gastro segment, we continued to see double-digit prescription growth in the quarter despite new competition. Humira holds the market leadership position in treatment-na\u00efve patients for both Crohn's disease and UC, where nearly half of new patients start on Humira. And in dermatology, double-digit volume growth was driven by our market leadership in psoriasis as well as strong adoption rates for HS, which was launched in late 2015.","International Humira sales were $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 4.6% on an operational basis and in line with our expectations. We continue to see good growth despite the entry of new competitors and indirect biosimilar competition, which continues to track in line with our expectations.","Global Imbruvica net revenues for the first quarter were $551 million, up nearly 45% over the first quarter of last year, driven by penetration into first-line CLL and continued strong performance in other approved indications. We remain on track to achieve our full-year expectation for global reported revenues of greater than $2.4 billion, with sales in the U.S. of more than $2 billion.","Global Viekira sales in the first quarter were $263 million, down versus the prior year. As we've previously communicated, we have seen market share loss and price erosion due to competitive dynamics within the HCV market. Global sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease, grew 19.8% on an operational basis in the quarter, and we also saw strong operational sales growth in the quarter from Creon, which was up 22.8%.","Turning to the P&L profile for the quarter, adjusted gross margin was 79.9% of sales compared to 81.3% in the prior year. On a year-over-year basis, gross margin as a percentage of sales was negatively impacted by partnership accounting and exchange. Due to the seasonality of certain products, our gross margin ratio in the first and fourth quarters is typically lower than the second and third quarters. We continue to forecast a full-year gross margin ratio of approximately 81%.","Adjusted R&D was 16.9% of sales, in support of our ongoing pipeline programs in oncology, immunology, HCV and other areas. On a year-over-year basis, R&D as a percentage of sales increased due to the spend related to the Stemcentrx and risankizumab deals, both of which closed in the second quarter of last year. Adjusted SG&A was 20.7% of sales in the first quarter, down 190 basis points versus the prior year, driven by sales leverage and operational efficiencies.","The operating margin profile was impacted by R&D investment related to Stemcentrx and risankizumab, as well as the adverse impact of foreign currency. Adjusting for these items, the adjusted operating margin profile grew by 120 basis points versus the prior year. We continue to forecast a full-year operating margin ratio of approximately 43%.","Net interest expense was $247 million and the adjusted tax rate was 18.2% in the quarter. The first quarter tax rate benefited from the adoption of new accounting rules for the treatment of taxes on equity compensation. This impact is most pronounced in the first quarter, given the timing of equity grants, and was contemplated in our guidance. First quarter adjusted earnings per share, excluding intangible amortization expense and other specified items, was $1.28, up 11.3% year-over-year.","As we look ahead to the second quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $1.39 and $1.41. Our second quarter adjusted EPS guidance excludes roughly $0.19 of non-cash amortization and other specified items. We are forecasting reported revenue growth in the second quarter of between 7% and 8%. Holding exchange rates constant at a current level, we would expect foreign exchange to have an unfavorable impact on sales growth of approximately 1% in the second quarter.","For U.S. Humira, we expect sales growth in the second quarter in the mid-teens to high teens. Internationally, we expect mid-single-digit operational growth for Humira, with approximately 3% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, resulting in low-single-digit reported growth. For Imbruvica, we expect U.S. sales growth in the second quarter to approach 35%. And with respect to the tax rate, future quarters should be modeled at above 19%. We remain on track to achieve our full-year guidance, including operational revenue growth of approximately 10% and adjusted earnings per share between $5.44 and $5.54.","So in closing, we are very pleased with AbbVie's strong performance in the quarter. We've driven top-tier revenue and EPS growth, while also advancing our strategic priorities and our pipeline. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Bill. We'll now open the call for Q&A. Operator, we'll take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Jami, your line is open.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you very much. Rick, I have a theoretical question for you. We have written about AbbVie separating into two separate businesses for reporting purposes in order to close what we see as a substantial value gap, a Humira company and a growth company. The idea is to set up Humira as an earn-out company from which to pay a recurring special dividend to shareholders to alleviate persistent fears from biosimilar competition, while drawing attention to your substantial pipeline story.","Assuming some form of corporate tax reform is passed, and I know that's far from a certain thing, how realistic is this scenario, and what is your appetite internally to do something like this? Do you have other priorities for cash, like M&A, stock buyback, or debt pay-down? Are those more important than a special dividend, does that even make sense? Because it seems to me that investors still see Humira is just a huge risk versus a monster cash flow generator. Just curious for your thoughts are? Thanks.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Hi, Jami, yes. Well, first thanks for the question. Maybe let me come at it from a broader perspective first, and then I'll specifically talk about how we think about it as it relates to Humira and AbbVie. If you listen to the framework of tax reform that came out yesterday, I'd say generally speaking, I find that incredibly encouraging for companies like ours, U.S.-based companies.","It certainly would put us in a position where we'd be far more competitive to our foreign competitors, which make up a significant part of our peer competitive company base and it would certainly give us a lot more encouragement to invest in the U.S. and create U.S. jobs. So I find the discussion encouraging and I think it would be extremely beneficial for companies, certainly our industry and across other industries.","Specifically as it relates to AbbVie, I'd say first I've read your report. I thought it was extremely well done and I'll tell you that I agree wholeheartedly with the thesis that you laid out in the report. And as you point out, we have a business that generates tremendous cash flow, and we anticipate that that cash flow is sustainable over the long term. That cash flow certainly, as it is generated, far outweighs what we would envision as what is required for us to reinvest back in the business. We're certainly going to reinvest back in the business, as we have historically, but I'd say as we project forward, we would be building cash offshore. And so, certainly it is in excess of what we would anticipate we would need for strategic reinvestment back in the business.","I'd also say that as you point out in your report, we're significantly undervalued. We're undervalued from the standpoint of Humira and the benefit that it drives in the business, and certainly that's driven by the concentration that we have in Humira, and oddly enough, as we continue to drive Humira and show the success with it, I think that increases that pressure. Secondly, I'd say we're tremendously undervalued as you look at the pipeline that we have. As I mentioned in my comments, you're going to see a dozen pivotal trial results that are going to read out over the course of 2017. There aren't many companies in our industry that have those kind of catalysts going forward.","And so as we look at it, if we were to get tax reform where we could get better access or more cost-effective access to our offshore cash, we're certainly going to be looking at ways to be able to appropriately deploy that cash. Dividend has always been important for us, and I can tell you we're committed to a growing dividend. The idea of a special dividend, I think, is a very unique idea and one that I think has strong merit. Certainly share buyback is another way to do that, but returning cash to shareholders to reward them for the tremendous success that Humira has had and will continue to have going forward is a high priority for us.","So I'm encouraged, I hope we can move tax reform going forward in 2017 or early 2018, and once there is clarity around that, then we'll be looking at what is the appropriate approach to make sure that investors are rewarded for the benefit of the cash flow that Humira is going to generate.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Just if I can follow up, Rick, in terms of priorities for cash, I mean many investors would look at the Humira concentration and say the only way to offset that is through further bolt-on acquisitions. Do you agree with that, or are you pleased with what you have and you would \u2013 in terms of usage of cash, just curious how you would prioritize? I mean, is it returning cash to shareholders, is that a higher priority right now than paying down debt, deploying cash to further acquisitions, how do you think about that?","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Well, as far as debt is concerned, I'd say it is not our intent to significantly pay down debt in the current environment. In the event that interest wasn't deductible, then I'd say that priority obviously would change going forward, but I'd say that's not a high priority for us. We believe we'll grow into the appropriate ratios; our credit rating is obviously important to us, and \u2013 but when you look at the growth of our business, we clearly think we can grow into that.","As far as bolt-on acquisitions, what really we focus on is, we have a strategic roadmap of how we're trying to operate within the franchises. For the most part, I'd say we have the major platforms that we need. So we don't envision the need for large platforms. We did that work with both Pharmacyclics and with Stemcentrx, and we think we're well-positioned for that. There are certainly additional assets that we'd look for, but I'd say they look more like the BI kind of transaction or individual kinds of products or smaller groups of products would be a higher priority for us going forward. And so, as I said, I think there'll be significant excess cash that will build up over time, and I would say returning that cash to shareholders in some appropriate way will be a high priority for us.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Jami. Operator, we'll take the next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Holford from Jefferies. Jeff, your line is open.","Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC","Hi, thanks very much for taking my questions. I just have two for you. First of all, on ABT-494, I wonder if you could talk about your confidence in the safety and efficacy of this asset. Basically, in light of the setback that we've seen with baricitinib and any color you could give us on potentially why your asset might avoid some of the issues that they may have seen that's triggered the CRL? And then secondly, we do have an upcoming catalyst in terms of Humira patents with the IPR decision on the '135 patent. Wonder if you could give us a sense of your level of confidence around the outcome of that decision, and then also just the negative and positive implications in either case of the outcome? Thank you.","Michael E. Severino - AbbVie, Inc.","Jeff, this is Mike. I'll take the first part of that question. So obviously we've been following the situation very, very closely. Of course, we don't have access to the complete response letter or knowledge of Lilly's conversation with regulators. But we do have a very clear understanding of our own program, our own data, and our own extensive conversations with regulators here in the U.S. and in major jurisdictions around the world. And based on that, we remain confident in our program and don't see any read-through from the Lilly situation.","We've designed a very comprehensive and robust Phase 3 program that will thoroughly characterize the efficacy and safety profile of both of the doses of ABT-494 that are being studied in Phase 3. And we remain confident in the data that we've seen, our Phase 2 data, we're very strong not only from an efficacy, but also from a safety perspective.","An important issue here is dose selection, and we designed a very robust Phase 2b program that explored a wide range of doses across different patient populations, because dose response is not necessarily the same in an earlier population or an TNF-inadequate responder population, for example. And we ran Phase 2 studies in both of those patient populations. That allowed us to select doses that we think optimize benefit\/risk, and as I said, we've designed a Phase 3 program that will fully demonstrate that benefit\/risk and support regulatory decisions. So our level of confidence or enthusiasm on ABT-494 remains high and hasn't changed a bit this past week.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Okay. Jeff, this is Rick. On the IPR, as we've said in previous calls, I mean we're in active litigation now, so we're not going to talk a lot about specifics around this. What I would say to you is, if you look at our level of confidence in what we've described to the market about our ability to protect Humira, it remains the same. And that confidence was built around a large portfolio of IP, it was never contingent upon any one set of IP or any single set of patents or individual patents. We have a large portfolio of formulation patents that have come under challenge and have been successful and successfully navigated through those challenges. We have now the beginning of these dosing patents, we have a large portfolio of dosing patents. We have dosing patents beyond '135 in RA, so beyond the ones being challenged. And so I'd say our level of confidence in the outcome, the overall outcome that we anticipated remains the same, and it remains high.","Having said that, if I look at the pure statistics around IPR decisions, I would say the statistics are against you, right? More times than not, they're not upheld at an individual level. So \u2013 and I'm not going to speculate on what we think is going to happen in this one, we're going to get that answer fairly soon. I'm sure that if it's a positive reaction, we'll get a positive result, and it's not going to \u2013 if it's a negative reaction, we'll get a negative result. I think investors, what they need to focus on is the longer-term perspective, and I think what we have described to the market has played out consistently with what we described, both from a litigation timeframe standpoint and the broadness of our IP. And whoever \u2013 whatever biosimilars want to enter this market, they're going to have to navigate their way through that IP. And I still feel as confident as I did when we communicated that to you back in 2015.","Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC","Thanks very much.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff. Operator, we'll take the next question.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is form Chris Schott from JPMC. Chris, your line is open.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks very much for the questions. Just had two regarding the TNF market. So first, can you just elaborate a little bit more on the U.S. kind of immunology market dynamics you're seeing right now? I think some of your competitors were highlighting a slowdown in the category in Q1; you obviously had very strong numbers. So just a little bit more about what you're seeing in terms of overall market dynamics, something about category growth versus the share that you're able to achieve here?","My second question was on the contracting cycle we're entering into. Just any more granularity on what portion of your business is already contracted out through 2018, versus how much is up for renewal, as we enter this next contracting season? I think you mentioned in the 3Q call that a good portion of the business was contracted for both 2017 and 2018, but just trying to get a little bit more granularity as we think about some of the news flow over the next few quarters? Thanks so much.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Okay. I mean, as far as the TNF market dynamics, they're obviously being affected by two major factors. One is what we've discussed in I guess the last two calls now, the impact that is happening as it relates to Enbrel in the marketplace. And then the second is really an IMS reporting issue, where IMS, a fairly significant account had blinded their data back in the summer of last year I believe. It is an account that we have very high share in, so we're over-indexed in that particular account. And although we're trying to make adjustments, or they're trying to make adjustments to the data, it obviously is depressing both the category and depressing what IMS reports as it relates to Humira.","And so, that's just an anomaly in the data. It's going to correct itself as we lap it, and I think actually IMS is going to try to correct it at some point here going forward. They are publishing some correction factors now, and we obviously do the correction internally, because we have our own data that we know what is represented in this particular account, so we can add back that data into the overall market.","And I'd say generally speaking, Humira continues to perform just like it has historically. In fact, if you look at \u2013 it's interesting, if you look at the last nine quarters in the U.S., I think on average, those nine quarters, we've delivered 22.4%. So Q1 is not any kind of an anomaly. It's right in line with what we would've expected. The majority of that growth is volume driven.","You have to remember that in our case, as we look at the market from a quarter standpoint, we know exactly the units that we've shipped, we obviously know exactly the revenue that we've generated. We have very high specificity around what the inventory levels are in the wholesaler channel, and we obviously know what the calculations are for price. So we can dissect this performance very accurately, and I'd tell you that Humira continues to perform extremely well. Overall market share in Q1 is stable, I'd say slightly down in psoriasis, just down a tiny bit, and slightly up in RA. So those two are netting themselves out with stable market share. One of things that we look at very carefully is the capture rate of new patients, and that is stable to slightly up.","And then obviously if you look at the performance of the brand in the U.S., and it's tremendous. So, I think we're still very, very comfortable with how the U.S. is performing, and we expect that performance to continue going forward, despite the fact that we are seeing new entrants into the marketplace.","Internationally, we continue to perform as we have last year. I'd say first quarter looks a lot like last year. If you look at our overall revenue growth it's 4.5%, 4.6%. If you adjust for Venezuela, you're talking about high-single-digit volume growth. And you have to remember, that's despite the fact that there have been biosimilars now in the marketplace, indirect biosimilars in the marketplace, for an extended period of time. Remicade biosimilars have been in for a long time, and now Enbrel biosimilars have been in the market for a substantial period of time as well. So that gives you some idea of how we're competing in that indirect market, but I'd say we're pleased with what we see in that marketplace going forward. It's tracking as we'd anticipated.","As far as contracting, I don't believe we have actually ever communicated what the split is between those that are 2017 and 2018 contracts. But I'd say, generally speaking we feel good about our contract position going forward into 2018. So I don't anticipate any change in our position as it relates to our formulary positions in the United States in 2018.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thank you, Chris. Operator, we'll take the next question.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Marc Goodman from UBS. Marc, your line is open.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Morning. Two questions. First, can you just give us the latest thoughts on what's going on in the ACV market in the three different regions, and how you think that's going to play out over the next year or two? And then second, can you just remind us for elagolix, what's the hook for that product and why we're excited about it? Thanks.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Okay. So, Marc, this is Rick. I guess I'll cover both of those questions. So maybe just repeat what you said about the three different regions. What were you referring to?","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Well, I was just saying that in hepatitis C, if you could just kind of go into what's happening in the three regions, what you're seeing, what are the dynamics, and how you think that'll change over the next year or two?","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","And regions, you mean the U.S., Europe and Japan, is that what you mean?","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah, correct.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Okay. I'm sorry. Yeah. Well, I'll tell you the dynamics. There's certainly differences between those markets, but I'd say there's general themes that are also similar. So maybe I'll talk to the themes. We're seeing essentially two different dynamics that are playing out in the market. One is, we continue to see price pressure in the market; the third entry in the market has certainly played a stronger price strategy than we would have initially anticipated, but I'd say that is continuing as we see them roll out into many of the international markets. And so, there is pressure on price, and I'd say fairly significant pressure on price in those markets, and they're using price to many cases to try to get early access into the marketplace from a pricing or reimbursement standpoint.","The second phenomenon that we're seeing is we're seeing that patient volumes are still trending down, although at a slower pace, so I think we are reaching some point of stability going forward. I think that's driven by a couple of different dynamics. One is, like in the U.S. as an example, many of the patients who were F3s and F4s have been treated, so now you have earlier stage patients. Some of those earlier stage patients are not as motivated to get treated. Some are still obviously undiagnosed in the marketplace, but I think it's primarily their motivation to be treated now, earlier on in their disease process.","And then some who are still in the later stages are in environments that are far more difficult to be able to access. They might be IV drug abusers, they might be in the prison system, et cetera, and so that's part of what's driving the dynamics in the U.S. market.","Outside of the U.S., you have funding cycles within those countries, and many of those countries funded for mostly F3s and F4s, didn't fund for earlier stage patients. And so, now we're going through the cycle of them dedicating funding for the number of people that they want to treat, and that clearly is coming down somewhat from what it had been in previous years.","Having said all of that, I'd say this is still a very big market, and at the end of the day it's a market that's sustainable at a substantial level going forward, and I think our GP product, our next-generation product, will compete very nicely in that market. And you have to remember that up to this point, we've only competed basically in genotype 1. And so there's a big opportunity for us to be able to compete in the other genotypes going forward. And we're certainly excited about what we think this next generation product can do in the marketplace. It will be more of a 2018 impact than a 2017 impact, although we'll get approved in 2017. So I think it's an exciting asset for us.","As it relates to elagolix, I'd say elagolix has the ideal profile for a new medicine in this particular area. Essentially \u2013 let's take the U.S. as an example. You have about 2.5 million women in the United States who suffer from endometriosis. Many people think that that number is low, that it could be as high as 4 million, because many of these patients are not diagnosed and physicians are hesitant to label them as having endometriosis when there's really no real benefit to doing that because there are no significant therapies. Many of these women suffer from significant pain. In fact, I would tell you that the opioid use in this population is relatively high. In the neighborhood of 35% to 40% of these patients use opioids to try to manage their pain level.","And if you look at the profile of elagolix and the clinical data that supports that, it would tell you that elagolix has the opportunity to change the profile of the treatment of that disease significantly. These women are typically of an age where they're interested in at some point becoming pregnant. And so what they're looking for is an oral agent that's fast-on and fast-off. Ideally, you want a therapy that could basically treat these women for in the neighborhood of a year or longer. We think this profile has the ability to do be able to do that for the vast majority of patients. And so we think that's a profile that is very, very consistent with what the market would desire and what patients would desire going forward.","It will be a market that you have to build over time, because we even saw in the clinical programs that you had to build awareness around this. So there will be an education process that is necessary in order to both educate physicians on the availability of this medicine when it becomes available, but also educate women to become activated and seek treatment when there weren't previous alternatives that could treat this disease. But if you look at the opportunity, this is clearly a multibillion-dollar product from an opportunity standpoint.","And so we're excited about it. It'll move forward into registration next quarter, and we anticipate being able to get that product approved and on the marketplace and starting to build that market. So I can tell you, I'm very excited about what the opportunity looks like. This is a market we know well, because of our experience with Lupron in this segment, and certainly Lupron does not have the ideal profile for these women. So I think it's a market that we'll be able to have a significant impact with this product.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Marc. Operator, we'll take the next question.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Geoffrey Porges from Leerink Partners. Geoffrey, your line is open.","Bradley P. Canino - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks. This is Brad Canino on for Geoff. Another question on HCV also. With the launch of the G\/P regimen looming, do you expect an initial pan-genotypic labeling given the latest data, and are the eight-week data for GT3 and GT1 also likely to be in the initial label at launch? Thanks.","Michael E. Severino - AbbVie, Inc.","So, this is Mike. I'll take that question. We feel very good about the data that we've generated across the program and across genotypes. If you look at our response rates, they're very high across both the common and uncommon genotypes, and in particular in some of the most difficult to treat patient populations, like genotype 3. And so, while it's difficult to speculate about a label, we think that the evidence that we've generated strongly supports pan-genotypic use of the product.","And with respect to the eight-week data, I would make similar statements. The eight-week data have been very strong across genotypes, including in very difficult to treat patients like genotype 3 patients. There, it's been studied in genotype 3 patients at eight weeks who don't have cirrhosis and are new to therapy, but that's a very, very significant portion of the market, not only in the U.S. but around the world. And our results are very strong, and again, while it's difficult to speculate about a label this early in the process, we think the data supports the use of the regimen in that manner.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Brad. Operator, we will take the next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank. Gregg, your line is open.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. First, following up on your comments, Rick, on HCV, is AbbVie a believer in NASH as a large opportunity, and what are your plans there? Second, for Mike, how would you set the bar for what you hope to see in TRINITY, and can you express your confidence in whether that data is sufficient to file with? You sound very confident there.","And third, Bill, can you comment a bit more on gross margin in the first quarter? I know there are timing issues and lumpiness, but it was the lowest level we've seen in quite some time. So can you provide a little more color on that? Thanks.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Yeah. So, Gregg, this is Rick. I'll take the first one, Mike will cover TRINITY, and Bill can cover the gross margin question. So on NASH, I mean certainly as you look at the prevalence of NASH, you look at the implications of it, this is a disease that certainly, if you could find the right therapy would be a significant opportunity. Again, it will be a market development kind of opportunity. Many of those patients are \u2013 the earlier stage patients are certainly in GPs and in internal medicine right now, with elevated LFTs as their only real symptom. So it would require some fairly significant market development work.","I think if you found the right drug with the right profile, it's clearly a significant opportunity. It's one of the things that's on our target list. As I said, what we do from a business development or a licensing acquisition standpoint is we have a strategic roadmap within each franchise of what we're looking for. I can tell you NASH is on that roadmap. We haven't \u2013 we obviously have not found anything yet that has met the criteria that we're looking for, that gives us enough confidence for us to pursue an asset. We've looked at a number of different things, and we'll continue to look. We have some internal efforts at an early discovery level looking at some different mechanisms as well. But those are fairly early on. So, yeah, it's a nice opportunity for the right kind of drug, if we can find that drug with that profile.","Michael E. Severino - AbbVie, Inc.","Okay, this is Mike, I'll take the question about Rova-T and TRINITY. So what we know about small cell lung cancer is that treatment options are severely limited for these patients. We know that in the front-line setting, we can drive good response rates with traditional chemotherapy, but those responses aren't durable and patients relapse. And when they relapse, they're very, very difficult to treat.","Second and subsequent lines of therapy have much lower response rates and very poor durability of those responses. In the third-line setting, where we're conducting the TRINITY study, for example, one-year survival is at best 12%, and many experts would put that number lower. So what we're looking for in TRINITY is something that really changes that picture, something that shows response rates that are different from the chemotherapy options and clearly differentiated \u2013 chemotherapy drugs response rates in the teens here \u2013 and responses that have the promise of being durable, and increasing that long-term survival to the greatest extent possible.","And you asked about our confidence. We remain confident in Rova-T and TRINITY. Rova-T is supported by a very, very strong package of preclinical biology and early clinical data. And this is a situation where the early clinical data are predictive of TRINITY. We're essentially looking at the same endpoints in TRINITY that we did in the early studies. So we feel good about that asset and about the overall Stemcentrx pipeline.","William J. Chase - AbbVie, Inc.","Gregg, it's Bill. So as you brought up, obviously our gross margin was a little lighter than last year, yeah, it was down 1.4 points. If you look at the impact of partnership accounting, and just to refresh your memory on that, the profit that we transferred to J&J related to Imbruvica, and actually the profit on Venclexta as well, ultimately gets booked up in COGS. So it actually dilutes our gross margin; that had about a 70 basis point impact. And then exchange had about a 30 basis point impact, and obviously exchange rates are going to move around. So it's difficult to call how that is in the future.","So, if you back those out, we're really 0.4 points below last year; that's primarily product mix, I think you can hang a lot of that on HCV. We do typically see lower gross margins in Q1 and Q4, and that's all tied to the seasonality of Synagis, which is a very, very low margin product. So that certainly played into that number as well. We feel good about our 81% forecast on the year. I would tell you, you should expect to see a number in Q2 above 81%.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Gregg. Operator, we'll take the next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Geoff, your line is open.","Paul Choi - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, good morning. It's Paul Choi. Thanks for taking our questions. First on the pipeline with regard to risankizumab, data that's coming out here, can you maybe comment on what other \u2013 what sort of metrics you'd be looking for in the psoriasis indication with regard to superiority versus some of the recently launched IL-17 agents that are out there in the market?","And secondly, on the Crohn's trials that you're running, with regard to the data that you'll present at DDW, is this something that you think would potentially accelerate the Phase 3 trials that you're planning to start here in the near term? Thanks.","Michael E. Severino - AbbVie, Inc.","Okay. This is Mike, I'll take those take questions. With respect to the risankizumab data, if we look at the Phase 2b data for risankizumab, it shows the strongest observed results in the category, which would include the IL-17s and the IL-23s. We had very high PASI 90 response numbers and very high PASI 100s, so complete clearance of skin disease in that program. And there were other features about the data that were very striking. First, we had very good durability response, and there's a very good administration, with the ability to drive quarterly administration in our Phase 3 program. So basically what we're looking for is a result in Phase 3 that is consistent with those Phase 2 data.","The other thing I'd point out, with respect to other agents, is we run active comparators in our Phase 2b, now that's against Stelara not against the IL-17s, but we saw very high PASI 100 rates there. And as I pointed in out in my prepared remarks, PASI 100 was about 2.5 times higher for risankizumab as compared to Stelara in that Phase 2, and the results of PASI 90 were similar, that there were substantially higher PASI 90 response rates, about double that of Stelara. So we feel good about the competitive profile and the ability to drive that through Phase 3 and into the market.","With respect to Crohn's disease, the data that we've seen are very encouraging. We're moving very fast already. So I'm not sure if the data at DDW accelerate that, but we're poised to move into Phase 3 and we feel that there's a lot of potential for this pathway in inflammatory bowel diseases as well.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, Paul. Operator, we'll take the next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. David, your line is open.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. I have two questions, please. First, I was just hoping that you could frame how much total cash AbbVie had at the end of last year. I'm guessing you don't have your 10-Q out yet. And also, what percentage of that was offshore, so we can better understand how much you would plan to repatriate based upon current cash ex-U.S. And maybe you can also speak to the opportunity for borrowing ex-U.S. in the event that repatriation is allowed, to bring back more than the cash on your books. And then second, with respect to Imbruvica, would you please talk a little bit about new indication opportunities over the next few years, the market potential, and the timing of specific e-trial readouts for Imbruvica over the next year or two? Thank you.","William J. Chase - AbbVie, Inc.","Hi, David, it's Bill. So, cash on hand at the end of the year was about $8.2 billion, and as you said, we don't have our 10-Q up, but obviously the number is at least $8.2 billion this quarter, and you'll see that soon.","Look what I would tell you in terms of geographic distribution of cash, obviously under the current tax paradigm, there is a penalty for bringing back cash, back into the United States. So what we try to do is only bring back that cash that is needed to cover our U.S. cash needs, and that's typically things like interest, the dividend obviously, and then our U.S. operations. To bring back cash above and beyond that is fundamentally inefficient from a tax perspective, so we tend to try to keep our cash, the majority of it, offshore.","In terms of our ability to borrow in the event that there was some type of repatriation, that would be a one-time event. Look, what I would tell you is first of all, as Rick said, we're incredibly encouraged that there is talk now about possibly allowing repatriation of cash in a tax efficient manner. We think that's absolutely the right thing to do, just not only for AbbVie and the industry, but the country. We would certainly hope that that is on a permanent basis as opposed to a one-time basis.","In the event that it was one-time and without specific limits, we would certainly look to take advantage of that to the greatest extent that we possibly could, and I think borrowing would be in the cards, given that following the closure of that window, we would have the ability to continue to generate robust offshore cash and quickly pay down that debt. So in the event that it went that way and we were permitted to do that, that is certainly something we would look at. That said, it's a little early right now to know definitively how this is going to play out, but we remain optimistic.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Okay. On your Imbruvica question, David, maybe we'll \u2013 Mike and I will sort of try to cover the question. Let me just talk about the opportunity first, and then Mike can talk about the timing of the readouts. So I'd say before you jump into new indications, one of the things I think to think through is, a big part of our strategy with Imbruvica, and with the Pharmacyclics acquisition when we talked about it, was the need to be able to move up in the first line, and CLL all by itself is a very, very large indication. And the reason that is so important is because, remember the duration of treatment on Imbruvica is much longer than other therapies now. And the fundamental benefit that patients get from a PFS and an OS standpoint is driven by those patients staying on therapy for long periods of time.","And so, as you move in the front-line, you get your greatest benefit for the patient by doing that, and obviously you get your greatest benefit from a business standpoint by moving up into those first-line patients. So even within the indications we're in today, driving towards first line, CLL is a very big opportunity, but the other indications moving into first line is a critical priority.","Now, having said that \u2013 and I'd say the bulk of our LRP is driven off of that \u2013 having said that though, I'd say then if you look at two \u2013 three other large categories, they have different risks associated with them from a probability of success. But NHL, I'd say we have a significant amount of data, but NHL as a category is a very significant opportunity for us, and Mike can talk about the different trials that are in that particular area to support our efforts there. Relapsed\/refractory multiple myeloma patients I think is another significant opportunity for us, just because of the size of that patient population. And those will all play out over the course of this LRP from the standpoint of timing of those trials and readouts of those trials and potential regulatory approvals in those areas.","And then I'd say a very high risk, but obviously high reward if it were to play out, is the pancreatic study. That is one that we've heavily risk-adjusted, and so it's not something that we're counting on, certainly isn't something that investors should be counting on at this point. But if it were to play out in a positive way, obviously that would be a very big opportunity. So those, as we look forward, I think are the most significant opportunities to describe.","Michael E. Severino - AbbVie, Inc.","And this is Mike. So with respect to the framework that Rick laid out, we have a number of opportunities to move forward in lines of therapy. And one that we would expect to see data on later this year is mantle cell lymphoma, an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, where we're anticipating interim data from a pivotal study in front-line, which would be an important step towards moving to front-line therapy there.","In mantle cell, we also have combination work ongoing with Venclexta, and that combination has shown very strong results. And so those data would continue to mature over the course of the timeframe that you described.","We're also going to see data in other forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma over the course of the next 18 or 24 months, including data in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, where we've seen good results in patients who have the ABC or activated B-cell phenotype of that disease, and also additional work in follicular lymphoma, which is the largest form of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma.","Outside of NHL, we're making good progress with GVHD. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have the initial submission in but we have ongoing data generation in GVHD. So all of those data will mature over the course of the timeframe that you described.","And then, at the back end of that two-year period, we'll start to see more data on multiple myeloma and other opportunities as well.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, David. Operator, we'll take the next question.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from John Boris from SunTrust. John, your line is open.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for taking the questions. Just on the \u2013 circling back to capital allocation on share repo, can you just give some transparency on what you purchased in the quarter and your thoughts about additional repurchases going forward, especially related to your comments earlier?","And then the second question just has to do with the line extension behind Humira. I believe you launched a lower \u2013 low-concentration, less burning formulation in the EU. What's your planning and timing for launch of that in the U.S.? Any thoughts around the appetite for formulary uptake in the U.S.? Also your ability to do direct-to-consumer advertising?","And lastly, just on how Roche's launch in the MS space and Lilly's launch into the diabetes space, that price discounts played a role, at least in terms of gaining access to formulary there. So, appreciate you taking the question.","William J. Chase - AbbVie, Inc.","So, John. It's Bill. On share buyback in the quarter, we bought back $500 million of shares. When you see our 10-Q you're going to see a higher number. We were also buying at the end of the year. About $300 million carried over between the years. So in the 10-Q it'll look like $800 million, but actually this year we bought back $500 million. It's not our intent at this point to buy back significantly more. That said, as I said earlier, to the extent that we find ourselves with an excess of U.S. cash, we do from time to time deploy that in the market and buy back shares, given that we've already incurred the tax inefficiency of bringing it back home, and we did do some of that last year. So yeah, some of this will wind up looking \u2013 we'll have to look to see what our U.S. cash balance looks like as we progress through the year. But right now, I think $500 million is all we have in our current sights.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","And then, as it relates to the new formulation, we have rolled out a new formulation outside the U.S. in a number of countries. We essentially have a country-by-country framework that we've laid out, of rolling that out. With a brand of the magnitude of Humira, obviously, we're being careful about how we roll that out to make sure there's no market disruptions.","And in fact, because it is a new formulation, we have to change the footprint of our manufacturing to be able to deal with it, because it's a different manufacturing process for the API. And so we have to basically \u2013 it's like changing the engine on a 747 while you're still flying at 40,000 feet. We're being careful about how we're doing that, as we flex the manufacturing capacity that we have to make the shift over. And so over time we would anticipate that that formulation will be in all the major markets around the world, but it will take some time in order for that to happen.","Your question on DTC, I'm not sure I quite understand. I mean, we obviously have an active DTC campaign now for Humira. We wouldn't anticipate a change in that as it relates to the new formulation, if that's what you were referring to. It's not that kind of a strategy that we've built here, although there is a benefit for patients from the standpoint of pain upon injection, but that's not part of the strategy that we built in place.","And then as it relates to the launches of Roche and Lilly, I think every single market has a different set of dynamics. I'm certainly not an expert when it comes to diabetes, so I'm not going to speculate on what the right strategy is there. I would tell you in the markets that Humira competes in, essentially we've had many competitors come at a low list-price strategy, and that hasn't necessarily been as ineffective, because you have to remember that list price in this market is not reflective of what the actual patient or the individual employer pays for the drug.","And so at the end of the day, that strategy doesn't seem to work well in this market, especially in a brand like Humira that has the attributes that Humira has. It can serve broadly a significant part of the patient population, both within a category and across multiple categories. It's really the strength of this brand and the clinical efficacy and safety of this brand that has driven its performance.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","So, Rick...","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, John.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Go ahead.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah. Just on direct-to-consumer, will you be able to make a claim on TV that it's less painful and causes less burning?","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","I don't believe so, but regardless of whether we could or we couldn't, it's not our strategy to do that.","John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.","Thanks, John. Obviously we're cognizant that there are a number of peer companies reporting today, so we've got time for just one more question. Operator, we'll take the last question.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. Vamil, your line is open.","Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah, hi. Thanks so much for taking the question and squeezing me in here. So just two if I could quickly, one on veliparib, you mentioned obviously the news from the two trials, it's obviously not a key growth driver in the near-term, but just if you can just talk about what you see as the future role for that asset, and why is \u2013 why you're still continuing to develop it in the trials that are still ongoing?","And then if you can just provide a little more color in terms of the impact you're seeing on biosimilars to Humira outside of the U.S., both in terms of the infused product and the injectables, that'd be helpful. Thanks so much.","Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.","Okay. So maybe I'll cover the second question first. Because I'd say the trend outside the U.S. on biosimilars is very similar to what we've seen, relatively low overall market share, discounting that's within the range of what we predicted historically or slightly lower \u2013 slightly less discounting than what we had predicted. And so we've essentially seen the indirect competition pretty much stabilize out in these marketplaces. There has been some impact on price in certain markets outside the U.S., but that has pretty much played through at this point. And so I don't expect any significant changes in the activity in the rest of 2017, from a biosimilars standpoint, outside of the U.S.","Michael E. Severino - AbbVie, Inc.","So with respect Veliparib, as we've said on other occasions, we were exploring a different hypothesis with Veliparib. We know that Veliparib \u2013 or we know that PARP inhibitors play a role in treating patients with inherited mutations in DNA repair, germline BRCA mutation and similar mutations. But we didn't view it as a substantial opportunity for a company like AbbVie to come third or fourth to market in that population. Essentially, the medical need was met for those patients. So we were testing a different hypothesis, and that hypothesis specifically was whether PARP inhibition would augment DNA-damaging chemotherapy; that the first hit, if you will, didn't have to be genetic, that it could from that DNA-damaging chemotherapy.","We've now seen across a couple of studies that that hasn't played out in the way we had initially envisioned. We see that in the triple-negative breast cancer neoadjuvant study and in the squamous non-small cell lung cancer study. And so, while that's not the result we had hoped for, we knew going in that this was a higher-risk, higher-reward sort of approach, and that the evidence while reasonable, from a preclinical and early clinical perspective, isn't entirely predictive in this setting. And so we knew that it was going to take Phase 3 data to answer the question. We've seen the first two readouts, and those studies did not meet their primary endpoint.","With respect to ongoing work, we have ongoing studies, some of which will read out very soon. So we can't speculate about what those results might be, but we will complete the ongoing studies and update you on the progress as soon as possible.","Vamil K.

Following our remarks, we will take your questions.","We delivered another impressive year with results well above initial expectations. Adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $1.90, representing growth of more than 28% versus last year and once again achieving our guidance for the quarter.","Total adjusted operational sales growth of 8.3% exceeded our guidance for the quarter. This growth was driven by a number of products including hematological oncology portfolio with global operational sales growth of more than 50% and U.S. HUMIRA, which grew by more than 9% versus the last year. Our international HUMIRA sales were down nearly 15%, reflecting the impact of direct biosimilar competition in Europe and other international markets. We also saw a continued strong performance from several other products including MAVYRET, CREON and DUODOPA.","AbbVie has demonstrated an exceptional track record of consistently delivering top-tier financial performance despite any market or competitive challenges and 2018 was another clear example of that performance. We continue to drive strong commercial and operational execution, resulting in full year 2018 global operational sales growth of more than 15% and adjusted earnings per share growth of more than 41%.","As we look at the evolution of our business and of our strategy, we're pleased with the progress that we\u2019re making. AbbVie's strategy has contemplated biosimilar competition since day one of the launch of this Company. Our focus has been on building a pipeline that would allow us to absorb the impact of biosimilar competition, and maintain a strong and growing business. Although our work is never done, we have made tremendous progress, building what we believe is one of the industry's most attractive pipelines.","In hematological oncology, we have built a powerhouse franchise with IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA. Today, this franchise is roughly $4 billion with more than $1 billion of growth expected in 2019, and significant growth anticipated over our long range plan.","In immunology, HUMIRA in the U.S. will continue to generate strong revenue, driving roughly $1 billion of growth in 2019. Since we became an independent company, our research and development efforts in immunology have focused on identifying and advancing new assets that can deliver efficacy superiority to HUMIRA and other new agents.","Given the importance of this growth platform, we understood that in order to maintain and expand our leadership position, the development of highly differentiated assets was absolutely critical. We are now confident that with risankizumab and upadacitinib, we have accomplished our objective. Both of our next-generation immunology therapies have demonstrated across multiple clinical trials superiority versus HUMIRA and other competitive offerings. This efficacy was shown across the broad spectrum of patients, including bio-na\u00efve patients at one end of the treatment paradigm and very difficult to treat patients who would fail one or more therapies at the other end of the spectrum.","In our hands, these assets have the ability to become the new standards of care in immunology. We expect to launch both risankizumab and upadacitinib in 2019, and based on their profiles, anticipate broad formulary access.","Beyond our new therapies hem-onc and immunology, we\u2019ve also developed other assets that represent attractive multibillion-dollar revenue opportunities, such as MAVYRET and ORILISSA. And we have a base business that includes therapies like CREON, DUODOPA, SYNTHROID and LUPRON, all products we expect will remain durable for many years to come.","The event that has for many years concerned investors most has been the loss of exclusivity for HUMIRA. Certainly the most frequently asked question that we get is what impact will biosimilars have on AbbVie's business. We have long been planning and preparing for the event that is now upon us. We are now facing direct biosimilar competition in Europe and other countries, which represent approximately 75% of our international HUMIRA business or approximately 25% of total global HUMIRA revenues. As we described on our third quarter call, biosimilar competitors have been more aggressive with HUMIRA than previous anti-TNF biosimilar analogs. But, despite the more aggressive discounting, our strategy is working as we had intended.","2019 is a year that should clearly demonstrate to all investors that AbbVie is once again delivering on its commitments. In 2019, we will absorb roughly $2 billion of erosion related to biosimilar competition and roughly $400 million of additional impact following the entry of generic competition for AndroGel 1.62. We're also facing an extremely difficult comparison period due to the outstanding growth we drove in 2018. And in 2019, we\u2019ll also be funding five major products or indication launches.","Yet despite all of these challenges, AbbVie expects to deliver positive revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth this year. This level of performance demonstrates that the strategy we have in place is working as we planned, and it should re-ensure all investors of our ability to absorb the impact of direct biosimilar competition while maintaining a strong, growing and vibrant business.","Further to that point, our ability to deliver industry-leading EPS growth in 2019, despite the challenges I just outlined, is particularly notable, given that this year many of our key pipeline assets will be at the very early stages of their launch trajectory and therefore providing minimal offset to the biosimilar impact. Given their product profiles, we expect these pipeline assets will grow substantially over the next several years and provide significant offset to the 2023 U.S. biosimilar event. So, as I said, we are pleased with the progress with our strategy, and investors should view 2019 as a real test of that strategy.","In summary, this is important time for AbbVie. The continuing momentum of our U.S. business and our hematological oncology franchise, combined with the launch and ramp of several new products will allow us to grow through biosimilar impact in 2019, just as we have predicted. We've demonstrated a strong track record of managing and overcoming challenges and our expected performance from 2019 is another clear example of that. And while we are certainly proud of what we've accomplished in the first six years as an independent company, I can tell you, we remain focused and committed to delivering our long-term vision for the Company, sustained, top-tier performance.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?","Michael Severino","Thank you, Rick.","2018 was a very productive year with significant pipeline advancement, including numerous development and regulatory achievements and successful data readouts across our pipeline. We secured regulatory approvals for several programs including VENCLEXTA in the broad relapse\/refractory CLL population, and conditional approval for VENCLEXTA in newly diagnosed AML patients ineligible for intensive chemotherapy; approval for IMBRUVICA in combination with Rituxan as the first chemotherapy-free combination treatment for Waldenstr\u00f6m's, the 9th FDA approval for IMBRUVICA overall; and for ORILISSA, for the management of moderate-to-severe pain associated with endometriosis.","We completed registrational studies and submitted regulatory applications for our two next generation immunology therapies, risankizumab and its initial indication, psoriasis; and upadacitinib in its first indication, rheumatoid arthritis. Across each of the four Phase 3 studies in the pivotal program for psoriasis, risankizumab showed consistent, high, durable rates of skin clearance. Based on these results, we believe risankizumab has the potential to significantly improve upon current treatment options for both bio-na\u00efve and TNF-inadequate responder patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis while offering the convenience of quarterly dosing. Our regulatory reviews are well underway with approval decisions expected in the second quarter.","With upadacitinib, our goal is to deliver a differentiated treatment to RA patients. We designed a broad and comprehensive set of six pivotal studies in RA, enrolling nearly 5,000 patients across multiple populations, including two studies with biologic comparators. We evaluated upadacitinib head-to-head against the standards of care in RA, including methotrexate and HUMIRA, and in a broad range of patient types within the moderate-to-severe RA segment. This includes monotherapy treatment in patients who are na\u00efve to methotrexate as well as studies in very difficult to treat patients who have failed one or more biologic therapies. Across the select clinical program, both doses of upadacitinib performed extremely well and demonstrated a strong benefit risk profile. Based on our analysis of the data generated across the registrational program, we believe the 15-milligram dose represents the best dose for the RA indication as it delivered maximal efficacy across a wide range of studies, drove strong results on important structural endpoints, and demonstrated superiority to HUMIRA in our head-to-head study. Thus, this does provides the differentiation we were seeking when we designed our program.","Our regulatory submissions are currently under review and we expect approval decisions in the second half of this year. In addition to the successful trial readouts for upadacitinib and risankizumab, we also reported positive data from several Phase 3 studies in other areas of our pipeline, including elagolix uterine fibroids, VENCLEXTA in frontline CLL, and data from several important Phase 3 studies in our frontline CLL program for IMBRUVICA, including results from the ECOG, ALLIANCE and iLLUMINATE trials.","Data from these three studies showed treatment with IMBRUVICA alone or in combination, significantly prolonged progression-free survival comparative therapies such as FCR, BR GAZYVA plus chlorambucil in previously untreated CLL patients.","We also initiated several Phase 3 programs, including studies for upadacitinib in atopic dermatitis and ulcerative colitis. In addition to the progress we made across our late-stage programs, we also advanced a number of early-stage assets in the mid-stage development, including our JAK BTK program in RA and our CD40 program in ulcerative colitis. And, we transitioned several preclinical programs into human trials including our novel TNF steroid conjugate, and our RORgammaT programs.","Clearly, we made tremendous progress, advancing our pipeline in 2018, and we look forward to many important pipeline milestones in 2019 as well. In hematologic oncology, we will see data from several Phase 3 studies for VENCLEXTA this year, including results from the BELLINI trial in relapsed\/refractory multiple myeloma and from our two frontline and AML studies, as well as the detail data from CLL14, our Phase 3 study for VENCLEXTA in frontline CLL. These data and subsequent label augmentations will build upon the body of evidence demonstrating VENCLEXTA's potential as a foundational treatment option across a number of hematologic malignancies.","Earlier this month, the VENCLEXTA CLL14 data were selected for FDA\u2019s real-time oncology review program. This program is aimed at expediting the review and approval process for supplemental drug applications. Results from CLL14 have already been shared with the FDA, which is part of the agency's evaluation process, leading to the decision to offer the real-time review. Very soon, we will begin submitting data, as part of the review process, and expect an approval decisions later this year. We look forward to bringing this new treatment to market in the frontline CLL population.","In the area of solid tumors, we\u2019ll see later this year from our Phase 3 study for depatux-m in newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. This is an extremely difficult to treat from of brain cancer with a very high unmet need and limited treatment options. We\u2019ve seen encouraging trends in overall survival in our Phase 2 study in second line GBM, and look forward to the results of our frontline Phase 3 study to define the future regulatory path for the program.","We also expect several assets from our early-stage solid tumor programs to transition to proof-of-concept studies this year, and will share data from these programs as they mature. In the area of immunology, as I previously mentioned, we expect regulatory decisions later this year for upadacitinib in RA and risankizumab in psoriasis.","In addition to their lead indications, we continue to make great progress with upadacitinib and risankizumab in a number of other immune-mediated conditions. This year, we\u2019ll report mid-stage data for upadacitinib in axial SpA, and we plan to begin Phase 3 development in giant cell arteritis. Overall, this year, we\u2019ll have 10 active ongoing registration-enabling programs for upadacitinib and risankizumab.","We\u2019re also making good progress with our early-stage immunology pipeline, which includes programs aimed at redefining the standard of care in autoimmune diseases. We have several promising assets including ABBV-323, our CD40 antagonist; ABBV-3373, our TNF steroid conjugate; and ABBV-599, our combination JAK BTK-inhibitor. And in the area of women's health, following completion of the pivotal trials for elagolix in uterine fibroids, we plan to submit our regulatory application around the middle of the year.","So, in summary, in 2018, we made tremendous progress advancing our pipeline, achieving a number of key clinical and regulatory milestones across all of our therapeutic areas. And we expect 2019 to be another very productive year for our R&D organization. We look forward to updating you on our pipeline progress throughout the year.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on our 2018 performance and our 2019 guidance. Bill?","Bill Chase","Thanks, Mike.","Today, I'll review the highlights of our performance for the fourth quarter and full-year 2018, and then walk through our 2019 outlook.","As Rick mentioned, we have completed another year of outstanding performance, delivering top and bottom line growth that ranks AbbVie among the very-top of our industry peers. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $7.91, up more than 40% compared to 2017 and $1.44 above the midpoint of our initial expectations for the year.","For the year, adjusted revenues were $32.7 billion, up 15.2% on an operational basis, excluding a nearly 1% favorable impact from foreign exchange.","For the fourth quarter, total revenues were $8.3 billion, an increase of 8.3% on an operational basis, excluding a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. This performance reflects double-digit underlying volume growth offset by approximately 2.5 points of negative price.","Global sales of HUMIRA were $4.9 billion in the quarter, up 1.4% operationally. In the U.S., HUMIRA sales increased 9.1% compared to the prior year, reflecting high-single-digit volume growth plus price. Wholesaler inventory levels remained below half a month in the quarter. International HUMIRA sales were $1.3 billion in the quarter, down 14.8% operationally, reflecting the introduction of biosimilar competition across Europe and other international markets. Global HUMIRA sales for the full -year 2018 were $19.9 billion, reflecting operational sales growth of 7.4%. Full-year sales of HUMIRA in the U.S. grew more than 10%, and international HUMIRA sales approached $6.3 billion, performing in line with our expectations.","Hematologic oncology global sales were $1.1 billion in the quarter, up 50.3% on an operational basis, driven by the continued strong growth of both IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA. In the quarter, IMBRUVICA net revenues were $1 billion, primarily driven by continued uptake in the frontline CLL segment. VENCLEXTA revenues were $124 million in the quarter, driven by continued uptake in the second line plus setting, as a result of our midyear approval in the broad relapsed\/refractory CLL segment. For the full-year, our hem-onc global revenues were $3.9 billion, up 45.8% on an operational basis.","Global HCV sales for the fourth quarter were $862 million. MAVYRET continues to perform well, holding roughly 50% market share globally. For the full-year, HCV sales exceeded $3.6 billion and was above our previous communicated guidance. We also saw continued double-digit operational sales growth for both DUODOPA and CREON. ","Turning now to the P&L profile for the fourth quarter. Adjusted gross margin was 79.8% of sales, up 80 basis points compared to the prior year. This was inclusive of the year-over-year benefit related to the termination of certain royalties with HUMIRA, partially offset by the dilutive impact of partnership accounting. Adjusted R&D was 16.5% of sales, supporting our pipeline programs in oncology, immunology, and other areas. Adjusted SG&A was 21.6% of sales, an increase of 30 basis points versus the prior year, reflecting continued investment in our on-market products as well as investment in advance of several upcoming product launches. The adjusted operating margin was 41.7% of sales in the fourth quarter, an improvement of over 100 basis points versus the prior year.","Net interest expense was $319 million and the adjusted tax rate was 9.1% in the quarter. Fourth quarter, adjusted earnings per share, excluding specified items were $1.90, up 28.4% year-over-year. In the quarter, we recorded a net charge of $2.75 per share, related to the partial impairment of intangible assets, acquired as part of the Stemcentrx acquisition. The net after-tax impact of this impairment and the related adjustment to contingent consideration liabilities was $4.1 billion. This one-time net charge has been excluded from our adjusted EPS results.","As we look ahead to 2019, our full-year adjusted EPS range is $8.65 to $8.75, reflecting growth of 10% at the midpoint. Excluded from this guidance is $1.26 of known intangible amortization and specified items, as well as non-cash charges for contingent consideration adjustments related to the expected approval of risankizumab in the first half of the year.","On the topline, in 2019, we expect revenue growth of approximately 1% on an operational basis. At current rates, we would expect foreign exchange to have just less than 1% unfavorable impact on reported sales growth.","Included in our revenue guidance are the following assumptions for our key products. In 2019, we expect U.S. HUMIRA to once again be an important contributor to our performance, with revenue growth of approximately 7%. We expect 2019 international HUMIRA to be down approximately 30% on an operational basis, reflecting the impact of biosimilar competition outside of the U.S.","For our hem-onc franchise, we expect global revenues of approximately $5.1 billion, contributing more than $1 billion of growth; this includes IMBRUVICA global revenues to AbbVie approaching $4.4 billion with U.S. sales growth of approximately 21%. For VENCLEXTA, we expect sales of approximately $725 million.","We expect global HCV sales of approximately $3.3 billion in 2019, with roughly flat performance in the U.S. and international sales of approximately $1.7 billion. For ORILISSA, we expect sales of approximately $200 million. We are pleased with the early stages of the launch, and expect demand to ramp, given recent increased formulary access, which now stands at approximately 70%.","For CREON, we expect approximately 10% sales growth; for DUODOPA, we expect revenues approaching $500 million; for LUPRON, SYNTHROID and SYNERGIST, we expect sales to be roughly flat year-over-year. And for AndroGel, we are forecasting sales of approximately $100 million, following the entry of generic competition for AndroGel 1.62. Finally, we are expecting a regulatory decision for both risankizumab and upadacitinib, later this year. We will provide specific guidance for these assets following their respective approvals. ","Looking at the P&L for 2019. We are forecasting an adjusted gross margin ratio of above 82.5%. This profile reflects a year-over-year benefit of HUMIRA royalty reduction, as well as the impact of partnership accounting. We are forecasting R&D expense of approximately 15.5% of sales, reflecting funding actions supporting all stages of our pipeline. We are forecasting SG&A to be approximately 20.5% of sales in support of five major product or indication launches. For 2019, we e are forecasting an operating margin ratio of just above 46.5%, roughly 200 basis points above prior year, inclusive of the required investment on our new product launches. We expect net interest expense approaching $1.3 billion, and we model a non-GAAP tax rate, just above our full-year rate in 2018.","Regarding our first quarter outlook, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.05 and $2.07, excluding approximately $0.31 of specified items. We anticipate first quarter revenue of approximately $7.7 billion. At current rates, we would expect foreign exchange to have an unfavorable impact on reported sales growth of approximately 2% in the first quarter. For U.S. HUMIRA, we expect sales of approximately $3.2 billion; we expect international HUMIRA sales of approximately $1.2 billion, assuming current exchange rates. And for IMBRUVICA, we expect sales of approximately $1 billion.","Moving now to the P&L for the first quarter, we are forecasting an adjusted gross margin ratio in line with full-year guidance and spending levels slightly favorable relative to the full-year profile due to investment timing. We expect an adjusted tax rate, just below 8% in the first quarter, lower than our expected full year rate, reflecting the fact that the tax impact of equity compensation is most pronounced in the first quarter of each year.","In summary, AbbVie has once again delivered an excellent quarter and full-year results. We\u2019ve driven top tier revenue and EPS growth while also advancing our strategic priorities and our pipeline. And our strong growth prospects have enabled us to position the business for yet another year of double-digit earnings growth in 2019, despite biosimilar dynamics and the required investments to support several major product and indication launches. We are very pleased with AbbVie\u2019s strong performance.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.","Liz Shea","Thanks, Bill. We\u2019ll now open the call for questions. Operator, first question, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Steve Scala from Cowen.","Steve Scala","Thank you very much. In 2019, if HUMIRA grows $1 billion in U.S. but declines $2 billion o-U.S., it would have to grow up 11% in 2020 to hit the $21 billion guidance figure. Is that still your expectation? Secondly, do you anticipate an FDA AdCom for upadacitinib? And then, lastly, perhaps in part due to AbbVie\u2019s openness to do a deal and its desire to have another therapeutic vertical, there's been some speculation that AbbVie might pursue a big deal, even in an unfriendly way. Considering the many moving parts at AbbVie, what is your appetite right now for a big deal and would you consider an unfriendly one? Thank you.","Rick Gonzalez","Yes. Steve, this is Rick. So, I\u2019ll cover one and three, and then Mike can cover number two. So, first of all, if you look at HUMIRA, obviously, we continue to see strong growth in the U.S.; we\u2019re continuing to see the biosimilar effect play out. We've assumed within our planning period of 2019 that we\u2019ll see some continued erosion from a price standpoint across the time period that is greater than what we currently have -- is currently in place. So, obviously, we\u2019ll have to see how that plays out. In the end, if we look at the long-term targets that we put in place, we still feel confident in the overall long-term targets. Whether or not one product is slightly different than another, I mean we'll see how that plays out, but we obviously feel confident in what we have committed to and we maintain that commitment. As far as the appetite for a big deal, I can tell you that is not something that we are contemplating.","Michael Severino","Okay. So, this is Mike. I'll take number two. With respect to upa and the potential for an AdCom, I think it's important to keep in mind that we\u2019re in very-early stages of a regulatory review. But, if you look at the practice of this review division, it's common for filings like this for new molecular entities in RA to go to an AdCom. So, it's certainly possible article. But, we\u2019ll have a much better idea once we\u2019re further along in the review process.","Liz Shea","Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Baum from Citi.","Andrew Baum","Thank you. Apologies if I missed the early part of the call. But, just in terms of what's embedded in your 2019 adjusted earnings guidance for HUMIRA in international markets, if you could give us additional color on that that would be great. Second, you recently had a management reorg. Could you talk to that in relation to also succession planning of the organization? And then, finally, you disclosed a couple of negative headlines in two Phase 3 veliparib trials over a year-ago. I haven't seen the data for that. It's just broader interest as what is -- as when might we see that data being presented. Many thanks.","Bill Chase","Hi, Andrew. I\u2019ll start with your first question. It\u2019s Bill Chase. Our guidance around HUMIRA for 2019 is in the U.S. strong growth, 7% is what we are recommending to model. Outside of the U.S., obviously with the advent of biosimilars, we are forecasting a decline, and currently we view that as about 30% on an operational basis.","Rick Gonzalez","So, Andrew, this is Rick. I'll cover number two. We did announce a change in our organizational structure at the executive level. The purpose of that change -- and we've operated now for six years with a fairly a broad management structure reporting to me, and the purpose of the change really was to narrow the focus of the direct reports that I had that ultimately would allow us to focus and execute even at a higher level around where our strategy is going forward. In addition, we have a very talented executive leadership team and we wanted to get those people some additional experience in other areas, and this will allow us to be able to do that. I've heard all the rumors about potentially me retiring. I can tell you they are not true. As many of you probably know, I retired once. And I can tell you, I'm heck of a lot better running AbbVie than I was at retirement. So, hopefully that clarifies it.","Michael Severino","This is Mike. With respect to veliparib data, so, we announced those topline results when we had them. We\u2019re committed to publishing all results and making the data available. I don\u2019t have a specific meeting or a specific timeframe to point to here on the call today. But, we will be making those data publicly available.","Liz Shea","Thanks, Andrew. Operator, next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Geoff Meacham from Barclays.","Geoff Meacham","I just had a few on HUMIRA. For O-U.S., are there countries that still need to be contractual locked in for \u201819? And what\u2019s your new guidance, Bill? Are there resets at year-end looking to 2020 and beyond? And then, when you guys talk about the U.S., the strategy seems to be moving HUMIRA to later in the paradigm across different markets and then upada and rizu upstream. As you guys get closer to launch, are you thinking about -- how is the contracting going to make this happen? Is it just about discounts or rebates or other more novel strategies under discussion?","Rick Gonzalez","So, this is Rick. I will cover those first two. So, there are still some countries where obviously, it is still evolving. The southern European countries are probably the most significant, and to some extent in Germany. I\u2019d say, we haven't seen a lot of movement in price over the last 60 days or so. But, we are anticipating -- and as I said, we built into our forecast some incremental decline in price, just to make sure that we felt comfortable with where it potentially could go.","As far as other countries in 2020, the majority of the volume doesn't come under additional biosimilar exposure in 2020. The more significant countries are in 2021. So, there is some, but the majority of it occurs in 2021, not in 20. As far as what you described as contracting dynamics, I think if you talk about our go-to-market strategy for these products, we\u2019re not in a position, nor from a competitive standpoint do I think we would want to talk about at this point what our go-to-market strategy is. But, I think in general, the way you can think about these assets and then certainly the way we're thinking about it is, now that we\u2019ve produced the data on upa and risa across the broad range of indications, it is validated for us that these assets ultimately are superior to what\u2019s out there today. And clearly, as I indicated, we now have enough data across a broad range of clinical trials and across a broad range of patient population from na\u00efve patients to TNF inadequate responding patients that we know these assets will ultimately be able to deliver significantly superior results to both HUMIRA as well as other assets that are out there, other medicines that are out there. And therefore, the logical strategy with these assets is to position them to be lead products in the marketplace. We would obviously put a contracting strategy in place that will be consistent with that approach, and obviously we will find those launches in a way to be able to drive that approach in the marketplace, both in the U.S. as well as outside the U.S. And we expect the uptake to be consistent with the profile of those assets.","Liz Shea","Operator, next question, please?","Operator","Our next question is from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research.","Tim Anderson","I have a question on spending infrastructure over the long-term. So, naturally, the big concern is HUMIRA biosimilars and how that impacts the P&L. And one of the levers you could potentially pull is cutting cost some point in the future. And I know you've given long-term operating margin guidance. But, can you give us kind of more detail on how you see SG&A and R&D evolving over time? I\u2019m wondering if you can call large amounts of spending out of these line items. It seems like that could be challenging in the context of still investing heavily in the INI space with your other assets. So, how much is spending, a major lever that can be pulled in the future? And then, second question just goes back to HUMIRA international. So, in October, you revised down your erosion guidance. And now, just three months later, you\u2019ve revised it down again in terms of international performance for 2019. Can we be confident that you won't have to revise it down yet again at another point in the current year?","Rick Gonzalez","So, I'll cover most of those questions, and Bill can fill in if anything that I haven't covered. So, let me start with what you described as the guidance. And let me go through the history of the guidance because I think it is important to lay out. We came out with the original guidance back in 2015, and that was based on what we saw out in the marketplace primarily at the time REMICADE and then followed it with ENBREL. And we updated it I think in 2017, specifically what we thought. And then from that point forward, we said we needed [ph] to see what it would look like going forward.","On the third quarter call, what we -- we were only, to my best of my recollection, three weeks into biosimilars. Right? And we made it fairly clear, and I think if you go back and if you read this transcript, it's fairly clear that what we were giving the market was a snapshot of what we saw at that time. And in fact, I think I said at the time, you should not assume this is guidance, it's likely to get worse. So, hopefully, we were clear at that point.","As far as specifically to your question, as I indicated, we have built in further erosion that we haven't seen yet. So, in the number that Bill described, the 30% to 31%, which is roughly 5 points above where it was before, that has some assumed erosion that has not occurred. And look, what we're giving you is our best estimate of what will happen. Obviously, this is driven by -- not us, it\u2019s driven by competitors and their behavior. And so, ultimately, it's not like we have a crystal ball that we can predict exactly what they do. What I can tell you is this. We have a high level of confidence in delivering the bottom line performance that we described to the market, and we have enough ability to be able to do that and we have a high level of confidence in double-digit EPS. So, that's what you should rely upon. Whether or not things move around a little bit? They could. But to the best of our ability, we are forecasting what we believe. And I think I'd say, it's a reasonably high probability that those numbers should be accurate.","As far as spending in infrastructure, I mean obviously, as we look at what's going on in these various markets, just like we do with any product that experiences an LOE, reflects as quickly as possible the spending around those products to be reflective of what's appropriate in that particular market in those circumstances. And we\u2019re certainly doing that with you HUMIRA right now in the international markets. But, obviously, one of the things that's important to remember here is, we're going to launch -- or really either just launched or will launch over the course of the next 12 months, four major products that have multibillion-dollar potential. If you think about VENCLEXTA, it's in its very early stages now; it's just received the broad label in CLL and in AML. So, it's essentially a relatively small product that\u2019s now growing rapidly. ORILISSA, we just launched that product. We\u2019re going to launch upadacitinib; we\u2019re going to launch risankizumab. These are all multibillion-dollar assets. We\u2019re going to fund those to the extent that is appropriate to drive the potential because that is ultimately what will offset and absorb the biosimilar impact. And so, that's the strategy that we\u2019ll drive.","Bill Chase","Yes. The only thing I\u2019d also add is as you look at the 50%, look, the big part of the story from here on out is going to be obviously P&L leverage, given robust sales that we\u2019re expecting once these new products get up to into their ramp. So, 2020 should be a sales expansion year. But, even then, we\u2019re always going to be thoughtful about how we deploy our resources. If you look at this year, on a operational sales increase of 1%, we\u2019re still delivering 200 basis points of op margin progress. So, I think that's pretty good. And we are appropriately funding those new product launches. The only way you can do that is being thoughtful about your overall book of SG&A and do some prudent reallocation. And obviously, you could infer to that happening in the numbers this year. So, look, we\u2019re always going to be thoughtful on spend. But, the real way to get an improved op margin is going to be through sales leverage, P&L leverage. And we are going to remain focused on making sure that we appropriately fund new opportunities.","Rick Gonzalez","And the only other thing I would add is, I think it\u2019s important to keep in perspective how this business is performing. You have a business here that for six years has delivered top-tier performance. Last year, we grew the bottom line 41% with the top line 15%. If you look at 2019 and you look at that guidance range at the midpoint being 10%, you back out the share repurchase, which is about 3 or 4 points of it, it says that the underlying business, despite taking almost $2.5 billion hit, is growing at 6% or 7% from an EPS standpoint. If you adjusted for the $2.5 billion, the bottom line is growing at 23%. There aren\u2019t many businesses around here that have that kind of performance. Top line is same thing. If I adjust the top line, which is roughly 1%, if I adjust it for the $2.5 billion, the rest of the business is growing high-single-digits. And so, you certainly want to make sure that you're in a position that you can continue to drive this business in a way that it can continue to perform because that is ultimately the way you\u2019re going to absorb biosimilars. And I would tell you that despite the fact that these biosimilars have priced more aggressively than we thought or the analogs would have suggested, the business is absorbing them effectively, and that's what the strategy was designed to do.","Operator","Our next question is from Geoffrey Porges from SVB Leerink. ","Geoffrey Porges","First, could you just talk a little bit about pricing, Rick? What assumptions about pricing you baked into your guidance for particularly U.S. revenue growth in 2019, and what do you think of the political risks that could affect that outlook? And then, secondly, could you talk a little bit about the launches of upa and risa in 2019? Could you help us understand what if any ability you have two prepare for those launches in your discussions with payers? Should we be expecting them to launch with the same sort of trajectories as the preceding products in that class or should we push those launches out to 2020, as you get into that payer cycle? Thanks.","Rick Gonzalez","I think if you look at pricing, we have now -- we were one of the companies that made a commitment that we're going to do one price increase per year, a couple of years ago, and it would be below double digits. And we've obviously honored that going forward. So, we've done the price increase for this year. You saw that it was lower, 6.2% roughly. And so, I think you know what the pricing will be in 2019 because we have no intention of doing another price increase in 2019. I think, if you look overall, yes, the industry has adjusted to some extent I believe to the environment as it relates to pricing. Our business is not a business that is driven to any great extent by pricing. We\u2019re fortunate that we have innovative products, and volume is the vast majority of it, though I mean you're probably talking -- 2019, you're probably talking overall negative price.","Bill Chase","For the entire book of business in the U.S., low single digit.","Rick Gonzalez","Yes. So, it\u2019s not heavily reliant upon price, nor last year was it heavily reliant upon price. So, I think we're comfortable with where we are from a pricing standpoint. We don\u2019t see any exposure related to that. As far as, upa and risa, obviously, we will want to get these products on formulary as broadly and as quickly as possible. I would say, that's an area that we have a team that is good at doing that, effective at doing that. And so, obviously, based on the fact that we assume risa is going to be approved here in the not too distant future, we have to be in a position we are in discussions, nothing that we update you here on. But, I would say the operating assumption that is probably a good assumption is that we will end up with broad coverage of these assets. As far as the ramp is concerned, I think I understood your question, and I'm going to answer it in the backdrop of what I thought you asked. What I thought you asked is how would I compare these to prior competitive launches? And I can tell you that we would expect, like other launches that will take a little bit of time in order to ramp. But, I'd say also, with our expertise in this area and the portfolio of assets that we have and the profile of these particular drugs from a clinical standpoint, I would expect that these assets will be able to drive significant share over time, and a significant capture of new patients and switching patients. And that will certainly be the strategy we have in place to drive a significant part of those available patients to these better assets.","Liz Shea","Thanks. Operator, next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Schott from JP Morgan.","Chris Schott","Thanks very much for the questions. My first one is just following up on the longer-term international HUMIRA business, so beyond 2019. Do you see 2019 as a peak rate of erosion for that business and then maybe more moderate step downs beyond 2019, or could we see several years of this more severe erosion level as we just think about kind of getting past this year and the outlook for that business? My second question was on capital allocation. And I guess, is the more challenging HUMIRA environment change or alter your priorities at all? I guess, specifically, the Company\u2019s been very active on the share repo front over the past few years. But, how do you balance, I guess that repo with priority with diversification, given some of these HUMIRA dynamics that we\u2019re seeing playing out?","Rick Gonzalez","So, I think, I would see that you have gotten the vast majority of the impact from a price erosion standpoint in 2019. But, remember what I described before. We have factored into our plan further erosion as you go throughout. So, there\u2019ll be some annualization impact that you would obviously see in 2020, if that is going to play out the way that we have planned for. And then, you will have some countries that will go biosimilar in \u201821; they have not gone biosimilar today. And then, we obviously have some impact, although I would say most of those countries, it should be a lower impact, but we\u2019re going to have to see how that sorts itself out. So, certainly, I don't think you will see a step down that\u2019s as significant as we\u2019ve seen in the first year because there have been very aggressive pricings in certain countries. And so, we\u2019ll obviously get to the point at which the biosimilar players have gotten to what they believe is the floor where they want to operate. And so, I think you should see it moderate, I guess, is the best way to describe it. As far as capital allocation versus share repo, I\u2019d say, if you look at how we\u2019ve operated this business since day one, we\u2019ve obviously been very vocal about how we view the business and what our mission and what our vision is for the business; and that is to drive long-term, sustainable top-tier performance. And in order to do that, you have to invest in the business appropriately.","We have obviously invested significantly in R&D. Since we launched the Company, we grew significantly. We've obviously been very active from a BD standpoint. At the same time, we have a business that generates a tremendous amount of cash flow, and we generated enough cash flow that we had opportunities to be able to also do share repurchase and other methods of being able to returning capital to shareholders, such as the growing dividend. And so, we try to balance those things in a way that is appropriate but never to not strategically invest in the business. That\u2019s always our first priority.","If you look at the share repo that we\u2019ve done in 2018, as an example, I think the thing you have to remember, and the numbers I quoted a minute ago I think are reflective of that. Share repo is driving some of the EPS growth, if you look at the midpoint. But, it\u2019s relatively modest, 3 to 4 percentage of that. And it wasn\u2019t driven for the purpose of doing that. Ultimately, we did the share repo and we announced it, I believe, in that first quarter call that we were going to do a significant amount of share repo because of tax reform, and we thought that was fundamentally important to be able return cash and capital back to shareholders. And so, we did it long before we ever knew what the biosimilar pricing would be. So, it wasn\u2019t driven for the purpose of driving the short-term versus the long-term.","Having said all that, we continue to be active and looking at opportunities there are out there. We have a very active business development group. We look at things that are small, things that are medium, things that are large, and we certainly have the wherewithal to be able to do things, if we could find something that strategically fit and we could get a good return on that, I can tell you we would act and we would act swiftly in order to do that. I think you\u2019ve seen us do that before. If we could find another IMBRUVICA or we could find another risankizumab out there, I can tell you we would aggressively pursue that. And so, we fundamentally have a pipeline that we believe has the ability to do what we strategically intended it to do, and that is to absorb the impact of biosimilars. Our focus is to ramp that pipeline as rapidly as we possibly can and make sure we're in a position to be able to continue to drive strong growth in the business.","Liz Shea","Thanks, Chris. Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Gerberry from Bank of America.","Jason Gerberry","Thanks for taking my questions. First one, just coming back to U.S. HUMIRA, just curious, the softening of the 2019 number, just sort of curious, to what degree is that cannibalization from the next generation immunology brands, sort of curious, if that's a factor or if it really is just sort of maybe the moderation of pricing. And then, my second question, I guess with Jamie no longer on these calls, I'll ask the question. Rick, how are you defining a large M&A deal? That's a question that we\u2019re getting from investors. So, if you can maybe put some parameters around that that would be great.","Rick Gonzalez","Last time I defined a large bolt-on, it had a undesirable reaction in the marketplace. The largest transaction that we've done so far has been Pharmacyclics. That's what I view as a -- the size of roughly a large bolt-on kinds of transaction. And when I say a large deal, I'm thinking about a very significant kind of deal, merger type deals; we\u2019re not contemplating anything of that magnitude at all. U.S. HUMIRA, do you want to cover that, Bill?","Bill Chase","Yes, sure. So, if you look at U.S. HUMIRA, we're guiding 7% in 2019. That's coming off of a number in \u201818 of 10%, and with, as I thank you pointed out, a lighter price increase on the years. So, if you really factor out the change in pricing year-over-year, you'll see that the business is still performing very, very well; volumes are still pretty much pegged right where they have been historically. You got the law of large numbers here a little bit. But, I wouldn't read much into underlying dynamics on HUMIRA other than continued strong performance in the U.S.","Liz Shea","Thanks, Jason. Operator, we have time for one final question.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today is from Katherine Xu from William Blair.","Katherine Xu","I'm just curious about the hem-onc franchise strategy. Apparently, IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA are doing well. What are you thinking about boosting over that? There is of course the case [ph] that you used have with other companies and returned, and there is also the cellular therapy -- therapeutic space there. I was just wondering about your general strategy there?","Rick Gonzalez","Mike?","Michael Severino","This is Mike. I\u2019ll take that. With respect to our hem-onc franchise, both IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA are performing very well, both from a data perspective and from their trajectories in the marketplace. One of the things that I think is particularly attractive about those two, with respect to our franchise, is that they cover a broad range of hem malignancies. They work well together in areas like CLL and mantle cell lymphoma, MCL, and they also have some unique areas, for example, like venetoclax in AML. So, that\u2019s going to be an important area for us going forward. It\u2019s now annualizing over $4 billion; it\u2019s growing at a robust rate. So, I think, you can expect to see us continue to work in this area. We\u2019re going to look at how we not only continue to develop those mechanisms in areas like multiple myeloma for VENCLEXTA, but also how from our earlier pipeline we can add additional mechanism, so that will further strengthen our position in hem-onc. And there are lot of things in our early, now approaching mid-stage pipeline work in apoptosis and other areas that could apply there. And of course, we\u2019re looking more broadly than that. You\u2019ve seen us do early stage deals, but early stage deals that give us access to interesting technologies. We have some very early plays that could be in toward cellular therapies and to other mechanisms that could further develop that franchise.","Liz Shea","Thanks, Katherine.

Welcome to the AbbVie Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to introduce Mr. Larry Peepo, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Larry Peepo","Good morning and thanks for joining us today. Also on the call with me is Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Laura Schumacher, Executive Vice President Business Development, External Affairs and General Counsel; Michael Severino, Executive Vice President of Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer; and Bill Chase, Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, I'll remind you that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.","Additional information about the factors that may affect AbbVie's operations is included in our 2014 Annual report on Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law.","On today's conference call as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. ","We want to remind you that we issued two separate news releases this morning in advance of today's call and have also posted slides on abbvieinvestor.com that supplements some of the content we'll be covering this morning. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions.","So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick.","Richard Gonzalez","Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. As Larry mentioned, we'll be covering two topics on the call this morning. I'll briefly discuss our third-quarter 2015 performance highlights and Bill will walk you through the quarter in a bit more detail. I'll then discuss the Company's long-term strategic and financial objectives that we outlined this morning, including our expectations for growth and other financial metrics over our long-range plan. As always, we'll provide ample time to answer your questions.","We delivered another quarter of strong performance with third quarter results well ahead of our expectations. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.13, representing growth of nearly 27% versus the third quarter of 2014. This is the third consecutive quarter of delivering roughly 30% EPS growth. Our results in the quarter included operational sales growth of more than 26%.","Before I provided an overview of our highlights in the quarter, I'll briefly provide our perspective on the recent update to our U.S. VIEKIRA label. As you're likely aware, last week, we updated the prescribing information to reflect a change in the use of VIEKIRA in certain patients with advanced cirrhosis. Specifically, Child-Pugh C patients. VIEKIRA went from not recommended to contraindicated. VIEKIRA was and remains contraindicated in Child-Pugh C patients. In addition, the updated label recommends a clinical and laboratory assessment for patients with cirrhosis to ensure that those with decompensated disease are identified.","Turning now to the other quarterly events. In the quarter, we advanced several important strategic priorities, continued to enhance operational efficiency and achieved a number of clinical and regulatory objectives. Our third-quarter performance was driven by growth from several product in our portfolio, including strong growth from HUMIRA and IMBRUVICA, continued uptake of VIEKIRA and continued growth from Creon and Duodopa.","We also continued to improve efficiency across our operations delivering roughly 640 basis points in operating margin expansion this quarter versus the prior year, achieving an operating margin of 44.9%. I'll discuss our commitment to further drive this metric in the context of our long-term financial objectives in just a few moments.","We continue to be very pleased with the advancement and de-risking of our mid- and late-stage pipeline. During the quarter, we reported positive data, advanced programs into the regulatory approval cycle and received approval for several assets. Last month, we reported positive top line results from two Phase 2b studies of our selective JAK1 inhibitor. We believe ABT-494 has a very compelling profile, with a potential for best in class efficacy even in the most difficult to treat TNF inadequate responder patients, and with once daily dosing. We'll present the full results from the two mid-stage trials in an upcoming medical meeting and are on track to initiate the Phase 3 studies by year-end.","We also reported positive top line findings from a Phase 2b trial of elagolix in patients with uterine fibroids. Preliminary results from the six-month study demonstrated that all of the treatment arms achieved the study's primary endpoint. Based on these findings, we plan to advance elagolix into Phase 3 development for fibroids, with initiation expected in the first quarter of 2016.","We recently submitted the U.S. regulatory application for IMBRUVICA as a therapy in treatment naive patients with CLL. In June, we announced the top line results from the Phase 3 RESONATE-2 trial comparing IMBRUVICA monotherapy to chlorambucil in patients aged 65 or older. The results illustrate that treatment with IMBRUVICA significantly improved progression-free survival and multiple secondary endpoints, including overall survival in first-line therapy.","As we've said, a significant portion of our valuation for Pharmacyclics was attributed to advancing into first line treatment, and while we assumed a very high probability of success, the RESONATE-2 data provides strong evidence of IMBRUVICA's efficacy in a frontline setting, further de-risking this component of our model. The trial results will be published in a peer reviewed medical journal and presented at an upcoming medical meeting, and we anticipate a regulatory decision to use in treatment naive first-line patients in the first half of 2016. Given the robust results, we have a high degree of confidence that IMRUVICA will be very successful as front line therapy.","We also recently completed our U.S. regulatory submission for venetoclax or ABT-199 in relapsed\/refractory CLL patients with 17p deletion. We also recently received regulatory approval for our two pill, once daily HCV therapy in Japan. We expect to receive reimbursement and launch in Japan in the next month or so. Late last month, we submitted our regulatory application for a once daily formulation of VIEKIRA PAK in the U.S. Finally, during the quarter, we received regulatory approval for HUMIRA as a treatment for HS and we submitted our U.S. and European regulatory applications for HUMIRA as a treatment for uveitis.","In summary, we delivered another quarter of strong results exceeding our guidance range for the quarter, and we raised our full-year 2015 outlook to the upper end of our previous guidance range, reflecting growth of roughly 28%. Our results year-to-date demonstrate the significant progress we've made towards our objective of delivering industry-leading growth. I'll discuss our strong outlook for 2016, as well as our longer term financial commitments after Bill covers our third quarter results in more detail.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. Bill?","William Chase","Thank you, Rick. This morning, I'll review our third quarter performance and provide an update on our outlook for 2015. As Rick mentioned, in addition to delivering strong top line growth in the third quarter, we again exceeded our earnings-per-share guidance range with growth of nearly 27% versus the third quarter of 2014. Operational growth on the top line was very strong at 26.2%, excluding a 7.8% negative impact from foreign exchange. Reported sales were up 18.4%.","HUMIRA delivered global sales of more than $3.6 billion, up 19.6% on an operational basis. We continue to see strong momentum for HUMIRA as the market leader around the world. On a reported basis, currency had a negative 7.5% impact on global HUMIRA sales, and reduced international HUMIRA sales by 16%. U.S. HUMIRA sales increased 30.4%. We've seen acceleration in market growth this year in the U.S. with HUMIRA driving strong growth across the gastro, rhum and derm segments. Wholesale inventory levels remained constant at roughly half a month.","Internationally, HUMIRA sales increased 7.1% on an operational basis in the third quarter, roughly double the rate of growth we reported in the second quarter. HUMIRA's momentum has not been adversely impacted by the Remicade biosimilar. We continue to see only modest overall share gains for the biosimilar in the major markets, in line with our planning assumptions. HUMIRA's list of indications continues to grow with recent EMA and FDA, approvals for HS. HUMIRA is also currently under regulatory review for uveitis with approval expected by the end of 2016.","Global peak year sales for HS are expected to be approximately $1 billion per year, while uveitis sales are expected to reach several hundred million dollars per year. For the full year 2015, we now expect global HUMIRA sales growth in the high teens on an operational basis, an increase from previous guidance of mid-teens operational growth. This reflects a forecast for you U.S. growth approaching 30% and high single-digit international operational growth.","This was the first full quarter of IMBRUVICA sales since the closing of the Pharmacyclics acquisition and global sales were strong at $304 million. U.S. sales were $267 million and our international profit-sharing was $37 million. For 2015, we continue to expect Pharmacyclics to add more than $750 million to our top line through revenue occurring after the May 26 closing date.","Global VIEKIRA sales in the third quarter were $469 million. The international launch has continued to exceed our planning expectations and has resulted in a higher mix of international sales this year. As Rick mentioned, we recently received regulatory approval in Japan for our two drug, once daily, ribavirin free combination for the treatment of genotype 1b. We anticipate launching in Japan next month following the traditional 60 day reimbursement review cycle. We also saw a strong performance across a number of our other products including Duodopa, Creon and Lupron.","Turning to the P&L profile, we are pleased with our progress in the quarter as we showed continued improvement in gross margin as a percentage of sales. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 83.3%, driven by exchange, operational efficiencies as well as product mix. Adjusted R&D was 15.4% of sales, reflecting funding actions in support of our pipeline asset. Adjusted SG&A was 23% of sales in the third quarter, down from the prior year, contributing to continued improvement in our operating margin profile.","We delivered an adjusted operating margin of 44.9% of sales, up 640 basis points versus the prior year quarter. After adjusting for a modest negative impact from Pharmacyclics, more than 500 basis points of this improvement was driven by efficiencies and P&L leverage. Net interest expense was $197 million, reflecting the impact of debt issued in connection with the Pharmacyclics acquisition. The adjusted tax rate was 21.9% in the quarter.","Third quarter adjusted earnings per share excluding non-cash intangible amortization expense and specified items were $1.13, up nearly 27% year-over-year and exceeding our previous guidance range. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share was $0.74.","Moving on to our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are raising our 2015 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $4.26 to $4.28. This reflects EPS growth of approximately 28% at the midpoint. This guidance excludes $1.10 per share of intangible amortization expense, deal costs, integration and other specified items. We expect fourth quarter revenue growth on an operational basis in the low 20% range, excluding approximately 5% negative impact from exchange in the quarter.","For the full year 2015, we are forecasting an operating margin of 42% to 42.5% of sales, and as Rick noted, today, we provided a 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $4.90 to $5.10. We'll provide more detail regarding this guidance as we normally do, on the fourth quarter call in January.","So, in conclusion, we're pleased with the drivers of our strong performance, further demonstrating the quality of our results in the quarter, and thus far in 2015. We've driven strong top and bottom line growth and delivered operating margin expansion, while also advancing our strategic priorities. This puts us in a strong position to deliver top-tier industry growth this year and in the coming years.","With that, I'll turn it back to Rick to walk you through our long-term strategic objectives.","Richard Gonzalez","Thanks Bill. As a reminder, we have posted slides to our website which you can use to follow along. My remarks regarding our long-term strategy generally coincide with the presentation. Today, we'll share with you some of the key assumptions from our long-range plan which we review annually with our Board of Directors. Over the past couple of quarters. There has been an increasing level of interest from investors for more detail on our views regarding a variety of topics, including AbbVie's long-term growth prospects over the next several years, our ability to expand margins, our expectations around biosimilars and our pipeline prospects.","Additionally, as we evaluated our long-range plans, expected performance versus Wall Street's consensus, there is a clear gap in revenue and EPS growth. Based on these dynamics, we decided it was appropriate to provide investors with a clear view of our expected performance and the significant drivers of that performance.","Turning to Slide 3, our mission when we launched as an independent company was to create an innovation driven patient focused specialty biopharmaceutical company, capable of achieving sustainable top-tier performance through outstanding execution and a consistent stream of innovative medicines. Our actions, since our inception have clearly supported that mission. We've built an innovation driven culture, attracting top talent, focused on developing new products to address some of the most serious health conditions. We delivered outstanding performance from our promoted portfolio.","This includes, HUMIRA, where we have accelerated growth and developed a comprehensive strategy for the future. Our heightened level of R&D investment has generated above industry success rate with positive clinical data and regulatory outcome from a number of development programs. Our pipeline now has a number of late stage de-risked assets with multibillion-dollar potential. We acquired Pharmacyclics, providing a major new growth platform in a key strategic area, and significantly strengthening our long-term growth prospects.","We have placed a significant focus on driving operating efficiencies with impressive results to date. We've built shareholder value and confidence with investors based on consistent strong performance and we've delivered strong return of capital to investors, including a rapidly growing dividend. Our actions have placed AbbVie in a position to achieve top-tier performance, and you clearly see that in our results.","As I mentioned earlier, our current guidance projects EPS growth of more than 28% in 2015. Our fundamental strategy is strong and we've built an excellent foundation. As you can see on Slide 4, since 2013 we have consistently delivered strong financial results, including acceleration across key financial parameters. We've generated significant top and bottom-line growth and robust operating cash flows.","Turning to Slide 5, despite our enhanced level of R&D spend as you can see on this slide, which has grown substantially since we were a division within Abbott. We've driven significant improvement in both gross and operating margin profiles. We remain focused on further margin expansion, and I'll outline our commitments to enhancing these metrics in just a moment.","Moving to Slide 6, we've also established a strong track record of delivering on our financial commitments, consistently meeting or exceeding our earnings estimates. We're proud of this outperformance, and we remain disciplined in achieving our stated objectives.","As noted on Slide 7, AbbVie's total shareholder return since separation is nearly 76%, a result that places AbbVie in the top third of our peer group. These strong returns have created more than $35 billion of value for our shareholders, and a market cap of nearly $90 billion.","Turning to Slide 8, while we've demonstrated a very strong track record of historical performance, we're also committed to delivering top-tier results in the years to come. As we evaluate our prospects over our long-range plan. We believe we're well-positioned for success. We're strategically positioned in attractive, high-growth market segments and based on continued strong performance from our existing portfolio of on market products, including our flagship brands HUMIRA and IMBRUVICA, as well as growth from our pipeline products, we expect to deliver top-tier revenue growth through 2020.","Today, as you can see on Slide 8, we're providing guidance for total company sales of approximately $37 billion in 2020. This reflects 10% top line sales growth on average over the five-year period. This guidance includes estimated global HUMIRA sales of more than $18 billion in 2020, which we believe appropriately captures the expected biosimilar dynamics globally. I'll share more detail on our comprehensive strategy to continue our leadership position in immunology later in these remarks.","Additionally, we expect AbbVie's IMBRUVICA revenues to reach approximately $5 billion in 2020, driven by continued growth within the hematological oncology market, and our pipeline has the potential to achieve nominal peak revenues of nearly $30 billion by 2024. This estimate excludes new HUMIRA and IMBRUVICA indications and sales from our next-generation HCV combination, which are considered on market products, for the purpose of this calculation.","We have the potential to launch more than 20 new products or indications through 2020, including seven approvals that will contribute in 2016, and beyond. I'll discuss some of these promising programs today but we will be covering our full pipeline in more detail at an R&D pipeline review to be held in Chicago during the 2016 ASCO meeting.","As I mentioned, our significant focus on operating efficiencies has resulted in strong improvement of our gross and operating margin profiles. The Company is committed to driving continued expansion of operating margin and is targeting an adjusted operating margin of greater than 50% by 2020, with an average of 100 basis points to 200 basis points of improvement per year.","AbbVie also remains committed to returning cash to shareholders, through a strong and growing dividend. To that end, today, we announced that our Board declared an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $0.51 per share to $0.57 per share, an increase of approximately 12% beginning with a dividend payable in February 2016. Our commitment to top line growth and continued operating margin expansion will drive double-digit earnings-per-share growth on average through 2020, and today we're issuing strong full year 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $4.90 to $5.10. This outlook represents 17% growth versus 2015, at the midpoint and positions AbbVie to be among the industry leaders for EPS growth again next year.","Turning now to Slide 9. To accomplish these goals, we have narrowed our focus, and positioned AbbVie for a leadership in extremely attractive market segments. Our core areas of therapeutic focus include immunology, where we have a strong leadership position, across rheumatology, GI and dermatology. We're leveraging our scientific leadership and expertise to develop next-generation biologics and small molecules that elevate standard of care.","We have multiple pipeline assets in mid- to late-stage development with best in class potential. The oncology market represents an $85 billion segment projected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 12% through 2020. Within this market, we have a developing leadership position in the hematological segment with IMBRUVICA and we have several other mechanisms in development, including our BCL-2 PI3 kinase and our anti-CS1 antibody drug conjugate. We also have an emerging pipeline of assets for the treatment of solid tumors, including our PARP inhibitor, Veliparib and ABT-414 for glioblastoma multiforme.","Virology also represents a large and durable segment for us. We've established a foothold in the marketplace with our current offering VIEKIRA. Our emphasis is on continuing to evolve HCV treatment, and our next-generation combination is poised to deliver meaningful improvements relative to currently available therapies.","Earlier this year, we disclosed preliminary results from a Phase 2b study of our next-generation protease inhibitor ABT-493 and our next-generation NS5A inhibitor ABT-530. The interim data showed non-cirrhotic genotype 1a and 1b treatment-naive and experienced patients receiving the ribavirin free therapy for 12 weeks, achieved SVR 12 rates of 99%. The dose we intend to pursue in Phase 3 drove SVR 12 rates of 100%. Preliminary results from the eight-week treatment cohort were disclosed last week. These data show that 34 of 34 or 100% of genotype 1 patients achieved SVR4. We'll share additional results from our next-generation combination at the AASLD meeting next month. ","Neurology represents a large market with significant unmet need. We're focused on developing disease modifying therapies for Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative conditions. Our existing portfolio includes Duopa for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease and Zinbryta which is currently under regulatory review in the U.S. and Europe for multiple sclerosis. We're also placing focused investment in our late stage programs in women's health with elagolix, and renal disease with atrasentan, as well as early-stage programs in cystic fibrosis. Endometriosis and uterine fibroids are both highly prevalent conditions and elagolix has demonstrated promising results in the treatment of both of these conditions.","Now turning to Slide 10, based on our long-range plan for our marketed product portfolio, and our risk-adjusted pipeline, we're targeting total revenue of approximately $37 billion in 2020, reflecting a top line compounded annual growth rate of 10%. As you can see, our estimates are roughly $5 billion above the current Wall Street consensus.","Our 2020 target revenue is based on a number of performance drivers. We expect HUMIRA to continue to be a strong growth driver, adding close to $4 billion in sales by 2020. AbbVie's IMBRUVICA revenue will reach approximately $5 billion by 2020. Our HCV franchise will remain a significant contributor to our long-range plan. Our pipeline will add more than $4 billion in risk-adjusted sales and Duopa will reach blockbuster status globally.","Turning now to Slide 11, we expect several key products within our current marketed product portfolio to add significant growth in the years to come, including HUMIRA, IMBRUVICA, HCV and Duopa collectively will add $10 billion in incremental sales by 2020. Growth of HUMIRA will be driven by continued biologic penetration across disease categories and new indications. I'll talk more about our planning assumptions around HUMIRA growth and the impact of biosimilars in just a moment.","IMBRUVICA's growth in this timeframe will be predominantly driven by increasing penetration within our currently approved set of indications and movement in the frontline use for those indications. The RESONATE-2 data further reinforces our view that IMBRUVICA will be a highly successful agent in frontline therapy for CLL. Growth will also come from label expansion into new hematological cancer, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma and multiple myeloma.","Growth in our HCV franchise will be driven by continued uptake of VIEKIRA PAK across geographies, including Japan, the second largest HCV market globally, and we expect to commercialize our next-generation HCV offering in 2017, which will be a pan-genotypic once daily, ritonavir and ribavirin-free combination. Given the significant global prevalence of this disease, we expect the HCV market to be very durable, well into 2020.","As I said, we forecast Duopa will achieve sales greater than $1 billion globally by 2020, and finally other products in our on market portfolio including Creon, Synagis, Lupron, Synthroid represent steady and durable sales contributors over our long-range plan.","Turning to Slide 12, our growth outlook for HUMIRA is based on a thorough analysis of the global market dynamics and the strategy that we've put in place. We've taken what we believe is a realistic view of the market and the competitive environment over the next five years, and expect global HUMIRA sales in 2020 to exceeded $18 billion.","Turning to Slide 13, we have a comprehensive strategy in place, which we believe will allow us to protect and grow our leadership position in immunology. Our multifaceted strategy is comprised of HUMIRA intellectual property, enhancements to HUMIRA, innovation, including a robust immunology pipeline and strong commercial execution.","Turning now to Slide 14, we're planning conservatively with respect to the timing for European biosimilars and for planning purposes expect direct HUMIRA biosimilar competition upon expiration of our compound patent in Europe in October 2018. However, we are pursuing additional IP in Europe and expect the situation to evolve over time. Again, though, the guidance we've outlined today excludes any potential benefit from our IP in Europe.","Turning to our U.S. patent estate, as you can see on Slide 14, we have built a robust portfolio of intellectual property. Beyond our composition of matter patent, we have more than 70 additional later expiring U.S. patents related to HUMIRA. The vast majority of these patents which reflect significant innovation and investment were granted by the U.S. patent and trademark office within the past two years. These patents expire between 2022 and 2034. The size of AbbVie's patent estate is a direct consequence of the ground-breaking work of AbbVie scientists in a new field of biologics.","Small molecules drugs have been around for many decades, but therapeutic antibodies are much newer, larger and more complex. Because they must be made in living organisms, biologics are more difficult to manufacture. In addition, because they are foreign proteins that are introduced into the human body, biologics present unique challenges in terms of formulation and treatment.","Not only is the field new, but HUMIRA itself was a new type of biologic. It was the first fully human therapeutic antibody ever approved by the FDA. The development of HUMIRA was unchartered territory. Those efforts resulted in the United States Patent Office granting AbbVie dozens of patents covering HUMIRA. The coverage of our later expiring patents includes methods of use for the drug in all HUMIRA indications, methods to formulate the drug, and methods to make the drug, as well as other aspects of the HUMIRA product such as the delivery device.","Any company seeking to market a biosimilar version of HUMIRA will have to contend with this extensive patent estate, which AbbVie intends to enforce vigorously. With respect to formulating the drug, we have patents on formulating the HUMIRA antibody, that also expire no earlier than 2022. Biologic drugs must be administered intravenously or as injections and can be difficult to formulate properly. Given our extensive experience with HUMIRA, these patents cover not only our commercial formulation, but also other related formulations that biosimilar companies might employ. 14 patents have been issued covering different formulations of HUMIRA.","With respect to making the drug, we have important patents on the methods of manufacturing HUMIRA that expire no earlier than 2027. The living cells that produce biologic drugs such as HUMIRA can be sensitive to small changes in the manufacturing process. Minor differences in manufacturing process can affect the nature of the biologic drug and even its clinical effect. 24 patents have been issued covering methods of manufacturing HUMIRA and HUMIRA compositions resulting from those methods.","Today, I'll focus on those patents which cover using the drug, otherwise known as method of treatment patents. While AbbVie's formulation and manufacturing patents for HUMIRA also have broad coverage, without further information on the biosimilar we cannot know with certainty, the extent to which these patents will be infringed.","Now turning to Slide 15. Since the biosimilar statute requires the biosimilar to obtain approval for one or more indications previously approved for the innovator drug, and have the same route of administration, dosage form and strength, we know biosimilars will infringe these method of use patents. We have method of treatment patents covering all the indications for which HUMIRA has been approved. These patents do not expire until 2022 or later. These patents reflect the development work of more than 100 clinical trials, spanning 18 years. As discovered through this work and reflected in the HUMIRA label, different diseases require different treatment regimens, which AbbVie discovered following significant investment in clinical development.","These patent in uses have been key to the success of HUMIRA. They have opened up new and better treatment options for an increased patient population and improved the quality of life for those patients. Our method of treatment patents cover the approved dosing regimens for each indication and are not mere refinements of previous dosing regimens, which is often the case with method of treatment patents in the small molecule arena.","Furthermore, biologics like HUMIRA are more complex and unpredictable by their nature than small molecules. As such, Biologics present unique challenges in terms of treatment. One challenge was the fact that HUMIRA targets TNF alpha, a protein that plays an important role in the human immune system. It is critical to find the right balance in terms of blocking the harmful effects caused by excessive TNF alpha without interfering with the normal functioning of the immune system. This made the development of safe and effective methods of administering HUMIRA all the more difficult, and because HUMIRA was the first human therapeutic antibody ever approved by the FDA of any type, the work by AbbVie scientists was unprecedented.","In total, putting aside the composition of matter patents on HUMIRA, there are 22 issued patents directed to the treatment of TNF mediated diseases that expire in 2022 or later. Additional applications are pending and still being examined in the patent office.","Again, a biosimilar company will have to contend with our method of treatment patents for every indication for which it seeks approval, as well as our formulation and manufacturing patents which are not limited to any particular indication.","Turning to Slide 16. As you evaluate the timeframe for a potential U.S. biosimilar market entry, it is important that you consider the legal process and the likely timeline for resolution. While it's always difficult to estimate the precise duration of the litigation process, the average time to trial for a patent action is nearly 3.5 years. Appeals to the Federal Circuit Court usually take one year. So, based on similar cases, the total litigation timing may be as long as four or five years.","At risk launches, when a company launches a generic product before patent expiration and before a final determination that a patent is invalid or not infringed, are relatively rare due to the potential exposure. Because of HUMIRA's success such damages could be extremely large. Of course, we can't know how other companies will evaluate that risk.","However, in the event a biosimilar attempts to launch at risk, AbbVie will seek injunctive relief. For the reasons we've already discussed, biosimilars will necessarily infringe our patents. Given the unique properties of HUMIRA and the lack of any prior experience with fully human monoclonal antibodies these patents are strong. Courts considering request for preliminary injunctions have considered these factors important and have granted injunctions where they are present.","Turning now to Slide 17, another important aspect of our immunology strategy is our pipeline. This includes both enhancements to HUMIRA as well as our promising pipeline of new products in development, which are designed to restate standard of care in each of our areas of leadership. We have two new indications for HUMIRA that will contribute significantly to the product's continued growth.","We also recently received approval in Europe for a new formulation of HUMIRA, which provides meaningful patient benefit, including lower levels of pain, versus the current formulation, and we are submitting regulatory applications for an improved HUMIRA pen device which we expect to introduce in 2016.","Finally, we are continuing to work on developing proprietary delivery technologies and devices to further enhance the product. Behind HUMIRA, we have a pipeline of mid and late stage immunology assets in clinical development. AbbVie is the clear leader in immunology. It is a category we understand extremely well and our performance is reflective of our deep expertise. As we embarked upon developing a set of next-generation assets, we did so with our knowledge of the type of breakthrough profile a new drug would require in order to achieve a significant market share position.","Each of the assets that we have in our immunology pipeline has the potential to deliver that type of market changing product profile that we're targeting. We're very pleased with the mid-stage results from our selective JAK1 inhibitor ABT-494, which shows the potential to be best in class in RA with high efficacy once daily dosing and a favorable benefit risk profile. We're particularly excited about the results of ABT-494 demonstrated in the most challenging patient population, the anti-TNF inadequate responders. Given that anti-TNF therapies have been available now for nearly 2 decades. This patient population has grown over time. In fact, the population currently represents roughly 35% of the U.S. patient population. We are rapidly moving ABT-494, the Phase 3 studies, and it is our goal to launch this asset into the U.S. market well in advance of any biosimilar entry. Our large and experienced commercial organization which currently represents HUMIRA will promote ABT-494 and our other immunology pipeline assets upon their U.S. commercialization. We have tremendous confidence in the organization's ability to successfully represent these assets.","We also believe our DVD antibody platform holds tremendous promise in the treatment of certain immunity conditions. ABT-122 is our combination anti-TNF anti-IL-17, two proven mechanisms which is currently in Phase 2 trials for RA, and psoriatic arthritis. Our earlier development work with the platform has established that our DVDs have favorable drug-like properties, similar to monoclonal antibodies and can be manufactured reliably.","We'll see data from the mid-stage trial in RA in early 2016 and results from our study in psoriatic arthritis later in the year. If the results are positive, we will quickly advance ABT-122 into Phase 3 development.","We're also working to advance several other early and mid-stage immunology programs including our partnered anti-IL-6 Nanobody and we continue to explore the LMA landscape for assets that fit our target product profile.","Moving on to Slide 18, HUMIRA's unique product profile and AbbVie's strong commercial execution has HUMIRA the number one prescribed biologic with the highest commercial prescription market share, including the highest percentage of new patient starts. HUMIRA holds the preferred or co-preferred position on managed care of more than 90% of U.S. covered lives. Patients, physicians and payers recognize the meaningful clinical and economic value of HUMIRA as a treatment option for the broadest set of immune mediated diseases. We've demonstrated that treatment with HUMIRA is more cost-effective and saves payers on downstream costs associated with diseases like RA, Crohn's and psoriasis.","Moving on now to Slide 19. As I said, we've taken what we believe is a realistic view of our prospects of our long-range plan. Given the competitive landscape, potential for biosimilars and other factors. Our plan is built around a key set of assumptions that vary by geography. Let me start with international. Internationally, we are planning for mid-single digit market growth over the long range plan. Our plan assumes some limited erosion upon Enbrel biosimilar launches starting in 2016.","As outlined, embedded within our guidance is an expectation for HUMIRA ex-U.S. biosimilar launch in the fourth quarter of 2018, with the expected pricing and market share performance for such products. We anticipate moderate erosion from direct HUMIRA biosimilar competition beginning in 2019. In the U.S. our long-range plan assumes that U.S. markets deliver mid to high size single digit market growth driven by roughly a 4 point increase in biologic penetration.","Despite competitive entries we expect HUMIRA will only experience minor erosion of market share over our LRP, and as we've outlined, we believe the litigation process and our intellectual property estate will protect HUMIRA from biosimilar entry until 2022.","Our LRP also assumes successful penetration of new HUMIRA indications and then our immunology pipeline will begin to contribute new revenues with commercialization of ABT-494 in 2019 and other assets to follow. It is our expectation that AbbVie's immunology pipeline will contribute nearly $8 billion in nominal sales in 2024, with ABT-494 a significantly de-risked asset, representing roughly half that expected contribution.","Now, moving to Slide 20 and moving on to our oncology portfolio, as we've said, we acquired Pharmacyclics and IMBRUVICA represents a pipeline in a molecule with significant growth potential through its existing and expanding list of indications and lines of therapy. This transformative therapy has already secured approval for the treatment of four indications and there are more than 25 company-sponsored clinical studies to evaluate IMBRUVICA as a treatment for a wide range of additional cancers.","In its first year on the market, Pharmacyclics and our partner have driven market-leading performance and therapeutic uptake of IMBRUVICA, clearly demonstrating the strength of the medicine's attributes and its clinical profile. We expect IMBRUVICA to achieve blockbuster status in 2015, with AbbVie's projected IMBRUVICA revenues growing to approximately $5 billion in 2020. IMBRUVICA, has vast potential for label expansion and future indications. It is currently being evaluated in mid and late stage trials in follicular lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and multiple myeloma.","We are also encouraged about IMBRUVICA's potential in graft-versus-host disease based on data from an earlier stage study, and if IBRUVICA demonstrates clinical value in solid tumors there would certainly be significant upside to our expectations. We recently initiated a phase 3 trial evaluating IMBRUVICA and pancreatic cancer, and we're currently studying IMBRUVICA in other solid tumour types in combination with immuno-oncology, including early-stage studies in breast and lung cancer.","Turning now to Slide 21, our acquisition of Pharmacyclics significantly accelerated AbbVie's clinical and commercial presence in oncology. With IMBRUVICA, we've established a leadership position in the haematological oncology market, which is poised to nearly double to $50 billion by 2020. We're well-positioned to build upon our leadership in this category with other promising assets in development.","Beyond IMBRUVICA, we have several other products in development that have the potential to offer differentiated efficacy in a wide range of blood cancers. Our BCL-2 inhibitor, venetoclax is in late stage development for CLL, and mid-stage trials for several other cancer types, including NHL, AML and multiple myeloma. Duvelisib is a mid and late stage trials for CLL and NHL, and we have an innovative antibody drug conjugate in early development for multiple myeloma.","Given our broad portfolio, we believe, we have the potential to continue to evolve the treatment landscape with combinations of these and other mechanisms. Our goal is to markedly improve efficacy by achieving deep, durable disease control or remissions while reducing or eliminating the use of toxic chemotherapy.","We recently completed the design for our first clinical trial evaluating Venetoclax in combination with IMBRUVICA and Gazyva in first-line CLL and we expect to initiate the study in the first half of 2016.","We also have an active discovery program with the objective to drive the next wave of immuno-oncology development beyond checkpoint inhibitors. We're particularly focused on the use of our bispecific biologic platform to support conditional activation of the immune system in the vicinity of tumour cells, and we're leveraging the emerging science of soluble T-cell receptor technology as well. We anticipate multiple immuno-oncology assets moving into human trials in 2016.","Moving to Slide 22, the assets in our pipeline stay in attractive especially categories. All told, we have more than 50 products or indications currently being evaluated in human trials with more than 20 currently in registrational trials or under active regulatory review.","Turning now to Slide 23, we built a robust pipeline comprised of potentially transformational medicines in large markets with profound unmet medical need. Our pipeline has the potential to deliver nearly $30 billion in nominal new revenue by 2024. Several products currently in late stage development have the potential to be multibillion-dollar assets that will offer growth and top line diversification. We also have numerous programs in early stage development underway that have the potential to come to fruition in the later years of our long-range plan.","Now turning to Slide 24. Over the past year, we've seen data from numerous key assets that have further increased our level of confidence in all likelihood of clinical, regulatory and commercial success. Based on our progress, we have significantly de-risked a large number of major development programs that now have a very high probability of success. For example, our first registrational study for Venetoclax in relapsed refractory CLL patients with 17P deletion met its primary endpoint and is currently under regulatory review.","As mentioned earlier, the frontline data for IMBRUVICA in CLL were robust and our regulatory applications are under active review. Regulatory submissions for Zinbryta and MS are well underway, supported by a large registration program that showed the novel biological superior versus an active comparator. We've seen positive data from several Elagolix studies in endometriosis and uterine fibroids. Our partnered asset, Elotuzumab is currently under regulatory review for relapsed refractory multiple myeloma, following receipt of breakthrough designation.","We disclosed top line data from our selective JAK1 inhibitor ABT-2494, illustrating its potential for best in class efficacy in RA even in the most difficult to treat TNF inadequate responder patients. We have successfully completed the HUMIRA uveitis pivotal trial with filings currently under regulatory review, and we announced top line data from our next-generation HCV program illustrating its potential to offer a highly competitive profile.","Turning now to Slide 25. We made significant progress with our pipeline and we anticipate continued advancements between now and the end of 2016. As you can see noted on this slide, we have numerous product approvals, data readouts, registration submissions and phase transitions anticipated over the next year or so.","Now turning to Slide 26. The continued growth from our existing portfolio combined with the risk-adjusted sales contribution from our pipeline will drive top-tier revenue performance over our long-range plan. This level of revenue growth puts AbbVie near the very top of our expanded peer group based on current consensus estimates.","Turning now to Slide 27, in addition to the strong top line growth we also expect to deliver significant margin expansion in the years to come. Our focus on driving operating efficiencies to date has resulted in strong improvement in both gross and operating margin profiles. On this slide, you can see the significant level of margin improvement that we've delivered since our first quarter as an independent company.","Turning to Slide 28. Our continued focus on operating margin will drive further expansion with a projected operating margin of greater than 50% by 2020 and an average of 100 basis points to 200 basis points of improvement per year. Expansion will be driven primarily by ongoing efficiency programs, optimized manufacturing, commercial infrastructure, administrative costs and general corporate expenses, productivity initiatives and supply chain, and the reduction of HUMIRA royalty expense in 2017 and 2018.","Additionally, we'll see continued sales leverage from our rapidly growing top line. Our guidance for 2020 operating margin incorporates approximately 200 basis points of diluted impact partnered assets, including IMBRUVICA, Venetoclax, Zinbryta and Synagis.","As you can see on Slide 29, this powerful combination of revenue growth and margin expansion, positions AbbVie as one of the top EPS growth companies among our expanded peer group.","Turning now to Slide 30. AbbVie generates significant cash flow, which we expect will grow in 2016, and beyond. So far in 2015, we have repurchased $6.25 billion of shares, including the ASR associated with Pharmacyclics acquisition, and we have $3.45 billion remaining on our current buyback program.","As I mentioned earlier, today, we announced that our Board has authorized a 12% increase in our quarterly dividend. Since 2013, we've increased our dividend by more than 42%, and we intend to maintain a strong commitment to growing dividend going forward. We'll also use our strong cash flow to continue to augment our pipeline through strategic licensing, acquisitions and partnering activity.","Over the past several years, we've added numerous promising assets to our portfolio and we continue to focus on identifying compelling programs that fit our strategic criteria.","Turning to Slide 31, since we became an independent company in 2013, we've consistently delivered on our commitments, and we are positioned to deliver more than 28% bottom-line growth in 2015. A level of performance that puts us at the top of our peer group, and as we look at 2016, we're once again poised to deliver top tier financial performance with EPS growth of 17%, the midpoint of our strong guidance range.","Based on our 2016 midpoint, AbbVie will have grown its EPS by roughly 60% in just three years. Across our long-range plan, we're projecting our EPS growth to average nearly 15%, again putting AbbVie in the very top of our peer group.","In summary, we're well-positioned to deliver strong top and bottom-line performance through 2020 and beyond. We've established growth platforms in some of the largest and most diffractive market segments, including immunology, oncology, virology and neurology and we build a compelling pipeline in these areas which will contribute significantly to our performance in the years to come. Our commitment to top line growth and expanding our operating margin to greater than 50% will generate double-digit EPS growth on average through 2020. We've built a strong foundation and we are committed to delivering top-tier financial performance.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Larry. Larry?","Larry Peepo","Thanks, Rick, and we'll now open the call for questions. Operator, we will take our first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jami Rubin","Thank you, and wow that was a lot of detail, Rick. It's going to take time I think to digest it all, but I know that we certainly really appreciate it. First question is this, was wondering if management's comp is tied to the long term targets.","Secondly, it seems that the biggest delta between the Street and your guidance on HUMIRA is timing of a biosimilar launch. Wondering if you could comment on that and also if you could comment on Amgen CEO's comment on his earnings call, where he said that HUMIRA has IP and Amgen has to respect that. So, is it the case that the Street's coming around to your view on the strength of your IP and the timeline of 351(k) pathway regulations or has something really changed in terms of your confidence with IP?","Thirdly, and I'm sorry for this but, with your operating margin guidance growing to over 50% by the end of the decade, it looks like that's really coming or driven by strong revenue growth not by operating cost cuts. Can you confirm that and obviously in a sort of a bear case scenario, how much flexibility do you have to reduce your SG&A? We all know you're spending a lot on HUMIRA and having a really good return on investment, but if that changes, how much flexibility do you have? Thanks very much.","Larry Peepo","Thank you, Jami.","Richard Gonzalez","Thank you Jami for all those questions. So, we'll cover each and every one of them. Let me start with the management comp. I mean, I think similar to probably the other companies in our industry, the vast majority of the executive team's comp is in long-term incentive that's associated with the appreciation of the stock. So, I'd say we're directly linked to that. In addition to that, for the top people within our company, we have two levels of incentive plans.","One, is basically focused on the short-term plan year and then we have one, which is a longer term plan that basically is designed to hit a three-year out target, where you would set things like this operating margin target and so the bottom line is yes, I mean, there's perfect alignment between all of these metrics and how people will be rewarded against those.","To your second question, which was, is the GAAP primarily the timing of biosimilars? I'd say, that's accurate for the most part. There's probably more penetration and more growth in the indications in general that are built-in versus the Street but the more significant part is the assumption that we're making around the timing of U.S. biosimilar entry.","As far as the Amgen CEO, I read the comment. I find the comment encouraging, but I'm not going to comment specifically on what they said. I think, to your point about, is the Street just now coming around to our point of view, I mean, in fairness much of this IP has only really come out in the last two years and I think both competitively that is now something that people who were interested in coming up with a biosimilar are having to evaluate. So, it's not like they had a lot of time. The Street certainly didn't have a lot of time to be able to evaluate that as well.","I'd say, secondarily look, there was no advantage to us going out early and touting that either. We were to make sure that our strategy was in a position that was solid and where we wanted to be and we worked hard over the last three or four years to get our strategy in place and we're at a point now where we're confident to be able talk about it, and you heard my words, so you probably can't be much clearer about what our intent is and so at the end of the day, I think, in fairness to the Street you now have all the information you can determine your point of view around that.","I'd say on the confidence in the IP, we have a high level of confidence in the IP, and so I think we feel very good about our position and if anything, our tendency, when we do our long-range plan is to be a little bit on the conservative side. I'd say the Europe assumptions that we're making as an example, I think are clearly conservative. There's far more opportunity for upside than there is downside and that's normally how we try to build our forecast because, we want an opportunity to be able to make sure that we achieve those.","On the operating margin, I think what your question was, was, is it almost all driven by sales leverage? No, and I think, the way to think about it is this, so, in Bill's comments, we guided to the end of this year being 42.5, because remember the fourth quarter will have high Synagis sales and we'll also have a full quarter of IMBRUVICA. So, we have more partnered revenues in the fourth quarter. So that tends to be dilutive as I described. So we'll exit this year somewhere around 42.5, but then I think that the way to think about the target that we've set here is you have to back out the dilutive impact over the five-year LRP, which is about 200 basis points. So you back down to about 40 as your starting point. So you're going to go to 40 to something north of 50, so about a 10 point improvement.","If you look at that 10 point improvement, and I've Bill here with me, roughly 25% of it comes from the royalty reduction on HUMIRA that will occur between '17 and '18, about 30% of it comes from cost reductions, cost management kinds of programs and the remainder comes from the leverage that we see of a fast growing top line with expenses being managed at a significantly lower growth rate. That's how you ought to think about it.","Jami Rubin","Okay. Super helpful. Thank you, very much.","Larry Peepo","All right, thanks Jami. Next question for us please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeffrey Holford from Jefferies. Sir, your line is open.","Jeffrey Holford","Thanks very much and thanks to the team. It was a very comprehensive midterms outlook today, which I mean really sets out your positioning on HUMIRA and the rest of the business very clearly. So, now obviously the debate on HUMIRA will continue and it seems that the linchpin near term is the achievement of an injunction against any would be at risk launches. We've recently heard from Amgen, regarding at risk launch and we certainly heard that also from other large biosimilar players, but could you be more specific on the trigger starting perhaps on the infringement process and the injunction process so we can think better at the timing of those. Are they more likely to be tied to filings or FDA approvals? So, that's the first piece.","Second on 2016 guidance, it would just seem to us that you're potentially implying you do not expect to increase the $3 billion exit rate for the hep C franchise in 2016, if you could speak to that too.","Then just last, you talked about being ready for larger deals again by 2017. To be clear, the current guidance does not include anything for additional M&A, just to be clear on that and then, can you tell us a bit more about substantial share repurchases that might be part of your midterm plan too, at least as a backstop if you can't find substantial M&A targets? Thank you.","Richard Gonzalez","I'm actually going to have Laura address your first question Jeff and then I'll cover the rest.","Laura Schumacher","With respect to the trigger for the filing of litigation, there's a process that's laid out specifically in the statute, which there has been litigation over whether or not that process is mandatory or not. From our standpoint, we are anticipating that in the event that there is a biosimilar applicant, they will or won't choose to follow that process, at some time to be not mandatory, should they choose not to follow that process upon notice of the filing of the application, of course, we would initiate the litigation.","With respect specifically to an injunction against an at risk launch, that injunction against an at risk launch would be triggered upon the approval of a biosimilar and of course we would then request that the court enforce our IP. As Rick laid out earlier, we intend to vigorously enforce the IP and we believe we have a very strong case for an injunction. First of all that we believe any biosimilar applicant will infringe at least certain of our patents, because in order to follow the -- to be classified as a biosimilar they will need to have the same dosing regimen as the innovator product.","As to validity, we think we have a very strong case on validity given the uniqueness of HUMIRA and the fact that HUMIRA was the first fully human antibody approved by the FDA, and there was nothing known about its effectiveness or its optimal dosing regimen at the time that we did extensive clinical work, trial, investment et cetera. So, we believe in the event that there was an at risk launch, we would have a very strong case for our preliminary injunction. Also, as you know, in the event a biosimilar would choose to launch at risk, the damages for such a launch, should it be found to be violative of our patents would be very significant.","Jeffrey Holford","Thank you.","Richard Gonzalez","Okay, thanks Laura. So, let me take the M&A question. Yes, the guidance that was laid out today doesn't cover any significant acquisition activity or licensing acquisition activity. So obviously, as that played out, we would look at -- based on the significance of it, we would make a decision how we would with that. Something we could manage or something that we could not and then we would obviously pass that into our guidance and communicate it appropriately.","As we talked about before, I'd say that our focus for the next couple of years is more trying to fill out our portfolio of assets within the therapeutic areas that we're in. We don't anticipate a large transaction in that timeframe and nothing has changed around that front, and that kind of gets to the whole share repurchase. Although, I'll have Bill talk about that just for a moment as well, but ultimately, how we look at share repurchase versus M&A is we're trying to manage between those two to make sure that we have the appropriate capacity to be able to do the things that we need to do for the business longer-term and share repurchase is more of an opportunistic kind of approach. So, Bill, is there anything you want to add to it?","William Chase","No, I mean, obviously, if you look at this long-range plan, there's going to be pretty robust cash generation. As we get out a couple of years, that can clearly fund larger M&A if we deem that's necessary. To the extent that, that an opportunity isn't readily apparent, well then, we'd certainly have to look at other things to do with that cash and share repurchases could very well be part of that.","Richard Gonzalez","So on the 2016 guidance, I mean, obviously, we've just gone through our planning process for 2016, and the way we do planning is we build everything up from the bottom up, product by product, and we make determinations as to what we're going to assume for each product based on a set of assumptions that we think are absolutely realistic and so we have an HCV number that's in our 2016. We tend to be a little bit on the conservative side when we build these up so that we have the flexibility to make sure that for any unforeseen events, we have the ability to be able to manage our way through those and I'd say, this plan is no different than previous ones that we built, but specifically, for HCV, I'd say HCV will have some growth built into it year-over-year because just the gadding [ph] of how the countries have rolled out over time internationally you're going to get year-over-year and we're just launching in Japan now, well, we're not launching.","We will be launching shortly in Japan now and Japan's a significant opportunity for us. So it will create a year-over-year growth driver for us as well. So, I'd say there is growth built into the HCV franchise, but let me specifically talk maybe about this $3 billion running rate, because I know I made that prediction in the early part of the year. If you look at where we are right now, what I would tell you is, we're going to be close, but we're slightly below that right now in the fourth quarter. At least as what we had built into our current guidance for the year and is the function primarily of the fact that -- in the beginning of the year, the number of patients being treated was significantly higher. We've seen that trend down. We've seen some changes in VA, in the United States. So, I'd say, we're going to be close. We could make it, but we might miss it and as I said, we tend to build conservatively what we have in the fourth quarter right now is slightly below that.","Jeffrey Holford","That's great. Thanks very much.","Larry Peepo","All right. Thanks Jeff. Next question for us please, operator?","Operator","The next question comes from Mr. Mark Goodman from UBS. Sir, your line is open.","Mark Goodman","Yes, morning. 494, $4 billion in 2024 is a pretty big number. Can you help frame how you're thinking about that and then secondly, just AndroGel continues to be a little stronger than we think, why is that? What's going on behind the scenes? Thanks.","Richard Gonzalez","494, based on the profile that we've set up. I would say $4 billion of risk-adjusted revenue for an asset that has that profile in that timeframe isn't a stretched number from our perspective at all. When you look at the level of response you have in the TNF inadequate responder patient population, which as I said in my remarks represent about 35% of the U.S. patients, we assume it's something similar to that in Europe. It's a little more difficult to get to the data in Europe. It's a sizable population and it's in the population that has relatively limited number of options available to it.","In addition to that, when you think about how biosimilars will ultimately roll out, I think it's a good assumption to assume that biosimilars are going to capture some portion, maybe a significant portion but at least some portion of the new patients. So they're going to be generating more TNF inadequate responders. Now, they might rotate to another TNF after that but, a proprietary product will have an opportunity in a biosimilar world to go after those nonresponders, and so that's a very significant opportunity. In addition to that, obviously to my comments about our organization representing this product will be a goal to be able to take the appropriate patients and try to move them to the appropriate kinds of therapies. So, patients that aren't responding as well on HUMIRA, obviously we would want to move them to 494 as an alternative. So when you look at all of that, I'd actually say that the $4 billion number is not a number that we're uncomfortable with.","William Chase","And Mark on AndroGel, clearly it has performed better than the Street was thinking and frankly it's performed a little bit better than we were thinking. The market still is in decline. However, what you're really seeing is less uptake or less impact on the brand from the generic 1% formulation. It's something we're just going to have to keep our eye on, but so far so good.","Larry Peepo","Thanks Mark. Our next question please operator?","Operator","The next question comes from Chris Schott of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Chris Schott","Great. Thanks very much and thanks for all the details today. Just had three quick ones here. First, following up on Jami's question. If for whatever reason the HUMIRA IP falls and sales end up closer to say consensus than your $18 billion target, is a 50% margin realistic in that scenario? I'm just trying to get a sense of like where margins could go in that downside case, that's not the scenario you laid out, but just trying to understand that.","Second, just thoughts on what happened earlier this year with Amgen and Sandoz with NEUPOGEN. Are there any learnings, similarities or differences that we should apply when you think about the HUMIRA situation?","Then finally, on the longer term, international HUMIRA targets, could you just give us a little bit more color on the type of erosion you're assuming given biosimilars for Enbrel and potentially HUMIRA over that window, just how much price and volume impact are you kind of reflecting here? Thanks very much.","Richard Gonzalez","Okay. So, I don't know that the 50% margin target would be realistic in a more catastrophic kind of situation. What I would tell you is, we've obviously laid out contingency plans by country, because this will be rolled out by country obviously, right as biosimilars enter those countries and we have an erosion curve that we built by country and if the country starts to fall below that erosion curve, then we'll do what we always do and that is, we will manage the expense base accordingly. So, we have the ability to be able to manage and offset the profitability like we would do with any type of LOE. So at the end of the day, I think know whether or not it had a 50% margin target or not, we would put a contingency plan in place that would allow us to try to maximize profitability or preserve profitability under that scenario.","Having said that, what I will tell you is, we have a high level of confidence in what we've built here and we don't build LRPs that we don't believe we can achieve. Again, we're not showing you anything different than what our internal LRP says that we present to our Board every year. So, at the end of the day, I can tell you, we have a high level of confidence that we can deliver against what we've put here.","The learnings from Amgen. I'm assuming you're talking about sort of the whole IP and litigation process for Amgen. I'm going to have Laura address that for you.","Laura Schumacher","With respect to the Amgen Neupogen litigation, a lot of the debate in that litigation surrounded whether or not the pre-litigation exchange process, whereby patents and information were exchanged between the innovator and biosimilar, whether that was a mandatory process or a voluntary process, and ultimately, as I said previously, we're not anticipating from a timing standpoint that there will be a litigation exchange, it will be something that the biosimilar applicant will choose to participate in or not. With respect to the underlying patent infringement litigation with Amgen and Neupogen, our litigation, our patent estate is very different than that. In that case, there's very few claims and patents and ours is as we've said before, we have over 70 patents, many of which, certain of which will be infringed and some of which may be infringed. So, we'll have to see when we know more specifically about what formulation and\/or process that particular biosimilar applicant uses.","Richard Gonzalez","Okay. Thanks Laura. Then on the European erosion curve, obviously as part of this planning process we have built a very specific erosion curve for both Europe as well as the United States when we get beyond 2022. So, what I would say to you is, I'll walk through the European one or I'll walk through the international one, I guess more generally. What I'd say is, it's fairly complex, because there are lots of different variables if you think about it right, you're going to have countries rolling out at different times as they enter those countries and they get pricing approval within those countries. Not every country is exactly the same, how you get pricing approval. So, there's sort of this gated period where you go across country by country as biosimilars would enter it.","The second thing is, you have to layer in what our strategy will be, and we've built a strategy by country. There will be countries where we choose to take price erosion to maintain all of the patients, new patients and well-maintained patients. There may be countries where we choose to only keep well-maintained patients, and do something different from a pricing standpoint. So, there's some complexities around that.","Then the third point that I'd say to you, that's very important as you think about this, because I'm going to walk you through what the erosion looks like here in just a moment, is when a biosimilar enters the international market, these markets are still growing. As I said, they're growing like mid-single-digits and so as I described to you what the erosion looks like, the number I'm going to give you is lower than what they could actually capture or the price erosion might ultimately translate to, because they will take a certain portion of that market growth within those markets. So having said all that, I think the simplest way to think about the erosion curve is this, if you think about international HUMIRA sales, they will peak in the forecast we laid out for you here, all the financials we've laid out, they peak in 2018 and from 2018 then they start to decline, and if you move out two years to 2020 which is the year we're characterizing for you, the erosion of the international HUMIRA business is about 15% to 18%.","Now, having said that, the impact or the opportunity lost, that probably is the best way to think about would be greater than that, because without biosimilar competition, HUMIRA would've continued to grow in those international markets beyond that period of time, and so it probably sounds a little lower than you would've expected, but it's because you have to think about it in those two components, part of the component is it will take some price out of the market which will reduce market growth, the other component is and they take some new patients. So, they're taking some of the market growth out that way, but just say what is the impact on AbbVie? It is the brand peaks at that point and it declines about 15% over that period of time.","Chris Schott","Very helpful. Thank you.","Larry Peepo","Thanks Chris. Next question, operator.","Operator","The next question operator question comes from Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Mark Schoenebaum","Hey guys, thanks for all the detail. I am in agreement with the other analysts on that. A couple of questions. Number one, what was operational HUMIRA growth rates -- operational HUMIRA growth rates quarter on quarter as well as year on year in international markets?","The second question is you didn't comment on your tax rate over the long-term. I don't think I saw that in your slides, and I would assume that as the Company diversifies away from HUMIRA, you're going to diversify into more tax optimized drugs -- tax optimized assets.","So, I would personally be comfortable modelling a decline in your tax rate. I wanted to hear your thoughts on that and when I do that, and when I use an operating margin of only 51, even though your guidance says, greater than 50, it could be 55 or 60 who knows, I'm getting to an EPS number in 2020 of around $10 a share. I'm just -- I know you're not giving an EPS number, but am I thinking about this all wrong, because most people say I'm not very good with math.","Richard Gonzalez","Why don't you cover the tax rate Bill, I'll cove the --","William Chase","Yeah, so, if you look at this business since we separated from Abbott, the tax rate has been pretty consistently in the 21% to 22% range. That's largely driven by our need for U.S. cash for certain items. So, as we do our LRP again, what we do is, we build it on a fairly conservative basis and what I would tell you is our assumptions are that that tax rate in the 21% to 22% is the right assumption for this business over the next 10 years.","Mark Schoenebaum","That's because of your repatriation needs. So, imagine the tax rate on single assets that are large, like your new JAK and IMBRUVICA, on a P&L basis, a single product P&L basis would be much lower.","William Chase","Yeah, but you've got IMBRUVICA which is largely a U.S. product for us from a tax rate. So, that actually lifts the tax rate the other way. So, I mean, you've got a lot of different things in the mix, Mark.","Mark Schoenebaum","Okay thanks.","Richard Gonzalez","So, on the EPS target, I would just tell you that at the end of the day, we built it up from the bottom up and we don't come up with your number. At the end of the day, you're going to assume 50%, 60%, 70% operating margin profile and get pretty big numbers, but if you're going to drive this level of growth, you have to invest in the business in a way that allows you to be able to do that. So I think the numbers we have forecasted certainly represent the top tier in this industry and they're the numbers that we're willing to stand behind.","On operational growth internationally for HUMIRA quarter versus quarter, what I'd tell you is this, we sell HUMIRA in almost 100 countries around the world, right and many of those countries have tenders and tenders don't always fall consistently in the same quarter. So, quarter over quarter, doesn't necessarily give you a very accurate picture of how the brand is growing, although I'll address it here in a moment to answer specifically your question.","I think the best way to think about HUMIRA internationally, I'd like to choose this year as the example is the [indiscernible] growth rate is for the first three quarters worth of growth and compare it to what the prior year was, I think that's the most reflective way to look at it, and I would say that revenues are up about 8.3% year to date, year-over-year. Volume is up about 10%, so slightly down in price, which is consistent with what we've seen in previous years, nothing unusual there, and market share is stable at just under 34%, versus the prior year, and I would tell you that's well within the range of what we expected when we did our plan and it's tracking consistently with what we expected as it relates to our plan. So, international HUMIRA is performing the way we would've hoped and expected it to be able to perform.","Now, if you look at quarter versus quarter and I'm assuming you're specifically talking about third quarter versus second quarter. If you look at third quarter versus second quarter, it's down about 1.3% or 1.4%. 1.4%, which you have to recognize, I'm sure you're aware of this, the month of August in Europe is the holiday month, right and so most physician offices don't have the same number of office days. In fact, they have very limited number of office days.","So you get a significantly lower level of new patient starts in the month of August versus other months in the year and therefore every year the third quarter is lower. In fact, if you look at last year, I think last year, it was down about 4% or 4.4%, and so, that's a common trend that we see. I'd also tell you as I mentioned at the very beginning, this -- if you look at it quarter to quarter and you don't make all the adjustments for any kind of anomaly of tenders between those periods of time. It's not very meaningful information for you. So I think the best way to look at it is year-to-date how are we performing and I'd say when you look at this level of performance, we're pretty comfortable with it.","Mark Schoenebaum","Rick, I've got a bunch of e-mails in from clients to the answer to my previous question about the $10 number where you said, you didn't come up it. Were you trying to suggest that you came up with numbers higher than that or numbers lower than that? Thanks.","Richard Gonzalez","No. I was trying to suggest the number that we communicated is the number that we came up with.","Mark Schoenebaum","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Richard Gonzalez","All right. Thanks Mark. Next question operator.","Operator","The next question comes from Vamil Divan of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Vamil Divan","Great. Thanks or taking the questions and again, thanks for all the details you provided. So, one more if I could HUMIRA and then one on a different topic. Just to HUMIRA, I think, obviously a lot of focus on the biosimilars and you addressed that pretty well, I thought, just what about the other sort of innovative products that are coming in to target some of the indications -- I'm thinking about the IL-17, competing, oral JAKs, oral products for Crohn's. I know you guys highlighted what you have in your pipeline but, can you just comment on how you think the market share erosion might be for HUMIRA as some of these new innovative products come into these other indications?","Then second just on neurology, this is an area of always struggled a little bit for you guys, so, if you can just touch on that a little bit more, you mentioned Duopa could be a big product, maybe a little bit more around sort of the number of patients you think would be willing to use a product like that, Zinbryta and where does that fit in? Most neurologists we've spoken to, [indiscernible] crowded MS space and even Alzheimer's, you kind of highlight that in the total market opportunity for your products. So, just maybe a little more color on how you see your neurology franchise growing would be very helpful. Thanks.","Richard Gonzalez","Thanks Vamil. So, let me start with HUMIRA competition. I think, as you know, this is in particularly take RA as an example, it's a pretty crowded field already, and there's the pretty good mechanisms in there, and yet still the TNF still control the vast majority of this market. It's a tough market to break into even with fairly good profiles of drugs. Now, having said that, I'd say there are some good profiles that are starting to emerge. The IL-17s are a good example. I think IL-17s have a pretty strong profile, but what typically happens in this area is those mechanisms for quite a period of time are relegated to the failure patient population, because physicians are comfortable. There are many other factors that are built into it and they tend to take up that failure population for at least a number of years and that tends to be the areas that they grow in.","Now, over a longer period of time, they might have a more material impact, but as I mentioned, our assumption is and I think this is a valid assumption based on our experience in the past is that HUMIRA will have some erosion in the United States, but relatively modest erosion over this five-year period of time, and that because we're assuming biosimilars don't come into the marketplace that is driven by these other innovative products that enter the market. So that is our assumption around that.","As it relates to neuro, maybe I'll have Mike talk a little bit about some of the earlier stuff, but I'd say our work in Alzheimer's an example there really isn't anything that's built into this planning period, but --","Michael Severino","Certainly, so perhaps to address your question on Zinbryta first. What we see with MS unfortunately is that it afflicts patients, often relatively early in their lifespan. They deal with many, many years of ongoing relapses and ultimately in many patients a downward clinical trajectory and so what that does is it creates a need for different mechanisms. Mechanisms that attack the problem from different directions mechanistically, and mechanisms with considerable efficacy. So, we feel that there is a real place for Zinbryta in the treatment armamentarium particularly when folks are looking for agents that have substantial efficacy as has been demonstrated in that program. When you look at the rest of our neuroscience efforts, apart from Duopa obviously and Zinbryta, they're very early and they're not contributing as Rick said to the financial numbers yet in a large way, but we do feel that we have a number of very promising approaches to go after in the longer-term the neurodegenerative aspects of MS, for example, which is still a large unmet medical need and diseases such as Alzheimer's. So that's a focus on our labs in the early end.","Richard Gonzalez","I'll just add a couple of points on Zinbryta, I mean, we're obviously doing a lot of the work to prepare as we anticipate approval of this product, so we've been doing market research and a fair amount of work in preparation and I'd say the profile of Zinbryta is a pretty compelling profile and as Mike mentioned, the unfortunate thing about this disease is that patients relapse and they relapse on average, probably about every 2 to 3 years on the current agents and this is certainly a high efficacy agent, from an annualized relapse rate, reduction and when you look at it versus the active comparator it has good performance. I think the other thing that is appealing to physicians is the compliance aspect of it that from a dosing standpoint, they know they'll have drug on board for an extended period of time. So, I think Zinbryta will have a very important role in the treatment of MS patients and it's going to be one of the things that physicians are able to go to, a more -- I'd say a higher efficacy kind of agent. We don't view it coming in as the first line but certainly as patients rotate through that, we think it will compete quite effectively in that second line.","Larry Peepo","Thanks Vamil. Operator, next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Alex Arfaei of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Alex Arfaei","Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions and also thanks for all the details. It certainly helps. I have a few questions on HUMIRA if I may. In 3Q, how much of your 30% growth in the U.S. was volume and price? Our audit suggests it was 11% to 14% volume. So, could you comment on the price component and what are your long-term pricing assumptions in the U.S. for HUMIRA?","And a follow up for Rick. I just wanted to make sure I understood your comments earlier, are you assuming no biosimilars of products that compete with HUMIRA in the U.S.? I just want to make sure that -- what your timeline for biosimilar competition for other products is in the U.S.","And finally, if you could provide your thoughts about the [indiscernible] versus HUMIRA? Thank you very much.","Richard Gonzalez","Why don't you go with the price?","William Chase","So, our numbers for Q3 -- our volume was higher than what you're seeing in the script, so the way you've got to think about price in the U.S. on the quarter was around a third of the overall growth, was related to price. In terms of over the LRP, look, again we've said multiple times, as we build out our LRP, we try to put in conservative and realistic assumptions. So along those lines we don't take what is currently happening in price and extrapolate that out across the LRP. In the U.S. it is -- where we do think we'll be able to maintain some degree of positive price, but what I would tell you is we're modelling a little lower than mid-single digits on that as you go out over the long range plan period. Ex-U.S., it's actually a negative pricing environment. So, when you actually look at the additive of the two across the LRP, we've got very, very, very low levels of price built in to our forecast.","Richard Gonzalez","Then as it relates to biosimilars, I just wanted to clarify, you're talking about a HUMIRA biosimilar or are you talking about a biosimilar to something else?","Alex Arfaei","No, biosimilar of competing products such as Remicade and [indiscernible] in the U.S.","Richard Gonzalez","Okay. I'm sorry. So, obviously we're not assuming any -- because of the IP and the litigation strategy we talked about, we're not assuming any HUMIRA biosimilar. I think as you click through the rest of them, as we look at the Enbrel IP, we think they have pretty good IPs, so we're not assuming we'll see Enbrel biosimilars in the United States. Then as it relates to any kind of Remicade, I think it would be a similar scenario to what we see outside the U.S. because it's an infusion product, it doesn't necessarily compete directly against us.","Then on Bari, Mike, why don't you cover the head to head on Bari?","Michael Severino","Sure. When we look at the Baricitinib head to head data clearly both agents are very active. When we focus on higher levels of response which we think are the most clinically significant. For example, DAS low disease activity or DAS remission, we really see very similar response rate at week 24, and of course also, consider the very long track record with HUMIRA well understood safety and efficacy profile. So, we feel good about the overall performance of HUMIRA over the course of its lifespan and think it will continue to play a very important role in the treatment armamentarium as Rick has already outlined.","Alex Arfaei","Thank you, folks.","Richard Gonzalez","All right, thanks Alex and operator, we have time for one more question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Colin Bristow of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Colin Bristow","Good morning, thanks for squeezing me in and as others have said, great presentation today. The methods being covered, but on hep C what proportion of your contracts are exposed to competition in 2016 versus in a multiyear and the cargo expectations changed per your performance in 2016 if at all based on the recent label update. Then two, just from a high level, given the sort of focus on drug pricing at utility [indiscernible] recently, could you give us your thoughts on these ongoing debates and whether you anticipate any impact to your business. Thanks.","Richard Gonzalez","I'm not sure I could give you the exact percentage of the contracts. I'd say the vast majority of them are protected through -- vast majority of the volume is protected I'd say through 2016, but, let us get back to you with something that's maybe a little bit more specific. As it relates to the label, as outlined in my comments, this was obviously moving from not recommended to contraindicated, and if you look at the patient population in Bs and Cs, it's a relatively small patient population. It's probably something in the 3% or 4% kind of range of U.S. patients.","So if you look at it purely from the perspective of that, it wouldn't be a big impact and frankly the fact that we weren't recommended and contraindicated in Cs you wouldn't assume that there was a lot of volume treating those patients anyway. Having said that, I will tell you we've gone out and contacted probably now around 80% of the physicians that prescribed the drug to make sure that they understand the changes in the label. I think that's gone well, and the feedback I'm getting directly back from the commercial organization. So, that is going well. We've gone back to all of our contracted -- our contract managed care contracts and other contracts and that has gone well, they understand it and I think, agree that in the previous label it was outlined in a way that probably there wasn't a tremendous amount of use there anyway. Having said that, I think we have to wait for -- see how this plays out for the next maybe 30 days or so to be absolutely sure, but right now, we are assuming based on everything that we know, that we'll have a material impact on the brand.","The drug pricing. Well, certainly, I think if you look at the debate around drug pricing, it's not likely to go away. In fact, I think with a political debate that's going on we'll probably continue to hear more about it and I think, everything isn't consistent across our industry. Certainly a lot of the debate came around taking old drugs and raising the prices a very significant amount. That's not a model that we have or we participate in. I think the important thing for our industry, the innovative industry is that we continue to bring out drugs that have a significant impact and we price those drugs in a way that gets the right value proposition, the right return for the value that those drugs have, both the clinical value but also the economic value and we demonstrate that economic value. I will tell you, in the international markets like Europe, where HUMIRA has competed for a long time, those are markets that looked very carefully at the economic value that their healthcare system pays and obviously HUMIRA has done extremely well in those markets and it's because it is a good value proposition and I think a lot of the areas that we're in, in specialty pharmaceuticals, it allows you to be able to do that. It allows you to be able to create a medicine that has truly outstanding impact for patients and also has the right economic value proposition and then pricing them accordingly.","So, I don't fundamentally believe we'll see a significant change, but I think the debate will continue on and I think our industry needs to respond in a way that's appropriate to that.","Larry Peepo","And that concludes today's conference call.

We are offline. Thank you, Larry Peepo. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported strong third quarter results with adjusted earnings per share of $0.82 exceeding our guidance range for the quarter. Our performance demonstrates the strength and durability of our portfolio, as we deliver these results despite the continued impact of generic competition on our lipid franchise. Today, we also raised our full year EPS guidance for 2013 reflecting the high level of execution we\u2019ve demonstrated this year. As we embarked on this year, we set forth several key priorities for our business, including, a seamless transition to operating as an independent entity, maximizing the performance of our current product portfolio, advancing our pipeline including our late-stage HCV program and other key assets and delivering operations efficiencies.","As we assess our progress, I believe we have met or exceeded expectations on our strategic objectives. I\u2019m pleased with the performance of our product portfolio including HUMIRA, which delivered more than 19% global operational growth in the quarter. This strong growth was driven by several factors including continued robust market growth resulting from increasing penetration across therapeutic categories and geographies. Market share gains particularly in the GI segment where our UC launch is progressing ahead of our expectations. And we delivered this performance despite the entry of new competitors into the category.","As we\u2019ve indicated in the past, HUMIRA's broad label and new indications are a competitive advantage and UC is the latest example of that. We\u2019ve launched UC indication in a number of key countries and it quickly gained meaningful market share and we\u2019re working to secure market access and reimbursement in a number of additional markets in the coming months. Today, in Western Europe, we\u2019re currently capturing roughly 25% of the UC market. And in the U.S. the UC indication has contributed significantly to our strong performance in the IBD market as HUMIRA is now the market leading biologic in the GI category. We continue to pursue HUMIRA in several other indications which are currently in late-stage developments.","Earlier this month, we presented Phase 2 data in patients with HS, a chronic inflammatory skin condition. Our Phase 3 trials are fully enrolled and we\u2019re targeting commercialization of this indication in the 2015 timeframe. Given the lack of effective treatment options, we believe HS could represent a several hundred million dollar peak year opportunity for us. HUMIRA continues to gain or hold market share across all indications. As I mentioned earlier, our strong UC launch has helped us attain the number one position in the GI category. We also hold the number one market share position in dermatology. And we continue to hold steady share in rheumatology despite the entry of new competitors.","We\u2019ve been very pleased with HUMIRA's exceptional performance this year and we\u2019re well on track to achieve our 2013 guidance for the product. Beyond HUMIRA, we also saw a strong performance from several other products including CREON, Synthroid, Zemplar, Synagis and Duodopa. Though certainly not as high profile as HUMIRA, we\u2019ve been pleased with the performance of these durable and growing brands. In the quarter, we also made good progress on other key strategic objectives. We continue to drive operational efficiencies including gross margin improvement, which Bill will discuss in more detail in his remarks. And we\u2019ve begun the process of creating our own efficient back office infrastructure that is more appropriate for an independent biopharmaceutical company.","In addition to our strong commercial and operational performance, we\u2019ve also made significant progress on our pipeline, where we have placed a tremendous amount of focus. As we evaluate our pipe line prospects including the number and potential of the opportunities, we believe our pipeline is the healthiest it has ever been. In addition to assets currently in late-stage such as HCV, daclizumab, elagolix, (inaudible) and elotuzumab were on the cusp of transitioning several additional programs in the Phase 3 development, including but not limited to ABT-199 per CLL and ABT-888 per select solid tumors. And we expect continued pipeline advancement between now and the end of 2014 including late-stage trial completions, regulatory filings and new product approvals.","Let me now provide you with an overview of some of the key highlights in our pipeline.","We expect numerous HCV data milestones to be achieved, including the results from our six Phase 3 interferon-free combination studies starting later this year and into early 2014. We also present data from these studies at EASL in April and other medical meetings throughout the course of 2014.","We remain on track with our U.S. and EMEA regulatory submissions in the second quarter of 2014, an anticipation of early 2015 commercialization, we are actively building the appropriate infrastructure, including medical care personnel and our sales organizations.","We\u2019ll present data from our Phase 2 HCV program in Asia and plan to start our Phase 3 program in Japan in the first half of 2014. Japan represents the second largest HCV market globally and we believe we\u2019re well-positioned relative to competitive offerings.","Given the prevalence of genotype 1b in the region, we plan to advance our 12-week two DDA treatment in this area. We also have a strong commercial presence in Japan which we\u2019ve has been in place for a number of years.","We remain on track to start our Phase 2 studies of our next-generation HCV compounds by the end of this year. As a reminder, our next-generation assets include a potent protease inhibitor, ABT-493 and our new NS5A inhibitor ABT-530.","In preclinical studies, these promising assets have shown pan-genotypic activity and excellent activity against key resistant mutants. These assets also support once-daily dosing, as well as the ability to co-formulate. Commercialization of our next-generation compounds could occur in the 2017 timeframe.","Now moving to our oncology pipeline, we\u2019ll see continued dataflow from our Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-199. The Phase 2 single-agent study in previously treated CLO patients with 17p deletion, will likely read out at the end of 2014.","Additionally, the Phase 3 comparative study of ABT-199 plus Rituxan versus Rituxan plus chemotherapy in patients with relapsed\/refractory CLL will begin in early 2014. The ongoing studies of ABT-199 will continue to collect data and in 2014 we\u2019ll present data demonstrating the durability of the treatment effect. We also expect to present combination treatment data, as well as results from some of our ongoing studies in other cancer types.","A number of our mid-stage studies of our PARP inhibitor ABT-888 will also read out in the coming months and throughout 2014, beginning with data that will be presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium this December.","From our neuroscience pipeline, in 2014 we will present data from our Alpha-7 NNR agonist ABT-126, which is currently being studied in Alzheimer\u2019s disease and cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia.","We also see data from the second of our two registrational studies for daclizumab in mid 2014. As a reminder, that study the DECIDE trial is somewhat unique and that is designed to show reduction of annualized relapse rates and disability progression in patients with the relapsing\/remitting multiple sclerosis versus an active comparator.","Assuming favorable results, we plan to submit the regulatory application for daclizumab in the second half of 2014. We will also see initial data from the first of two pivotal studies of the Elagolix in the endometriosis in the second half of 2014. And finally, we look forward to seeing Phase 2b data in RA from our partnered selective JAK1 inhibitor late next year.","We continue to augment our pipeline through a conservative focused effort on strategic licensing, acquisitions and partnering activity. We have targeted large and growing specialty focused therapeutic areas that enhance our current franchises and our emerging pipelines.","In the recent years, we have added more than a dozen promising assets to our portfolio. Last month, we announced two new collaborations. First, we entered into a global licensing agreement with Ablynx to develop and commercialize an anti-IL-6 Nanobody for autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Early clinical work in RA shown promise and given the molecule\u2019s unique characteristics, we believe there is room for therapeutic differentiation there.","In addition, we entered into a global alliance with Galapagos to discover and develop novel therapies for cystic fibrosis, but there is still a significant unmet need. ","In closing, as we approach the end of our first year as an independent company, we feel very good about the progress we\u2019ve made, executing our key strategic priorities. We\u2019re pleased with our performance this quarter, while we saw strength across our portfolio including double-digit growth from HUMIRA and growth from a number of other products. We\u2019re taking the necessary steps to build a more efficient organization, as we move to a fully independent operating environment beginning in 2015 and we have made significant progress advancing our pipeline and look forward to a number of key milestones in the months ahead. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill for a more detailed view of our results, Bill.","Bill Chase","","Thank you, Rick. This morning I\u2019ll start with an overview of our third quarter performance and then I\u2019ll provide an update to our 2013 outlook. In addition to delivering strong topline growth in the third quarter, we again exceeded our earnings per share guidance. Third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.82, excluding non-cash intangible amortization expense and specified items. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share were $0.60. Total sales in the third quarter increased 3.6% on an operational basis which excludes an unfavorable 0.3% impact from foreign exchange. Excluding TriCor and Trilipix, which are experiencing a loss of exclusivity, total sales increased 10.9% on an operational basis. ","Third quarter growth was led by HUMIRA, which had global sales of nearly $2.8 billion up 19.1%. As Rick mentioned, we continue to see a positive impact from a launch of UC indication, which has helped us gain significant share in the global gastro market. In the U.S. HUMIRA sales increased 22.3% reflecting continued robust market expansion as well as share gains in dermatology and gastroenterology. Internationally, HUMIRA sales grew 16% on an operational basis with many markets continuing to grow strong double-digits. Share gains and continued uptake of new indications are contributing to the growth. International sales in the quarter also benefited to some extent from the timing of tenders. As a result, we\u2019re forecasting slower international HUMIRA growth in the fourth quarter. ","AndroGel sales were $248 million in the third quarter, down 11.1% versus the prior year, reflecting continued moderating of market growth, rebating actions from the second half of last year and certain account loses in early 2013. AndroGel remains the testosterone replacement market leader with more than 60% share and achieved share gains in the last quarter. As expected, all the products in our lipid franchise are now experiencing generic competition. U.S. sales of Niaspan were $201 million, down 13.4% due to the launch of a generic Niaspan in mid-September. TriCor and Trilipix sales were $39 million down 88.3% versus the third quarter of 2012. Though sales across the lipid franchise declined in the third quarter, they did performed better than we had forecast. We continue to expect full-year 2013 sales of less than $1 billion for our combined lipid portfolio, reflecting a decline of roughly $1.2 billion. As we've said previously, this decline will be most pronounced in the fourth quarter when the full impact of Niaspan's loss of exclusivity will be felt.","Global Lupron sales were nearly $196 million in the quarter, up 4.2% on an operational basis. Lupron continues to hold a leadership position and maintain significant share of the market. U.S. sales of Synthroid were $161 million in the quarter, up 22.9%. Snythroid maintains strong brand loyalty and market leadership despite the entry of generics into the market many years ago. For the full-year, we expect to see Synthroid sales growth in the mid-single digits. ","U.S. CREON sales were $101 million in the third quarter up 9.8%. The launch of our 36,000-lipage unit dose earlier this year continues to positively impact sales performance. CREON maintains its leadership position in the pancreatic enzyme market where we continue to capture the vast majority of new prescription starts. We expect double digit sales growth for Creon in 2013. Sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease, grew 18.9% on an operational basis this quarter. Duodopa is currently approved in Europe and other international markets.","Moving on to our P&L profile. Third quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 79.7% excluding intangible asset amortization and other specified items. This was above our expectations for the quarter, driven by operational efficiencies and product mix across our portfolio including HUMIRA and better than expected performance of our high-margin lipid franchise.","Adjusted SG&A was 26.1% of sales in the third quarter in line with our expectations and reflecting heightened investment of our growth brands. Adjusted R&D was 15.2% of sales in the quarter driven by increased funding of our emerging mid and late stage pipeline assets and the continued pursuit of additional HUMIRA indications. Net interest expense was 79 -- $69 million in the quarter and the adjusted tax rate was 22.3%.","Turning now to our full year 2013 outlook. We are razing our adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $3.11 to $3.13. This updated guidance contemplates sales somewhat above $80.5 billion, reflecting strong balanced performance across our portfolio offsetting the decline in lipids from generic competition. Included in our sales guidance is an estimated negative impact from exchange of somewhat less than 1% for the full year.","We are now forecasting a gross margin ratio of around 78% for the year, excluding non-cash amortization and specified items. This reflects our efforts to improve operational efficiencies as well as product mix including the better-than-expected sales of our lipid franchise in the first three quarters.","In addition to raising our EPS guidance, our performance this year has also allowed us to increase the level of investment behind both our pipeline opportunities and marketed products. As a result, we now expect R&D expense to be somewhat above 15% of sales, reflecting funding actions in support of our pipeline.","And we now expect SG&A expense to be approximately 27% of sales in 2013 reflecting increased investment in our key brands including HUMIRA where we are pursuing opportunities to further increase penetration rates across indications.","We are forecasting net interest expense of about $280 million for the full year. And we continue to expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 22% in 2013. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance range for the year excludes $0.57 per share related to amortization expense, acquired IP R&D and ongoing separation and restructuring costs. We expect that earnings per share will be $2.54 to $2.56 on a GAAP basis.","Regarding the fourth quarter, we expect sales approaching $5 billion reflecting a mid-single digit decline on a reported basis which includes a negative impact from exchange of approximately 0.5%. Our sales guidance for the fourth quarter includes continued impact of the loss of exclusivity for TriCor and TRILIPIX as well as the full impact of Niaspan going generic since this occurred late in the third quarter.","We expect the adjusted gross margin ratio for the quarter to be around 77%. We are forecasting fourth quarter SG&A somewhat below our full year estimate and we expect R&D to be somewhat above our revised full year guidance.","So, in conclusion, we are very pleased with AbbVie\u2019s performance again this quarter as well as our outlook for the remainder of the first year as an independent company.","And with that, I will turn it back over to Larry.","Larry Peepo","Thanks, Bill. We\u2019ll now open the call up for questions. Wendy, we\u2019ll take our first question now, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) The first question today is from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley","Yes, hi. Can you hear me?","Bill Chase","Can hear you David. How are you?","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley","Great. Good morning. So I have a couple of questions. First of all, on Hepatitis B, could you just update us on the topline press release strategy and potential timing, so what studies we\u2019re likely to see topline releases on the frontend of the schedule versus for example, in early 2014? That\u2019s my first question. Second, could you talk about the FC pill burden from payer and physician perspectives? It\u2019s not clear to me that payers and physicians will care about the number of pills for twelve week treatments and I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s your view point as well, but just wanted to hear your perspective on what's your hearing about pill burden for short duration treatments and whether payers and physicians will care or not. And then third, with respect to ABT-126 as an add-on for both Alzheimer's and schizophrenia, could you just remind us when we should expect topline press releases in both Alzheimer's and schizophrenia. Thanks very much.","Scott Brun","David, good morning, it\u2019s Scott Brun. So why don\u2019t I go ahead and take those. Again, with regard to the Phase III Hepatitis C program, all 6 studies as you know are fully enrolled and we\u2019re very pleased with the progress that we\u2019re making there. We will be releasing data as topline press releases later this year and moving into early 2014. I don\u2019t want to get into the specifics with regard to which studies are going to be released, but certainly when you look at all 6, each of them is quite large involving several hundred patients. Again, looking at a variety of different contacts from treatment, na\u00efve treatment experience, cirrhotic patients, so I think certainly each study or set of studies that we release will certainly help to provide some very solid evidence with regard to the performance of the regimen. But again look for us to start those releases later this year. ","With regard to the pill burden, I think as you noted David -- with regard to the payers as well as clinicians that we\u2019ve spoken to, cure or sustain virologic response is really keen here. And when you consider a short term regimen whether or not you\u2019re talking 1pill, 4 pills, really what\u2019s going to trump everything is, how well is it going to perform with regard to eliminating the virus. And certainly with regard to the performance that we\u2019ve seen so far of our regimen in Aviator, involve treatment na\u00efve and treatment experience patients , SVR 12 rates ranging from the mid-to-high 90% range as well as tolerability reflected by discontinuation rates for adverse events less than 2%. We really don\u2019t feel that the pill burden is going to be material to clinicians, the payers or for that matter to patients who\u2019re really looking to eliminate this virus. ","Finally, with regard to ABT-126, the Alpha-7 NNR, we are looking in Alzheimer's disease both as a mono therapy treatment as well as an add-on to donepezil and then in cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia, we are looking -- we are evaluating the drug as a mono therapy. We will begin to see data in Alzheimer\u2019s very late this year and certainly releases would probably be expected sometime within the first part of 2014, the schizophrenia's data likely coming a bit later within 2014.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley","Thank you.","Scott Brun","Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. The next is from Jeff Holford with Jefferies.","Jeff Holford - Jefferies","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just firstly, I wonder if you can just give us a bit more color on the HUMIRA sales potentially splitting them by the main indications if you can for the quarter. Secondly on ABT-199, I was interested just the way you put it in the press release today, it\u2019s a large single agent study you described it as a -- with ABT-199 in the 17p deletion patients. Now that\u2019s likely to read out by the end of next year, could that potentially be an early filing for that specific population, that\u2019s my question. And then just lastly, I noticed that share count was down more than expected during the quarter, can you just talk a little bit about capital allocation and just how you are thinking about share repurchases going forward. Thank you.","Rick Gonzalez","Okay. Thanks Jeff. Let me start with the HUMIRA sales breakdown. Scott will cover the 199 question and Bill can talk about capital allocation at the end with Rick, if necessary. In terms of our mix right now, it\u2019s interesting that in U.S., RA is now in the high 30% range. It\u2019s a little below 40% of our total U.S. sales.","Gastro is about a quarter of our sales. Psoriasis right now is about 15% or so of sales and the remainder is kind of in the spondo area of psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis, those types of indications. It\u2019s similar ex-US. I\u2019d say RA is probably in the mid 30% of the ex-US franchise. Psoriasis again is down in that 14%, 15% range.","SPA ex-U.S. is protein 30% and again gastro is probably about a quarter of our sales. So hopefully that gives you a pretty good feel of how the sales mix up today. So I would characterize it as a pretty diverse basket of sales across those four different categories.","Scott Brun","Jeff, I want to go ahead and take your question on ABT-199, our first-in-class BCL-2 inhibitor. So you\u2019re right, we\u2019re currently enrolling a large study in relapsed refractory CLL patients with the 17P deletion mutation, certainly a very hard to treat population. And if the results from this study looks similar to results in this population that we presented before with a overall response rate above 80%, complete response rate of 18%, we certainly think that there is the potential to be able to move forward with a filing on the basis of addressing an unmet medical need.","Certainly, as Rick noted though, we\u2019re also beginning a -- in collaboration with our partner a large Phase 3 traditional study that will compare 199 with Rituxan and a chemotherapy free regimen to a more standard chemo containing regimen.","Bill Chase","Jeff, it\u2019s Bill Chase. We\u2019ve been pretty consistent on our capital allocations story this year. First and foremost, this is a business that generates very, very healthy cash flow. The first thing we\u2019re going to do with that cash flow is make sure that we reinvest in the business.","You\u2019ve seen some good progress on the deal front this year with a number of compounds announced. And certainly we continue to build out our infrastructure with capital expense that sort of thing. So that\u2019s first and foremost.","Second, the dividend is a very, very important piece of our investor identity. We have set the dividend in a very competitive payout ratio relative to our peers. And we've been pretty clear that we intend to grow that dividend over time probably more modestly in 2014, given some of the challenges with the lipid business but growing it nonetheless. And I think you can expect to see that payout ratio creep up as a result.","After that, we like -- try to pay down a little bit of debt. We think that would be the right thing to do, given our balance sheet. And then above and beyond that, capital cash will build and that will be a valuable source of liquidity and flexibility for the company.","Jeff Holford - Jefferies","Thank you.","Bill Chase","We do have a buyback program, Jeff, but that is primarily geared to offset dilution of competition programs.","Jeff Holford - Jefferies","Thanks very much.","Rick Gonzalez","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Steve Scala with Cowen.","Steve Scala - Cowen","Well, thank you. I have two questions. I appreciate that you\u2019re not giving guidance for 2014 but when we think about this spending levels in 2014, given the need to develop and rollout the pipeline, how would you compare spending in 2014 to 2013 on a percent of sales basis?","And secondly, you\u2019ve done a good job of downplaying the 250,000 pending patents around HUMIRA. Is that how you want us to view the patent stated as of limited ability to blunt potential biosimilars as patents expire in 2017 or \u201918? I must admit I\u2019m surprised that your state has no patents which could provide obstacles for biosimilars when they come around? Thank you very much.","Rick Gonzalez","Okay. So this is Rick, Steve. So let me start with your investment question. We\u2019re obviously going through our planning process right now. So we haven\u2019t finalized any investment decisions yet as to how we\u2019re going to proceed forward in 2014. But what I would say is you should think about it from this perspective.","One, as I indicated in my remarks, we\u2019re going to prepare to have a very effective launch of HCV and we need to build that infrastructure in 2014 to be prepared to launch in the early part of 2015 and that\u2019s going to require incremental investment. The second thing is, we could have as many as seven or eight assets in Phase 3 development during 2014 and we\u2019re obviously going to fund those Phase 3 assets to be able to get them to the market as quickly as possible. So I think there will be some increased investment, but we\u2019re just not in a position yet to be able to tell you what that looks like. And so I think that\u2019s how you\u2019ve got to be thinking about it and we\u2019ll give more guidance in the fourth quarter as to what that looks like.","The second thing is -- maybe I\u2019d answer your question a little bit differently. As you look at how we think about bio-similars, maybe let me walk you through our thought process around, because I think it helps answer your question. We certainly feel good about the patent portfolio that we have and I would not interpret it as we don\u2019t believe that it provides a level of protection. Quite the contrary, I believe it does and will provide a significant level of protection. And we certainly intend to enforce our patents and make sure no one violates those patents. But we\u2019re not going to talk a lot about specific patents.","But more importantly, I think you have to look at the whole bio-similar situation in a broader perspective. And I tell you that we fundamentally don\u2019t view the bio-similar market as a very attractive market. And frankly, we could get into the bio-similar market easily. We looked at it actually a couple of times as to whether or not we wanted to get into. We certainly have the capabilities for an R&D standpoint as well as a manufacturing standpoint. And we decided not to get into it for three fundamental reasons. If you look at bio-similars and you really analyze the ability of bio-similar to perform in this market, I think it raises a lot of questions, patents are only one of those.","There are three basic areas that we had looked at and made a determination that it\u2019s not a very attractive business. Number one is the predictability of commercial success. Number two is the return on the investment versus other pipeline opportunities that we have. And number three is the risk around patents and other things as well as the fact that you don\u2019t control your own destiny. So let me walk you through each one to at least give you our view of it. If you think about the predictability of commercial success in bio-similars, you take the anti-TNF market as an example.","It\u2019s a difficult market even for differentiated innovative products to carve out much share. I mean literally, six or seven products have been introduced into that market in the last six or seven years and they\u2019ve all gotten 2% or 3% market share. So it\u2019s a tough market to break your way into. And these are differentiated products. Bio-similars have no differentiation at all from an efficacy or safety standpoint. In fact, I could argue with using bio-similar because they don\u2019t have a long safety database. They\u2019re at some disadvantage from a safety standpoint.","And if they ran non-inferiority trials, they can basically say, they is no worse than X versus the innovator product. And so they really have no differentiation. The only way they can compete for market share is on price and if the innovator chooses to respond to that in some form or fashion, it\u2019s very difficult to build models that suggest that you\u2019re going to get any significant share in this market. So that really brings you to the second part of the analysis and that is the return on investment. So if you think about modest share gains and what kind of pricing you would have to go at with the bio-similar strategy, in our analysis, it says you have to make six or eight different bio-similars to have a meaningful impact on the business.","When you develop six or eight bio-similars, the investment to be able to do that is more than a single innovative product and it approaches pretty close to two innovative products. So I guess if the only thing you had in your pipeline was this, you might invest in it. But frankly when we stack it up against the things that we have, we wouldn\u2019t trade off six to eight bio-similars for a couple of our innovative products. And so we just don\u2019t see a good return on investment there. ","And then, frankly, then there is the last part that you pointed out and that\u2019s risk in controlling your own destiny. If you\u2019re going to do six or eight bio-similar products, you\u2019re going to be walking your way through an absolute mine field of IP, thousands of patents around all of these products. And you have to make sure that you don\u2019t step on any one of them along the way because that\u2019s going to create a big problem for you because I can assure you just like us, every innovator is going to protect their patent position.","The second thing is, you\u2019re at the mercy of the innovator that if they change the formulation or they change the device, so they somehow innovate the product along the way, then you\u2019re at a disadvantage. And so as we look at all these things, we ultimately don\u2019t believe that it is a good place to be and frankly it probably gives you some picture into how we view some of our defense strategies as well as how we view how we compete in this marketplace. So hopefully, that gives you some perspective on it.","Steve Scala - Cowen","That\u2019s great. Thank you.","Rick Gonzalez","Thanks Steve.","Operator","The next question is from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.","Vamil Divan - Credit Suisse","Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions.","Rick Gonzalez","Sure.","Vamil Divan - Credit Suisse","One on the HUMIRA, again I appreciate the color you gave on the quarter. Can you talk a little bit about the payor dynamics there, if there is anything specific in the quarter? We saw some stuff from the (inaudible) around formula decisions, anything that impact in the quarter and also maybe more looking out near to medium term, how do you see that changing?","And then second one just on 199 if I could. Appreciate the comments around the studies that are ongoing. Just wondering, when we might start thinking about you looking at other non-CLL indications and from only potentially moving this product in general. And in an all over the 199 question for you so you are ongoing in non-CLL indications, which seems to make segment from, while this is about potentially moving this about potentially moving this product into those areas. Thanks.","Scott Brun","I will start with the 199 question. Scott Brun, again. So we already have some studies ongoing in non-CLL indications such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma diffuse large B cell lymphoma and certainly you will be seeing some more of those data next year. And we continued to look at other opportunities within hematologic malignancies for things like potentially AML as well as looking at multiple myeloma, plus we are assessing the potential for the Bcl-2 mechanism, do have applicability in solid tumors. So all of that work, some of that is already ongoing and much to be initiated in the not-too-distant future.","Rick Gonzalez","Okay. And this is Rick. I will take the HUMIRA payer dynamics. I think if you look at one of the strengths of HUMIRA, it has been the payors and governments around the world recognized the value of this product. And so I would say, we've been in the fortunate position that we have a very strong position in the standpoint of payors. In fact, in the U.S. managed care environment, the number is around 70% preferred status, meaning they have to go through HUMIRA first as your first anti-TNF. That dynamic hasn\u2019t been changing it all. In fact, if anything I would say is probably improving a little bit over time but we don\u2019t see any negative dynamics occurring in that area if that\u2019s what you were looking at. Thanks.","Scott Brun","Thanks, Vamil.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Arial Herman with Goldman Sachs.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. This is [Ayan] in for Jami Rubin. I just have two pipeline questions. The first on ABT-199, how should we think about the potential to do some additional combo studies with GA101 or something like ibrutinib and then also with Elagolix, can you just help us understand the market dynamics and the potential size for this product? Thank you.","Rick Gonzalez","Right. I\u2019ll go ahead and I will start with 199. So with regard to additional combos, we are working with Roche. As you said first of all, looking at combinations with Rituxan as well as with GA101. With regard to ibrutinib and other new agents on the horizon, we are certainly interested in those types of combinations and we are talking about how best to pursue that with regard to the timing of availability of ibrutinib. Certainly with combinations like 199 in other agents or even a single agents, those are the potential that really changed the way CLL is treated, moving it from something that requires chronic therapy to a situation where you could have a well-tolerated combination that perhaps result in drug free remissions or even functional tumors.","Scott Brun","With regard to Elagolix, the opportunities, so certainly we are in Phase 3 in assessing patients with endometriosis, a very common condition affecting millions of women in the developed world. Certainly, the current treatment options available have limitations with regard to tolerability because of the very dense estrogens suppression, they result in you get menopausal-type symptoms like hot flash and bone loss and with Elagolix\u2019s mechanism you get a more guided or partial suppression sof estrogen, which through Phase 2 studies we've seen reduced impact on symptoms such as hot flash or certainly bone loss. So we think that combination of the efficacy and tolerability profile will provide a very nice option for women when you consider you have the types of surgical alternatives such as hysterectomy which are quite extreme. We\u2019re also in Phase II for uterine fibroids, a condition that can lead to very heavy marked bleeding as well as other symptomatology and again with regard to the type of estrogen suppression we\u2019re seeing, we feel very confident in the ability to markedly impact that rate of bleeding and provide women an alternative to hysterectomy, which again represents the majority of surgical solutions for this condition. ","Scott Brun","Certainly from a commercial perspective, we\u2019ve talked about the endometriosis indication being a potential greater than a $1 billion opportunity and certainly fibroids could be a significant opportunity as well as for us if you\u2019re looking from a modeling perspective. ","Rick Gonzalez","This is Rick. I think the key here and what we\u2019re working towards is, if you get sufficient pain suppression in endometriosis and a strong safety profile where this can be used as a long term and more chronic kind of therapy, it's a very big opportunity and that is why we designed the trial the way we designed it where we have two doses that were running to Phase II to determine which one of those doses best fits that profile long-term.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks all of you.","Operator","","Thank you the next question is from Chris Shad with JP Morgan.","Chris Shad - JP Morgan","","Great, thanks very much, just had a few here. First, coming back on the question about longer term spend. As I think about growth initiative over a next few years and this is pretty more qualitative question, but can you just tell me understand how significant this spend associated with the roll out of HCV is going to be, I guess, my question is how much of this can you leverage existing infrastructure as compared to incremental spend? ","The second question was on HUMIRA, you mentioned higher spending due to some of -- accelerating some promotion programs there, could you elaborate a little more of specifically what those efforts are going to focus on? Is there any particular indication that's more promotion sensitive or you\u2019re seeing opportunities to accelerate share gains. And then the final question is in HCV-1, I know it's early, but can you just elaborate a little bit on the confidence you have and you\u2019d be able to maintain the initial share you\u2019re going to take in this market. ","I think example -- as an example, we look what is like some interesting [Merck]] early stage data in the AASLD abstracts and if we end up with several players with all oral highly efficacious combos. Is that translate to a relatively fragmented market in your opinion or it's the first more advantage here just to significant that it's hard to displace that the initial share you take, thanks very much.","Rick Gonzalez","","Okay, this is Rick. I\u2019ll cover the questions so. If you look at the building out the infrastructures associated with HCV I\u2019d say for the most part it's incremental. There is -- there are certainly areas around the world where we\u2019ll have an opportunity to be able to add some synergies with our existing structures, but I\u2019d say for the bulk of it, you\u2019re going to -- you should be thinking about it as incremental build. And as I said we\u2019re going through our planning process right now, we literally have not finalized again, probably won't finalize it for another month or so, but we\u2019re going to make sure that we\u2019re in a position to be highly effective in that area. ","As you talk about HUMIRA spend, one of the things I\u2019d say to you is, as we approach the beginning of this year one other things that we knew is that we were going to face some new competitive challenges and in anticipation of that, we did some things from an investment standpoint that we thought would put us in a position to be able to defend and still grow our share and I\u2019d say if I look at the results nine or ten months into it, we\u2019re pretty happy with the investment that we made there because it's given us back a pretty healthy return and it's really -- it has allowed us from a competitive standpoint to really deal with new competition in a very effective way. ","As far as HCV is concerned, I think as Scott pointed out, a significant part of this is really built around the performance of the product, We\u2019ve done a lot of market research. And when you look at prescribing preference of physicians, the first five, six attributes are all related to performance of the product, cure rates in different populations. And so as the competitive environment rose out and as we get to our second generation product, I think we will then take another incremental step in this particular disease treatment paradigm there will be difficult to beat. I think it's incredibly difficult to get performance that\u2019s better than this or at least what we anticipate and then it will be all about how you built through infrastructure, how well establish it is, that will make it difficult. You look again at the (inaudible), think out difficult it is for a new competitor break into that market. And it\u2019s because of both the performance of the product and the value that it provide and the established infrastructure that in place that has a lot of experience have been able to drive those products.","And so, I think HCV will play out the same way and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s enough head room left that anybody can truly have a very differentiated product after second generation. So, that\u2019s how we view it.","Larry Peepo","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Marc Goodman with UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS","Yeah. Good morning. First, can you talk about the cystic fibrosis product and what exited about that, what\u2019s the hope there, obviously that\u2019s interesting market. Second, HUMIRA in the emerging markets, just give us a little color there, you had mentioned something about tenders, if you can quote that a little more. And then third, I know you are working on some early stage HUMIRA combos, for like next gen technology, life cycle strategies. Can you update us on where you are there? Thanks.","Rick Gonzalez","Sure. I want to go ahead and start around with the cystic fibrosis Galapagos collaboration. So, I mean, certainly, with regard to the genetic understanding of cystic fibrosis in the mutation that lead dysfunction in the ion channel, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane receptor lead to the symptomatology. We have seen introduction of a therapy like (inaudible) that can have marked impact on patients. But really is only applicable to small minority of patients.","What we are exited about is, can we go ahead and take this even further by addressing patients with the much more common F-fiber weight nutrition. Really looking at combinations of two drugs, a so called the potentiator that helps the malfunctioning channel, ion channel to both proper way, as well as the corrector that helps to affect the defolding in the transport of the receptor to the cell surface.","And so, we feel that Galapagos, it\u2019s got some very, very interesting science and even though there is a timing element here, we won\u2019t be entering clinical trials until late next year.","We are using analogy of Hepatitis C, where certainly we did not begin in the lead but by leveraging certain scientific insights and taking full advantage of the ability to combine different mechanisms to get where we are now. So again I think, that\u2019s really what excites us, the ability to make a remarkable impact on a very devastating disease and to follow on the science that -- that is already out for the minority of patients.","With regard to, we\u2019ll say, HUMIRA next generation, certainly we built a very, very strong foundation with HUMIRA and rheumatology, dermatology and gastroenterology. And the question is what can you do as a leader in these areas to improve upon what the anti-TNF HUMIRA specifically have been able to achieve. And so we are looking at the potential to improve efficacy, power ability, convenience across the whole patient journey within those various diseases.","And we are approaching it strategically with the combination of both internal and external innovations, small molecules and biologics. So for example, we have a selective JAK1 platform. You\u2019re certainly familiar with that, Tofacitinib which non-selective JAK. It\u2019s consequence has limitations in its ability to dose to really get significant efficacy before you start running and decide effects.","With our Galapagos collaboration, we\u2019ve got a selective JAK1 inhibitor in currently dosing in Phase 2b in rheumatoid arthritis as well as Crohn's disease. And we feel that the ability to be able to dose these molecules higher without running in the JAK2-3 related side effects provides the potential for significant improvement in efficacy in these diseases.","We also have our own internal JAK ABT-494 that\u2019s recently entered Phase 2 studies and we think that with these two JAK mechanisms, we have the ability to have a portfolio of compounds that can address multiple disease states in -- again patients who have various stages of treatment experience. Moving on, we\u2019ve got other external collaborations, other mechanisms like our Biotest work in Phase II with anti-CD4 mechanism. We\u2019re very excited about the Ablynx deal that\u2019s an Anti-IL-6R Nanobody. These Nanobodies, because of their size, have the potential for improve that tissue penetration, also the Ablynx Nanobody binds the serum albumin, which is present during information which will help the traffic to the tissues where you want it to go. So again, we think the potential for differentiation (inaudible) currently available IL-6 based therapies. And then certainly, we\u2019re extremely excited about our Dual Variable Domain technology, DVDs which allows us really to buy specifically target two biologic mediators in disease. We\u2019ve got ABT-122, which targets both TNF as well IL-17, which is -- have been shown probably significant role in various auto immune diseases. And so again the idea is, can we improve upon anti-TNFs with this molecule that\u2019s currently in early development in Rheumatoid Arthritis patients, so really a wide portfolio of various approaches to build upon our current strength in auto-immune disease.","Bill Chase","Mark, its Bill Chase. As you acknowledge, we did have some tender activity in the third quarter and that did lift our international HUMIRA results a bit. The way you got to look at that, it does occur from time to time in certain markets. When it occurs, it\u2019s generally about a 2% to 3% lift. That\u2019s certainly what we saw in Q3 and what we\u2019ll try to do and we have been doing is to be transparent, so let you know when that\u2019s occurring to a way, to better understand both the quarter that\u2019s occurring as well as the next.","Larry Peepo","Thanks Mark. Operator, we have time for one more question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today is from Tony Butler with Barclays Capital.","Tony Butler - Barclays Capital","Thanks, very much. Rick, you outlined very nicely on HUMIRA and the various indications, you guys have done a phenomenal job in growing the [x-RA] indications in particular, but I wanted to just focus on RA only. Is that a market that continues to grow in volume or has it ever really reached a negative. Two very small questions for you Scott, one is what\u2019s the strategy around other genotypes, genotype 2, 3 in particular and then lastly is ABT-493, is that boosted or non-boosted. Thanks very much.","Rick Gonzalez","Okay, maybe quickly on the RA market. RA market has penetration rates that is still under 30%, so there\u2019s still clearly an opportunity to grow and we continue to see in most markets around the world that the RA market is continuing to grow. So it\u2019s not growing as fast as some of the other markets like the GI market as an example, but it is continuing to grow.","Scott Brun","Tony, its Scott. With regard to our strategy on other genotypes, we are currently doing work with ABT-450 and ABT-267, which we do have activity beyond genotype 1, in genotypes 2, 3 as well as 4. So we\u2019re currently in Phase II with those genotypes and we\u2019ll continue to move forward, but it\u2019s really our pan-genotypic ABT-493, ABT-530 combination that we think has the most balanced pan-genotypic activity. To your question, neither ABT-493 nor ABT-530 in the next generation requires return of your boosting. From what we\u2019ve seen in ongoing clinical development there, pharmacologic profiles are both conducive to QD, once daily dosing without boosting.","Tony Butler - Barclays Capital","Thanks, very much.","Rick Gonzalez","You\u2019re welcome.","Scott Brun","Thanks, Tony.

Welcome to the AbbVie Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer portion. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to introduce, Ms. Liz Shea, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Liz Shea","Good morning and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Severino, Vice Chairman and President; and Rob Michael, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Joining us for the Q&A portion of the call is Laura Schumacher, Vice Chairman, External Affairs, Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary.","Before we get started, I remind you that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.

These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions.","So, with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick.","Rick Gonzalez","Thank you, Liz. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. I'll discuss our third quarter performance and highlights, as well as our full year guidance which we are raising again this quarter. Mike will then provide an update on recent advancements across the R&D programs and Rob will discuss the quarter in more detail. Following our remarks, we'll take your questions.","AbbVie delivered another outstanding quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $2.33, representing growth of nearly 9% versus last year and exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.04. Total revenue of $8.4 billion was also ahead of our expectations for the quarter driven by continued strong performance in hematological oncology and immunology. ","I\u2019ll start with our hem\/onc business, which delivered operational sales growth of 38.5% in the quarter. IMBRUVICA continues to perform exceptionally well with global revenue of more than $1.2 billion in the quarter an increase of nearly 30% versus last year. IMBRUVICA has a strong position across multiple indications and remains the clear market share leader across all lines of therapy in CLL.","We are especially pleased with the recent inflection in the frontline setting driven by IMBRUVICA\u2019s growing body of clinical evidence, label augmentation and update to treatment guidelines. We are also seeing a substantial contribution from VENCLEXTA with total revenue of more than $200 million in the quarter. VENCLEXTA continues to expand new patient share in the broad Relapsed Refractory CLL segment and we are making very good progress with our recent approvals for frontline CLL and AML. ","Now turning to immunology where we strengthened our leadership position with the introduction of two new best-in-class therapies, SKYRIZI and RINVOQ, creating a broad portfolio of therapies well positioned to further improve patient care. ","We continue to see excellent performance from SKYRIZI, with total revenue of approximately $90 million in the quarter. The launch is going extremely well with prescription trends that continue to remain well above recent launch analogs in the psoriasis category.","Through the first six months on the market, we already have approximately 3,500 prescribing physicians and more than 9,000 patients treated with SKYRIZI including those in our bridge access program. And in this short timeframe, SKYRIZI has already established its position as the leader for in-play psoriasis patient share. This includes both new patients, and switching patients. ","In addition, commercial access for SKYRIZI is now more than 80%, a testament to its best-in-class product profile. We continue to expect SKYRIZI to drive significant growth over our long-range plan. ","In the quarter, we also announced the approval of the upadacitinib, known as RINVOQ in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients who had moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. This approval marks yet another major milestone for AbbVie, the 14th new product for a major indication approval in the last five years and continues to demonstrate our commitment and our leadership in immunology, ","With a strong benefit risk profile demonstrated across the registrational trials, RINVOQ offers meaningful advantages over products on the market today or in development for rheumatoid arthritis. Feedback from prescribing physicians has been very positive and we have a highly experienced immunology commercial organization to support a strong launch trajectory. ","The early trends for RINVOQ are highly encouraging and performance has been tracking ahead of comparable analogs within the RA segment. I\u2019ll highlight a few recent datapoints for you. In the month of October, the second full month was on the market, we estimate more than 1400 prescriptions were filled including both paid prescriptions and those who received RINVOQ in our bridge access program. ","Based on this level of prescription volume, RINVOQ is currently capturing approximately 6% of in-play RA patients. After less than 90 days on the market, RINVOQ\u2019s in-play patient share has surpassed REMICADE and several other established products and is rapidly approaching in the in-play share for Enbrel. ","We are also seeing very low cannibalization of HUMIRA market share thus far. Commercial access is ramping strongly and in line with our expectations. By early January, we expect RINVOQ to have commercial access above 75% and we expect paid prescription volume to increase significantly as this expands over the next several months. ","So while we are still early in the launch, we are certainly pleased by the feedback we received from field from physicians, and the robust demand trends that we are seeing. ","Now turning to HUMIRA. HUMIRA grew 9.5% in the U.S. this quarter driven by continued strong volume growth across all three segments, rheum, derm, and gastro.","International HUMIRA sales were down approximately 32% on an operational basis, reflecting the impact of direct biosimilar competition in Europe and other international markets. The international biosimilar trends and dynamics remain consistent with our expectations.","Based on the continued strong momentum of our business in the quarter and the progress year-to-date, we are once again raising our full year 2019 EPS guidance. We now expect adjusted earnings per share of $8.90 to $8.92 reflecting growth of 12.6% at the midpoint, which remains at the top tier of our peer group. ","I am extremely pleased with the underlying performance of our business. Additionally, with the planned acquisition of Allergan, we will be adding highly valuable on-market assets with leadership positions across additional attractive growth segments including significant new growth platforms in medical aesthetics and CNS. ","The proposed acquisition is proceeding as expected with the recent successful completion of the Allergan shareholder vote who approved the transaction and advancing regulatory reviews around the globe. Integration planning is also well underway and we have made substantial progress. We remain on track for closing in the first quarter of 2020. ","The Allergan transaction has significant strategic merit and the new AbbVie is poised to deliver top tier financial performance. Combined, we will generate significant earnings and cash flow to enhance our innovative R&D platform, support a strong and growing dividend and rapidly pay down debt. ","As noted in our press release today, we are announcing a 10.3% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $1.07 per share to $1.82 per share beginning with the dividend payable in February 2020. Since our inception, we have grown our quarterly dividend by 195%. ","So in summary, we continue to demonstrate strong momentum and I am extremely pleased with our execution across the portfolio including the progress that we are making with the recent new product launches and our pipeline advancement. We have assembled an impressive set of growth assets and the outlook for our business remains strong. ","The Allergan transaction will make us even stronger and more diversified. We remain focused on achieving our long-term strategic vision for the company delivering industry-leading performance and outstanding shareholder value while improving patients\u2019 lives. ","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?","Michael Severino ","Thank you, Rick. We continue to make great progress across all stages of our pipeline with several significant pipeline milestones since our last earnings call, as well as notable data presentations at a number of medical meetings. ","In the immunology, we achieved another major milestone and continued to expand our portfolio with the U.S. approval of RINVOQ and its initial indication of rheumatoid arthritis. We are very pleased with the label, which reflects the strong benefit risk profile demonstrated across our large and comprehensive registrational program.","RINVOQ, which was internally discovered and developed at AbbVie represents an important advancement in the treatment of RA providing physicians with a new, highly differentiated therapeutic option for their patients. The launch is underway in the U.S. and feedback from the medical community has been very positive. ","We also recently received a CHMP positive opinion for RINVOQ with an approval decision in Europe expected in the next few months. In addition, we expect approval in Japan in the first quarter. We are making good progress with the development programs for RINVOQ in other immune mediated conditions as well. ","We recently announced results from the first of our registrational trials in psoriatic arthritis, the SELECT PSA 2 study. In this study, which evaluated RINVOQ compared to placebo in psoriatic arthritis patients, who had an inadequate response to one or more biologic DMARDs, both doses of RINVOQ met all primary and key secondary endpoints.","We are very encouraged by the strong levels of response on both joint and skin endpoints, including ACR responses and PASI measurements, as well as minimal disease activity scores in the heavily pretreated biologic refractory population. We look forward to presenting detailed results at a medical meeting next year. ","We expect to see data from our second registrational trial, SELECT PSA 1 in the first half of next year with our regulatory submissions expected in mid-2020 and commercialization anticipated in 2021. At the ACR Meeting later this month, we will be presenting 26 abstracts for RINVOQ in rheumatic diseases including results from stage two study in ankylosing spondylitis. ","In this study, RINVOQ met a primary and key secondary endpoints demonstrating significantly greater improvements in signs and symptoms, as well as physical function and imaging endpoints compared to placebo. ","We plan to begin a Phase 3 study in Axial Spondyloarthritis in the coming months, an indication expansion that will further strengthen RINVOQ\u2019s position within rheumatology. Both psoriatic arthritis and Axial Spondyloarthritis, our large and important markets in the rheumatology segment and our key areas of focus for AbbVie\u2019s immunology portfolio. ","In the Dermatology segment, we expect to see results from the first of RINVOQ\u2019s registrational trials in atopic dermatitis in the first half of 2020. We continue to make great progress with SKYRIZI, as well. SKYRIZI was approved in its first indication psoriasis in the second quarter and the launch is going extremely well with its differentiated profile and quarterly administration resonating with both physicians and patients. ","One important feature of SKYRIZI\u2019s profile is its strong durability of response. We recently presented long-term data at the EADV Congress showing that after 2.5 years on treatment, SKYRIZI continues to provide high levels of efficacy as demonstrated by 61% of patients achieving PASI 100 or complete skin clearance. ","Similar to RINVOQ, SKYRIZI is being developed in several additional indications. The Gastro segment in particular, represents a significant opportunity for SKYRIZI and the registrational programs in both crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are progressing very well. ","We expect to see data from a Phase 2b study in ulcerative colitis next year and data from the Phase 3 studies in crohn\u2019s disease are expected in 2021. ","Moving now to hematologic oncology, where we continue to make good progress advancing our programs and expanding the breadth of data for IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA. We\u2019ve made significant progress this year with IMBRUVICA in the frontline CLL setting. We received a label update to include data from ILLUMINATE study, which evaluated IMBRUVICA in combination with Gazyva in frontline CLL. ","In addition, the NCCN guidelines were updated to include data from three important studies in our frontline CLL program. We also reported positive Phase 3 data in the watch and wait population and later this year, we plan to submit data for regulatory approval from the Phase 3 ECOG study in young and fit first-line patients. ","An important element of our hem\/onc strategy is our ongoing clinical program evaluating combination use of IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA. ","In the area of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, we expect to see results from the Phase 3 SYMPATICO study next year, a trial evaluating IMBRUVICA in combination with VENCLEXTA in relapsed refractory mantle cell lymphoma. We are also making good progress with the combination program in CLL. We expect to present data from a Phase 2 study in frontline CLL at the upcoming ASH Meeting and additional data from the Phase 3 program are expected in the next 12 to 18 months. ","We continue to advance other programs in our hem\/onc portfolio. We will see data next year from two confirmatory Phase 3 studies evaluating VENCLEXTA in frontline AML. And at the upcoming ASH Meeting, we will be presenting data from several early-stage programs including results from a Phase 2 study evaluating Navitoclax in myelofibrosis where we are seeing very encouraging data in patients who have failed Jakafi.","High risk myelofibrosis is a serious hematologic disease in which bone marrow is replaced by fibrotic tissue interfering with bone marrow function. Current therapies attenuate signaling through the Jak-Stat pathway to address symptoms but are not disease modifying. ","With Navitoclax, we are targeting the mutated clonal cells causing myelofibrosis for apoptosis through the BCL-xL and BcL-2 pathways, a unique approach offering the potential to modify the course of disease reverse fibrosis and restore hematopoiesis. ","Navitoclax may also act to resensitize cells that have developed resistance through Jakafi, thus representing a potentially important treatment option for myelofibrosis patients. Also in the quarter, we submitted our regulator application for Elagolix in uterine fibroids with an approval decision expected in the second quarter of next year. ","And in neuroscience, we recently presented data for ABBV-951 demonstrating its potential as a new treatment option for patients with advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease. ABBV-951 is a subcutaneous delivery system for our Levodopa\/Carbidopa pro drugs, an innovative approach to treating motor fluctuations in Parkinson\u2019s disease with the potential to provide DUOPA-like efficacy with a less invasive non-surgical delivery method. ","If successful, ABBV-951 would represent a transformational improvement to current treatments with the potential to significantly broaden the addressable patient population beyond those treated with DUOPA today. ","The Phase 3 program for ABBV-951 is underway and we look forward to updating you as the program progresses. So, in summary, we have continued to make very good progress advancing and accelerating our programs this year and we look forward to many more important pipeline milestones in the coming months until 2020. ","With that, I will turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our third quarter performance. Rob?","Rob Michael ","Thank you, Mike. We had another quarter of strong performance. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.33, reflecting growth of 8.9% compared to prior year and $0.04 above our guidance midpoint. Net revenues were up 3.5% on an operational basis, excluding a 0.5% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Strong growth from several key products and newly launched assets offset the impact of international biosimilar competition.","U.S. HUMIRA sales were $3.9 billion, up 9.6% compared to prior year with volume growth of 8.6% and a favorable price impact of 1%. Wholesaler inventory levels remained below 0.5 a month in the quarter. International HUMIRA sales were approximately $1 billion, down 32% operationally, reflecting biosimilar competition across Europe and other international markets and in line with our expectations.","SKYRIZI continues to demonstrate strong uptake with sales of $91 million in the first full quarter following the launch in April. As Rick mentioned, we are pleased with the launch and \u2013 RINVOQ. Sales in the partial quarter were $14 million. ","Hematologic oncology global sales were nearly $1.5 billion, up 38.5% on an operational basis, driven by the continued strong growth of both IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA. IMBRUVICA global net revenues were more than $1.2 billion, driven by strong share in all lines of therapy in CLL. ","VENCLEXTA revenues were $221 million driven by continued share gains across all approved indications. ","Global HCV revenues were approximately $700 million, down roughly 19% on an operational basis, driven by lower treated patient volumes in select international markets and increased competition within the U.S. managed Medicaid segment. ","Despite the dynamics impacting performance this year, Mavyret remains the global leader in HCV therapy and we expect it to generate durable cash flow for AbbVie well into the next decade. We also saw continued strong operational sales growth for Creon and Duodopa.","Turning now to the P&L profile for the third quarter, adjusted gross margin was 82% of sales, up 30 basis points compared to the prior year, including a 140 basis point benefit related to the expiration of HUMIRA royalties, partially offset by the impact of partnership accounting. Adjusted R&D investment was 14.5% of sales supporting our pipeline programs on oncology, immunology and other areas.","Adjusted SG&A expense was 19.1% of sales, reflecting continued investment in our on-market products and newly launched assets. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 48.4% of sales, an improvement of 120 basis points versus the prior year. Adjusted net interest expense was $288 million and the adjusted tax rate was 8.8%.","In the quarter, we recorded a net charge of $0.56 per share related to the impairment of intangible assets acquired as part of the Stemcentrx acquisition. The net after-tax impact of this impairment and the related adjustment to contingent consideration liabilities was $823 million. This net charge has been excluded from our adjusted EPS results. ","Based on our continued strong performance year-to-date, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $8.90 to $8.92, reflecting growth of 12.6% at the midpoint. Excluded from this guidance is $3.82 of known intangible amortization and specified items. ","We are also increasing our revenue guidance for the full year and now expect growth of approximately 2.5% on an operational basis. At current rates, we continue to expect foreign exchange to have approximately 1% unfavorable impact on full year reported sales growth.","This forecast comprehends the following updated full year assumptions. We now expect U.S. HUMIRA sales growth of approximately 8.5%. We continue to see a robust volume growth and maintain a strong leadership position across all segments. For international HUMIRA, at current exchange rates, we now expect sales to approach $4.3 billion representing an operational decline of approximately 28%. ","We now expect SKYRIZI global revenues of approximately $275 million reflecting continued launch momentum. For our hem\/onc franchise, we now expect IMBRUVICA global revenues approaching $4.7 billion with U.S. sales growth of approximately 28% and for VENCLEXTA, we now expect sales of approximately $775 million. We are now forecasting global HCV sales approaching $3 billion. ","And on the P&L, we now forecast adjusted gross margin of approximately 82.5% of sales and adjusted operating margin to remain just above 47% of sales. ","Finally, we now expect a non-GAAP tax rate just below our full year rate in 2018. All other full year 2019 guidance assumptions remain unchanged. For the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.17 and $2.19, excluding approximately $0.49 of non-cash amortization and other specified items. ","We anticipate fourth quarter operational sales growth approaching 5%. At current rates, we expect a modest unfavorable foreign exchange impact. ","As Rick mentioned earlier, today we announced a 10.3% increase in our quarterly cash dividend beginning with the dividend payable in February 2020. The significant earnings in cash flows with the combination of AbbVie and Allergan will generate allow us to support a strong and growing dividend and rapidly reduce debt. ","We continue to expect the combined company to achieve a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times by the end of 2021. We are further deleveraging through 2023. ","In closing, AbbVie has once again delivered outstanding performance and with our strong track record, combined with the momentum of our business, we remain well positioned to deliver top-tier financial performance in 2019 and beyond. ","With that, I will turn the call back over to Liz. ","Liz Shea","Thanks, Rob. We'll now open the call for questions. Operator, first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today is from Navin Jacob from UBS. ","Navin Jacob ","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. A couple please. Number one, just want to understand how we should think about the psoriatic arthritis market for RINVOQ relative to RA. Same I guess for SKYRIZI. And on a relative basis, how big those opportunities could be? ","And then four, with regards to IMBRUVICA, there has been some questions around AstraZeneca\u2019s Calquence. They're going to be reporting some updated data at ASH. Wondering how you are thinking about the competitive landscape? ","And then finally, just on the Allergan transaction, do you have an update on or when should we hear an update about the divestment of some of your assets. There is some questions around SKYRIZI versus brazikumab. So any clarity would be helpful. Thank you. ","Rick Gonzalez","Okay. Hi, this is Rick. I think I\u2019ll have Mike walk you through PSA and then, I\u2019ll cover the Calquence question and I am going to have Laura talk a little bit about the status of the regulatory reviews for Allergan\u2019s products. Michael?","Michael Severino","Okay. This is Mike. I\u2019ll take the PSA question. The PSA segment is an important part of the overall other segments. I equate as large as RA but it makes a meaningful contribution, that and spondyloarthritis, axial spa it\u2019s often referred to. ","Those two components provide meaningful revenue in that area and as we announced earlier this week in the psoriatic arthritis study we had at this \u2013 we delivered very strong results which were completely in line with our expectations. ","We had a very strong impact on both joint measures, on the ACR measures, on the skin measures, and on composite measures of minimal disease activity, which look across both joint and skin and show that we are getting a substantial proportion of patients with very high level of control. ","So we think it\u2019s a very, very substantial opportunity for RINVOQ in the long-term. We haven\u2019t put a dollar on that market yet. But we do think it\u2019s going to be a very important contributor to the overall RINVOQ profile. ","SKYRIZI is doing very well and its initial indication of psoriasis. We have a psoriatic arthritis program underway. We think it\u2019s important to show the benefit of SKYRIZI in a psoriatic arthritis setting. That\u2019s not as advanced. ","We don\u2019t have those data readouts yet. But we would expect it to perform well in that setting as well based on Phase 2. So we think between the two we\u2019ll really have a very strong portfolio in that important segment of the market. ","Rick Gonzalez","So, let me talk a little bit about the \u2013 and we got to talk about it maybe a little more broadly, the competitive environment around IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA are in the CLL setting. I think, certainly, as we look at Calquence being a BTK, we would certainly expect that it will have positive data and that we will be frankly surprised if it didn't have positive data in first-line. ","I mean, obviously, IMBRUVICA have very impressive data and a large and comprehensive data and that will certainly play into the competitive dynamics. I think if you think about the competitive dynamics in this field, you need to think about it sort from two perspectives. What does the competition looks like today? And what\u2019s the experience been against that competition? ","And then, what way it looks like going forward for a competitor to be able to compete in this market in an effective way and I am specifically talking CLL now. So, Calquence has been in the market now for, I think about two years. It really has not been able to get a label that has any real differentiation. It has today and it\u2019s a proved indication of MCL second-line plus about 14% share. ","It had between 10% and 14% for quite some time. So, it\u2019s kind of vacillated in that area for quite some time. Its current use in CLL is about 1% despite being on treatment guidelines I think since about 2018, and almost all of that 1% is in third-line plus, which gives you an idea of how physicians view it behind IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA. ","If and when they get approval in first-line, I think it is important to remember or anybody to compete in this marketplace is, how the market operates today. If you look at IMBRUVICA\u2019s share of treated patients and what I mean by that is, patients who are currently under active treatment today. IMBRUVICA\u2019s first-line share of treated patients is 51%. ","So, roughly half of the patients that are under treatment today are utilizing IMBRUVICA. Second-line plus is about 75%. So, three quarters of the patients who are under treatment right now are using IMBRUVICA. IMBRUVICA is treated to progression therapy. I don\u2019t see physicians taking well-maintained patients off of IMBRUVICA and switching them to Calquence or anything else. ","And if we were seeing that, the duration of therapy which is something we track, we\u2019d be going down, but indeed it\u2019s not. It\u2019s stable to slightly increasing. So anyone that comes into this market will have to compete for share and will be limited to compete for share by only competing in the areas where you got new patients or you have failure patients. ","And in the case of new patients or failure patients, they are also going to have to compete against VENCLEXTA in this market. And as you know, VENCLEXTA is recently been approved in first-line. We are about three months post that approval. If you look at VENCLEXTA\u2019s new patient capture share in first-line, it\u2019s 5% already. In second-line, it\u2019s 10% and in third-line, it\u2019s 21%. ","So, I think the reality is, we fundamentally believe and I think many physicians believe that we have the two best assets for being able to treat CLL patients and provide them with long durations of disease-free intervals between VENCLEXTA and IMBRUVICA. So, if Calquence gets a first-line approval in CLL, that certainly gets some share. ","But I would tell you that I feel highly confident in our position in this marketplace based on our performance, and based on the assets that we have. So, Laura? ","Laura Schumacher","Okay. With respect to the regulatory process, the regulatory process overall is proceeding well. We have filed for approval in all major jurisdictions. With respect specifically to the FTC, we received a second request for information at the end of September, which was not unexpected and we are working through those requests with the FTC. ","We\u2019ve also notified them of our intent today about two assets. One brazikumab, which is an IL-23 and the other Zenpep. We have a robust divestiture process ongoing right now with several interested parties. And I think as Rick said earlier, we remain optimistic of a first quarter 2020 closing. ","Liz Shea","Thanks, Navin. Operator, next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. ","Terence Flynn ","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on all the launch progress. Maybe just two from me. I was wondering with respect to ex-U.S. SKYRIZI, looks to be off to a strong start there. Wondering any more color you can give us in terms of where sales are coming from and anything similar or different versus the U.S. launch? ","And then, Rick, how should we think about U.S. HUMIRA pricing next year? Amgen had some comments earlier this week, but we\u2019d be curious to hear your thoughts as well. Thank you. ","Rick Gonzalez","I think on an international SKYRIZI, you have to remember, we really only have reimbursement in a relatively small number of countries today. But that reimbursement process, that pricing reimbursement process is ongoing. ","So you can expect it\u2019s doing extremely well in the markets that it is in. But that\u2019s going to expand significantly over the course of the next 12 months as we get pricing and reimbursement in additional countries. ","I would expect SKYRIZI to perform reasonably consistently with what we are seeing in the U.S. and certainly in the western European markets. So, I think, there is a good opportunity there and we are excited about that opportunity. ","Certainly, as it relates to HUMIRA pricing, we are obviously in the process of going through all of our managed care and I\u2019d say, we are far into that pricing or that contracting process for 2020. I don\u2019t view any significant change in the dynamics around HUMIRA pricing in 2020. It would be significantly different from what we\u2019ve seen in 2019. ","Liz Shea","Thanks, Terrence. Operator, next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Scala from Cowen",". ","Steve Scala ","Thank you. Congratulations on a very well executed quarter. Despite all the investor apprehension, HUMIRA foreign has beaten three quarters in a row. How is that success between regions? Were there are biosimilars and AbbVie is just delivering despite the pressure and regions where patents are still in force? So, that\u2019s the first question. ","And then, second, it seems like the Allergan closing might be earlier than generally thought, the company had been saying Q1, but in the release it says early 2020 which kind of implies January. So, what key steps have been achieved earlier than expected to allow for that earlier closing? Thank you. ","Rick Gonzalez","Yes, so, if you look at \u2013 you are correct, Steve. This is Rick. On OUS HUMIRA, if you go back to our guidance in the fourth quarter of last year, we guided to overall erosion at about 30%. As Rob said in his comments, our forecast now is that that erosion will come in at about 28%. So, slightly lower than what we expect and you\u2019ve seen that in each of the quarters. As you indicated, we\u2019ve overachieved. ","I would say, the bulk of that is slightly better performance in the areas where biosimilars are impacting the market. There is a portion of it, that\u2019s a little better performance in the other market as well. But the majority of it is driven by stabilization of pricing in those markets at a level that came earlier than we would have expected. ","As far as the closing is concerned, I don\u2019t think we were trying to telegraph an earlier date, if that\u2019s how the market interpreted it. We are making good progress on the Allergan closing. Integration activities are going extremely well. We are obviously managing that very tightly. As Laura indicated a few minutes ago, the regulatory processes are advancing. ","But we\u2019d like to stay with the current guidance that we\u2019ve had and that is a first quarter close. Obviously, we\u2019d like to close it as rapidly as we can and we are pursuing that activity to get that done. But at this point, I wouldn\u2019t want to change what the original guidance was. So, that\u2019s how it was interpreted. That was not our intent. ","Steve Scala ","Thank you.","Liz Shea","Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Baum from Citi. ","Andrew Baum ","Thank you. Couple of questions please. First, on Washington, obviously, it\u2019s very dynamic, but the Senate\u2019s Finance Committee proposal probably has more legs than most. Within that, there is a proposal to fund the cap and out-of-pocket spend through funding of the catastrophic coverage periods from both pharma as well as the planned sponsors. ","Thinking about IMBRUVICA, how do you balance the impact of that? I am thinking on the positive side of increased volumes due to compliance adherence versus a negative of both the direct hit to net revenues, but also the indirect hit from payers playing you off against competitors, including Calquence in order to claw back economics. ","The second question is on rheumatic arthritis. So both Novartis and Lilly have failed to show ACR-20 improvements in front-line setting versus HUMIRA given your waiting date to next year for your trial, are you confident that RINVOQ will enable you to do that? ","I know it\u2019s dangerous making cross-trial comparisons in the second-line from what you presented today doesn\u2019t necessary provide significant reassurance. But I am interested in that. ","And then finally, could you comment on the infection rates that you saw with RINVOQ in the 30 milligram of the psoriatic arthritis trial versus placebo? Many thanks. ","Rick Gonzalez","Andrew, this is Rick. I\u2019ll cover the first one and I will have Mike cover the other two. Certainly, as you indicated, the situation is still pretty dynamic. Although, I\u2019d say, it\u2019s a little lighter over the last month or two. They had been across the summer. But I still think there is a lot of interest and a lot of activity that\u2019s still going to continue to look at ways to try to open up access and affordability, particularly in the Medicare population. ","And I think that\u2019s appropriate and I would tell you, we as a company support that. We do believe we need to make medicines more affordable to Part-D patients. The Senate Finance Bill goes in a direction and I think it\u2019s helpful. It takes those out-of-pocket costs down from where they are today on a therapy like IMBRUVICA or even a therapy like HUMIRA as an example. ","It takes them down fairly significantly to an out-of-pocket cost. It\u2019s about $3,000 or $3,100. I would say, we still fundamentally believe that\u2019s too high for most Medicare patients. The average Medicare patient has an income of $2,600. We think it needs to be more in the neighborhood of something below $2,000 and our government affairs people are working to try to articulate that position. ","The other issue with it is, there is still front-end loaded in the year. So from a cash flow standpoint, the patient has to come up with that $3,100 in the first two months, typically the first three months and most of these individuals don't have that kind of cash flow. ","So, coming up with a structure that will allow it to be spread across the full year would be certainly a more reasonable approach to allow those patients\u2019 affordability.","As it relates to the funding in the catastrophic area, certainly, if you look and trying to make these drugs more affordable to patients and have broader access, someone has to pay for that. And certainly, I can't speak for the entire industry. But I can speak for AbbVie. We have said and I testified at the Senate Finance Committee, I said we are willing to step-up and cover more of that cost. ","Healthcare plans have to pay more of the cost and obviously the government needs to pay a piece of that as well. It moves in that direction, although I will say, the way they structured it so far, it is more punitive or more costly to companies that have more innovative therapies and it actually gives a benefit to certain companies who have drugs where the total cost would be below $6,000 per year. ","I don't think that was the intent, I doubt seriously. They were trying to give a benefit to any specific company. So, really looking at where that threshold is and the overall percentage in the catastrophic base is something that would be an important aspect of modification to this bill. But I'd say, it moves in the right direction.","Specifically, the answer your question about volume, we have looked carefully not just to move it up across our entire portfolio. We do believe there will be some volume increase. Net-net, I can tell you the volume isn't enough to offset the overall cost. ","But I think in the grand scheme of where we want to go with this, I think this is a reasonable approach and with some modifications, I think you could have a meaningful impact on the issue and potentially put the debate to rest. So, it's something that with modifications I am supportive of it.","Michael Severino","Thanks. This is Mike. I'll take the question on psoriatic arthritis. One thing that's important to keep in mind is that the study that we just released is in a bio IR population. And in fact, it was in a pretty heavily pre-treated bio IR population where a number of patients had failed two or three prior biologic DMARDs despite that we drove very high levels of response at the ACR-20 level and at higher levels on the joint endpoints. ","And if you look at the placebo subtracted differences, they are entirely in line with our expectations. So, these data would increase our confidence in the overall program and our ability to hit our marks in the second study which includes not only the head-to-head comparison, but also the structural endpoint.","The second thing that I would add is that that second study is a very large and robust study because it has a structural endpoint. So it's very well powered to show the effects that we would expect to see. So we remain confident in the head-to-head and in our overall psoriatic arthritis program.","And then, on the third part of your question with respect to infection rates, in the data that we just released in psoriatic arthritis, we did see numerically higher rates of infections and serious infections in the 30 milligram dose. That's not uncommon in a therapeutic immunomodulator class. ","This is our first study. We are going to have to see how that second study plays out, not only with respect to the safety parameters, but also with respect to the dose response that we see or do not see across doses on the joints and other endpoints and we'll make a determination of the most appropriate dose to carry forward based on that complete dataset as we did in RA.","Liz Shea","Thanks, Andrew. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Geoffrey Porges from SVB Leerink.","Geoff Porges ","Thank you very much and I appreciate the questions. Congratulations on the strong results. Two questions if I may. First, on VENCLEXTA and IMBRUVICA, could you give us a sense of whether you really think significant volume of CLL patients could really be treated with a non-chemo, non-CD 20 regimen? And how are you thinking about the duration of VENCLEXTA in that setting, because it could be potentially transformational?","And then, Rick, could you just talk a little bit about capital allocation? I am sure there is some relief out there that the dividend went up. Now you are getting close to closing the Allergan transaction. Could you talk about how confident you feel about the outlook for the dividend and your ability to continue the long record of dividend increases? Thanks.","Michael Severino","This is Mike. I'll take the first part of your question on VENCLEXTA and IMBRUVICA combination used in CLL. I mean, we do think there is a very meaningful opportunity there. When you look at the CLL population, it's a heterogeneous group and that ranges from patients who develop CLL later in life and have a number of co-morbidities. ","Those patients today tend to receive rich progression therapy with IMBRUVICA. We are seeing that shift very strongly as we've released those IMBRUVICA data. But there are other patients, patients who developed CLL earlier in life, patients who had less co-morbid illness, who are interested in treatment intensification and getting very, very deep responses. ","And for those patients in particular, the VENCLEXTA and IMBRUVICA combination, I think is very compelling based on the data that we've generated to-date. We see very deep responses. We'd expect that to translate into long disease-free intervals and we think it's a therapy that will be an important treatment option.","With respect to the specific duration, that's going to be tailored based on the data to individual settings. But those combination regimens do tend to have fixed duration therapy.","Rick Gonzalez","Okay. Hi, this is Rick. I'll take the capital allocation question. Let me start maybe with more broadly about capital allocation. We have basically three priorities when we look at capital allocation. We want to invest in the business. We want to continue to drive a strong and growing dividend and we want to pay down debt. And those are the priorities for us. ","We have a debt pay down plan that we have put in place that\u2019s consistent with the objectives that Rob indicated in his formal comments and that will be something that we will absolutely drive towards. Now we are fortunate that we are in a business that generates a tremendous amount of cash flow in the combination of Allergan and AbbVie together will generate very, very significant cash flow. ","And so, we have the luxury that we are able to do both. And we certainly would not have increased our dividend double-digit now if we had any concerns about that going forward. So, I can tell you we are committed to a strong and growing dividend and we are committed to paying down debt and we have the ability to be able to do both. ","And I think the dividend increase that we are announcing today is a reflection of our confidence in that cash flow generation.","Geoff Porges ","Thank you.","Liz Shea","Thanks Geoffrey. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research.","Tim Anderson ","Thank you. Going back to Astra's Calquence, if that product is able to show differentiation either on side-by-side analysis to your product or in the head-to-head that reports out next year, where does that come? And what form does that come? Is that likely to be efficacy or on safety? ","And I understand the commercial dynamics still might keep them on the sidelines, but in terms of what the clinical data shows with these next-gen products like Calquence, if it were to be better, where would that be?","And then, a second question on Allergan, obviously the lead asset is Botox. Wondering if you can give us some indication of your view of the product\u2019s durability over an extended period of time and your long-range planning assumptions, send it off competition well in the past. ","There is obviously certain new threats on market now, what is your long range planning assume? Is it continued positive growth through the next decade at about the same rate for example?","Rick Gonzalez","Okay, Mike?","Michael Severino","So this is Mike. I'll take the first part on Calquence. We really wouldn't expect to see differentiation on efficacy or safety, based on our look at the data. We understand the positioning that that some of the follow-on BTK inhibitors have put forward. But when we look at the data, they look like me-toos as Rick has said. ","If you look at like-for-like data in second-line CLL, for example, which is the only indication where they have publicly available Phase 3 data and you line that up against our Phase 3 data. If you look at response measures, they look very, very similar. And that's despite the fact that in the assorted of study they had a median number of prior therapies at one prior therapy and we had a median number of three prior therapies. ","So, a much more heavily treated patient population and yet the same efficacy results. So that's not indicative of likely differentiation in our mind and you wouldn't expect that based on mechanism of action. It's a BTK inhibitor.","And when you look at safety, that story has evolved as well. It started off as no bleeding and no afib because now we see both of those in their label and those events are showing up in their larger scale clinical trials, as well. And if you go back to that same study comparison that I talked about, you see rates that they fit that actually looks pretty similar if you look at corresponding time points. ","So we don't really see differentiation there either. I mean, it's important to keep in mind that labels evolve over time. If you look at how our label has evolved, as we have unblinded multiple large Phase III trials and also accumulated extensive post-marketing experience, things get added to your label and that's the natural course of a product's lifecycle over time. ","If you look at their label today, compared to IMBRUVICA's label at a corresponding time point, they look pretty similar. So, to our eyes, these look like me-toos and we wouldn't expect to see that differentiation.","Rick Gonzalez","Okay. This is Rick. Tim, I'll answer your second question about Botox. And I am getting answer it in the backdrop of the work that we did as it relates to the acquisition, the market research that we did leading up to the acquisition. So we look carefully at Botox and the durability of Botox. It's an important product for Allergan. ","And I would tell you the Allergan organization I think has done an outstanding job with Botox. But if you look at competition, it comes in two forms or potentially it can come in two forms. One, other branded toxins, which is what they've experienced thus far and we expect to see more other branded toxins. ","And I would tell you that what the market research clearly told us is that the brand equity of Botox in the channels that they operate is so strong that it is extremely difficult for those practices to operate without offering Botox, because many patients when they walk in the door, ask for it by name. ","And so because of that, they have a bundling program that has been extremely effective and being able to manage the competitive dynamics around this asset quite well. ","And in fact, I would say as we built our model for the Allergan transaction, we\u2019ve built and we've said this a number of times. We've built a fairly conservative model and we did that across virtually every single product. And so, our model is more conservative than what the Allergan current performance is and it\u2019s certainly more conservative than their longer range forecast. But it still does project growth for Botox going forward.","I would say we've watched the quarterly performance last quarter and Botox despite the fact that there was a lot of speculation. The competition was going to have a big impact, Botox performed very, very well. We'll see their performance here soon. ","But I would expect that Botox will continue to perform very well. And so, I think that organization deserves a lot of credit for the way they have handled the competition and the way they continued to grow this brand quite well.","The second aspect as you have to look at as it relates to Botox is whether or not you are going to see any biosimilars for Botox and we've talked to investors in quite a bit of detail around here. ","But the short answer is, based on the uniqueness of this particular molecule, we have come to the conclusion there would be extremely difficult to create a biosimilar version of Botox and I would tell you, we looked at this very extensively with a lot of outside expertise and we feel very confident that that's the case.","So, that was a long answer to basically say to you, we feel good about Botox. We feel good about our ability to be able to continue to grow Botox both in the aesthetics area, as well as the therapeutic area. And I think all of the data thus far only further supports our confidence.","Tim Anderson ","Thank you.","Liz Shea","Thanks, Tim. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Dave Risinger from Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger ","Thank you very much. So obviously the results were quite impressive. I just had a question on the gross margin. So that was down slightly sequentially to 82.0%. Could you just comment on that? And the outlook for AbbVie's gross margin?","Second, with respect to a comment you made earlier, Rick, you said that RINVOQ is capturing 6% of in-play RA patients. I was wondering if you have the SKYRIZI in-play psoriasis patient percentage as well. ","And then finally, with respect to IMBRUVICA, there was a recent Blood article on the product's link with hypertension. Could you just comment on that? And talk a little bit about how you are managing that? Thank you.","Rob Michael","David. So this is Rob. I'll take your first question. So if you look at our year-to-date gross margin profile, we are at 82.7%. I have given guidance of approximately 82.5% for the year. The key thing to keep in mind within a particular quarter, you will have sales mix and it can be more pronounced and more pronounced impact on gross margin profile. ","In Q3, we saw stronger sales from partnered products like IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA, as well as the seasonal impact of Synagis. But keep in mind that we also share expenses with our partners for IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA. So that gross margin impact was offset in our expense profile. So as a result, you can see that we've exceeded our guidance on the operating margin profile this quarter. ","We just achieved an all-time high at 48.4%. So it's really important when you think about those partnered products to be really focused on operating margin, as opposed to just gross margin.","Rick Gonzalez","And then David, this is Rick. On SKYRIZI, the in-place psoriasis share for SKYRIZI is over 20%, right now and growing pretty rapidly.","Michael Severino","And this is Mike. I'll take the IMBRUVICA question regarding hypertension. So hypertension has been seen with clinical uses in IMBRUVICA and other BTK inhibitors and obviously, we believe that it's important to pay close attention to patient safety and then it needs to be managed effectively. And we think it is managed very effectively both in clinical practice and in our clinical trial programs. ","If you look at the overall benefit risk profile, it\u2019s very strong. We have released data from a number of Phase 3 studies across a wide range of settings and that benefit risk profile comes, I think very clearly in all of our data. So we are very confident in the overall profile of the molecule and we are managing hypertension I think quite effectively.","David Risinger ","Great, thank you.","Liz Shea","Thanks, David. Operator, we have time for one final question.","Operator","And I am showing no further questions at this time.","Liz Shea","Okay, thanks a lot. That concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time."]}}
